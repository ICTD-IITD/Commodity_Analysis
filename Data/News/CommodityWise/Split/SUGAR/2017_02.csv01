It noted that in 2013, sugarcane was grown across 9.5 lakh hectares, while in 2016, it was grown across just three lakh hectares in the State.If the government failed to encourage cane growers by giving them interest free loans and through scientific pricing, they would stop cultivating the crop and sugar factories may have to be shut, it stated.Kuruburu Shanthkumar, president of the association, told reporters here on Monday that even the number of farmers cultivating sugarcane had reduced considerably in the State. He said that cane growers were discouraged by the failure of the government to get them remunerative prices. The government would get a tax of Rs. 3,000 per tonne sugarcane and the sudden fall in production had resulted in heavy losses to the State exchequer, he said.The FRP (Fair and Remunerative price) which was fixed at Rs. 2,200 per tonne in 2014-15 has not been enhanced for three years though prices of sugar had touched Rs. 50 per kg, Mr. Shanthkumar said adding that farmers were incurring couple of hundred rupees losses for each tonne of cane that they had grown instead of earning the same in profits.The association has urged the Union government to implement the recommendation of the M.S. Swaminathan committee forthwith. He urged the State government to give crop loss compensation of Rs. 25, 000 per acre to farmers who have incurred crop loss owing to drought in the State in the past two years.Mr. Shanthkumar also urged the government to waive off all farm loans to prevent farmers resorting to drastic measures. He said that it was high time the government realised that the farmers were made to incur losses in the absence of a system to get remunerative prices for agriculture produce."

While Srivastava is from West Champaran and Raj is from Bolia. The families of both have been contacted and they are expected to arrive by Saturday morning.Neither of them reportedly knew how to swim. Police said that a third student  Amit Kumar Jha  had also fallen in the pond, but managed to swim to the bank.According to police sources, the pond where the students drowned is located behind the boys' hostel. ""According to what the survivor has told us, the three had decided to go to the garden behind their hostel around 4pm. They were busy searching for mangoes when they came close to the pond. The trio then decided to try some fishing. It was around 4.45pm when one of them slipped in the moss and fell in. His two friends tried to save him but they too fell into the water. Unfortunately, the place where they fell was the deepest  around 20ft. By the time the third friend swam back and sought help, the duo had drowned,"" said an officer. The pond where the accident took place is used for training, with two outlets for hot and cold water.Police sources said that the victims had been taken to two separate hospitals. While Srivastava was rushed to the Port Trust Hospital, Animesh was rushed to the CMRI Hospital. Both were declared dead on arrival. The police then sent the bodies to Kantapukur morgue where the postmortem is likely to be carried out on Saturday in the presence of their family members. Srivastava's father Prasad, who owns Harinagar Sugar Mill, has already boarded the train to Kolkata with his brother, said sources.The second-year students are being counselled after the incident, said police sources.Located less than a kilometre from Taratala crossing, the institute was established at the onset of Independence in 1949 to satisfy the growing need for marine engineers in India. The institution, earlier called the Directorate of Marine Engineering Training, had its headquarters in Kolkata and a branch in Mumbai under the ministry of shipping. It was renamed in 1994."

In order to balance the power supply across the district, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has started two hours load shedding of agricultural consumers on Thursday.The Kolhapur zone of MSEDCL comprises of Kolhapur and Sangli district. The sugarcane farmers there require continuous power to irrigate cane. These farmers will now have to face load shedding of two hours during the night time starting from May 5.Chief Engineer of Kolhapur zone M G Shinde said, ""The technical issue is temporary. Therefore, we are left with no option except cutting power supply for agricultural consumers. We have decided to cut their power supply during the night. Normally, the slot starts from 10pm to 8am. The load shedding will continue for the next few more days.""Kolhapur president of state irrigation federation and organisation of farmers Vikram Patil said, ""Farmers are soft targets of the government.

Purnachandra Rao on Saturday raided an unauthorised food unit only to find that the raw materials not suitable for human consumption are being widely used to make sweets like sunnundalu, soan papidi and others. Two tonnes of spoilt black gram which could only be eaten by animals was found at the unit.However, it is not the only such unit it in the city and officials have so far identified at least 20 other unauthorised snack-making units, 15 unauthorised ice cream units and about 50 shops that sell the food items sold by these units. Most of these shops are located near schools. Unauthorised food units thrive in the summer season and their focus will be on snacks and ice creams which will be bought like hotcakes in the rural and slum areas by kids enjoying summer holidays. But consuming such food from unauthorised vendors may cause them health issues, Mr. Rao told The Hindu .Kids at riskChildren who eat the unhygienic food are most likely to suffer diarrhoea which may take a toll on the health as summer hot weather adds to the situation. Fast food prepared on the roadsides is also dangerous for kids as well as elders, officials say.He said that excess levels of prohibited food colour is being used in a wide range of sweets, biscuits and ice creams. They also use water drawn from unhygienic sources, reused oil and other raw material to minimise making cost, Mr. Rao added, advising parents not to allow their wards to buy food from roadside shops. An ice cream bar is just made of water, food colour, saccharine and sugar. These snacks are mostly sold at kirana shops, pan shops in the slums of urban areas and main centres in rural areas."

In larger quantities, they outright kill people and may cause cancer. However, an intriguing study conducted in Tamil Nadu suggests that even in trace doses, insecticides could cause diabetes particularly among agricultural workers who intimately work with them.According to the team of scientists from Madurai Kamaraj University, this happens because the colony of bacteria that populate our gut  or gut microbiota as they are called  chemically break down the insecticide into short chain fatty acids like acetic acid, increase glucose production in cells, and eventually lead to glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes.In probiotics industryThe body is estimated to have about 35 trillion cells and  because theres still considerably uncertainty  about two to three times as many microbial cells distributed all over and inside the body. The greatest diversity is believed to be within the gastrointestinal tract, home to around 3,000-4,000 species of bacteria, not including viruses and other life forms. Some are harmful and many of them indifferent.Knowledge that the balance of microbes in the gut can thwart infection already underlies the global probiotics (or beneficial gut bacteria) industry. Mother Dairy, Amul, Danone Yakult and Nestle India are among the leading producers of probiotic functional foods and beverages in India with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, being among the most popular species employed in developing a range of products such as yoghurt, curd and several dietary supplements.But now, beyond being a palliative for the stomach upset and reservoir of instinct, piling evidence shows that there is a distinct pattern of microbes  healthy and harmful  found in the gut when stricken by atherosclerosis, obesity, intestinal and even psychological disorders. This could help design new drugs and treatment regimes to tackle complex disorders.A 2014 report in the journal Nature quoted a trial by Joseph Murray, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, U.S., where the gut bacterium Prevotella histicola was fed to transgenic mice engineered to have human-like immune systems to suppress the inflammation caused by multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Vedanta Biosciences in Boston, Massachusetts, now acquired by Pfizer Inc, is conducting preclinical trials of a pill containing microbes that suppress gut inflammationNeed for an Indian projectThe lead editorial in the latest issue of Indias top science journal, Current Science , warns that if Indian science doesnt wake up, it could be lose out in the revving, global race to understand the mysteries of the gut. Several countries have begun projects such as the Australian Gut Project, American Gut Project, British Gut Project, Initiative in Skin and Oral Microbiome (iMicroCare, China), Canadian Microbiome Initiative, Human MetaGenome Consortium Japan (HMGJ), EU-funded MyNewGut Project, and International Human Microbiome Consortium (IHMC, 12 countries), note Yogesh Shouche and Shekhar Mande at the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, There is sufficient evidence to suggest that genetic as well as microbial composition of the Indian population is distinct a project of such dimensions requires multi-disciplinary expertise and strong financial support.The paucity of gut flora-related research in India marks the Tamil Nadu study as among the few India-centric studies to hint at the guts microbial diversity and a possible role in diabetes, that afflicts at least 70 million Indians, according to a 2015 report by the International Diabetes Federation.Studys findingsThe study, published in this weeks issue of the peer-reviewed Genome Biology , and which surveyed 3,080 people in Vadapalanji panchayat of Madurai district, argues that diabetes in people regularly exposed (defined as those involved in spraying or mixing these chemicals) to organo-phosphatic (OP) insecticides, a mainstay of Indian agriculture, was threefold higher (18.3%) than in unexposed people (6.2%), even when traditional risk factors like obesity, hypercholesterolemia and physical inactivity in this population were low.Typically, OP targets the nervous and muscular systems and causes convulsion, respiratory failure and death of insects and mammals. However, when small doses of the insecticide were given to mice, the researchers found no significant changes in levels of acetylcholinesterase in their blood.Raising the levels of OP insecticide administered to the mice and delivering the equivalent of 12-15 years of human life exhibited a slow and steady increase in blood glucose levels in the mice and significantly elevated blood sugar levels after 180 days, as well as impaired glucose intolerance compared to controls.To test the role of gut flora, the researchers then transplanted faecal matter from the OP-fed mice into the guts of regular mice that then, according to the researchers, exhibited significant glucose intolerance. Further tests on fasting blood and faecal samples from the human study population suggested similar links between OP degradation and hyperglycemia in humans, lead author of the study, Dr. G. Velmurugan, now at the University of Florida, Gainsville, U.S., said in a statement accompanying the research paper, the effects of chronic exposure to OP pesticides on the gut microbiome may be a risk factor for diabetes the use of OP pesticides should be reconsidered.jacob.koshy@thehindu.co.inEvidence of a distinct pattern of microbes in the gut during illnesses could help design new drugs and treatment regimes"

These transactions took place during 2010 and 2011.Taking note of certain observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) regarding the sale in an audit report for the 2010-11 period, the Commission suo-motu began looking into the matter to ascertain, whether there have been any bid-rigging.The latest ruling of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has come more than four years after it ordered a detailed probe into the matter. The investigation was ordered in 2013.In an audit report, the CAG had observed that in the bidding by firms for the sugar mills of UPSSCL and UPRCGVNL (Uttar Pradesh Rajya Chini Evam Ganna Vikas Nigam Ltd), there was lack of competitive process and the bidders were engaged in the bid-rigging activities.Such activities violate provisions in the Competition Act.While ten operational mills of UPSSCL were sold during 2010, eleven closed mills of UPRCGVNL were sold in 2011.Wave Industries, PBS Foods, Indian Potash, Nilgiri Food Product, Trikal Food and Agro, Giriasho Company, Namrata Marketing and SR Buildcon had participated in the bidding.CCI said that given the tender conditions and the methodology adopted for inviting bids for the sale of sugar mills, it was open for any bidder who satisfied the eligibility criteria.The Director General (DG) has found no evidence of collusion or coercion which prevented the potential bidders from participating, it said in an order dated May 4.Cases where the regulator finds prima-facie evidence of competition norms violations are referred to its investigation arm DG for detailed probes.On the basis of facts and evidence in the case, no conclusion of contravention of the Competition Act can be drawn against the participating bidders in the sale of ten operational mills of UPSSCL, according to CCI.""The fact that there is no evidence of collusion or coercion to show that several potential bidders were prevented from participating in the bidding process for the sale of closed mills rules out possibility of premeditation of outcome by the participating bidders and hence collusion by them,"" CCI said with respect to eleven closed mills of UPRCGVNL.The bidders had raised issues relating to applicability of Section 3 on the sale of sugar mills, thereby, challenging the jurisdiction of the CCI in the case.The regulator opined that in absence of a finding of collusion/bid rigging in the case, there remains ""no immediate requirement"" to deal with the jurisdiction issue.However, in a supplementary note, CCI member Augustine Peter said the regulator has jurisdiction to entertain the case.

The experts have recommended a balanced diet in which 60-70% of total calories come from carbohydrate, 10-12% from protein, and the remaining 20-30% from fat. On fats, the recommendation is to have it in its unsaturated form, with avocados, nuts, and canola and olive oils.The food regulator constituted the panel following the Delhi High Court, hearing two cases, asking the FSSAI to suggest nutritious, healthy and wholesome food for school children.FSSAI had referred its draft guidelines to experts for their opinion. Inadequate studies on Indian food habits, the experts felt, pose a hurdle to framing region-specific guidelines for children and adults.But the 58 observational studies conducted so far indicate that an adult in India consumes higher-than-ideal quantities of fat, salt and sugar.Imposing additional tax on the purchase of commodities such as pre-packaged foods with high salt and fat content and sugar-sweetened beverages can be a pragmatic approach to reduce their intake, the panel said in its report."

BMC may lose Rs 6,000 to 7,000 crore because of octroi getting off the new system, however, the government has decided to compensate the local bodies and protect their independent sources of revenue.During a special session in August 2016, the Maharashtra legislature had ratified the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill. On 6 April, the Parliament passed four GST bills which now have to be cleared by all states.In the 288-member Maharashtra legislative assembly, the BJP has 122 members while Shiv Sena 63.

He further said ""thief"" is demanding to hand over all the evidences to him.""Then he would prove himself innocent by becoming a judge, a lawyer and a witness,"" he added. In the morning, Jha, who is an MLA from Burari, went to Rajghat, Mahatma Gandhi's memorial, to ""seek blessings"". ""On May 7, Kapil Mishra had said that Arvind Kejriwal had met Satyendar Jain where he paid him Rs 2 crore. My question to him is at what time did he meet the chief minister. Which car did he use? I have the entire day's video footage (of people entering Kejriwal).""The whole world knows about Kejriwal's credentials and he (Mishra) should give evidence to back his claim. If it turns out to be true, even I will join him in his hunger strike against Kejriwal,"" Jha said. Mishra hit back at Jha with another ""open letter"" and ""advised"" him to drink lots of water during the hunger strike."

The GST Council finalised the rates for about 1,200 items on Thursday. The rate for services will be decided on Friday.On the first day of its two-day session in Srinagar, the council decided that a fifth of all goods sold in India would be taxed below 18%, making most goods cheaper under the GST regime. A few items, however, will cost more.Talking to reporters after the meeting, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, Tax rates for many items have been reduced. With a better system in place, compliance will improve, he declared. Jaitley is confident rates for all goods and services would be finalised by Friday. If that doesnt happen, the session will be extended by a day, he said.Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said only 19% of goods on the list would be taxed at 18%, while 81% of goods would be taxed lower. He said sugar, tea, non-instant coffee, edible oil and coal would be under the 5% category, while toothpaste, hair oil and soaps would be taxed at 18%.The current tax on toothpaste and soaps is close to 28%.

The council had earlier decided a five-slab structure of 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.Most luxury goods and sin items were expected to fall in the highest 28% bracket. It was assumed small cars would have a lower tax rate than 28%, but state finance ministers who attended the meeting on Thursday said the item hadnt come up for discussion.The council approved seven GST rules required for its rollout. The remaining two, related to transition and return, are being vetted by the legal committee, Jaitley said. Jaitley assured Jammu and Kashmir that the Centre would respect its special status while rolling out GST."

5922f5197be9e01fc0070852,Fine dining and a sea view,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/fine-dining-and-a-sea-view/article17350977.ece,2017-02-23,"Worlis Atria Mall seems to be slowly emerging out of hibernation. The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel. Self-taught baker and dessert chef Tanvi Kirawant, or as she likes to call herself the Nagpur tigress, tells it takes her 50 steps to make the dessert. We manage to polish it off in five, quick bites.Swey at Atria, Worli, is open from 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.; 9820436666"

The doctors had also advised that he be hospitalised, but Mishra carried on with his hunger strike.The doctors said that the mild dehydration suffered by Mishra was because of no salt intake for the last few days, and described the condition as ""starvation ketosis"".Mishra started his hunger strike on May 10, with the demand that his party release details of foreign tours undertaken by five leaders.He has also levelled allegations of corruption against several party leaders, including the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and PWD Minister Satyendra Jain."

The state government is, however, considering giving insurance cover to crops against fire under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY). The matter is expected to come up for discussion in the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday.According to the government's own data, wheat crop has been destroyed due to fire on around 2,800 acres across the state in this season. The PMFBY implemented in Haryana last year offers cover against natural calamities, including lightning.""Once the PMFBY has been implemented by the state, there is no question of compensation by the government to the farmers,"" said Haryana's food and civil supplies minister Karan Dev Kamboj Admitting that during his visit to grain markets in around 12 districts in the last four days, a number of farmers had raised the compensation issue with him, Kamboj said, ""On Tuesday we have a meeting of cabinet ministers and the issue of including the crop loss due to fire under the PMFBY shall also be taken up.""Asked as to what measures have been taken by the government to save the wheat crop from electric fire destruction, Kamboj replied, ""We are not providing agriculture power supply during day time, especially these days."" The minister said that sparks in overhead power lines passing over fields cannot be considered the only reason for crops catching fire, since many a times, farmers leave back lighted bidis or matchsticks near fields.To overcome the problem of produce often getting spoiled, Kamboj told that the state government was going to set up six modern grain storage silos of six lakh metric tonnes of capacity in public-private partnership (PPP) for which the tenders would be released in May. ""Such things are best maintained in PPP mode as various sugar mills and rice mills being run by the government had earlier suffered losses,"" the minister said.The Food Corporation of India (FCI) had given a green signal to the state for setting up of silos with a total capacity of 9.50 lakh tonnes capacity. Out of this, FCI would be constructing silos with capacity of 3.50 lakh tonnes. Silos with modern technology, including temperature control, moisture check and elevators to pick the stock, would be established railway lines in the areas where there is shortage of storage facility."

They also said that the civil terminal of Gorakhpur airport and Agra airport would be named after Guru Gorakshnath and Deen Dayal Upadhayaya respectively. Besides, it was also decided to rename Viklang Jan Vikas department as Divyang Jan Vikas department, Sharma said.Speaking to media persons after the meeting that lasted less than an hour as compared to the two earlier meetings which continued for over two hours, Sharma said that the government during the past one month in office, the government had proved that it was dedicated to the welfare of farmers. He said that with the decision to implement Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna, the farmers would get the complete benefit of the scheme.Sugarcane was dropped from the scheme as it was a cash crop. It was included in the scheme by Akhilesh-led UP government and was objected to by the Centre. Elaborating on the scheme, Sharma said that the state would be divided into 12 clusters. One insurance company would not be allowed to get more than two clusters.Detailing on the agriculture scientific centres, Singh said as of now the state had 69 such centres. However, a decision has been taken to open 12 more centres. Similarly, cabinet also decided that instead of two districts, four districts would be selected for organic farming of banana and chilli.The cabinet also decided to make the film on the life of Vijaya Raje Scindia and titled 'Ek Rani Thi Aisi Bhi' tax-free, Singh further said."

When one field is cleared, sugar cane in the nearby farm will be ready for harvest. The sugar cane fields over nearly 700 hectares is an attraction for visitors to Marayur.But it is a double whammy for sugar cane farmers this year, with the scorching sun and scanty monsoon leading to stunted growth. They say the early drought will take a toll on jaggery production.There are many fields affected by drought with the groundwater table at a low and water scarce for irrigation.Normally, 10 months are enough for harvesting sugar cane. Even after 11 months, the crop is stunted due to absence of water, said P.G. Sojan, a farmer.Jaggery production hitNormally, drought sets in by March-end and jaggery production will be at a low. Now, the fields ready for harvest are facing the situation. Low atmospheric temperature and rain can have a positive impact on jaggery production. The sugar cane harvested now are not only deficient in juice but also pencil-thin, he said.Lack of irrigation facility is a major concern for the farmers. Even tender crop is hit, with the main rivers the Pampar, Kanniyar, and the Therthamala drying up.On the side other side, the prices of jaggery are at a low with a 62-kg sack fetching Rs. 3,000. Considering the high labour cost and low productivity, it is an unviable endeavour for farmers.Akbar Ali, president of the Anjunadu Karimpu Ulpadaka Samithy, said there was a 45 per cent drop in northeast rainfall at Marayur.Being a rain-shadow area, Marayur and Kanthallur were dependent on northeast monsoon.He said an acre under favourable conditions could yield 4 tonne of jaggery. However, production had come down to to 2.5 to 3 tonne this season, he added.Without irrigation facilities, it would be difficult for the farmers to retain interest in sugar cane cultivation and area under the crop would come down considerably, he added.Check-dam workThe work on constructing a check-dam at Chattamunnar to irrigate sugar cane had been dragging on for various issues, he said, adding that once the farmers shifted to other crops, it would be difficult to prompt them back to sugar cane farming."

The iffy thing was, they said, they hadn't made any purchases or even visited their local ration shops for a long time.Kovilambakkam resident D Govardan said he received an SMS from the ration shop in the neighbourhood informing him that he'd purchased 2kg of sugar, 20kg of boiled rice and 1kg of tur dal.""I haven't been to the ration shop in months,"" he said. ""When I questioned the shopkeepers, they casually told me that it was routine practice for them to identify 'idle' PDS cards - whose holders have not used them for long periods of time - and make large purchases in the name of the card-holders.""""The staff sell the subsidised goods to retail outlets and make big profits,"" Govardan said, visibly vexed at the scam. ""Now I will not be able to make any purchases myself because they've used my PDS quota for everything from rice and dal to palm oil and kerosene shops."" He said it is blatant looting of people most of whom, because they are economically underprivileged, need subsidies on essential commodities.In Thiruvanmiyur, Rajesh Chandran received an SMS from his Besant Nagar PDS shop stating that he had purchased a packet of palm oil for `25 when he did not even go to the outlet.Chandran said he was very surprised when he first got these messages, but soon figured out that the shopkeepers were up to no good.An employee of a PDS shop in Kodambakkam, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted that he and his fellow-workers were also part of the racket and sold essential commodities from PDS shops to small restaurants and eateries for a good profit.Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation officials said they have received complaints about such cases and are making efforts to sort out the issue and put an end to the racket."

The association said the sugar industry faces a revenue crunch when prices fall.The UPSMA also demanded de-reservation of molasses produced by the sugar industries and given to the liquor sector.

Photo: R. RavindranThe neighbourhood tea shops appear to be learning a lesson or two from the success of upscale coffee chains in the city. In the last six months, as many as three start-ups selling premium varieties of tea have begun dotting Chennais landscape.The startups  Chai King, Tea2go and Chai Kings  are offering high quality tea at affordable prices. Sensing huge opportunity, the trio are also on an expansion mode. Ball park estimates indicate that in Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), the IT corridor of Chennai, on an average 4 lakh cups of tea is sold per day, of which 60 per cent sales happen in the evening and midnight.Currently, the market is unorganised and there is tremendous potential, said Suresh Radhakrishnan, founder of Chai King which commenced operations in August 2016. We prepare freshly brewed authentic tea sourced from Nilgiris and door deliver to corporates. We operate on a QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) model and we are the first mover in this space in Chennai. We also take advice from tea tasters and experts, he said. Chai King sells 700-900 cups per day from its outlet in Virugambakkam. The venture started off with a self funded capital of Rs. 8 lakh and its second outlet will be operational soon.After studying the Chennai market for more than eight months, Jahabar Sadique, co-founder of Chai Kings forayed into this space in October 2016. He said, When we did a preliminary analysis we found that if an outlet sold 1,200 cups of hot beverages 1,000 cups are only tea. We wanted the city to have hygienic tea at the same time at affordable price, Sadique said. According to him, Chai Kings uses sulphur free sugar, no emission electric bikes for delivery and six-stage filtered water used for chai preparation. The start-up which was started with initial investment of Rs. 85 lakh sells 800-1,000 cups of tea per day and is also looking to scale up to four more outlets from its existing three.The latest entrant in this space is Tea2go, a mobile tea vendor business started in January. Not many like to have tea from a vendor selling tea on cycles as they are skeptical about hygiene. We prepare tea at a centralised location and give it to vendors who work for us. Our cycle is designed in a way where even the cups have separate cabins to rest and are not exposed to dust. Our vendors wear a hair cap while at work, said its founder Sivaraj Muthuraman. Tea2go has 10 cycles each selling 250-300 cups of tea per day at various locations.The night shift marketNow the focus is on the night shift market, which is huge. The OMR belt will be our focus, said Sivaraj who has pumped in Rs. 3 lakh into this venture. According to analysts who track the hot beverages market in Chennai, the Ambattur belt sells more than 4 lakh cups of tea per day, T. Nagar sells more than 5 lakh cups of tea per day. Employees working in the IT sector and construction workers are the major consumers. One of the employees at a tea shop neighbouring the Olympia Techno Park, Guindy, said, We sell around 4,000 cups of tea per day.Estimates indicate that in OMR alone,an average of four lakh cups of teaare sold per day"

They are also making more non-carbonated drinks as well as reformulating drinks to lower sugar levels and launch sugar-free versions.These measures come amid a wave of sugar tax approvals in the United States and Europe.The consumption of added sugar in foods and beverages has been linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Despite the increase in prices of essential commodities, the monthly grocery bill of the rural cops have come down by at least 30 per cent.Reason: A memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has enabled the rural police department to procure stock for its central police canteen at its headquarters in Chhani for a much lesser price than the market rates from the CRPF canteen in Gandhinagar After the tie-up, policemen have been able to buy products from the canteen at prices that are up to 30 per cent less than the market rates. The canteen, which is only for cops of rural police, currently has more than 200 items. Apart from grocery items, the canteen also sells electronic items like mixer grinder, iron, fan among others, helmets, different kind of bags and garments.Mulji Mahyavanshi, a store keeper, said that some items like sugar and edible oil are not sold by CRPF canteen therefore they are procuring these items from wholesalers in grain market at Hathikhana at much lower rates. He added that most of the business is done by 10th of every month when cops get their salaries. A senior police official said that till date around 1,200 cops have benefited from it. A group on WhatsApp has also been made to inform the policemen and their family members when new stock arrives at the canteen. A constable at the police headquarters told TOI: ""We have benefited a lot with this. Earlier we had to go to shops and big stores for buying our monthly groceries but with the canteen in our premises, we do not have to go out and also get products at low rates.""""Most districts in state do not have such facilities. Some have shops but those are under credit societies. But running a central police canteen is far more beneficial as the products here are available at same price available to paramilitary forces,"" said Saurabh Tolumbia , superintendent of police, Vadodara (rural).""Apart from saving money, there is also a sense of belonging among the policemen for the canteen and the new constables who are recently inducted are most happy as their salaries are low in the initial years,"" he added. Since many police stations are far away, the rural police is planning a monthly parade at headquarters for cops posted at these police stations so that they can buy products from the canteen."

While a notification to this effect would be released shortly, the move has been welcomed by educators and healthcare professionals.There are an estimated two lakh people with Type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes, in the country, of which about half would be children, said V. Mohan, chairman, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre.Children with Type 1 diabetes take about three to four injections of insulin per day  and taking one injection half an hour before breakfast, and a mid-morning snack is very important to prevent low-sugar reactions. Low sugar could cause sweating, trembling, confusion, giddiness and in extreme cases, even coma. This could lead to huge difficulties while writing exams, he said. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition in which there is total insulin deficiency  the pancreas produce little or no insulin.According to the International Diabetes Federations Atlas 2015, India has the second-highest number of children with diabetes in the world. The Atlas estimated the country had 70,200 children in the 0 - 14 age group. In Chennai, in the ICMR Registry of People with Diabetes with Young Age at Onset there are 1,660 young people (less than 25 years) with type 1 diabetes, Dr. Mohan said. This is a fantastic decision and should be extended to all Boards and colleges as well, he said.The CBSE already has in place several measures for students with disabilities. While students who have learning disabilities, including dyslexia, are given exemption from subjects such as Language and Mathematics, while students who are visually-impaired are given a separate question paper and are allowed scribes.The evaluation process, too, is tweaked for these students. The parent of a 10-year-old girl in Class V at a city CBSE school said this was a welcome decision.If she misses having her snack, her sugar becomes low. Mostly, she manages by herself, but we constantly have to tell teachers about her condition and ask for a little time. With this move, she will be able to eat properly and study better too, said the resident of Kolathur.Students are usually registered for the Class XII board examinations when they are in Class XI by CBSE schools in the city.We mention in the list if the student is a slow learner or has a physical disability and when this allowance for diabetic students comes into place, this will be included in the list as well so that the board can make arrangements for the break they are eligible for at their examination centres, said a principal from a city school.Low sugar could lead to huge difficulties while writing examsV.

The petitioners alleged that none of the officials visited their households or locality during the survey to assess whether they should be classified as priority households (PHH) or NPHH. They said that of the 300-odd households in the village, 200 had been classified as NPHH.The survey, intended to be an elaborate door-to-door verification exercise to identify PHH, was carried out across Tamil Nadu by Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection department as part of the implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the State.State government had maintained that though the exercise was carried out as per the mandatory guidelines of the Act, there will be no reduction in supply of rice and other items being given. However, according to the villagers, the employees at the ration shops informed them that their rice and other supplies would be reduced henceforth. Some of us were given less amount of rice and sugar even this month, said V. Vetrivel, a resident of the village. S. Selvi, another resident, said that even some elderly people living alone or with their spouses without any source of income had been classified as NPHH. My husband works as a construction labourer. Apart from a small house, we do not have any property. Our family is also now an NPHH, she said. CSCP department had given elaborate guidelines for identifying a household as NPHH, which included households with annual family income of more than Rs. one lakh, at least one income tax payer in the family, owning an air-conditioner or four-wheeler and farmers with more than five acres of land.S. Mayandi, Madurai district executive member of Communist Party of India (Marxist), who accompanied the petitioners, said that none of the households would come under NPHH category if the survey criteria were properly followed. He said the officials had assured to carry out a review and correct the classification, if found wrong."

The increase in the NDPS cases by 119% and COTPA cases by 603% compared to the 2015-16 period shows the alarming use of the NDPS and tobacco products and the crackdown against the banned products.As many as 94,955 raids were carried out by the Excise Department across the State in the June 1-January 31 2016-2017 period. In the 18,363 Abkari cases and 2,480 NDPS cases registered after the raids, the excise seized 2,663 litres of illicit arrack, 1,184 litres of illicit spirit, 564 kg of ganja, 2,243 ganja plants, 10.8 kg of hashish oil, 101 gm of brown sugar, 35 gm of heroin, 50 gm morphine, 450 gm of poppy plant powder and 29 of gm opium, 170 gm of charas and 6,113 tablets/ ampules of nitrazepam, diazepam, alprazolam and buprenorphine.Without prescriptionPurchase of cough syrups, pain killers and drugs for depression from medical shops without prescription and their misuse is also rampant.

Ramakrishnan informed the Assembly on Wednesday that the increasing use of button medicine had been reported. Steps have been taken to prevent the misuse of medicines and Deputy Excise Commissioners had been asked to conduct checks with the help of drugs controllers.Mere enforcement would not help and the cooperation of all sections of people was needed. The Minister said the NDPS and Abkari rules had to be strengthened with the help of the Union government and more inter-State coordination was needed to contain the alarming use.As part of strengthening the enforcement, container modules are to be set up in seven excise check-posts, CCTV in 14 check-posts and solar LED high masts in 25 check-posts.De-addiction centres would be set up in all district hospitals as part of the Vimukthi project."

Four types of party drugs that includes cocaine, Ecstasy and charas were seized. One person, identified as Saneesh , who supplied these high-end drugs to rich clients for use in rave parties has been arrested.The arrest of the 32-year-old Kumbalam native was the result of trap laid by excise sleuths who posed as potential clients. They arrested him after intercepting his car on the national highway near Kundanoor on Thursday morning.The arrested youth Saneesh, son of Sarvothaman , hails from Blaithara near Kumbalam and had brought the contraband from Goa. When they learned about his presence in the city, the sleuths lured him and made the arrest when he arrived to make the delivery.The man used to supply the contraband to rave parties for over a year, said excise officials who tracked him over a month.""The parties seems to be happening in offshore vessels. We are finding it hard to conduct raids as tracking them is almost impossible without proper modes of transport for patrolling at sea,"" said an excise officer, adding that joint operations with coastal police were not productive.""The man was a peddler. We have seized electronic weighing machines used to make measurings in milligrams along with small pods used to sell the contraband to customers,"" said Narayanan Kutty , deputy excise commissioner.The seized drugs include 11g of cocaine estimated to cost Rs 7 lakh. MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a drug commonly known as Ecstasy was also seized. Excise sleuths said that they estimate the value of MDMA tablets (47 g) to be about Rs 25 lakh.Three grams of liquid MDMA valued at Rs 1.5 lakh and charas weighing 205 grams valued at Rs 50 lakh were also seized.The accused can get a minimum jail term of 10 years or a maximum of 20 years as the seized MDMA is of commercial quantity, said excise sleuths.The youth booked under provisions of the NDPS Act is now in judicial custody.""The liquid MDMA is commonly used by partygoers who drop them on sugar cubes.

The strict implementation of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act also resulted in more cases being registered in the cases.With more than 30% liquor shops shutting down, the state was also facing a rise in bootlegging and illicit brewing.The excise department that registered 900 cases in 2014, filed about 3600 cases since June 2016 under the NDPS Act. As many as 3,900 persons were also arrested during the same period.Since June 2016, the excise department registered 23,600 abkari cases, conducted 1.27 lakh raids and arrested 22,000 persons. State excise commissioner Rishi Raj Singh said that the bulk of synthetic drugs reaching the state were from Goa and Mumbai, while ganja was mostly brought in from Telangana and Tamil Nadu ""We have taken up a proposal to study the connection between the lack of availability of liquor and the rise in drug abuse by a team comprising of a psychologist, a sociologist, an education expert and a food safety expert. The study is slated to commence as soon as the proposal gets the planning commission's approval,"" Singh said.""The youths are following a frightening trend.

Assured market and price fixation, low input costs coupled with monthly returns have been attracting the farmers to switch over to oil palm cultivation.Lands with groundwater facility are suitable to cultivate oil palm. Though the water requirement is quite low as compared to paddy and sugarcane, installation of drip irrigation is mandatory. We are extending subsidies to the farmers on drip irrigation system, tractor tillers and other equipment, says Gopi Kumar, Assistant Director of Horticulture.With regard to the extent of cultivation and yield, East Godavari stands second in the State after West Godavari and in terms of potential area for cultivation both the Godavari districts are estimated to be of having 1.25 lakh hectares each. On an average, about 1,500 hectares of land is being converted into oil palm groves every year in the district. Besides low input costs, oil palms resistance to different climatic conditions such as heavy gales and cyclones is attracting a good number of farmers. We are happy that the market is assured and returns are considerable, observes Pendyala Buchi Babu, president of the East Godavari District Oil Palm Farmers Association  the body enjoys a membership of 30,000 farmers. Oil palm is being cultivated in 30 mandals and most of the yield is being procured by the Ruchi Soya Industries that extracts crude and edible oil from the fruit. The yield starts after three years of transplantation and there is no need to go for fresh transplantation for a period of 30 years. Once the harvest begins, the farmer can sell the produce every month. On an input cost of Rs. 35,000 per acre, the farmer gets 10 tonnes of fruit on an average and the present price is Rs. 8,500 per tonne, explains D. Ravindra, senior manager (plantations) of the Ruchi group.The recent price fluctuations remained a cause for concern among the farmers and the government should come out with an assurance on the price, points out Satti Rama Reddy, former president of the AP Oil Palm Farmers Association. We are extending support to the farmers by way of providing them fertilizer in time. We have established 18 service centres in different locations to procure the fruit, says P. Mallesam, corporate head of the Ruchi group, foreseeing a bright future for the crop."

Cooperative farming will be encouraged to minimise expenditure and maximise production.Under cooperative farming, a few farmers join hands together and grow only sugarcane in larger area. Rythu Seva Kendrams will be set up in 10 mandals. Drip irrigation will be given top priority for effective use of water resources. Borewells will be sanctioned under NTR Jalasiri programme. The farmers of SC and ST communities will get them at 100% subsidy.Currently, sugarcane is being grown only in 8,700 hectares both in kharif and rabi seasons. The government plans to increase the area to at least 20,000 hectares in a phased manner. The officials also observed the yield was only 27 metric tonnes per acre compared to 70 metric tonnes per acre in other areas.Srikakulam Collector P. Lakshmi Narasimham recently held a meeting with cooperative, agriculture and other departments to improve the production which is a must to meet the sugar factory needs if it is ready to function again.The sugar factory which used to spur economic activity in almost 10 mandals was closed a decade ago after it had registered huge losses. It was sold to a private company but the government take its control after farmers strongly opposed the privatisation.The High Court has also given a favourable judgment to benefit the farmers who were the shareholders of the company.

The cement companies, however, informed the government that the cost quoted by the RVNL was very high and process time consuming.Mr. Ramakrishnudu, to a question on modernisation of VV Ramana Sugar Factory in Anakapalle, said the government constituted a Group of Ministers to look into the problems confronting sugar sector among other sectors. The government also constituted a Secretaries Committee to identify the measures with the assistance of expert consultants to provide comprehensive and enduring resolution of sick cooperative sugar enterprises.

Almost all the shopkeepers on the road cover their faces with masks to avoid inhaling dust, while a few are forced to pull down the shutter of their shop, unable to withstand the dust.The Public Works Department has taken up construction of drainages along the road to allow free flow of rainwater. The earth movers have, in the name levelling the sidewalks, removed the top layer of soil and left in unattended for almost two weeks now.This is the busiest road after B.M. Road in Hassan town. Ten city buses cover at least 13 trips each a day, besides the buses plying to the tourist spot Halebidu. Hundreds of vehicles take this road as Malnad College of Engineering and many other educational institutions are located nearby.The asphalted width of the road is only 5.5 m, and the rest is covered with mud. Whenever a bus passes by, thick dust rises from the ground, forcing the people around to cover their faces. I close my shop during the busy traffic hours as I have already got respiratory problems because of the dust, said Ganesh, a shopkeeper. Meanwhile, the coconut sellers and sugarcane juice makers on the sidewalks are finding it difficult to work without covering their faces. Even if I park my two-wheeler for half an hour on this road, dust gathers on the vehicle, said Ashok, another shopkeeper.When The Hindu contacted Giridhar, assistant engineer with the PWD, he said the drainage work would start soon and would be followed by asphalting of the road. We have levelled the ground for drainage work. The [work] will start soon. Moreover, we have proposed widening of the road in view of the increased traffic on the stretch, he said.The PWD has proposed widening of Salagame Road as part of the works to be taken up for the Mahamastakabhisheka, to be held in 2018, and has also sought financial assistance under the Central Road Fund for the work. We are hopeful that either of these will be approved soon so that we can take up the widening work, the official said."

Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the scheme in Belagavi on February 27, 2016.Senior officials in the district administration told presspersons here on Wednesday that the collective efforts put in by the district administration, Agriculture Department, panchayat bodies, self-help groups, and social workers helped it in enrolling an overwhelming number of farmers under the scheme during the current financial year 2016-17  particularly for the rabi season. A total of 2,12,381 farmers (98.17% of an estimated 2.15 lakh farmers taking up rabi crops) were covered under PMFBY by insuring 2,58,810 hectares (89.24%) of the total cropped area of 2.90 lakh hectares under rabi as on January 10. Of the 2,12,381 farmers, 2,04,252 were non-loanee farmers.However, not many farmers came forward to enrol for the scheme during the kharif season as there was initially good rainfall and for the fact that majority of the farmers have been traditionally cultivating sugarcane  which is not a notified crop under PMFBY. Of an estimated 4,41,397 farmers who took up sowing operations during kharif season, 50,708 (11.49%) were covered, which included 35,207 non-loanee farmers and insured 68,816 hectares (14.67%) of the total 4,68,986 hectares of cropped area.The achievement marked by overwhelming enrolment had witnessed lack of cooperation from bank officials  thanks to their preoccupation with post-demonetisation impacts. But, a tactical approach by Deputy Commissioner N. Jayaram helped the banks to fall in line, sources said.But, officials and employees of various departments and social workers physically reached out to nearly 2 lakh farmers as part of massive door-to-door campaigns, organising gram sabhas, sending SMS and WhatsApp messages, and radio talks, to promote their enrolment under PMFBY."

The TRS regime was implementing its own schemes by diverting the Central funds, he alleged.Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday Mr. Lakshminarayana made it clear that his party would oppose tooth and nail the efforts of the TRS leadership to provide 12% reservations for religious minorities.He said the very proposal was unconstitutional and the Constitutional Drafting Committee Chairman B.R. Ambedkar himself opposed the reservations on the basis of religion.Expressing heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved family members of Nizamabad Municipal engineer Ch. Venkateswarlu who committed suicide after being trapped by the ACB recently, he said that it was unfortunate that an honest officer was driven to take the extreme decision. He wanted the Government to order a judicial inquiry into the incident.The party district president Palle Ganga Reddy said that the BJP district committee meeting would be held at Manikantha Function Hall at the newly formed mandal headquarters, Mupkal on January 27.Union Minister of State for Labour [Independent] Bandaru Dathatreya will attend as the chief guest.Mr. Ganga Reddy said that the Nizamabad district meeting would deliberate on the negligence of the TRS Government against farmers and their issues and its failure to reopen Nizam Sugar Factories at Bodhan and Jagityal and Sirpur Kagaz Nagar paper mill. It will also chalk out an action plan to launch the agitation to exert pressure on the Government on taking a decision on the three factories."

Addressing media persons here on Tuesday in connection with World Kidney Day, which falls on March 9, Dr. Abraham said that obesity and being overweight were critical risk factors.Indians, especially Keralites, are at the highest risk since they are fond of food items such as parathas and beef and are also prone to high stress levels and inadequate exercise. Each year, roughly 5,000 persons are diagnosed with CKD in Kerala. The primary prevention method is to do annual screening test, regulate blood sugar and pressure level and lead a balanced lifestyle, he said.CKD could lead to other complications such as heart disease, stroke and infections. Those with diabetes, hypertension, anaemia, kidney stone, obesity or family history were more prone to kidney ailments.The association would organise a host of awareness programmes, screening camps, flash mobs and mini marathon in different districts.The State government had been taking steps to promote cadaver transplant through the Kerala Network of Organ Sharing. A few hundred such transplants were over, while 1,500 chronic patients were on the waiting list. For details, check www.knos.org.in.Dr. Abraham said that transplant had around 90% success rate, especially if a person gave one of her kidneys. The rate was lower in the case of cadaver transplant (that of a brain stem dead person). The whole process cost around Rs. 8 lakh.Secretary of the association Dr. Binu Upendran said that a urine test is the best method of detecting kidney ailments. But most patients consulted a doctor after 90 per of their kidney functioning was lost. Dr. Jose Paul, convenor of the Cochin Nephrology Society, was present."

Randeep issued the directive and cautioned banks of action when farmers said that a majority of them barely receive any remuneration for their crops, as the amount received from the sale of agricultural produce is adjusted against the outstanding loan amount.The farmers were told the State government had sought over Rs. 4,000 crore as crop compensation from the Centre, of which Rs. 1,742 crore has been allocated to the State and Rs. 450 crore released so far.The Deputy Commissioner said the amount would be credited to the accounts of farmers with Aadhaar and other details in the bank database.Farmers highlighted what was perceived to be a major limitation to the crop insurance scheme  the awarding of compensation only in case of failure of the notified crops. They asked for this clause to be amended and the inclusion of crops such as sugarcane and cotton under the purview of the scheme.Sugarcane Cultivators Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar said the present cane procurement price does not match the actual sugar recovery or yield which, he said, is 10.5% to 11% a tonne in Mysuru district.

Our argument is that the exemptions given in VAT be continued in the GST regime also, said Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu.The GST Council, headed by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, would meet in Srinagar on May 18 and 19 to finalise the tax rate structure and also the commodities.The Finance Minister conducted a meeting with senior officials of the Commercial Taxes and Finance Departments on the States preparedness for GST, at the Secretariat near here on Tuesday.Mr. Ramakrishnudu said that the issue would be raised at the GST Council meeting.

These products would attract both tax and cess, he said.The GST Council decided to collect the cess, though AP has suggested paying the compensation to the States from the Consolidated Fund of India.

We are big pranksters and love to whip up offbeat, path-breaking recipes, the 32-year-old Dhopatkar tells us. He met his partner-in-crime, 31-year-old Lakhani, in 2015 at a pastry demonstration in Delhi. Just before the event, she had cut her finger and there was no first aid. I jumped in to help her set-up makeshift cake stands as some of her equipment had not arrived. I got to eat her cake too, he laughs. Lakhani later visited his kitchen, and the two were appreciative of each others talent. Though Ashay and I are like yin and yang in the kitchen. Sugar and salt! says Lakhani.Although Dhopatkar always wanted to be a chef, hes given his medical entrance examination and passed it too. But that was, he says, Just to prove to my parents that I could. I didnt take up the course, and moved [instead] to Goa to pursue hotel management. Hes also graduated with an MBA from University of Wales and a culinary arts course from Hammersmith and West, London. Luckily, his career landed him at several restaurants run by Michelin star chefs, including Herbert Berger, Mark Hix and Gordon Ramsay.Lakhani on the other hand, joined Le Cordon Bleu, Canada, after she reached a stagnating point in her job at a garment export company. She later joined ITC Maurya in Delhi as a kitchen executive chef, and also trained under pastry stars like Pierrick Boyer and Peter Yuan.For their Mumbai meal, the duo has planned a meal with deep European influences. Our food is European, but with an amalgamation of global flavours. For example, we do a hedgerow garlic dumplings with wasabi mayo. In this dish, the hedgerow is British, mayonnaise is French and wasabi is Japanese, says Lakhani, who in the past has also consulted at Le Bistro Du Parc, Noida.When queried on the use of molecular gastronomy, Dhopatkar says, [Using it] helps enhance the experience by assisting in achieving impossible textures and flavour combinations. But it shouldnt be used as a sheer gimmick.For their Mumbai pop-up, their menu includes interesting dishes, including whipped cauliflower  cauliflower espuma (foam) with candied walnuts, pistachio crumb and white truffle oil  saffron risotto with prawns and chorizo with parmesan air, and a salted caramel Magnum bar. We attempt to turn simple, everyday ingredients into a refined avatar, without adding too many flavours. Most of our dishes are inspired by our experiences, travels and mother nature, he says.To book the eleven-course tasting menu (Rs. 4,200 for vegetarians and Rs. 4,700 for non-vegetarians) by the Troublesome Duo at Magazine Street Kitchen at 7.30 p.m. on February 18, see insider.inOur food is European, but with an amalgamation of global flavoursNeha LakhaniChef"

Kallupatti, first local body to receive ISO certification",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/first-local-body-to-receive-iso-certification/article18074143.ece,2017-04-17,"Stench of decomposing waste, mounds of garbage with plastic and other wastes strewn all around - these are the things that come to ones mind while visualising a garbage dump or recycling yard.Instead, such a dumping yard with shade-giving trees on both sides of the entrance, crops of groundnut, spinach, and sugar cane, clean areas for preparing compost, without stench too, might look unrealistic. However, such a garbage yard for solid waste management, or Resource Recovery Park as it is called, does exist in T. Kallupatti town panchayat in Madurai district.The efficient maintenance of this dump was one of the several factors that had enabled the town panchayat to receive ISO 9001: 2015 certification last month. The certification, awarded by a private accredited certification agency, Quest Certification, has made T. Kallupatti the first local body in Madurai district and one of the very few local bodies in Tamil Nadu to receive ISO certification.We were not aware of the ISO certification. Looking at our track record, the Directorate of Town Panchayats had suggested the certification agency to check if T. Kallupatti would be eligible for the certification, said A. Kalaiarasi, Executive Officer of the town panchayat, who played an instrumental role in making the civic body eligible for the certification.According to her, the certification process, which spanned nearly six months, began with discreet visits by teams from the certification agency to assess T. Kallupattis work in providing essential services and implementation of various schemes. We did not know about their visits. They were directly interacting with the public, she said. The certification agency later made surprise visits to the town panchayat office to scrutinise maintenance of records, a crucial criterion for awarding ISO certification. The agency was pleasantly surprised by the transparent and precise maintenance of 63 types of registers, mandated by the Directorate of Town Panchayats.Wherever I worked, I had ensured proper maintenance of records. After completion of every financial year, ours will be the first local body to submit records for auditing to the Local Fund Audit office, said Ms. Kalaiarasi, who has already received recognition from the government for her work as EO in T. Kallupatti and Alanganallur town panchayats.The key areas on which the certification agency granted ISO certification to T. Kallupatti town panchayat included street light maintenance, water supply, dengue control, solid waste management, implementation of House for All scheme and maintenance of bus stand.Officials at the town panchayat said that the personnel from certification agency were particularly impressed by the focus given on solid waste management and dengue control, apart from comprehensive maintenance of records. They liked the overall maintenance of the park and also the fact that we are selling every month around 300 kg of compost prepared from the waste collected from households, said V. Muthazhagu, a sanitary supervisor. He also pointed to the new equipment procured for recycling plastic wastes.Zero dengue casesHighlighting that not a single case of dengue had been reported in the past couple of years in T. Kallupatti, Ms. Kalaiarasi attributed it to the continuous monitoring and awareness programmes. All the households in the town panchayat are visited at least once a week by our conservancy workers to monitor whether there was stagnant water or anyone in the house was down with fever, she said, showing the daily check lists maintained by the workers regarding the visits.She added that the town panchayat office was also in close contact with the four hospitals and clinics in T. Kallupatti, including a primary health centre, to effectively monitor fever cases.M. Manickam, whose tenure as the Chairman of T. Kallupatti town panchayat came to an end recently, said that the primary focus had been to redress grievances of the public at the earliest. For instance, we have a dedicated wireman to repair any fault with the 462 street lights. We also ensure that there was no issue in the daily supply of water, he said.The public also appeared to vouch for the efficient functioning of the town panchayat. The bus stand is cleaned at least thrice daily. The town panchayat has also installed drinking water facilities and ensured clean maintenance of toilets, said R. Pichai Kaleeswaran, who runs a fruit shop inside the bus stand.Ms. Kalaiarasi said that the better work and recognition had enabled the town panchayat to get more works sanctioned for the public. For instance, T. Kallupatti had been allocated 120 houses under the House for All scheme, which is the highest for any town panchayat in the State, she said.The ISO certification is valid for three years and subject to periodic reviews. Now that we have reached this milestone, our aim will be to sustain this efficiency in the coming years, she added.After completion of every financial year, ours will be the first local body to submit records for auditing to the Local Fund Audit officeA.

While admitting that there could be some black sheep here and there, Mr. Naidu asked the public to monitor the implementation of welfare schemes and bring to his notice, if they find anyone indulging in corruption.Hospital inauguratedDescribing Anakapalle as the bastion of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Chief Minister said the Area Hospital at Anakapalle was modernised with a 100-bed Maternity and Child Health Ward. The maintenance of hospitals would be outsourced and to ensure cleanliness and hygiene.Mr. Naidu said pattas would be distributed to beneficiaries at Gajuwaka and Simhachalam very soon.The Purushottapatnam Left Main Canal would be completed by the end of this year and drinking water would be provided to Visakhapatnam city.The Chief Minister earlier presented a gold crown worth Rs. 5 crore to the Goddess Nookambika temple in Anakapalle.Referring to demands made by MP Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao and MLA Peela Govinda Satyanarayana, the Chief Minister said sanction of a trauma centre and a dialysis centre at the Anakapalle Area Hospital.

59233d6d7be9e01fd59ad6bd,Irrigation potential in Maharashtra increased by 39 lakh hectares,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/irrigation-potential-in-maharashtra-increased-by-39-lakh-hectares-4578078/,2017-03-20,"The state government has created additional irrigation potential of 39 lakh hectares of land, surpassing the past record of 32 lakh hectares attained in the year 2005. The irrigation potential data is for the period between mid-March 2016 and 2017. After the summer crop rotation, it expects the irrigation potential to increase to 41 lakh hectares by April-end 2017.A highly placed source in the Ministry of Water Resources said, Due to a good monsoon, water storage across 3,037 dams was 83 per cent. This helped us to meet the target in the irrigation command area.The outcome is being attributed to the enforcement of the vision document along with reforms for better water management in dams. It has been backed with changed crop pattern at the taluka levels.During 2015-16, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had worked with every relevant department for a comprehensive vision document drawing a detailed roadmap with definite targets till 2019. Adhering to the plans, Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan held 80 meetings taluka wise. The canal advisory committee was set up to carry out better water management.At the end of three years, 150 projects will be completed, which will increase to 250 projects by end of five years.According to officials, As per our calculation, if all our dams are 100 per cent filled with water, the maximum irrigation potential would be 49 lakh hectares.But with the completion of ongoing 250 projects under our command area, we expect to enhance the irrigation potential by 7.5 lakh hectares in the next five years. Thus our objective is to take the irrigation potential to 55 lakh hectares by 2019-20, he said.Notwithstanding the recurring droughts in the last three to four years, the administrations biggest challenge was to check theft of water from dams for non-agricultural purposes.According to the officials, The water lifting from the dam beyond its reserved quota was to the tune of 25 to 30 per cent. It was essentially used for commercial and industrial purposes. Even within the agriculture sector, water lifting for sugarcane cultivation was also a cause of concern adversely affecting the overall irrigation potential.The stringent measures taken by the government in the last one-and-a-half years included better dam management along with greater focus on optimising available water by plugging leakages from canals.Indicating that dam water metering will be the next move, sources said, This would help us to generate an additional revenue up to Rs 750 to Rs 800 crore. This can be achieved through metering of dam water.While observing that peak summer stretched between March end to June, sources said dam water storage may decline beyond 40 per cent. Sources added, There should be no cause for concern for farmers as agriculture will continue to get the highest priority after drinking water.The change in the crop pattern, especially in drought- stricken districts, along with implementation of drip irrigation for high water intensive crops are being pushed.In the year 2016, the total expenditure incurred on drip irrigation subsidies to farmers was Rs 445 crore, covering crops across 1.02 lakh hectares. The economic survey 2016-17 projects a decrease in sugarcane area by 36 per cent and a production drop by 28 per cent.The officials in the ministry of agriculture said, The greater awareness about water management and changed crop pattern are beginning to bring some positive signs which was reflected in reduced sugar cane cultivation. In spite of a good monsoon, farmers are not banking on sugar cane cultivation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

If the demand during the summer is within 4,300 MW, there will be no problem. But if the demand exceeds that, we will have to buy power, K Siddaraju, director (technical), Bescom, told DH.To address the shortage, Bescom hopes that from April 2017 onwards, most government buildings will start generating solar power so that pressure on the grid is reduced, he added.The Energy Department has invited tenders for installing solar panels of at least one MW capacity in state and Central government buildings under the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IDPS) and the 13th Finance Commission.Presently, only 30 MW to 40 MW of solar power is generated in all Bescom divisions, and just 6 MW from 448 connections in Bengaluru. This is a small number. Wind power generation is uncertain and ranges from 30 MW to 1,800 MW, the official said.In the first phase, Bescom has identified 83 state and 200 Central government buildings in all its divisions for installation of solar panels.In Bengaluru, all Bescom offices, Vidhana Soudha, Vikasa Soudha, Legislators Home, Central government offices and schools and panchayat offices have been listed.Bescom is buying power from various sources and has left hydel resources untouched so as to use them during the summer.We are purchasing600 MW under the short-term open access. Another 450 MW is being purchased from Jindal Power Ltd and other power-trading corporations. We have procured 300 MW from Maharashtra; Bescoms share in it is 47.9%. We have also signed agreements with sugar factories for power generation which will start in a week. Water resources are being conserved to the maximum. The present capacity of hydel power is 15 million units against the installed capacity of 40 million units, Siddaraju said."

Express photo AAP inroads in Doaba worry SAD-BJP, Congress. Express photoAs campaigning draws to a close in the countdown to the February 4 vote, anger runs deep in Doaba, the land between the Beas and the Satluj which, with the regions of Malwa and Majha, makes the state. And it is this feedback from the Dalit stronghold of Punjab that has the ruling SAD-BJP combine worried.As elsewhere in the state, one of the talking points this election in Doaba has been the menace of drugs and the failure to stem the rot. Any talk of development is immediately overtaken by that of the illegal drug trade.In Dhamian Kalan in the Sham Chaurasi constituency of Hoshiarpur district, Jasbir Singh speaks for many in the village: If there has been any progress, it has only been for MLAs and ministers. In our village, only the drug trade has flourished, nothing else. One can buy nasha injections even from kirana shops. The drug peddlers know how and who to supply.In Chakowal Brahmana, Jeewan Chand echoes the sentiment. He says people do not need free sugar and ghee being promised by the SAD. The drug supply will kill our children and the sugar and ghee will kill us. What does the government want?Khuradpur village is in Adampur constituency, another reserved seat. And people here are rooting for the AAP, the newcomer which has made the fight for Punjab a triangular contest. We do not know the candidate. But our village is going to vote for the jharoowali party this time, said Jeet Ram who works as a farm hand in Khuradpur.In Phagwara, Balwinder Singh complains about the law and order situation. One can see drug flow freely in several areas of the city. We dont need this. We have been with the BSP for long. But this time, we will vote for some other party.Across Doaba, there is a clamour for badlav (change). And this is not only troubling the SAD-BJP but also the Congress which has committed votes in these constituencies  up against inroads made by the AAP.This region has 23 seats  Malwa accounts for 69 seats and Majha 25 in a House of 117  and is home to 46 per cent of Punjabs Dalit population. While eight are reserved constituencies, 20-30 per cent of the voters are Dalits in the remaining constituencies.In the 2012 assembly elections, the SAD-BJP won seven of the eight reserved seats. Its score in Doaba was 17/23.In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Chaudhary Santokh Singh of Congress took the Jalandhar parliamentary seat, defeating his SAD rival. But it was the AAP which came third, pushing the BSP to Number 4. The Hoshiarpur Lok Sabha reserved seat went to BJP state president Vijay Sampla who defeated his Congress rival. Again, AAP was Number 3 and the BSP fourth.This election, every party has gone all out to woo Dalit votes. The AAP brought out a Dalit manifesto, promising a Dalit Deputy Chief Minister if the party is voted to power. Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi promised to clear the backlog of 50,000 government jobs, mostly with Dalit youth. He also promised an Ambedkar university in Jalandhar. He and his party leaders visited Dera Sach Khand Ballan which has a large Ravidassia following in the Doaba.AAP, BSP and Congress leaders have all demanded the Bharat Ratna for Kanshi Ram. The SAD-BJP government built the Ravidass Dham at Khural Garh, Ram Tirath in Amritsar for the Valmiki caste, besides promising houses and free education.While Congress has its share of loyal supporters, the AAP appears to have attracted the young Dalit voters, especially in rural areas.Chabbewal Congress candidate Raj Kumar says AAP has nothing to give to the people of state as they do not understand Punjab or Punjabis. The Captain, he says of Amarinder Singh, has great vision and people trust him a lot.AAPs Sham Chaurasi candidate Ravjot Singh says his is a new party with new blood which wants to change all stereotypes since these old parties have no vision people know the reality and will not be carried away by false promises.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal)The National Green Tribunal has slapped an environment compensation (EC) of Rs 25 lakh on one of the countrys largest sugar firms for extracting groundwater without permission and polluting the environment in Uttar Pradesh.The green panel has held that two units of Balrampur Chini Mills in Balrampur and Babhnan and Manakpur Chini Mills in Gonda districts of UP and Rauzagaon Chini Mills in Barabanki were discharging large quantity of waste water into the Ganga through the rivers Rapti and Ghaghra and withdrawing groundwater without obtaining permission from the Central Ground Water Authority.Balrampur Chini Mills is considered to be the second largest sugar mill in the country.Invoking the polluter pays principle, the NGT said these units were liable to pay Rs 5 lakh each as EC for polluting the environment, committing breach of the terms and conditions of the consent orders and failing to install appropriate anti-pollution devices.In environmental law, the polluter pays principle was enacted to make the party responsible for pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also directed Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and Central Pollution Control Board to jointly inspect all these industries and submit a detailed and comprehensive report within six weeks.An additional environment compensation of Rs 5 lakh was imposed on Manakpur Chini Mills for causing death of animals and birds through the release of ammonia gas and polluting the environment.The judgement was delivered on a plea by an environment activist who had alleged that these industries were illegally extracting groundwater and operating their distilleries which were discharging effluents without treatment in the nearby rivers.The petitioner had sought a comprehensive study with regard to the impact of water and air pollution caused by the respondents and a detailed study with regard to lowering of the groundwater table in the area.Balrampur Chini Mills has 11 sugar factories in Uttar Pradesh, having an aggregate crushing capacity of 79,000 tonnes of sugarcane per day.

(File Photo) UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. (File Photo)After Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, now UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath too has brought out a catchphrase. He has taken the opposition parties apprehensions over the electronic voting machine (EVM) and called it to mean Every Vote Modi. The opposition parties had raised concerns over EVM tampering soon after the state assembly polls last months in which BJP won more than two-thirds of the seats.Addressing a meeting of BJP workers at a hotel in his home district of Gorakhpur on Saturday, Adityanath said that in the recent municipal polls in Delhi as well, the public proved that the meaning of EVM was no more electronic voting machine but it has become every vote ModiThe Delhi public proved that they have faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and in his effort to make India the biggest economic power in the world, said the chief minister. BJP Delhi state president Manoj Tiwari spoke to me over phone after their civic polls and said there was a UP effect. I feel that we will record a victory in the coming local body elections bigger than recent Assembly elections.Uttar Pradesh will see elections to its 744 urban local bodies in June. CM asked the workers to intensify campaigns to popularise the schemes of central and state government. In another event at the Gorakhpur University campus where foundation stones of several projects estimated to be worth Rs 261 crore were laid. CM said here that restoring rule of law was a challenge but claimed his government has already changed the atmosphere in one month and that the state has become an attractive investment destination.We will not allow any person to play with law. We will not let UP slip into anarchy, he said. He also said that his government will provide free electricity connection to below poverty line consumers.But, I appeal to the people to get into the habit of paying electricity bills. Every one should pay at least a minimum bill so that we could meet the target of uninterrupted 24-hour power supply across the state by October, 2018, CM said.He also said that the foundation for two new sugar mills will be laid and one mill will be made operational in eastern UP in next few months. He said that increase in industries will generate employment. He once again asked party workers not to agitate as they were the government now. If path of agitation is adopted, then it will worsen the situation, CM said. There was is a need to take the government schemes to the society without discrimination, he added.In case of grievance, he asked workers to send forward their issues and suggestions to the government through MLAs, MPs and party organisation leaders. He announced the laying of a foundation for a coaching centre for civil service aspirants, an auditorium, two new bus stations, hostels for SC/ST students and a four-lane underpass in Nanda Nagar area.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(File photo) At the same time, the Trump administration discontinued another signature program by Michelle Obama and her husband Barack Obama. (File photo)US President Donald Trumps administration put the brakes on a scheme championed by former first lady Michelle Obama meant to ensure healthier meals in schools through lower salt, fats and sugar. The Agriculture Department on Monday said in a statement the change would give American schools greater flexibility and stop kids from throwing out the less appetizing food mandated under the scheme.Forcing schools to adopt better nutritional standards under the 2012 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act if they wanted federal subsidies for meals was one of Michelle Obamas key achievements.Lauded by supporters in the US as crucial in the fight against childhood obesity, the initiative put restrictions on sodium and sweetened milks, and required school lunches to increase the amount of whole-grain foods they contained.The Trump administrations backtrack on the measure came the same day as a study suggesting that if American children exercised more, tens of billions of dollars in medical costs could be saved over their lifetimes.The finding was made by researchers at Johns Hopkins Universitys Bloomberg School of Public Health. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in six American children are overweight or obese.The Agriculture Department said the nutritional requirements imposed on schools in the past five years had added USD 1.2 billion in costs to school districts and to states.It said easing those rules would decrease costs, give back greater control to local authorities, and see children eating more enthusiastically.If kids arent eating the food, and its ending up in the trash, they arent getting any nutrition  thus undermining the intent of the program, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said.At the same time, the Trump administration discontinued another signature program by Michelle Obama and her husband Barack Obama.The 2015 scheme designed to promote educational opportunities for adolescent girls in developing countries, called Let Girls Learn, was being immediately scrapped, CNN reported on the basis of an internal email it had obtained.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Had it been around, India would have qualified this week, hands down. If you are wondering what Stella Award is, well, I am not referring to the Australian award for Gospel Music, honouring women, but to the award that honours the memory of Stella Liebeck, who was awarded nearly $2.7 million in punitive damages and $160,000 in compensatory damages by the New Mexico District court, in a law suit against McDonald.The 79-year-old Stella Liebeck was carrying McDonalds coffee, at about 85oC, between her knees, sitting in the passenger seat of her grandsons car, and trying to open the lid off the tumbler for adding sugar and milk, when she spilled the hot coffee over thighs and genitals, causing third degree burns thus needing hospitalisation (1992).The award had its origin in a column by Randy Cassingham, featuring Wacky-but-true news stories. The awards contributed much mirth between 2005 and 2007 before it was closed down as it ran out of steam. But the awards documented some hilarious law suits.One Stella award winner was Jerry Williams of Arkansas, for example, who was awarded $ 14,500 plus medical expenses because he was bitten on the butt by his neighbours Beagle, which was chained, in its owners fenced yard, and Williams had jumped over the fence into the yard and repeatedly shot the dog with his pellet gun. The jury had been good enough to reduced Williamss demand a tad, as it believed the beagle may have been somewhat provoked by Williams with his pellet shooting.Well, now it has happened at our own doorstep, namely in amchi Mumbai, where the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal held last month that a drunk motor-biker, with two on the pillion, who died on the day of Holi in a road accident against a municipal truck in 2008 was only 25% guilty and awarded him claims worth Rs 38 lakh.The heavier truck was supposed to take 75% of the blame (the award suitably adjusted of course)!Now our courts or tribunals are getting rather mathematically precise. Though we arent told if the biker was wearing a helmet, could the answer to the question have possibly swung the percentage of guilt by a couple of points as it were. Nor do we know if the biker had a valid licence and what difference that could have made to the percentage blame. We also do not know what adjustment to the percentage accounted for the fact that there were three riders on the motor cycle. And what adjustments would be made in case the biker was coming on the wrong side of the road?Zig-zag bikersZig-zag bikers on our roads are a common sight. Is there a further correction to the percentage point for zig-zag driving? And if he had a cell-phone between his shoulders and ears, would that make a further difference? And if he had taken off when the signal light was still red?And this particular accident was with a Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) truck, and according to the BMTC, the driver was well in control of the vehicle. What if the accident leading to the unfortunate death of the biker had involved another two wheeler? Or an auto-rickshaw? Or even a pedestrian? One hopes the tribunal would put out a detailed percentage chart of blame.One had mistakenly come to believe that in our land everybody, two-wheelers and four-wheelers alike, have the licence to drive like so many beheaded chicken, without helmets, without seatbelts, talking on the cell phones or even texting, with their vehicles over-crowded or over-loaded, as if they were all out on a suicide mission. After all, dont we routinely encounter near-accidents averted by a tiniest fraction of a second, when a lout overtakes us from the left, or goes around us from the left in order to turn right at a traffic crossing just as we are accelerating to go straight, just as the red light turns green?But this accidents tribunal has raised the bar. Not only is it par for the course to drive drunk with two pillion riders, such drivers shall be protected by law and awarded unprecedented sums in a country where victims of murders and rapes are awarded a pittance. We are now told it is the others who must watch out for such drivers.Well, well, we live and we learn. The tribunal has stuck true to the age-old percentage formula that we strongly believe in: what matters is the relative size of the vehicles in collision. The lions share of the blame must accrue to the bigger vehicle; dont worry with trivia like who was drunk or texting on a phone when driving.Our sympathy is only for those who die, even if they are suicidal idiots and it is their kin who deserve to get rich by Rs 38 lakh for their loved ones driving a motor cycle drunk on Holi, with two riders behind, rushing to meet their maker successfully. Never mind if the truck driver involved and his family have to suffer a life time of collateral consequences. Now you know why we would have qualified for our very own Stella award!Our roads and streets are full of manhole covers that dip or rise a good nine inches above the street level. We have so-called speed breakers that double as bone breakers, without even markers  for day or dark hours. We have encounter enormous craters or dug-up roads aplenty any without any warning, fair or foul.We negotiate assorted animals or even people coming on the wrong direction even on our highways or one-way streets. All of them may cause deaths. Are we to understand that from now on, it shall not only be our lot to learn to live with them all, but also be prepared to pay heavily if a drunken fool compounds the situation by insisting on driving under your wheels.(The writer is an academic and author)"
5923b7c87be9e01fcef055ad,Note ban defence confusing,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/595635/note-ban-defence-confusing.html,2017-02-09,"R K Pattnaik and Jagdish Rattanani, Feb 10, 2017 23:01 ISTECONOMIC SURVEYA key theme of the Economic Survey presented to Parliament last week was demonetisation. The survey sought to discuss complexities of the analytics, empirics and potential impacts of demonetisation. It has focused on the three sets of issues in this regard: (a) broader aspects of management of demonetisation, as reflected in the design and implementation of the initiative, (b) economic impact of demonetisation in the short and medium run and (c) implications of demonetisation for the broader vision underlying the future conduct of economic policy.The Survey refrains from discussing the broader aspects, steering away from the most critical aspects of the entire exercise of demonetisation. It is the ill-conceived and poorly-timed design and implementation of demonetisation that is at the crux of the many adverse consequences that have impacted the common citizen, besides hurting the economy.The exercise was based on a false perception that cash transactions breed corruption and less cash means that the level of corruption is reduced. The poor and inefficient technological readiness made such a massive operation ineffective. It is a pity that money supply figures are not recorded properly and the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) hesitancy to report the remonetisation figure is a clear evidence of this.The survey maintains that there have been short-term costs but potentially long-term benefits. To prove this point it has carried out an impact analysis using 10 variables which include: (1) Money/interest rates, (2) Financial system Savings, (3) Corruption (underlying illicit activities), (4)Private wealth, (5)Public Sector Wealth, (6) Formalisation/Digitisation, (6)Real estate, (7)Broader economy, (8)GDP, (9) Tax collection, (10) Uncertainty/ credibility.A perusal of the long-term impact on the above heads leads one to conclude that there is no definiteness and that the so-called impact analysis is highly conditional. For an example, the survey comments that loan rates could fall further, if much of the deposit increases prove durable; that the financial sector system savings will increase to the extent that the cash-deposit ratio falls permanently; that corruption could decline, if incentives for compliance improve.It goes on to argue, without providing any basis for such assumptions, that private wealth could fall further, if real estate prices continue to decline and that government/RBIs wealth will increase when unreturned cash is extinguished, reducing liabilities. Further, it claims that real estate prices could fall as investing undeclared income in real estate becomes more difficult and that the tax component could rise, especially if the GST is imposed on real estate.This is more of a wish list rather than any analysis. The long-term impact of demonetisation has been sugarcoated with many `ifs here. Such an analysis, claims and statements are neither expected nor appropriate in an important document like the Economic Survey.More importantly, the impact of GDP analysis lacks analytical rigour and is misleading. The Survey, to defend demonetisation, takes the shelter of nominal growth. It mentioned that an even better counterfactual for comparison would be the level of nominal rather than real GDP growth. After all, demonetisation is mostly a nominal demand shock, so its effect in the first instance will be on nominal magnitudes.This is not only an analytical blunder and but also a classic case of creative accounting to defend and justify a wrong. For all analytical purposes, the real GDP represents truly the performance of the economy and certainly not the nominal GDP.Furthermore, the survey to prove the point of minimum adverse impact of GDP has gone into the technicalities and concluded that when one is comparing the GDP growth estimates by the IMF, the Central Statistics Office and others, it would be more appropriate to make a comparison based on the changes in the forecasts rather than their levels. This suggestion has the potential of inconsistent approach to make any comparison.Tax collectionAnother important issue is tax collection. The survey claims that indirect and corporate taxes could decline, to the extent growth slows. Over the long-run, taxes should increase as formalisation expands and compliance improves. This is again a very simplistic and an erroneous view. It is important to recognise that less cash in the economy does not mean formalisation in the economy is automatic. There are structural rigidities in the form of bankable habits and stricter KYC norms. Even in the much- discussed Jan-Dhan accounts, as the demonetisation experience suggested, there are ample cases of misuse.The increase in taxGDP ratio is a sustainable answer to prudent fiscal management. But moving to a formal economy has no direct relation with the increase in tax compliance. Tax compliance is one issue but more important is enhancement of tax base along with rationalisation in tax rates and withdrawal of many tax exemptions.With regard to credibility, the survey has mentioned credibility will be strengthened if demonetisation is accompanied by complementary measures. However, these complementary measures have not been defined in the survey. There seems to be some inconsistency in the Survey: on the one hand, there is an argument that full remonetisation will not happen but while discussing the credibility, there is a mention that early and full remonetisation is essential.It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the Economic Survey has been used to justify the erroneous decision on demonetisation and related issues. Counterfeit notes and black money are the result of deficiencies in the currency management architecture of the RBI the tax administration of the government. At the end of the day, it is important for the RBI to improve the currency management architecture. In a longer-term perspective, it is important to strengthen the currency management architecture and tax administration without harassment.(Pattnaik is Professor, SPJIMR; Rattanani is Editor, The Billion Press, SPJIMR)"

Perturbed by similar incidents and also by the fact that a large number of CAPF personnel were prematurely leaving the forces, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) commissioned a study in 2012, which established that stress caused by tough work conditions, separation from their families and lack of basic amenities as the major problem. All the three recent incidents bear this out.Though the problem was recognised, efforts made to address it seems insufficient. In many uniformed organisations, the quality of food served has often resulted in riots. It is evident that supervision on the part officers to ensure service of quality and wholesome food to their personnel is lacking.Complaints about food also emanates from perceived pilferage of items like atta, oil and sugar. If officers visit the jawans messes and ensure quality, this issue can be resolved.In so far as grant of leave is concerned, there is nothing much a unit head can do because of vacancies, overstay of leave by personnel and emergencies. It is not always possible to grant leave to those who seek leave.The unit officer has to exercise discretion and refusal of leave causes a lot of stress as most CAPF jawans are at countrys borders or at hostile territories, far away from home. The only way to tackle this problem is to reserve 20% of sanctioned strength of a unit for leave and other exigencies. Secondly, if all vacancies in a unit are filled up, the unit officers will not be hard pressed to spare their men to avail leave.Long hours of duty and sleep deprivation is also a cause of stress in CAPF. This can be set right only if adequate staff strength is maintained and regular rotation of duties among personnel is done.A large number of men from paramilitary forces are deployed on internal security duties. It may be prudent to take men off such duties periodically so that they are not constantly stressful.It also must be ensured that deployment of persons less than a squad strength is never done to ensure proper messing arrangements and operational efficiency. An effective transfer policy to take care of the problem of being far away from home is called for.It is established that there is a complete mismatch between the persons selected to man CAPF and the role they need to play. The selection process needs to improve.What is most important is ensuring the quality of lower level supervisory staff like NCOs and JCOs (non-commissioned and junior commissioned officers). They need to be sensitised to the needs of the jawans. For this, they need effective training. Since they are the first contact point with jawans, their handling of situation will go a long way in solving many problems.Of late, measures have been taken by CAPF to destress their personnel. Sports, yoga and meditation classes are regularly organised. Apart from regular medical check-ups, regular psychological assessment is also called for. If a weapon is given to a person, it is to be ensured that the person handling it is psychologically sound.Stress levelsIt is a known fact that CAPF men who are highly disciplined, do not indulge in undisciplined acts all of a sudden. Only when their stress level reaches the boiling point, they resort to mindless acts.The officers supervising jawans both at NCO and JCO levels must be sensitive to the prevalent conditions and must communicate with their seniors on what exactly is happening at the platoon level, so that remedial measures can be taken.There is a severe shortage of Gazetted Supervisory Officers in all CAPFs and there is also rivalry between those officers recruited directly to CAPFs and those deputed from the Indian Police Service (IPS). This is also a cause for various problems. The leadership of CAPFs at all levels need improvement.The CRPF jawan has spoken about the disparity in pay between school teachers and CAPF jawans. The CAPF personnel have long been complaining about pay disparity with the army. Despite the Seventh Pay Commission implementation, such complaints continue. This needs to be resolved.It is high time that these problems are not swept under the carpet like in the past by the authorities concerned but address them head on.(The writer is the former Director General of Police, Karnataka)"

PTI PhotoAn uneasy bonhomie, engineered by the respective cricket boards of India and Australia, forms the smokescreen for the third Test beginning here on Thursday. Despite all the peace talk and sugar-coated claims, the lingering bitterness between the two teams is hard to miss.The eight-day break between the end of an acrimonious second Test in Bengaluru and the start of the third Test here at the JSCA stadium may have helped soothe the frayed tempers to an extent, but the pent-up emotions can explode at the slightest of provocation. To pre-empt the potential for any such situation, match referee Richie Richardson will be holding a meeting with the captains of the two teams  Virat Kohli and Steve Smith  in attendance on the morning of the match and brief them on the importance of playing the game within the boundaries specified.That said both teams realise the magnitude of the task at hand. While Kohli isnt given to diplomacy, he is also smart enough not to lose the woods for the trees. He knows India need to win both the Tests to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy while Smith is aware that his team requires just one more result in its favour to retain the crown.As leaders and as main batsmen of their respective sides, the two understand that they have to put their personal battles in the backburner in the best interests of their groups.For all the brouhaha surrounding the Smith-inspired Review-gate, cricket has been engrossing even though the quality of pitches for the first two matches has come under scrutiny. Australia, against all pre-series predictions, have shown trademark resolve and resilience to challenge India on an equal footing. Their preparations for the series have been spot on and their attention to details, be it about the pitch or the players, has been threadbare. They shocked India in three days in Pune and dominated the hosts for most of the second Test before losing it all in a little over a session.Thats the beauty of Test cricket in India. As much as the shorter versions of the game have become monotonous with a set pattern of batsmen ruling the roost on shirt fronts, Test cricket still remains fascinatingly unpredictable. The constant ebb and flow of the game makes it more challenging for players than anywhere else in the world. Australia would have realised that in the space of less than four days in Bengaluru.The third Test promises an equally exciting affair on another pitch where spinners are expected to call the shots. The Aussies, including Smith and coach Darren Lehmann, perhaps spent more time examining and analysing the surface than they would have on an R Ashwins bowling clip or a Kohli batting footage.The low bounce and the expected wear and tear may force Australia to include off-spinning all-rounder Glenn Maxwell in place of Mitchell Marsh, who played the first two Tests. In a like-for-like replacement, the tourists may play a fastish Pat Cummins in place of the injured Mitchell Starc, helping them cover all the bases wherein they will have seven batsmen and two-three pace-spin bowling combo. Interestingly, Smith, once considered heir apparent to the great Shane Warne, had a decent bowl during practice and was seen practicing off-spinners.India too are unlikely to deviate from the seven-four combination which worked well for them in Bengaluru. With low bounce on the cards, both Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma will be inevitable given how effective they were in Bengaluru. India will also be hoping for M Vijay to regain full fitness from the shoulder injury, and encouragingly, the opener had a hit at Wednesdays nets without the obvious discomfort.While the form of KL Rahul and plucky shows of Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane are good signs, the home team will be looking for Kohli to deliver. The skipper has had a rare run of four failures, and a big one from him is due."
5923d6b87be9e01fcef06d36,What's the buzz,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/613054/whats-buzz.html,2017-05-22,"What's the buzzFruit juice not safe for infantsFruit juice offers no nutritional benefit to children under the age of one and may contribute to excessive weight gain, say experts who recommend not including juices in the diet of infants.The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a new policy marking the first change in recommendations on fruit juice since 2001. The revision accounts for the rising rates of obesity and concerns about dental health based on data accumulated over recent years.Parents may perceive fruit juice as healthy, but it is not a good substitute for fresh fruit and just packs in more sugar and calories, said Melvin B Heyman. The recommendations state that 100% fresh or reconstituted fruit juice can be a healthy part of the diet of children older than one year when consumed as part of a well- balanced diet.Researchers recommend that intake of juice should be limited to, at most, four ounces daily for toddlers age one-three. For children aged four to six, fruit juice should be restricted to four to six ounces daily and for those aged seven-18, juice intake should be limited to one cup per day. Toddlers should not be given juice from bottles or easily transportable sippy cups that allow them to consume juice easily throughout the day. The excessive exposure of the teeth to carbohydrates can lead to tooth decay, as well.Eating fruits, veggies daily may cut artery disease riskEating over three servings of fruits and vegetables every day may lower the risk of developing an artery disease that restricts blood flow to the legs, a new study claims.Researchers, including those from New York University (NYU) in the US, analysed data from about 3.7 million people. They found that people who reported eating three or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables had 18 per cent lower odds of peripheral artery disease (PAD) than those reporting eating less.PAD narrows the arteries of the legs, limiting blood flow to the muscles and making it difficult or painful to walk or stand. Researchers found that overall, 6.3% of participants had PAD and 29.2% reported eating three or more servings of fruits and vegetables daily. The study provides important information to the public that something as simple as adding more fruits and vegetables to your diet could have a major impact on the prevalence of life-altering peripheral artery disease, said Jeffrey Berger, associate professor at NYU.Air pollution may cause DNA damage in childrenChildren and teenagers exposed to high levels of traffic-related air pollution may be at an increased risk of a specific DNA damage called telomere shortening, a new study warns.Young people with asthma also have evidence of telomere shortening, a type of DNA damage typically associated with ageing, researchers said. Telomere length may have potential for use as a biomarker of DNA damage due to environmental exposures and chronic inflammation, said John R Balmes of University of California.The study included 14 children and adolescents. Researchers assessed the relationship between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a ubiquitous air pollutant caused by motor vehicle exhaust and shortening of telomeres. As the exposure to PAHs increased, telomere length decreased in linear fashion.Children with asthma were exposed to higher PAH levels than those without asthma. The relationship between PAH level and telomere shortening remained significant after adjustment for asthma and other factors."

The Committee that should include teachers, parents, students and canteen operators would be also solely responsible for providing safe food to the school children, it said.Consumption of foods High in Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS), popularly known as junk food, is associated with increased risk of certain diseases such as type-2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation and hyper-insulinemia with a risk of cardiovascular diseases in later life. These diseases and childhood obesity have been reportedly found to affect the cognitive and physical development of children adversely causing an irreparable loss to the society, the notification said.The notification also directed school authorities to conduct timely checking of quality of raw materials and ingredients and decide the lunch items to be prepared in the school canteen/kitchen. The Committee would also see that food in schools are up to standard and meet the guidelines as outlined by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).The Board also asked the school authorities to conduct regular inspection of lunch boxes of students in order to minimize the consumption of unhealthy foods may be done by the schools.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The raids are an effort to tarnish my image. My adversaries have not been able to digest my political growth. They are trying to remove me from my ministership, he stated.He said he will soon submit a report to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on the raids and stick to whatever decision he takes. Sources in the Congress said Jarkiholi is planning to meet the chief minister on Thursday to brief him about the I-T raids.Further, Jarkiholi claimed that the statement by the I-T department that it has seized Rs 162 crore unaccounted money and 12.8 kg jewellery is wrong. The department has neither found money nor any jewellery during the raids, he claimed.Of the properties worth Rs 115 crore found during the raids, around Rs 80 crore belongs to the sugar factory and property worth another Rs 53 crore relates to various other businesses. Accounts of the entire Rs 115 crore have been submitted to the I-T department, he said. None of it is unaccounted for, he claimed.BSY demands resignationBJP state president B S Yeddyurappa on Wednesday demanded the resignation of Small Scale Industries Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi after income tax raids unearthed Rs 113 crore undisclosed assets purportedly belonging to him. Instead of sacking Jarkiholi, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has stated he has no information about the I-T raids.This is a very irresponsible statement and Siddaramaiah should contemplate whether he himself should continue in office, Yeddyurappa said. He also demanded that the Congress take action against its womens wing president Lakshmi Hebbalkar who has also been at the receiving end of the I-T raids. He said the statement by BJP national president Amit Shah at a recent party rally in Bengaluru that the Siddaramaiah government was the most corrupt in the country is turning out to be true."

However, in the Union Budget proposals for 2017-18, this subsidy component was withdrawn, indicating that the entire burden of subsidised sugar will have to be borne by the states.Khader said the Karnataka government has written to the Centre to restore its share of subsidy immediately. At present, 10,000 tonnes of sugar a month is distrubuted through PDS at a cost of Rs 15 per kg.The state is not in a position to bear the entire subsidy on its own and will be forced to withdraw supply of sugar through PDS from April this year, the minister said.BPL ration card holders in rural areas will get one litre of kerosene a month even if they have LPG connections, Khader said. As many as 40 lakh card holders with LPG connections will benefit. They will have to enrol at the respective gram panchayats stating that they are interested in availing kerosene. The fuel will be charged at Rs 25 a litre and provided from March. Supply of kerosene to households with LPG connections was discontinued in 1995.Food and Civil Supplies Department Principal Secretary Harsh Gupta urged all ration card holders to link their cards to Aadhaar at the earliest. Aadhaar seeding of ration cards has been mandatory and ration supply will be cut if it is not done within the next few weeks, he said.As many as 50,000 applications have been received online for new APL cards since January this year and 30,000 of them have been processed, Khader said."

File photoIn a bid to provide a substitute for its tipplers, the Tamil Nadu government has come up with a new idea to manufacture and sell vitamins-rich health drink Neera, a non-alcoholic drink extracted from toddy palms and coconut trees.The government's ambitious plan to promote Neera assumes significance as it was taken in the backdrop of the closure of more than 3,500 liquor shops along the highways following a recent Supreme Court order.Neera, which is called Pathaneer in Tamil, is a sweet beverage usually extracted from palm trees. But if it is not preserved properly, fermentation will kick in due to airborne yeast and turn it in to alcoholic toddy.The AIADMK government, which promised the people that it would close all liquor shops in the state step by step, has given the permission for large scale sales of Neera, which is rich in Vitamins A, B and C.At present, Neera is being produced only in Coimbatore and the product is being sold in few State Co-operative stores.State Coordinator for Tamil Nadu Toddy Movement, Nallasamy said Government's initiative will not only help about 50,000 farmers, but also ensures direct and indirect employment for about two lakh people once the product reaches the market. Neera drink will also boost the ongoing protests against aerated drinks, he added.According to him, the State has eight crore trees spread across 10.74 lakh acres. A farmer earns just Rs 1,000 a year by selling coconuts. But with Neera, he could earn up to Rs 15,000. Neera biscuits will also be available, he added.Pointing out that over 3,500 liquor shops were shut along state and national highways, Nallasamy said we do not want them to reopen it elsewhere.Sources from the State-owned Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU), which helps farmers in producing ""Neera"", said the drink will also help shift traditional toddy extractors towards an healthier alternative, which has good diet value such as palm sugar and candy."

We have already listed some areas in the Mysuru and Dandeli belts. We are also covering Tumakuru, Ramanagaram, Mandya and Hassan, Dilipkumar Das, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Project Elephant, told DH.Das said that unlike the last census, where different states were covered on different dates, this time it will be done in all South Indian states on the same day. This will help ensure that the migrating elephants are also counted.Officials and conservationists hope that the population this time will be almost same as the one during the last census (6,000, highest in India) despite the death of several animals. According to Forest department records, in the last five years 515 elephants died a natural death, while 68 met with unnatural death because of electrocution, shooting, man-animal conflict and poaching.Kishan Singh Sugara, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), said that he did not expect any sudden rise in population. It should be stable. Though there have been deaths, births have also been reported. This time, during the census, more attention will be given to areas where cases of conflict have been very high, he said.Favourite cropsOne cannot say that since the number of conflict cases are high, the population is more. Elephants are coming out of forest areas because farmers are growing the favourite crops of jumbos in the areas bordering forest patches. The corridors are also being encroached upon, which is leading to conflict, Das added.Raman Sukumar, noted elephant expert and professor at IISc, said the drought factor could play a role in the census. But this time the census will be more accurate as dung decay rate analysis has been incorporated in addition to counting of animals.Workshops for training the staff and volunteers are also under way.The dung decay rate analysis started in 2016. Preference is being given to volunteers who have participated in earlier census.Census from May 17-19The Elephant census will be conducted between May 17 and 19. Training will be imparted to volunteers and preparation of elephant distribution map will be done on May 16. Training for forest staff and volunteers is going on.One training camp was conducted at Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) on April 2. The next training session will be held on April 22 at BNP office and one each in Mysuru and Chikkamagaluru on April 25 and another in Dandeli on May 2."

(Source: Reuters) Maria Sharapova will return from a 15-month doping suspension on Wednesday. (Source: Reuters)From the shadow of Chernobyls nuclear wasteland to international super-stardom and from penniless arrival in the United States, without a word of English, to a fortune of USD 200 million.It may sound like the stuff of Hollywood dreams, but the story of Maria Sharapova is a testament to the power of one individual to make it, whatever the odds, whatever the controversy, whatever people think.Tomorrow in Stuttgart, the 30-year-old will return from a 15-month doping suspension to open the next chapter.When she takes to the court to face Roberta Vinci, it will be to the consternation of many opponents and the relief, albeit privately, of a womens tour left flagging by the absence of Serena Williams, probably Sharapovas only serious rival in the arena-filling business.Sharapova shot to international fame as a giggly 17-year-old Wimbledon winner in 2004  the third youngest player to conquer the All England Clubs famous grass courts.She would go on to win the Australian and US Opens while claiming two titles at the French Open, despite famously likening her movement on Roland Garross crushed red brick toa cow on ice.Siberia-born Sharapova first picked up a racquet at the age of four in Sochi, where her Belarus-born parents had settled after escaping the deadly clutches of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.Spotted by Martina Navratilova, she was encouraged to move to Nick Bollettieris Florida academy, the proving ground of Andre Agassi and Monica Seles.Father Yuri and the seven-year-old Maria left for the US in 1994 with just USD 700 to their names.Yuri took odd jobs like dishwashing to finance his daughters dreams although visa restrictions meant mother Yelena was back in Russia, separated from her daughter for two years.When Sharapova was nine, the mighty IMG group spotted her talent and funded the USD 35,000 fees required for the Bollettieri school.She made her professional debut at 14 in 2001 and by 2003 reached the world top 50. She won her first tour titles in Japan and Quebec.Then in 2004, her Wimbledon final triumph over Williams made her an overnight international celebrity.One year later, she became the first Russian woman to be ranked number one in the world while, in 2006, she won her second major at the US Open.But in 2007 and 2008, she began her long, on-off battle with shoulder trouble. She still had time to win the 2008 Australian Open before a second shoulder injury kept her off tour for the second half of the season, including missing the US Open and Beijing Olympics.A 10-month absence from the sport, as she recuperated from surgery, saw her ranking slip to 126, but she was back in 2012, capturing the French Open to become the 10th woman to complete a career Grand Slam and adding Olympic silver to her resume that year.Her 2014 French Open title was another high after a dispiriting injury low. More injury troubles followed before the bombshell announcement of her positive test for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open  where she fell in the quarter-finals to Williams, her last match before her suspension.With Williams, she has endured her most testing rivalry  on and off the court. The two famously exchanged personal insults over their love lives when Sharapova began a two-year romance with Bulgarian player Grigor Dimitrov, a rumoured previous suitor of the American.Sharapova had previously been engaged to former Los Angeles Laker star Sasha Vujacic. She may have been unlucky in love, but Sharapova hit the jackpot in her commercial affairs.She made almost USD 30 million in 2015, according to Forbes, with USD 23 million of that coming from endorsements and once signed a contract extension with Nike worth a reported USD 70 million.Beauty sells. I have to realise thats a part of why people want me. Im not going to make myself ugly, she said.She owns luxury homes  one in Florida, one in California  and is making a lucrative career as anentrepreneur.In 2012, she launched her own line of candy, Sugarpova, and during her suspension, signed up for a Harvard Business School course.But she insists that retirement was never an option despite her absence meaning her world ranking has disappeared, leaving her at the mercy of wildcards into tournaments.Those free-passes have irked many of her contemporaries already suspicious of the Russians aloofness.I know I am respected, says an unconcerned Sharapova.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

59284cf27be9e0137c77ca31,Skipping breakfast before workout,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/610703/skipping-breakfast-workout.html,2017-05-09,"Skipping breakfast before workoutGretchen Reynolds May 9 2017, 23:25 ISTFor those who can stomach it, working out before breakfast may be more beneficial for health than eating first, according to a new study of meal timing and physical activity. Its results indicate that when we eat affects how much fat we burn during exercise and also alters molecular activity within fat cells, in ways that could have long-term implications for our physical well-being.Athletes and scientists have long known that meal timing affects performance. If you eat first, you have relatively high levels of blood sugar. Working muscles can readily use this sugar as fuel.If, on the other hand, you have fasted before working out, your muscles must rely primarily on the bodys skimpy supply of stored carbohydrates or its larger reservoirs of fat.Accessing this fat, however, requires extra metabolic steps to become available as energy, which makes it a relatively inefficient fuel source during strenuous exercise. The body tends to turn to fat as its primary fuel source when exercise is more moderate.So for the new study, which was published this month in The American Journal of Physiology  Endocrinology and Metabolism, researchers from the University of Bath in England decided to home in on average people and their fat cells.Most of us probably do not realise how busy and physiologically bossy our body fat can be. But in recent years, scientists have established that fat cells constantly make and excrete a wide variety of substances that influence other systems and organs in the body.The British scientists suspected that eating before exercise might affect the production of these substances.To find out, they first recruited 10 overweight and sedentary but otherwise healthy young men, whose lifestyles are representative of those of most of us. They tested the mens fitness and resting metabolic rates and took samples of their blood and fat tissue.Then, on two separate morning visits to the scientists lab, each man walked for an hour on a treadmill at a moderate pace. Before one of these workouts, the men skipped breakfast. On the other occasion, they ate a substantial, 600-calorie morning meal, supplied by the scientists, of toast, jam, cereal, milk and orange juice about two hours before they started walking. Just before and an hour after each workout, the scientists took additional samples of the mens blood and fat tissue. Then they compared the samples.Lower blood sugar levelsThere were considerable differences. Most obviously, the men displayed lower blood sugar levels at the start of their workouts when they had skipped breakfast than when they had eaten. As a result, they burned more fat during walks on an empty stomach than when they had eaten first.But it was the impacts deep within the fat cells that may have been the most consequential, the researchers found. Multiple genes behaved differently, depending on whether someone had eaten or not before walking.Many of these genes produce proteins that can improve blood sugar regulation and insulin levels throughout the body and so are associated with improved metabolic health. These genes were much more active when the men had fasted before exercise.To gain the greatest health benefits from exercise, it may be wise to skip eating first, says Dylan Thompson, the director of health research at the University of Bath.This was a very small, short-term study, though. It cant tell us whether other types of meal timing such as, for instance, skipping lunch before an afternoon workout will produce similar effects or if the acute changes seen in fat burning and gene expression after fasting will necessarily translate into lingering health improvements over time.The results also do not suggest that fasting before exercise will accelerate weight loss. In fact, in this study, eating before exercise resulted in the men burning more calories during their workout than fasting.In other words, many questions must be investigated before scientists can offer recommendations about eating before exercise, Thompson says. But he will not be surprised, he says, if subsequent data reveal that working out on an empty stomach has advantages.If we just think of this in evolutionary terms, he says, our ancestors would have had to expend a great deal of energy through physical activity in order to hunt and gather food. So, it would be perfectly normal for the exercise to come first, and the food to follow."
59284e697be9e0137c77cb3a,GST: Impact on key sectors,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612889/gst-impact-key-sectors.html,2017-05-21,"Mahesh Kulkarni May 22 2017, 0:11 ISTFixing rates for six sensitive items will be top priority for the GST Council, which is slated to meet in New Delhi on June 3, just 27 just days beforThe two-day brainstorming session of the GST Council completed its task more or less on May 18 and 19 at Srinagar, with the announcement of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on 1,200 goods and 500 services. The Council has arrived at 18% tax rate as a standard rate on majority of the goods and services. However, there are still some politically sensitive items like bidis, gold, textiles, footwear and agriculture implements, among others, for which the rates will be finalised in the next meet of the GST Council in June. Fixing of rates on lottery service is also yet to be finalised.This leaves the government with a little over 40 days to officially implement the GST effective from July 1, 2017. We are in a state of readiness for July 1 rollout, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting.But before getting into the nuances of the implications for various sectors, there are four broad things that one must understand about the intent of the GST.The core intent of the GST rates was to ensure that the GST implementation is not inflationary, as has been the experience with some other countries. As a result, the GST Council has made an attempt to keep the GST on sensitive food items in the range of 0-5% and transport at 5%.According to Vaibhav Agrawal, Head of Research and ARQ, Angel Broking, GST cannot be purely looked as a tax rate, but one should look at the simplicity that it brings in business and trade. GST makes the entire country as a single homogenous market. Take the case of multiplexes, even though the impost under GST may be higher, the fact that a plethora of state and local levies are getting subsumed, which makes it much simpler.There is an issue of credit on tax paid on inputs, which was not available in many cases in the past. However, under GST, the input credit in such cases will be automatic and seamless. That will reduce the effective rate of GST in most cases, he said.What the GST rates mean for key sectors in India:With the government focus on keeping tax on items of mass consumption low, this sector could be the clear winner. While milk, grain and cereals are exempt from GST; other products like sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will attract just 5% GST. This will benefit companies like Nestle. While personal care items will be taxed at the peak rate of 28%, items of mass consumption like hair oils, soaps and toothpaste will be taxed at 18%. This will be beneficial for companies like Marico, Dabur and Colgate. Overall, the food side of the FMCG business is likely to benefit from the GST.Auto could slightly be a mixed bag as the impost will vary across categories. With the standardisation of GST for automobiles at 28%, two-wheelers and small and medium cars may face a higher impost. While this may be slightly negative for players like Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti, etc, we believe that this will be passed on to consumers, Angel Broking said. Among the commercial vehicles space, Ashok Leyland may see higher GST.The GST Council has put items like refrigerators and ACs in the maximum 28% category. This will lead to a higher impost on these companies, and could impact companies like Voltas and Havells. However, with robust summer demand, they should be able to pass on these costs to the consumer. These companies will also benefit fundamentally as GST will bring more companies under the organised ambit and reduce unfair competition from unorganised players.For cement manufacturers, the peak rate of tax may go up slightly under the GST regime. However, there is an additional benefit for them as the GST on coal and metal ore has been cut to 5%. For cement companies, this will largely offset the higher GST impact. At the same time, steel and power companies that depend heavily on coal will also benefit from the lower GST on coal. JSW and Tata Steel may be the key beneficiaries.These companies may be slightly unhappy that they have been bracketed in the highest category along with gambling and betting activities. That almost looks akin to imposing a Sin Tax on movies. However, multiplexes will benefit from subsuming of a plethora of state and local taxes into one single tax and also from input credits. PVR and Cinemax may find the GST rates neutral at best.Grandfathering of current exemptions for services (including healthcare & education) leaves limited anomaly on the taxability services and the Council has clarified that no additions shall be made to the exemption list, Amit Sarkar, Partner & Head, Indirect Tax, BDO India, said.Unlike the current regime where service tax is imposed at a flat rate of 15% across all services, the GST will have four slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% exactly like the GST on goods. For example, the GST on telecom will be 18%, higher by 3% from current levels. However, the availability of input credit will partially neutralise this impact. However, making transport service GST at 5% will be anti-inflationary. The GST will be just 5% on economy flying, which will help airlines like Spice Jet and IndiGo give a bigger push to the Udaan programme.A rate of 18% for telecom and financial services may appear higher against the current service tax rate of 15%; however, these sectors are likely to derive substantial benefits on the input credit front, given the eligibility of credit on the goods which was not the case under the current regime.Overall positive impact for restaurants having less than Rs 50 lakh turnover, and non-AC restaurants, given that they shall be taxed at 5% and 12%, respectively, with full input tax credit as against the current tax incidence of approximately 19-20% [VAT + ST] for AC restaurants. It is noteworthy that restaurants having less than Rs 50 lakh of turnover may also opt for the composition scheme, subject to the conditions prescribed.With respect to works contract service, though the 12% rate with full input tax credit could be an overall boom for a civil contractor as against the current taxes at 6% (central) and 1-5% (state), it may still lead to potential disputes regarding movability and the applicable rates thereon [works contract vs composite supplies].The impact of GST has been a mixed bag for the Capital Goods and the consumer sector. While the Capital Goods sector would benefit from a lower tax rate on contracts, there would be higher tax incidence on cables and transformers, Motilal Oswal Securities said in its report.A few segments in the consumer sector would see higher effective taxes and need to take price hikes to offset cost pressures from increased taxes. Key changes/surprises vs expectations were for a) Fans, which were expected to come in the 18% bracket, but have been bought at 28% (currently at 24%) and need price hikes, b)Air-conditioners, which have been put in the 28% bracket and would need 2-3% hikes, c) Transformers put in the 28% GST rate vs the current 18% implies price hikes need to be taken, d) Cables, which were earlier in the 18% bracket taken to 28%, and e) Work contract, which is in the 15-20% range (depending on the VAT rate) taken to 12% is a positive for the construction sector (L&T, BHEL).Under the new tax regime, industry stabilisation will take a couple of quarters. However, the benefits of GST on business practices and company strategies will be seen only in the medium term (1-3 years). The extent of business efficiency is estimated to be higher in goods as compared with services. At present, supply chains across major manufacturing industries are strategised, based on tax arbitrage aspect, CRISIL Research said.Seamless tax treatment under GST will eliminate the need of multiple warehouses across states.Broadly, the GST rates are likely to be neutral to positive for the Indian markets overall. Of course, the fine print will give much greater clarity on this subject.Effects:All tax payersWith need for registration and filing of returns in multiple states, compliance costs are likely to go up. Overall tax compliance, too, is expected to go up. This will also impact some of the smaller entities in SME-dominated sectors. Over the longer term, this is likely to lead in consolidation and gain in market share for the organised sectorImpact on manufacturing statesThe destination-based taxation structure of GST implies that states with manufacturing bases will potentially lose revenue which will be compensated by the central government  about Rs. 500 b in the first year. The key states that will require compensation are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana. Proceeds from the additional cess on sin goods/ luxury items will constitute the pool from which the states would be compensated for any revenue loss.Existing companies which have signed MoUs with statesSeveral states have, in the past, offered tax incentives to companies for setting up manufacturing units. Dilution of the power of states to levy independent taxes/offer exemptions under GST regime, will impact existing projects too. State governments and impacted companies will need to find out solutions. However, at present there is lack of clarity on this issue.Revenue authoritiesTax monitoring will become easier on account of the robust GST network platform where all returns can be accessed instantly and in a user-friendly manner. This will help revenue officials monitor the sequence of supply of goods and services as well as flow of input tax credit.Financial institutesGST will increase working capital requirements across major manufacturing sectors on account of tax liability on inter-state stock transfer. Accordingly, businesses will not be able to claim their tax credits until the shipped goods are sold. To reiterate, stock-transfers in the current regime does not attract any tax even during an interstate transfer."
59284eac7be9e0137c77cb69,Getting a business to taste 'organic' growth,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/610378/getting-business-taste-organic-growth.html,2017-05-07,"Hrithik Kiran Bagade, May 8 2017, 0:14 ISTBusinesses are harvesting plans to reap the resurgence of organic farming, making humble crops like millets relevant in today's plateAgriculture, the primary economic activity in India employing the largest workforce in the country, dates back to the early stages of civilisational growth. Since time immemorial, Indian farmers have tamed the lands soil, tapped her fertility, and perfected the cultivation of myriad crops, using improvised techniques where animals were the source of energy for tilling, irrigation, and when natural manures played a pivotal role.But the Green Revolution in the early 1960s, backed by the introduction of high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilisers, led to a hike in production and paved the way for economic independence of farmers. But, while the natural strength of the soil was getting lost in the long run, the Green Revolution brought in a new set of crops against conventional ones like pearl millet (bajra), foxtail millet (navane akki), finger millet (ragi), and sorghum (jowar). Since dramatic climatic changes brought drought, leading to drastic reduction in the agricultural yields, policymakers, agri-scientists and farmers began thinking of going back to environment-friendly modes of cultivation  simply put, organic farming.Karnataka, which recently conducted the Organics & Millets National Trade Fair in Bengaluru, is the first state to draft an Organic Farming Policy in 2004, which will be reformed into a new policy this year.According to Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, The Karnataka Organic Farming Policy 2017 aims to bring organic farming into the mainstream and transform the states agriculture into a sustainable and remunerative occupation, enabling production of safe and nutritious food by promoting eco-friendly and holistic organic farming and marketing systems.This has been heard as a sort of clarion call by startups and businesses alike which not only wish for higher yields in their own fortunes, but also want to build perception.Startup seedlingsIt was six months ago that Namu Kini co-founded HappyHealthyMe Organics in Bengaluru, which today boasts of over 300 SKUs under its brand, including cold pressed oils, ghee, staples, spices, masalas, grains, and unusual flours, among others.Namu, who is also the CEO, says, We want people to reconnect with food and enjoy every meal. We dont want them to view healthy food as deprivation and punishment. A lack of finding authentic organic brands in the market, led to the founding of HappyHealthyMe, which will be launching its website soon, and eventually going pan-India. Organic food is tastier, but its also difficult to source many of its products. Theres a lot of misinformation out there on what is organic and what isnt, and procuring everything becomes inconvenient. A lot of brands claim to be organic, but are not, she says, adding that the organic switch is to be made not when one is sick, but rather when one is healthy and wants to remain that way.The global organic food market, which was estimated at $90 billion in 2015, has been growing at a CAGR of around 12% over the last 14 years. Interestingly, India has the largest number of organic producers in the world at 5,85,000 active cultivators, who produce around 1.35 MT of certified organic products namely sugar cane, oil seeds, cereals and millets, pulses, tea, coffee, fruits, spices, dry fruits, vegetables, and so on (as part of edible crops), annually. In Karnataka, meanwhile, the certified organic area increased to a mammoth 93,963 hectares in 2015-16, from 2,500 hectares in 2004.It must be noted that certified organic means that every single products supply chain must be audited by a number of different agencies/certification bodies around the country. Once something is certified, it means that the farm should have gone through a three-year conversion period, during which neither chemicals nor fertilisers should have been used  only then can it be claimed as organic.Besides organic farming as a means, what one is eating in the end must also be known. Millets, often dubbed as poor mans food, are being popularised as hardy crops requiring a tenth of water consumed by mainstream crops, and even less fertiliser, to become an integral part of ones balanced diet.Soulfull, the health food brand of Kottaram Agro Foods, is blending innovation to make millets relevant in the 21st century. In the mainstream perspective, millet is an underdog among food crops. Still, what we are seeing is a lot of interest coming for these ancient grains from urban pockets. But there is a long way to go, and there is more exposure needed. One must understand that unlike rice which has different varieties, millets constitute a family of different types, Prashant Parameswaram, MD (Soulfull) at Kottaram Agro Foods, tells DH.Millet consumption, compared with mainstream rice or wheat consumption, is very small, in the 1-2% range of total staples consumed every year.Awareness is on the rise, and the next stage is increasing consumption to 10-20%. The role for companies like ours is to innovate the right product and bring it into the market in a way that is relevant and resonates with consumers, he says, elaborating with an example: One is aware that ragi is good for health, and is more nutritious than other mainstream grains like rice and wheat, but how do I get a child to eat it? How do I provide it in a more attractive form? Todays children are choosier about what they eat.A drive towards fitness due to rising lifestyle disorders and hectic job profiles has led many, especially in urban areas, to embrace an organic and millet-filled lifestyle. With a surge in foreign ideas, Indians have taken to eating oats, muesli, and quinoa as major dietary additions, while there is a need to make them see the beauty of home produce. For instance, foxtail millets and quinoa are nutritionally the same, with the latter also having been classified as a super food. But, why run after a crop which is grown in South America, when a similar indigenous ingredient like foxtail millet provides the same applications? questions Parameswaram.Hence, we are trying to bring millets back into the mainstream. Were not telling people to give up rice, wheat or oats, but supplement a healthier alternative in their meals with millets, he adds.Conquering challengesA point in question is about organic food being expensive when compared with regular FMCG food products.A major reason might be the amount of time, methods and risk involved in the cultivation process. While cheap petrochemical pesticides artificially enhance growth of crops, the amount of harvest will also increase, getting more people to use them. Eventually though, they kill the soil quality, and there will be no crop after several cycles. On the other hand, organic agriculture will not give that much of a harvest, with some yield also being lost to pests since no pesticide is used.However, once demand increases, price will go down as more farmers would be encouraged, believes Namu. But a big challenge is forecasting that demand, and one has to maintain quality and authenticity, she says, adding that with government support, it will be accessible to everybody, and even farmers would gain confidence to grow such crops.Even bigger companies are keenly eyeing this nascent space. MTR Foods has committed to use more millet in its products, while online grocery store BigBasket has signed up with a number of farmers to sell their produce on its platform.Meanwhile, the state government has allocated a budget of Rs 10.5 crore for agriculture innovation startups, assisting in Series A and B funding by connecting them to investors. Food for thought, anyone?"

The contents of the new land bill passed by the Assembly resemble the provisions of GO 123. But, the GO was stayed by the High Court recently, he added.Hence, the new land bill passed by the Assembly amending the provisions of the 2013 Act, which was sent for President approval, would not stand for legal scrutiny, he claimed. Kodandaram further said, TJAC has decided to meet President to submit a memorandum in this regard to him. We demand the state government to procure land for projects as per 2013 Act.He said the TRS government was unable to fulfil its poll promises. Because of that, people are backing the agitations taken up by TJAC, he added.The TJAC chairman took strong exception to the state governments apathy in reviving the Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar factory (NCSF). He accused the state government of adopting double standards on this issue.He also said that TJAC is committed to fight for the concerns of people. As part of that, they are strengthening organisational network at grassroots level in every district."

Oinam Anand Outside a bank in Sherkot, Bijnor, UP. Oinam AnandITS BEEN over two months since demonetisation happened, but the queues before banks and ATMs in Brush Nagari  as this town in the Dhampur Assembly constituency of western Uttar Pradeshs Bijnor district is called  are still long and winding. Sherkot has around 600 small-scale and cottage industry units that produce an estimated 70 per cent of the painting and drawing brushes in India. They employ between 25,000 and 30,000 people from in and around the Nagar Palika town, which had a population of 62,226, according to the 2011 Census, of which over 74 per cent were Muslims and another 9 per cent Dalits.Notebandi has hit us badly. Sixty per cent of our units have shut, as theres no cash to pay workers, says Mohammad Ajmal, owner of Oskar Brush Products. The small home-based units, each engaging 10-25 labourers, have stopped working. Even the bigger ones  the 25 or so having 100-150 workers each  are running for eight hours, as against 12 before November 8 (when the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes were banned), says Satish Kumar, a local brushware trader.Two things strike any first-time visitor to Sherkot. The first is the streetlight poles fitted with LED bulbs dotting not just the main, but even interior roads. This is being credited to the towns young municipal board chairman Qamrul Islam, who is from the ruling SP. The second is the long bank and ATM lines.Out of the four ATMs here, only the one belonging to HDFC functions occasionally. The second (of Punjab National Bank) is non-functional, the third (Bank of Baroda) was shut from November 8 till January 11, and the fourth (State Bank of India) has no money most of the time. Even the banks mostly give only Rs 1,000 at a time, says Keshav Singh, from Balkishanpur, a village nearby.For the current Assembly polls, the BSPs candidate from Dhampur is Mohammad Ghazi, who has a family business of manufacturing paint and art brushes under the Sajan and Charminar brands. Other leading brush makers from Sherkot include names such as Wilson, Sunrise, Jainco, A One, Panama and Master. These firms basically source the raw material  PVC or wooden handles, bristles and tin ferrules, which hold the hair or filaments on the handle, and epoxy glue  from outside and assemble the brushes using local labour.The brushes are hand-assembled, requiring special labour skills that youll find in this town, says Ghazis father Mohammad Khursheed, who came from Gungoh near Saharanpur in 1976 to establish a brush-making unit at Sherkot. Those days, we used only natural bristles like hair from pigs or from cattle and buffalo tails. But in the last 15 years or so, synthetic nylon filaments are mostly used.The BSPs electoral strategy this time is focused around Dalit-Muslim consolidation and capitalising on discontent due to demonetisation. Bijnor district has 43 per cent Muslims and 21 per cent Dalits, apart from it being home to industries like brush-making in Sherkot, glass-bottle manufacturing in Kiratpur and handlooms in Nehtaur, all of which have been impacted by demonetisation.While the BSP was the first to announce candidates for all of Bijnors eight Assembly seats and seems most poll-ready, as of now, Dalit-Muslim consolidation isnt, however, easy to achieve on the ground. Our heart is with SP. Even if the party splits between father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and son (Akhilesh Yadav), we may go with the latter. His government has done a lot of work, especially in improving electricity supply. If Akhilesh bhaiya ties up with Congress and Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal, it makes our choice easier, says Syedul Hassan, a truck-owner from Nindru Khas, a village near Dhampur town.The BSP, on its part, is going all out to woo Muslims. The party has fielded Muslims in six of Bijnors eight constituencies (Bijnor, Najibabad, Dhampur, Barhapur, Chandpur and Noorpur), and Dalits in the remaining two (Nagina and Nehtaur), which are reserved seats. It has also projected the internal feud in the SP as a reason for the community not to waste its votes that will only benefit the BJP.What nasbandi (forced sterilisation) did to the Congress in 1977, notebandi will do to the BJP and parivarbandi (family feud) to the SP this time, claims Rasheed Ahmad, BSPs candidate from Bijnor who is also chairman of the Nehtaur municipality. The BJP, which is facing the heat from demonetisation, fancies its chances on a split in the Muslim vote as well as a reverse Hindu consolidation  plus of course, Prime Minister Narendra Modis personal popularity. In a three-cornered contest, the BJP has the edge in at least five seats (Dhampur, Barhapur, Nagina, Nehtaur and Noorpur), says the chief general manager of a sugar company that owns two of the districts nine mills.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Last week, Patna witnessed a coalition of opportunistic interests and a clash of confederate priorities when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar shared a dais. Nitishs allies Lalu and the Congress party were kept away from the elevated symbolism of platform politics.Both political leaders are experts in playing mind games with each other, as well as with their associates. Though Nitish hasnt moved beyond Patna Politics, he has acquired a national stature through his posturing against Modi and the Sangh Parivar. During the past three years, both have made it a point to keep their hot-and-cold relationship as the fulcrum around which their conflicting national interests revolvedone to sustain and the other to capture power.At a time when Mamata Banerjee and Arvind Kejriwal, along with some opposition parties, are forging an anti-Modi alliance, it would suit the PM if the Prince of Patna kept his fraternal distance. Perception is power playwhen they whisper in each others ears, the minds of their friends and foes are blown. Last week, when they participated in the customary address to celebrate the 350th Anniversary of Guru Govind Singh held in Bihars capital, they disrupted the national political narrative. Whether they have kissed and made up is known only to them. But the political establishment and the media have spun their own interpretative yarns. They describe the Modi-Nitish encounter as the beginning of a new political re-alignment at the state and the national level.A religious function is hardly a forum for mutual backslapping. But Nitish set the tone by describing the alcohol ban in Gujarat as an example of decisive action. He declared, Drugs and alcohol are dangerous for society. It destroys the lives of people. Before Bihar, the Gujarat government implemented it. The PM before taking up his post was the CM of Gujarat and he implemented prohibition. The ban is still going strong. Bihar will also set an example to the nation. Modi returned his frenemys compliment with a patently sugar-coated response. Praising Nitish for enforcing prohibition in Bihar, the prime minister remarked, Nitish ji has taken a very significant step. Bringing social change is not an easy task. Despite facing difficulties, what Nitish ji has done is worthy enough to be praised. I congratulate him and hope that the people of Bihar will win the fight against alcoholism... This is not Nitish Kumars struggle alone. This is a battle, which the whole state of Bihar needs to fight. Everyone should take the resolve of turning Bihar alcohol-free. I believe Nitish Kumar will succeed due to the blessings of Guru Gobind Singh Maharaj.Power is a seasonal phenomenon, and mellowness was suddenly in the air once both Nitish and Modi came to power in their respective domains after protracted attrition. They refrained from attacking each other or raking up confrontationist issues. Ever since Nitish became Bihars CM in 2015, he has abjured vocal opposition to the prime minister and his policies. This was a marked departure from his previous preference for blaming the Centre for denying special status to the state. In the first few months of Modis tenure, Nitish has been all sound and fury while charging New Delhi with ignoring Bihars legitimate economic interests. But ever since the autumn of 2016, Nitishs new political romance with the prime minister became apparent. Examples:*In March last year, the PM visited Bihar in connection with a Patna High Court function. Both took a helicopter ride together. Modi defied protocol and walked up to his former Public Enemy No. 1, who was seated a few chairs away. Later on, the PM described his erstwhile foe as his mitra (friend). In response, Nitishs subsequent speech avoided all mention of the `1.70 lakh crore financial package he had sworn to wrest from the Centrea plank on which he had won the polls. Further, he praised Modi for his cooperative federalism.*A few months later, Nitish expressed his wish to travel with the PM to Lumbini, Nepal, to attend the Buddha Purnima function to be held on May 21. Nepal had also invited the Chinese president and the UN secretary general. Nitish wrote a formal letter to Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj communicating his desire to be a part of the PMs delegation. Though the function was cancelled later, the overture signalled a change in their hostile relationship.*On demonetisation, Nitish has taken a stand in favour of the PM while many of his senior party leaders are strongly opposed to the move. In spite of Nitish being the Janata Dal (United) president, he has made it a point not to join Opposition protests against the note ban. According to published reports, both leaders have been holding informal consultations and meetings on various national issues. Nitish had declared that he would review his views on demonetisation after December 30. Even though 10 days have passed since the deadline expired, he hasnt changed his views.*Nitish has so far not accepted Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singhs invitation to join the poll campaign of secular parties. Migrant labour from Bihar plays a decisive role in affecting the electoral outcome in at least 25 seats, in half the districts of Punjab.The message from Pataliputra reveals a new Manifesto of Mindsets. Modi considers Nitish an important instrument for the success of his Congress-mukt Bharat mission. If he is able to create friction in the Grand Alliance with his excessive flirtation with Nitish, the latter will need the BJP for his political survival. With a total strength of 128 seats in a house of 243, the BJP and the JD (U) enjoy a comfortable majority in the Bihar Assembly.Currently, Nitish is dependent on the Congress and the Lalu-led Rashtriya Janata Dal. By winning over a credible CM like Nitish, the PM can dent the united oppositions armour. With 14 states under NDAs direct or indirect control, Modi can implement his agenda with the help of other CMs from Odisha, Tamil Nadu and a couple of Northeastern states. Nitish, on the other hand, can bargain for better financial support from the Centre and ensure better delivery to those who voted for him. Lalu is a staunch Congress supporter and Modi-basher.His party is already annoyed with the chief minister for not letting a Yadav share the stage with the PM. If the seating arrangement at a government function can cause tremours in the ruling coalition of Bihar, imagine the damage a frequent exchange of bouquets and badinage between the PM and the CM can cause! Modi and Nitish may be separated by the chasm of their national ambitions, but seem to be made for each other in the political bartering of mutual rewards.Prabhu Chawlaprabhuchawla@ newindianexpress.comFollow him on Twitter @PrabhuChawla"

Deeptiman TiwaryModi tere raj mein, munji gai byaj mein, aur prali gai sharam-lihaz mein (Modi, under your government, all my paddy crop has gone into paying off debts and the hay had to be donated). THIS ONE-LINER painted behind a tractor-trailer chugging towards the Shamli sugar factory with a load of sugarcane captures the mood among Jat farmers in the Shamli-Kairana-Muzaffarnagar belt of western Uttar Pradesh, which votes in the first phase of the Assembly elections on February 11.With payment from sugar factories sluggish, minimum support price for crops stagnant, crop loan debts on the rise and the rabi sowing season impacted by demonetisation, Jat farmers, the dominant votebase in this region, are up in arms against the BJP. So much so, that almost all Khap panchayats here have declared that they will vote to defeat the BJP, this time.Jats had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the party in the 2014 parliamentary polls and were instrumental in BJPs clean sweep in this part of the state. But, on January 8, around 35 Khap leaders and thousands of Jats from UP and Haryana gathered at Kharad in Muzaffarnagar, under the banner of Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti, to declare that the community would not vote for the BJP again.The rally was significant for its presence of Muslim Jats and speeches in which the BJP was accused of spreading communal hatred. And, although the key concern expressed at the rally was the denial of reservation to Jats, much of the talk among community leaders is also about problems plaguing the farming sector, lack of visible development and the aftermath of the Muzaffarnagar riots.There is a lot of anger among Jats against the Narendra Modi government. Not only has it denied reservation to Jats, none of the development promised has come about. Just go out and see, has anything changed? The farmer is suffering. Modi promised so much that we ended up defeating our own Ajit Singh (Rashtriya Lok Dal). It wont happen again, says Chaudhary Subhash Baliyan, 48, Sarva Khap Mahamantri, which covers 365 Khaps in UP and Haryana.Baliyan says that the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 gave a lease of life to BJP in western UP, but the price had to be paid by Jats. Our children are in jails. Is the BJP helping them get justice? Once their leaders became ministers, no one came to visit us. Among Muslims, the poorest bore the brunt. Havent they contributed to Indias freedom struggle? The BJP just wants us to keep fighting among ourselves, he says.This sentiment is echoed by Chaudhary Harkishan Singh of Gathwala Khap, one of the bigger Khaps in UP, with 52 villages under it. They precipitated the riots. Once it was over, we were left to fend for ourselves. We are ruing our decision to vote the BJP to power. The Jats political identity is linked to Ajit Singh and thats where they will go this time, claims the 89-year-old, who admits that he is an accused in several cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots. Harkishan was represented by his son Rajender Malik at the Kharad rally.Chaudhary Naresh Tikait, chief of Balyan Khap that holds sway over 84 villages in UP, is not as vocal as the others but does not hide his displeasure with the Centre. I dont want to say who should be voted for and who shouldnt. But it is not just Jats, the farmer community as a whole is not happy with the Modi government. We feel cheated. We had expected sugar exports to be eased and sugarcane prices to go up to Rs 450 a quintal. We are also not getting the right price for our crops. None of what we expected has been delivered and on top of that, demonetisation has reduced farmers to poverty. This government has completely ignored farmers.Most Jats say that even though they are not happy with the Samajwadi Party, which they accuse of playing a partisan role in the riots, they would go with it if there is an alliance of SP, RLD and Congress. The common refrain for going with RLD is: Ajit kam se kam shor to machaega kisano ke liye (Ajit will at least make some noise for the farmers).The idea is to teach the BJP a lesson. Jats will go with whoever can achieve that. In that sense, at least, Jats and Muslims are together in these polls, says Chaudhary Jeetender Singh Hooda of Hooda Khap, which has 10 villages under it.Khap leaders such as Chaudhary Sanjay Kalkhande, 55-year-old chief of Kalkhande Khap that has 12 villages under it, are ready to vote for an SP candidate if the RLD and SP tie up. We have to agree that (UP Chief Minister) Akhilesh Yadav has done some development work. At least, roads have been built. Mulayam Singh Yadav, too, has spoken for farmers. The BJP is only interested in dividing society. They did it in UP first, then in Haryana, says Kalkhande.Hooda, however, is the most vocal on farmers issues. The BJP had said in its manifesto that farmers would get a price that is one and-a-half times their input cost. While input cost has almost doubled since then, prices are stagnant. Demonetisation has severely impacted farm incomes. We were forced to sell our Basmati paddy at 60 per cent of what we usually get. Similarly, jaggery sold for Rs 2,200 a quintal against the expected price of Rs 3,400, he says.This Khap leader was also critical of the import-duty waiver on wheat when the country had a decent harvest. It was the time for Indian farmers to earn. But the government wanted to help foreign farmers. BJP will pay, he says.Chaudhary Surajmal, 81, of Battisa Khap, which covers 32 villages, is concerned  and angry. Modis concern for farmers is limited to his speeches. Nothing happens on the ground. Earlier, MSP would be increased every year. But ever since Modi has come to power, it hasnt increased even once. Same is the case with price for sugarcane, which has increased only once by Rs 25 in the past few years and, that too, thanks to Akhilesh Yadav, says Surajmal.These leaders say that Jat farmers were expecting an announcement on farm-loan waiver from the Prime Minister on December 31, 2016. That it hasnt come across and interest-free loans given to sugar mills has not translated into clearing of farmers dues has disappointed us, says Chaudhary Rajinder Singh, 80, chief of Deswal Khap, with sway over 60 villages stretching to Aligarh and Mathura.In his speeches, the Prime Minister says payment to sugarcane farmers has been cleared. We havent received anything. Where has the money gone? He is paying mills. No one is paying us. This government is that of industrialists, not farmers, claims Singh.The mood among Jats in these parts is so bitter that they are not even ready to credit the government for the cross-LoC surgical strikes. What has it achieved? Attacks by terrorists have continued. Under no government have so many soldiers died, says Surajmal.The other big fear here is the threat of Income Tax raids, post demonetisation. We are not well-read. We dont understand this cashless system. Anyone can fool us. For every transaction and payment now, PAN card has to be furnished. They will soon begin to ask for tax from us, says Singh.According to him, while the common man has suffered hardship, demonetisation has turned all black money into white. Tell me, has corruption ended. Go anywhere even today, no work is going to get done without paying a bribe, he claims. Almost in exasperation, this Jat leader closes the argument in quintessential style: Kisan ka na koi khata, na Modi se ab koi naata (Farmer has no bank account and he will now have no connection with Modi).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Source: Ganesh Shirsekar, Deepak Joshi More than 42,000 runners turned up to take part in the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon on Sunday, including celebrities such as actors Rahul Bose (top right) and John Abraham. Source: Ganesh Shirsekar, Deepak JoshiWith surprisingly good weather, the city on Sunday was kind to the 42,000-odd people who participated in the 14th edition of the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon. This year saw fewer cases of dehydration, with 11 people requiring hospitalisation and around 2,500 needing medical help.In 2016, 18 runners had to be hospitalised due to high blood pressure, dehydration and sugar levels, and 4,000 others needed medical aid.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThis year, there were multiple factors for such a healthy run. People are more aware about their health, and we saw no case of cardiac problems. The cooler weather brought down dehydration complaints, said Dr Vijay DSilva, medical director of Asian Heart Institute.Among the 11 persons hospitalised, six were taken to Bombay Hospital, two to Lilavati and Hinduja Hospital each and one to the Jaslok hospital to be treated for dehydration. A few others were treated with IV drips at medical camps set up for the event, DSilva added.Runners also reported problems such as muscle cramps, limb ache, nausea, exhaustion and back pain. At various medical camps dotting the route, physiotherapists and volunteers massaged runners or administered them medicines.There were a total of 60 beds put together with 11 medical aid camps along the stretch of 42 km. In addition, 11 ambulances and seven doctors on motor bikes covered the route to help runners.While a training of emergency cardiac relief and CPR was given to 40 volunteers and over 1,000 policemen, not a single case of cardiac arrest or even irregular heart beats surfaced this year.At Bombay hospital, three runners were discharged by Sunday afternoon.Three others, Mahesh Pillai (32), Vishal Adhav (30) and Dinesh Victor, who were part of the full marathon, remained admitted.All of them suffer from dehydration but are stable. The treatment given to them is of IV fluid and lots of electrolyte, said Dr Sagar Sakle, spokesperson of Bombay Hospital.About 85 cardiac patients also participated in the half as well the full marathon this year after undergoing a series of health check-ups and stress tests. They did not need any medical treatment (during the marathon) in spite of having undergone heart procedures. This shows that conditioning and preparation under medical supervision can avoid any problems during long runs, said Dr Ramakanta Panda, Vice-Chairman of the Asian Heart Institute.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5928941a7be9e0138af8b827,White House concedes it won’t close Guantanamo after all,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/white-house-concedes-it-wont-close-guantanamo-after-all-4479499/,2017-01-18,"White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. ( File Photo) White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. ( File Photo)The White House said on Tuesday that the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba will still be open when President Barack Obama leaves office, conceding that a core campaign promise will go unfulfilled. Administration officials had long insisted that the president was continuing to work toward closing the facility even when it became obvious that it would no longer be possible for practical reasons before President-elect Donald Trump takes office Friday.WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWSWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that the administration determined it wouldnt happen when they realized they did not have enough time left to comply with the 30-day deadline for notifying Congress in advance of a detainee transfer. At this time, I dont anticipate that we will succeed in that goal of closing the prison,Earnest said. But its not for a lack of trying, I assure you.Over the weekend, the US transferred 10 low-level detainees from Guantanamo to Oman. Eight were from Yemen and two from Afghanistan, including an insurgent, Abdul Zahir, who was accused of possessing a white substance suspected to be a chemical or biological weapon but that turned out to be salt and sugar, according to his lawyer, Air Force Lt Col Sterling Thomas. All were deemed eligible for release after authorities determined they no longer posed a threat.Their release lowered the number of detainees to 45, with a few more releases expected in the administrations final days. Trump said during the campaign that he not only wants to keep Guantanamo open but load it up with some bad dudes. Earlier this month, he said there should be no further releases of men he called extremely dangerous people. The US began using its military base on southeast Cubas isolated, rocky coast to hold prisoners captured after the Sept 11, 2001, attack and at the start of the war in Afghanistan. At its peak, the facility held nearly 680 detainees. It was down to 242 when Obama took office in 2009, pledging to close what had become a source of international criticism over the treatment of detainees and the notion of holding people indefinitely, most without charge.Congress thwarted Obamas effort to close the detention center with restrictions on transfers, including the requirement of a 30-day notice, and a ban on moving detainees to the US for any reason, including trial. The administration launched a case-by-case review process to winnow down the population, moving 193 prisoners to 42 countries for repatriation, resettlement or prosecution.Earnest blamed politics for failing to close the detention center, which he called a waste of money and recruiting tool for terrorists. Members of Congress in both parties, frankly, played with this issue, he said. Human rights groups and others who have called for the closure of the detention center have criticized Obama for not acting forcefully enough to shutter it at the start of his administration.Tom Wilner, a Washington lawyer who helped secure the right of detainees to challenge their detention, hopes Trump will take a fresh look at the situation. I think if he looks at the facts objectively he will really see that Guantanamo really is a bad deal for America, Wilner said. Theres no benefit to it, its grossly expensive and it hurts our reputation.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Virat Kohli scored his 27th ODI century in the first ODI in Pune.Indian skipper Virat Kohli, who has taken his game to another level, has also set new benchmarks for other players in terms of fitness. His ability to steel singles or convert singles into doubles has made the world look in awe for Kohlis endurance. And that led his childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma heap praise for Kohli for his efforts. Rajkumar recollected the days when he use to gorge butter chicken, mutton rolls and all sorts of fast food.In a recent interview with CricketNext, Rajkumar said that while players and experts across the world admire Kohlis fitness regime and work ethics, he just admires the sacrifices that his student has gone through to reach the peak.Sharma said Kohli once told me, if I dont set the benchmark as captain, who else will? Even as the world looks on in wonder, I know the boy behind the man. He used to gorge on butter chicken, rolls and all sorts of fast food. But today, it finds no place in his diet.The Delhi lad has transformed himself to another level where the opponents find it difficult to get rid of the Indian captain.In fact, he is so particular about his diet, that even when he comes over to my place, he wont have packaged fruit juices. You either give him fresh juice or you dont. Carbohydrates are a strict no-no and there are no off days in his routine anymore, Sharma added.The 27-year old cricketer made his international debut in 2008 in the five match ODI series against Sri Lanka.For Rajkumar, more than the fitness regime, it is Kohlis dedication that he sticks to the routine that that makes the coach proud of him. He further added that the sacrifices his student has made at this age is something that even people of his age cant.See, it is easy to do these things for a short or particular span of time. But to make it a constant routine and life style is what makes me proud. It takes a lot of devotion and focus to restructure your lifestyle to this extent. He has cut down on carbs and doesnt even have chapatis. It is either grilled or boiled food for him. Even his coffee is without sugar and definitely no packaged fruit juices for him, he revealed.He also credits other trainers who work with Kohli while on national duty, for his transition to a run-machine.I would be lying if I take all the credit for this. Yes, I did suggest working out for a couple of hours and maintaining discipline, but credit also goes to the trainers in the team as they made him further believe the importance of physical fitness and its direct effect on the game.In the last two or three years, he has taken fitness and his eating habits to a different level. He takes it so seriously that he got a gym built in his new house. He has this belief that fitness is very important if you have to succeed in international cricket. And his only goal in life is to keep raising the bar, he said.Rajkumar shared that discipline is one of the major reasons for the success that the right-handed batsman has achieved. Kohli finished as the top scorer in 2016 with 2580 runs from 40 innings.Talent was never a problem with Kohli, but then, the effect of the gruelling fitness regime is that he has more stamina and can keep picking the singles and doubles and turn the singles into doubles. He doesnt tire down and hence the need to play risky shots go out of the equation. Whatever be his work schedule or travel scene, he always finds time to hit the gym, he signed off.Virat also tops the ICC T20 rankings while he is right behind Australian captain Steve Smith in Test rankings and AB de Villiers in ODI rankings.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Basavaraju of Yelwal said, from the last two months, supply of sugar, grains and kerosene has been stopped. When questioned about it, the authorities claim that kerosene is not provided to those who have LPG connection.

Santosh Singh Purnima Devi, wife of union leader Naresh Srivastava. Santosh SinghBrajesh Baitha, 24, sits on a plastic chair in front of his thatched house with his mother Maya Devi at Bada Bariyarpur village, near Motihari town. The eldest of the four sons of Suraj Baitha, who died after setting himself on fire last month, Brajesh says it may be called suicide but it was still nothing less than murder.His father, 50, and Naresh Srivastava, 49, joint secretary and general secretary respectively of the labour union in the shut Sri Hanuman Sugar Mill of Motihari, had set themselves on fire on April 10. Brajesh says they died because of the callous attitude of the management and lack of intervention by the East Champaran administration.The two had given prior warning about their self-immolation plans to the district administration and marked copies to authorities at 25 levels, from the President of India to the Chhatauni police station in-charge. Over 600 workers had been demanding payment of 133 months salary and reopening of the mill, shut since 2003. It had resumed production at the intervention of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in 2012, only to shut down again only 45 days later.Brajesh, a Class IX dropout, runs a small tent rental to support a family of six. He points at the wooden cot where his father would sit. He would often say, Brajesh recalls, that the sugar mill owed him Rs 22 lakh and Rs 43 crore to about 600 workers.Brajeshs mother Mina Devi said: Workers had drawn their last salary, between Rs 10,000 and Rs 18,000, in 2012 and a one-month advance in Holi that year.The family owns 4,000 sq ft agricultural land. Baithas father had got an Indira Awas Yojana house long ago but that portion of the property went to his brothers. The family got Rs 4.12 lakh as ex gratia for SCs/STs.The police version is that the two union leaders were provoked into suicide. Brajesh denies it and says, I have kept all video recordings of the self-immolation and my fathers interactions during treatment [Baitha had died nine days after the incident].A Patna Medical College and Hospital video shows Baitha saying no one has provoked them. I had written to the administration in 2010 warning of immolation Whatever I have done is my decision. It is the administration that has brought us to thisWe have arrested four mill workers and three social workers for provoking the two union leaders, says East Champaran SP Jitendra Rana. District magistrate Anupam Kumar, who had held a press conference soon after the act of the union leaders, had said the administration had tried to talk to Naresh.Brajesh alleges, We suspect complicity between the district administration and the mill management. Why cant Bihar police get the mill owner from Kolkata to talk to us?A kilometre and a half from Baithas house lives the family of Naresh Srivastava, who had become the face of the workers agitation. Srivastava had written to the DM on March 22 saying they would set themselves on fire anytime after April 9 midnight unless the management and the district administration found a way out of the crisis.He never shared these things with us, says his wife Purnima Devi, a graduate. But since he wrote that letter on his letter-pad, the district administration should have made a preventive arrest of the union leaders. She says her husband could hardly talk after the incident and died the following day. Srivastava, like Baitha, did not blame anyone.Srivastva, second of four brothers, had got his job at the mill on compassionate grounds after the death of his father in 1984. The family, which lives in workers quarters provided by the management, owns four bighas agricultural land at its ancestral village, Mirzapur in Patahi. Two of the brothers are lawyers and one is unemployed. Their mother has been unwell since Nareshs death. She has been getting free medicine at the intervention of a local group supported by former IPS officer P K Siddharth, who has been campaigning with the media and social workers across the country about this ignored incident amid the Bihar governments Champaran centenary celebrations.The Srivastava family does not speak about the police claim that someone had provoked the twin suicides. Purnima says all they want is payment of Nareshs dues and they have no expectations of the government. She alleges that the management has backtracked from its assurances about paying dues even after signing an agreement.Sitting next to a portrait of her bearded husband, she says: It was no less than a satyagraha. My husband fought and lost. The couple have no children.Labour union president Harkhit Baitha says the mill, which is spread over 10 acres, possesses over 300 acres land. This could not be independently verified with the mill shut and its manager arrested. Owner Vimal Nopani has not issued any statement since the self-immolation. It was just about Rs 70 crore in dues, which should not have been a problem for the management of a mill with such huge assets, says the union president.Social activist Swami Agnivesh, chairman of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front, has visited Motihari.

(File photo) Social activist Swami Agnivesh. (File photo)Social activist Swami Agnivesh on Thursday demanded a CBI probe into the death of two sugar mill leaders who allegedly immolated themselves while protesting against non-payment of arrears in Bihars East Champaran district. The Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by Bihar government will not be able to probe the matter in a fair manner as the deaths of two union leaders are a result of the nexus between the mill owner, land mafia, administration and police. Hence, we demand a CBI probe into the incident, Agnivesh said.A five member team headed by Agnivesh, the national president of Bandhua Mukti Morcha, had on May 1 and 2 visited the spot where the two leaders immolated themselves. The team held a public hearing on the incident and prepared an inquiry report. The leaders of Hanuman Sugar Mill in Motihari, Naresh Srivastava and Suraj Baitha had on April 10 immolated themselves while demanding long pending arrears of around 7,000 farmers and 500 labourers.Srivastava had died the next day while Baitha died on April 19 this year at Patna Medical College and Hospital. The inquiry report described police case on the labourers, accusing them of setting the two leaders on fire, as false and baseless.This is an unfortunate incident as it happened on the day of Mahatma Gandhis Champaran Satyagrah centenary celebrations, he said. We had sought time from Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and wanted to submit our report but could not get an appointment due to his busy schedule. We will send our report to the CMs office now, Agnivesh, also a JD(U) member, said.Agnivesh also alleged that the officials misguided the CM by saying that the two leaders were burnt by their fellow labourers, which is contrary to the reality. He said that he has apprised Kumar of his teams report during a telephonic conversation. The CM said that inquiry report should be placed before the SIT. Agnivesh also demanded the arrest of the mill owner Bimal Nopani.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Representational) Our farmers both in the hills and the plains have suffered natural calamities for several years which have hit them hard economically. (Representational)Opposition Congress in Uttarakhand has demanded payment of dues to sugarcane cultivators, loan waiver for farmers of the state on the lines of their Uttar Pradesh counterparts and regularisation of guest teachers. Talking to reporters here PCC president Kishore Upadhyaya said he had written to Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat reminding him of his pre-poll promise of settling the dues of sugarcane farmers within 15 days of coming to power.It is more than a fortnight since he (Rawat) took oath but the promise is yet to be fulfilled. If the government forgets pre-poll promises like his it will be a matter of concern for the people of the state, he said yesterday. Noting that Haridwar and Udhamsingh Nagar are the two districts in the plains where sugarcane growing is prevalent, Upadhyaya said the new season for plantation of the crop has begun but last years arrears had not yet been paid.Terming it a matter of concern, he asked the chief minister to immediately take steps about it. Citing the example of Uttar Pradesh where farmers had been exempted from repaying loans up to Rs 1 lakh recently, the Congress leader said farmers of Uttarakhand should also get a similar waiver.Our farmers both in the hills and the plains have suffered natural calamities for several years which have hit them hard economically. Hence we demand that they should also be exempted from repaying their loans, he said. Upadhyaya said guest teachers had been appointed by the previous government to address the problem of shortage of teachers in schools especially in the remote hill areas.The tenure of their services is over now. But we demand that they should be regularised in view of the fact that their services are still needed, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Farmers with 20-ft tall sugarcane stalks of Co 0238 variety at a field in Bijnor, UP. (Source: Express Photo by Oinam Anand)The story of sugar in the 2016-17 season (October-September) has been about two underestimations. The first has had to do with Maharashtra  not adequately factoring in the impact of the 2015 drought on cane availability for the new season. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), on September 28, projected the states sugar output for 2016-17 at 62.7 lakh tonnes (lt). Actual production turned out to be just 41.87 lt, a steep drop over the 84.15 lt and 105.14 lt for the preceding two seasons, and the lowest since the 22.33 lt of 2004-05.The second underestimation has been with regard to Uttar Pradesh (UP), although here it has worked in the reverse. ISMAs September 28 advance estimates had pegged sugar production this season at 76.60 lt, up from 68.55 lt in 2015-16. But as on April 18, mills in UP had already produced 85.27 lt. With 52 out of the 116 factories still running, the final output could touch 88 lt  an all-time-high, surpassing the previous 2006-07 record of 84.75 lt.Significantly, the above production achievement hasnt come due to any increase in sugarcane area. UPs total area under cane in 2016-17 has, in fact, fallen by almost a quarter compared to 2006-07. Nor has crushing gone up. Mills had till April 18 crushed 805.33 lt of cane and may end up doing about 830 lt. But that would be well below the 894.94 lt crushed in 2006-07.The higher output by mills is only because of average sugar-to-cane recovery going up, from 9.47 per cent in 2006-07 to a likely 10.6 per cent in the current season. That, in turn, owes itself to Co 0238, a cane variety which gives both higher yields to farmers and also more sugar from every tonne crushed by mills.From practically zero till 2012-13, Co 0238 is estimated to have covered 7.29 lakh hectares (lh) or 35.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. Given the higher yields from this variety, its share in overall production and cane crushed by mills will probably exceed 50 per cent, reckons Vipin Kumar Dwivedi, sugarcane development and sugar industry commissioner of UP.My yields were earlier 45 quintals or so per bigha (66 tonnes/hectare). With Co 0238, it is now 55 quintals (80 tonnes/hectare), says Jitender Hooda, who grows cane in six out of his eight-acre holding at Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district/tehsil. Co 0238 is also the main reason for UPs average cane yields rising from hardly 60 tonnes per hectare till only four years ago to 66.5 tonnes in 2015-16. Since Co 0238s share in total area was only 19.6 per cent last season, I expect the average to cross 70 tonnes per hectare in 2016-17, notes Bakshi Ram, director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute at Coimbatore and breeder of the blockbuster variety.For mills, the biggest draw of Co 0238 is its early-maturity character, defined in terms of sucrose accumulation. This happens faster and reaches optimal levels in Co 0238 at least a month earlier than for normal general cane varieties. Mills are, then, able to get high sugar recoveries right from the start of crushing and all through the season. That alone explains the sharp jump in average sugar recovery in UP, from 9.25-9.5 per cent to 10.6 per cent over the last two years.A one percentage point recovery jump translates into 8.3 lt of extra sugar on the 830 lt of cane that UP mills would be crushing this season. At an average realisation of Rs 36 per kg, it works out to nearly Rs 3,000 crore of additional revenue. In the current season, as many as 27 out of the states 116 mills have recorded average recovery of over 11 per cent. That includes the Bundki (12.31 per cent) and Bahadarpur (12.07 per cent) factories of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, followed by Balrampur Chini Mills Kumbhi (11.94 per cent), Uttam Sugar Mills Barkatpur (11.91 per cent) and UP Cooperative Sugar Factories Federations Sneh Road (11.87 per cent) units. Four out of these top five are in Bijnor district and one (Kumbhi) in Lakhimpur Kheri.The benefits to farmers via higher cane yields  an average increase of 10 tonnes means extra income of Rs 31,500 per hectare at the state advised price (SAP) of Rs 315 per quintal for early-maturing varieties  have, however, been partly offset by delayed payments from mills. During this sugar season, mills have until now bought Rs 24,717.74 crore worth of cane at the SAP. Out of this, Rs 23,521.10 crore should have been paid not later than 14 days after cane delivery, as per the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953. But mills have actually paid only Rs 19,258.47 crore, corresponding to Rs 4,262.63 crore of arrears.The ruling BJP, in its UP election manifesto, had promised to ensure farmers received full payment for their cane within 14 days of sale, as provided in the 1953 Act. However, cane arrears, which were around Rs 4,175 crore when the Yogi Adityanath government took over on March 19, have shown no decrease. Much of the current arrears are courtesy a few groups  mainly Bajaj Hindusthan (Rs 2,355.49 crore), U.K. Modi (Rs 412.23 crore), Simbhaoli Sugars (Rs 390.92 crore), Mawana Sugars (Rs 303.25 crore) and Uttam Sugar (Rs 110.44 crore).We have given a deadline of April 23 for all mills to clear their pending dues to growers. Once that ends, a review meeting will be held and we will take appropriate action against the defaulters, UPs sugarcane development and sugar industry minister Suresh Rana told The Indian Express.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59293fdb7be9e0138af8d8d7,Lack of cash clouds Cuba’s green energy outlook,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/lack-of-cash-clouds-cuba-green-energy-outlook-4593688/,2017-03-31,"Cuba, battling a chronic energy deficit, has all the sunshine, wind and sugar to fuel what should be a booming renewables sector  if only it could find the money. The countrys first utility-scale renewable energy project, a biomass plant in Ciro Redondo, is finally under construction thanks to an injection of funds from China, a socialist ally and in recent years, the communist-led islands merchant bank of last resort.Turning Cubas renewables potential into reality has become a state priority over the past year since crisis-stricken ally Venezuela slashed subsidized oil shipments to Cuba that were supposed to help power its traditional plants. Some foreign players in green energy, such as Spains Gamesa and Germanys Siemens, have shown early interest in the country. But the overall paucity of foreign financing means that this project, being carried out by Cuban-British joint venture Biopower, is still the exception rather than the rule.The financing puzzle is a crucial one to solve if cash-strapped Cuba is to hit its target of renewables filling 24 percent of its energy needs by 2030, up from 4 percent today, a strategy that would require billions of dollars in investment. The government announced last July it was rationing energy, raising fears of a return to the crippling blackouts of the Special Period after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The energy shortage comes at a time when growing tourism and private business creation are generating greater demand.The most challenging thing we have had to deal with in the last six years of developing this project has been the financing, said Biopower President Andrew Macdonald, while touring the site of the Ciro Redondo plant. The Scotsman, who has been doing business with Cuba for more than a decade, said the U.S. blockade had strangled funding from Europe and other obvious sources, with banks afraid of sanctions. His start-up Havana Energy joined forces with a subsidiary of domestic sugar monopoly Azcuba to create Biopower in 2012, with a contract to build five plants attached to sugar mills.The plants are projected to use sugar cane byproduct bagasse and fast-growing woody weed marabu as biofuels, costing around $800 million to add some 300 MW to the grid. Biopower was finally able this year to start building the first one, thanks to a decision by Chinas Shanghai Electric Group Ltd to buy an equity stake in Havana Energy. The JV is now looking for external financing for the next four plants. We have to check whether the funders are open for the Cuban market or not, said Zhengyue Chen, former investment manager at Shanghai Electric and current Biopower chief financial officer.RISKY INVESTMENTSome international companies have shown an interest in gaining a foothold in the slowly opening Cuban market, encouraged by a three-year old investment law that allows full foreign ownership of renewables projects. Cuba last year signed a deal with Spains Gamesa for the construction of seven wind-powered plants and with Siemens for the upgrade of the creaking power grid.These are just preliminary agreements, however, which may not become concrete contracts, Western diplomats based in Havana say, given difficulty agreeing on a financing framework and actually securing the funds. On top of the U.S. trade embargo, which frightens banks from offering Cuba loans, Cubas payment capacity is questionable. While it has improved its debt servicing record under President Raul Castro, it is falling behind on paying foreign providers.And it has little to offer as payment guarantees in hard currency. Its state electricity utility generates revenue in Cuban pesos, which are not traded internationally, only into convertible Cuban pesos at a state-fixed rate. The government has promised to unify those two currencies, but it is unclear how. If no currency indexation is provided from the government, significant devaluation poses a great threat to investors revenue, said World Bank renewable energy expert Yao Zhao.Moreover Cuba does not belong to multilateral institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank that could provide external guarantees. In the current conditions, without guarantees or convertibility, it is very difficult to imagine big investment in the renewable energy sector, said one Western diplomat.CHINESE FUNDINGThat is likely to force further reliance on China, already Cubas top creditor in recent years, having offered loans as a way to hike trade with the island. Shanghai Electric is importing and building the Ciro Redondo plant, as well as helping finance it. Project Manager Li Hui, already directing excavators shifting earth on site, said he will stay on after the factory is built as the head of the companys first branch in Cuba.We will hand them over a fully-functioning power plant, he said, adding that Shanghai Electric had to bring over new building equipment because the Cuban ones were antiquated and lacked spare parts. But even Chinese largesse may have its limits. Chen said Biopower was now in discussions with overseas funders, mainly from Europe, and hoped to secure commercial funds for the second plant by the end of this year. Macdonald said he hoped his project would be part of the launch of many foreign participations in the energy sector. But today, we are still pioneers, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Amit Mehra K Vijay Kumar (right) with Deputy Editor Muzamil Jaleel at The Indian Express office. Amit MehraMUZAMIL JALEEL: Former prime minister Manmohan Singh called Naxalism the biggest threat to internal security. How does this government see it?The principal approach has been the same: security and development. And the two go hand-in-hand. Yes, in 2006, Manmohan singh described it as the foremost problem for the country as far as internal security was concerned. However, the situation has been improving. If you need absolute numbers, then from 1,000 killings each year, the figure has come down to 230-140. Significantly, in 2015, the numbers have come down by a further 40 per cent. Forty per cent reduction is generally considered very good development. And if you talk about shrinkage, then from 100 districts (areas affected by Naxalism), it has come down to 15-20. Things are improving, but there could be a few jerks, such as a blast etc. But overall the security force is doing a tremendous, and a rather difficult, job.The ratio since last year has been that we are losing one (of our men) and taking three from their (Naxals) ranks.MANEESH CHHIBBER: When you say that the strike rate is 1:3, how many Naxals have been eliminated in the past one year? Despite the successes, do you see any change in the situation on the ground? Are Naxals attracting less number of people now?(We are losing) less than 60-70 (men) from our side and you can multiply and get the numbers for their side. I may not be very accurate.They are definitely attracting lesser number of people. Recruitment has reduced drastically and, as a result, some of their ranks have been filled in by people from other areas where there is better recruiting soil. Let me put it this way, 80 per cent of the people recruited in Odisha are from other places such as Chhattisgarh, which is a fertile ground (for Naxalism).For the past 24 years, Bastar has been virtually under the control (of Naxals), and it is only in the past five-six years that the government has stepped up its efforts. The problem is like the three walls of a triangle  lack of governance, lack of development and lack of security, military and political All of this creates a vacuum.The terrain in the region is also very challenging. We have not taken over Bastar, but the situation is improving slowly. Bastar is just one of the six or seven affected districts. Some of the worst affected districts are Sukma, Bijapur, Jagdalpur and Kanker. In these areas, the tribal communities also have to be handled delicately, because they have been indoctrinated by these people (Naxals).Efforts by the government have been stepped up. We have a plan to construct 500 km of road, of which 200 km has been completed around the Sukma region. So things are happening, but they cannot happen at a pace that you and I would like it to happen. Counter-insurgency cannot be a sugarcoated pill dumped down their throats. Things are proceeding at a pace, and the situation is getting better.RAHUL TRIPATHI: You have been on ground zero. What went wrong during the March 11 incident, when 12 CRPF personnel were killed and two injured, in an ambush in the Bhejji area of Sukma district?See there is a procedure for an inquiry  part 1 and part 2. Part 1 is simply about the number of people who have died It is a very crisp and condensed form of looking at the situation. That part is now over. Part 2 is more detailed  whether the incident happened because of omission or commission, whether something which was not supposed to be done was done. All these angles are being looked into.Two patrols, each with 60-70 men, were moving on either side of the road. They were going into an area where a road is being planned. The idea was to open up the area. Now, from their (Naxals) point of view, you are entering their bedroom. Each patrol had been broken down into three smaller patrols, and there was a gap between them. One of the platoons got hit, and some of them started taking cover in the trees. In some previous instances, Naxals have planted explosives in areas where people would normally take cover. But it would be very harsh on my part to say you shouldnt have taken cover. It all depends on the local situation.In this case (Sukma), the captains there, they decided to take cover, and that is where they lost an inspector. They took cover and blast happened in two or three places. The blasts, however, were not so severe as to kill you immediately, but enough to incapacitate you. My guess is that the Naxals wanted to take their (the security forces) weapons. That is what they did.I think we probably would have done better if we had more canine elements, because they can sense strangers from a 100 yards. Having them as part of our advance team would have helped.DEEPTIMAN TIWARY: The two-pronged approach to dealing with Naxalism  development and security  has, over the years, become a kind of chicken and egg situation. How do you find a balance between the two? The government says there can be administration in a region only when it is free from Naxals, whereas the forces say that area domination can happen only if there is some semblance of administration.Area domination is a bad word actually What we need is a combination of all these elements. We need to show the flag and say the government of India is here, the government of Chhattisgarh is here, we are around, in case you want to come to us. We need to show them our faces. But then again in showing our faces, there is always a threat. Hundred people go and come back, and four people can sit on a hilltop and disrupt the exercise by just shooting at you.We need a balance of all this  a bit of long-range patrol, a bit of deep penetrative night movement etc.The second point is about development. Just because we are not there, that is no excuse to indefinitely keep this area in a vacuum. The best way to fill that vacuum, which is also the internationally accepted way, is to enable the boots, that is chaps like me, who can carry along with them a bit of government. Then there can be a village chief, a ration shop guy, a paramedic, a teacher I give these people space in my camp. It is called integrative development centre (IDC). This is being done by the government. The idea has been tried elsewhere, but I would say that we need to do much more of IDC.Security forces should never be alone for a long time. What do we do? We go on cleaning up, and we have nothing more to offer, except cleaning up. This cleaning up is very clinical, it looks very good, but it doesnt have an impact. The impact comes when security, development, governance, all are incorporated. You need an ability to linguistically connect with them, culturally respect them, and make them part of the project. Counter-insurgency is a very, very difficult, complex thing. Handling insurgency is basically a messy affair, and you can only make it less messy from what it already is.KRISHN KAUSHIK: In the past one year there have been allegations of excesses against security forces, including those of gangrape. Fact- finding missions and researchers, such as Bela Bhatia, visiting the region have been threatened or hounded out. There is an increasing perception that the government wants to create an information vacuum in Bastar.I have said this over and over again, there are good NGOs, neutral NGOs and then there are not-so-good NGOs. Do we want to embrace them? Yes. We dont see them as enemies. The problem is that there are extremists on both sides. The NGO extremists and the other kind, who are within our forces. Personally, I can say that if there is a good cop and a good NGO, the partnership would be absolutely fine.Now, Veerappan cannot be compared to the Maoists, but he used guerrilla tactics. At one point, the public had tilted towards him, and we had to win them over I see many commonalities. One of the things we faced the most then was that the Special Task Force (STF, which nabbed Veerappan) faced several charges, including that of rape, rioting, arson, loot you name it. Most heinous sections of the IPC were thrust on them and they had to face inquiries. What happened in the inquiry was that apples and oranges got mixed up, asses and horses were lumped together and the good, bad and ugly had to be merged for the identification parade.So, people stood there in a line and the so called victims would come and say, No, this man didnt rape me. Now, imagine the trauma of the man standing there, who has been put through this just because he is wearing a uniform. So, I think, there needs to be a balance. Since Im not privy to all the facts, I cannot say anything. But yes, it is unfair to throw out a good NGO. Let them do their work.KRISHN KAUSHIK: But who defines what is a good NGO and a not-so-good one?That is a very difficult debate. NGOs have good intentions. Where the government cannot penetrate into, an NGO should, and hence they get together for a common cause. Im only talking about those who, in the guise of an NGO, have a private agenda. They then try and justify negative things, including the killing of policemen. Thats unacceptable. Then there are some balanced people as well who are condemning violence by the police, State etc. And theres this third kind of NGO, that may be accused of being planted by the government, that only says good things and talks rubbish about the other guy. Thats what I meant. I didnt mean to generalise.MUZAMIL JALEEL: Which other states, besides Chhattisgarh, contribute to the Maoist problem?Im focusing on Chhattisgarh, but besides it, Odisha, Jharkhand are the two states which contribute the maximum to the LWE (Left Wing Extremism) problem. Also, the Bihar-Jharkhand border. West Bengal was one of the worst states, but things changed dramatically since the removal of Kishenji (The Maoist leader was killed in 2011).MUZAMIL JALEEL: There was some talk of recruiting Kashmiri militants who have surrendered and posting them to Chhattisgarh, and vice versa for tribals who have surrendered in Chhattisgarh. Is there such a policy?There is a two-pronged policy. One is to use their (men who surrender) terrain knowledge, language abilities and cultural affinity in the same area, because it serves as a value addition to our operations, like in the case of the Ladakh Scouts in the Army. The second is to integrate them into national forces such as the CRPF and BSF. Once they are in, unless there is a commitment that they will work in the same state, it is understood that they will work anywhere. There are many Kashmiris working in West Bengal and the Northeast. It is not a deliberate policy to export. It is a national policy of deployment.MUZAMIL JALEEL: There are conflicting views on the use of pellet guns. What is your position on it?See any gun is not good. It is a violent instrument. It has been authorised by law for some agencies to put out violence. Now the pellet gun comes in different sizes. To hit a pigeon, you use a pellet gun of size 1. The smaller the number of the pellet, the bigger the size. Number 8 means it is a very small pellet. Pellet Number 1 is bigger. The pellet gun is considered sub-lethal, a lesser evil, vis-a-vis a 7.52 gun and an AK-47.Also, the man using it is not a sniper. He is a constable, who is on the move. Everything is dynamic. Now if the pellet gun hits your feet, then its job is done. But if it has caught you somewhere else, it is very bad then. I am only trying to explain the ballistic angle of it, and on why the decision to use it was made. It was not made whimsically. There was a rationale behind it, but the consequences have been quite different from what was expected. There could have been many reasons for it. In a crowd, where this man (a security force personnel) is moving and retreating, the shot may not be accurate. Now to immediately condemn everybody as untrained is incorrect. There needs to be a balance.So, I am asking for two contrarian things. I am asking for a gun which can be non-lethal and effective at the same time. Also, if the crowd is aware that it is not going to be lethal, then what kind of mob dispersal will there be? I am not talking about Kashmir per se, I am talking about general mechanics of crowd handling, and the philosophy of mob dispersal.VANDITA MISHRA: But pellet guns are not used outside Kashmir?No, no. That is not a correct perception at all. Pellet guns, in terms of intensity, over a period of time have been used in Kashmir. But they have been used elsewhere also.I have used them myself in Madurai and other places as well. It is not as if pellet guns were not there, but we did not have enough of them.Pellet guns were chosen in the hope that they will be less dangerous, and there will be lesser casualties. We need to refine it further and look at what is being used in other countries. We need to see what better things make mobs disperse in a better manner in other countries. Also, mob behaviour is different in different countries, and we need to take that into account as well.AMRITH LAL: There have been reports of Maoist sightings in the trijunction of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. Is there a presence?Any trijunction is a beautiful halt and residence for these people, because typically the presence of a government ends a little away from this belt. Life is tough there, its not a picnic. But these guys find a way to survive because they are resolute. They have a cause, an ideology and they want to fight for it. They are fighters when you push them.The trijunction has been a potential area for them for the past 10 years. Now that they are feeling the pressure in Bastar, they want a new sanctuary. The geography of the trijunction region is favourable for them.MUZAMIL JALEEL: What is your view on the JNU controversy and students being charged with sedition?I would not like to comment on it because I dont know much about the case.DEEPTIMAN TIWARY: In Andhra Pradesh, the situation was as bad as it is now in Chhattisgarh. What did Andhra do that Chhattisgarh did not?It is very unfair to compare the two. In Andhra, they had certain integrated development actions. Chhattisgarh is doing that as well. What Andhra did in 2001, Chhattisgarh is actually repeating it now.MUZAMIL JALEEL: You were in Kashmir in 1998, leading the 49 battalion of the BSF. If you look at Kashmir now, it is in the same place where it was then.I would not like to slip into that area. I had a good stint in Kashmir. We had a huge force then and it was a challenging time.

The High Court was hearing a revision petition filed by the driver who had challenged the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge that convicted him for rash and negligent driving and causing death by such an act. The incident took place in Vategaon village in Sangli. The accused was arrested on January 17, 2011, two days after the accident.The 5-year-old girl and her mother were on the left side of the road when a tankercoming from a sugarcane factory hit the child. The girl died on the spot. It was incumbent on the part of the driver of the tanker to take care as is expected from a prudent person while driving such a heavy vehicle. If he fails to take such care then he becomes guilty of a rash and negligent act, said Justice A M Badar.Negligence is breach of duty or lack of proper care in doing something. The road was not wide enough and was infested with potholes. It becomes the duty of the driver of the heavy vehicle, particularly when proceeding towards Vategaon village, to drive it slowly and carefully, he said. The court added: The impact of the accident on the minor female child can be seen from the spot panchnama. This evidence unerringly pointed out to the rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of the tanker.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Reuters PhotoIslamabad had been abuzz with nervous excitement as the Pakistani Supreme Court ordered a JIT probe of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs family in relation to corruption allegations that came to fore from the Panama Papers which implicated three out of four children of Sharif, including his daughter and presumptive political heir Maryam Safdar.The focus of this particular SC probe had been the Sharif family properties based in London, purchased through these offshore firms. Sharif and family have denied any wrongdoing and have dismissed the claims as being politically motivated, even as controversy has long surrounded this industrial family  known to be one of Pakistans richest. Their businesses have included steel, sugar and paper mills, along with extensive holdings outside Pakistan and they have been accused over time of corruption, ownership of illegal properties, tax avoidance and money laundering.

The Opposition party also alleged that he was taking anti-people decisions through the backdoor only to benefit private individuals and dubbed his government as Government of India Private Limited. He also said that the bias against the poor and the middle class is evident in the policies of this government which is privatising health, education and stopping HIV medicines for chidren in a conspiracy against the country. Amit Shah ji has told all the party MPs of Uttar Pradesh that if they get less than 2-3 seats, they will be held accountable and action will be taken against them.Watch What Else Is Making NewsSo, I believe the prime minister has also been told the same thing and he is responding to Amit Shah jis threat. He is also scared that he may not win those 2-3 seats from his own constituency, party spokesperson Ajoy Kumar told reporters when asked if there was a leadership deficit in the BJP as Modi was camping in Varanasi for days together.Modi ji is scared of Amit Shahs statement and is trying to save his pride by camping there, he said. He cited four recent announcements to accuse Modi of backstabbing and betrayal of countrys common people as such decisions are taken through backdoor in the din of electioneering.In this election season, where people are watching his blitz Modi ji is taking anti-people decisions through back door!. Modi jis new slogan is cashless cashless japna, janta ka paisa apna, he said.

Pointing out the waiving Rs 1200 crore worth of loans to Vijay Mallya, who is absconding, he said on the one hand Modi is spreading the red carpet for the likes of Mallya and on the other, banks are levying transaction charges.He said the IRDA, which is a regulatory authority for insurance, has increased motor premium of third party insurance of vehicles from 40 per cent to 101 in two years.Kumar also cited the steepest hike in LPG rates and doing away of Rs 4,500 crore subsidy on sugar provided to the poor through PDS network as the two other anti-people decisions taken in the recent past in the din of electioneering.

59294a157be9e0138af8dc77,Ludhiana: Watermelon growers hit hard by high seed prices,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/ludhiana-watermelon-growers-hit-hard-by-high-seed-prices-4562856/,2017-03-09,"Watermelon growers, Punjab Watermelon growers, watermelon seed price, Watermelon growers hit hard, Punjab watermelons, indian express news Watermelon growers, Punjab Watermelon growers, watermelon seed price, Watermelon growers hit hard, Punjab watermelons, indian express newsALREADY FACING a potato glut, farmers in Punjab have been hit further by skyrocketing prices of hybrid seeds of watermelons and muskmelons. Before the onset of the paddy season, farmers in some pockets of Punjab prefer growing watermelon and muskmelon from March to May. With the state-owned Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) not producing any hybrid seeds of watermelons, the farmers are solely dependent on private companies, which are selling seeds ranging from Rs 20,000 per kg to Rs 70,000 per kg depending on the variety. Even the seeds of PAUs non-hybrid watermelon variety, Sugar Baby, are not available for sale at its seed shop on the university campus. When The Indian Express visited the PAU seed shop to buy the watermelon seed, the staff deployed at the shop said, Seeds are currently unavailable, although the sowing season has already begun.What else is making news:The state agriculture department has no control over the seed prices of private companies, which enjoy monopoly in hybrid seed sale. Speaking to The Indian Express, Maheshinder Singh, a potato farmer who has started cultivation of watermelon this season after suffering losses in potato crop, said, I have purchased the hybrid watermelon seed for Rs 50,000/kg manufactured by a Bengaluru-based company. The government is not taking any step to check how private companies are looting farmers in selling hybrid seeds. After potato glut, I decided to sow watermelon before paddy to tide over the potato loss to some extent but even melon seeds are so expensive.Watermelon is mostly grown in the Doaba belt of the state with Kapurthala, Nakodar, Shahkot, Jalandhar pockets being dotted with most of the farms. Some pockets are also there in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and villages near Sutlej banks. With warm weather required for watermelon cultivation coming early in southern parts of the country, the fruit from Karnataka and other southern states also enter the markets of Punjab before farmers here can harvest.Watermelons from Bengaluru and Chennai are already available at shops in Punjab. In fact, they are available round the year now. So, farmers in Punjab are losing interest in watermelons. Seeds are too expensive and then, at mandis, non-hybrid varieties fetch Rs 5 per kg or even less only in peak summers, said Gurpreet Singh, another farmer from Amloh. The hybrid varieties still fetch Rs 50-15/kg for farmers at mandis, Rs 15 being the closing rate at the end of the season. Dilbag Singh, senior scientist, PAU vegetable department, said, PAU is working to develop hybrid variety seeds but it will still take a few years for seeds to reach farmers. Our non-hybrid variety Sugar Baby seeds cost Rs 300-400 per kg only. Since private companies have monopoly on hybrid as of now, their prices are skyrocketing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A team of six students from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, proposes a solution: adopt an effective channel irrigation method. The team MI6 has considered the water-guzzling crop of sugarcane as a sample to prove the efficiency of their model.The team, which has also proposed that the state government provide certified water-efficiency ratings to all sugar mills, is one of the 220 finalists in the Transform Maharashtra competition.The competition Transform Maharashtra: Platform for Youth to Create a Roadmap of Developed Maharashtra by 2025 makes sure that policymaking and governance for students is not limited to dialogues and proposals that seldom see the light of the day. Winners of the competition will get to see their proposal implemented as a policy or a state-sponsored programme.The winners will be selected based on the popularity of the idea depending on the number of votes the idea receives. Another set of winners will be chosen by a panel of judges. Students from across the state sent proposals under the 11 themes specified under the competition.MI6s model has made it to the top 20 under the Jai Kisan: Drought-free Maharashtra theme. Our model aims at solutions for drought, one of the biggest challenges for Maharashtra, said Udyut Goyal, a fourth-year civil engineering student from IIT-B. By using the effective channel irrigation method, the farmers can optimise the use of available water and eliminate wastage, said Goyal, adding that the model is designed to improve the efficiency of farmers as well as reduce wastage of water in sugar mills.The IIT-B teams idea seemed popular as it was one of the most voted ideas under the theme. Team Parivartan, from the College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, was leading the chart under the theme Moulding the future: Reforming Rural Education.The model proposed by the team will help the government reduce the dropouts rate in schools and bridge the gap between education and employment. We have proposed that eight adults be selected from each village for a centralised training. They will then teach students in schools, said Sarah Husain, one of the team members.These are free vocational courses for students between classes VIII and X. The courses can be helpful for students to get jobs after they pass out. They will also be an incentive for students to attend classes, said Husain, who added that the vocational courses will be specific to the geographical locations of the schools. A compulsory class in puberty is also a part of the model which can be scaled up to be linked with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.A team from Institute of Chemical Technology has proposed a model to improve the transport facilities in the state. Kalyani Chavali, a member of team Aryabhatt, said that the team studied various transportation models in the state and designed a strategy to make the state transport system more reliable and efficient.The online voting, which began on March 21, closes on March 31.

This was stated in an analysis report on recent changing trends in Indian monsoon over Maharashtra. The report was presented as part of the annual monsoon 2016 workshop organised by the India Meteorological Society (Pune branch) in the city on Wednesday. The areas affected include districts in north Madhya Maharashtra  Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon and some parts of Ahmednagar.The average annual rainfall, which is largely a well distributed one, received during the four months over north Maharashtra ranges anywhere between 700 mm and 1,200 mm. However , current rainfall figures are indicating a downward trend in this annual average rainfall.About 3,000 hectare of area is primarily being used to cultivate fruits and vegetables. This area is also major cultivator of grapes and onions in the country. Apart from these, there is sizeable cultivation of tur, gram, jamun, bajra, rice, jowar and sugarcane.The agriculture ministry identifies this region as Western Ghat zone, under which 25 per cent of the total area is covered by forest.This region receives rain primarily from the south-west monsoon, that is during June and September, from the various systems formed in the Arabian Sea. However, off late, it has been found that these rain-bearing systems are phasing out ahead of reaching northern Maharashtra.A a result, these regions are sometimes deprived of even the normal rainfall during monsoon, said Subhangi Bhute, an IMD official from Mumbai.Subsequently, the systems instead benefit Konkan and southern districts like Pune, Satara, Raighad and Ratnagiri in the process. Monsoon onset and its progress is crucial until it passes through Maharashtra, stated Bhute.According to another IMD scientist and agriculture meteorologist R Balasubramanian, June and July are crucial months as that is the period when sowing of Kharif crops has to be undertaken.  Until mid-July, there must be good rains inorder to achieve good crop yield during Kharif Season, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The beachside of a sleepy town called Marve is an hours drive from Malad city  a long winding route through kuccha roads punctuated by the overwhelming smell of freshly caught fish. Shahrukh, Amitabh and Salman, all of them have houses here, claimed an auto rickshaw driver as he navigated through a road dotted with villas, many of them with display boards announcing their availability as shoot locations.Shooting of serials take place here. Have you heard of Ice Factory? Crime Patrol and Savdhaan India are shot there, the driver added. Marve beach does not have an endless expanse of sand unlike the the popular seasides elsewhere in the city and significant portion of the area is cordoned off by barbed wires with a board stating that it belongs to the defence ministry.From the seafront one can see a green shore line and the golden dome of the Global Vipassana Pagoda, a meditation centre in Gorai. Everyday, people from the fishing community, tourists and vegetable vendors line up to occupy boats anchored along the beach. The place has a jetty and boat services to Manori or Gorai.The crowd here is a mix of locals and tourists. Since the exam season is on, families dont visit all that much, a hawker said. Marves small beach has a number of stalls selling light snacks and cold drinks that cater for local and tourists.They charged Rs 1300 for 1 kg of prawns, said a shocked Juhu resident Renuka while her little daughter took a horseride.Rs 50 for one round, said the horses young caretaker.

5929d0967be9e0138af8ee11,Post Poll: A sweetener for sugar,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/post-poll-a-sweetener-for-sugar-mill-sugarcane-farmer-uttar-pradesh-bjp-4570762/,2017-03-15,"The Upper Doab Sugar Mills factory at Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. Praveen Khanna The Upper Doab Sugar Mills factory at Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. Praveen KhannaThe same party ruling at the Centre, and now the state, has given a ray of hope to Uttar Pradeshs (UPs) 116 operational sugar mills as well as 25 lakh-odd cane growers, just emerging out of three consecutive bad seasons. With sugar prices improving  ex-factory realisations are currently around Rs 36.50 a kg, compared with the average Rs 31.74 and Rs 25.64 for the 2015-16 and 2014-15 seasons (October-September), respectively, and the lows of Rs 22.54 touched in July 2015  and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in power both in New Delhi and Lucknow, there is renewed optimism over the fortunes of a hitherto troubled industry.Whats more, UP this season will overtake Maharashtra as the countrys leading sugar producer. Its mills have produced 69.12 lakh tonnes (lt) as on March 14, and with crushing to continue beyond mid-April, output could cross 85 lt out of Indias likely 200 lt or so in the 2016-17 season. While 100 out of UPs 116 mills are still running, 148 out of the 150 factories in Maharashtra have already shut for lack of cane and production may dip below 42 lt, from 84.15 lt in 2015-16 and 105.14 lt in 2014-15.Theres no better time to reform UPs sugar sector than now, when things are looking good. The focus should be on cane pricing reform and ending the problem of payment arrears to farmers once and for all. This can happen by linking cane prices to sugar realisations, based on the C Rangarajan Committees report, said Ajit S Shriram, joint managing director of DCM Shriram Ltd, which has three mills in Hardoi and one at Lakhimpur Kheri district.The committee under the chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council in the previous United Progressive Alliance regime had recommended a value-sharing formula, wherein the cane price payable would be 75 per cent of the average ex-factory realisations on sugar. At Rs 3,650 per quintal, the cane price as per the Rangarajan formula works out to roughly Rs 274 per quintal, higher than the Centres fair and remunerative rate of Rs 254.2 per quintal taking UPs average sugar recovery from cane at 10.5 per cent. But it is below the UP governments state advised price (SAP) of Rs 305 for general and Rs 315 for early-maturing cane varieties.Ideally, sugar realisations should be Rs 4,000-plus to enable us pay the SAP. They must be allowed to go to those levels, as this is an industry, unlike fruits or vegetables, where farmers get a fair share of the consumer price. Also, if people can fork out Rs 52 per litre on 30 litres of milk per month, why cannot they pay the same rate for just 5 kg of sugar? Shriram pointed out. However, farmer leader and convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, opposed the Rangarajan formulas adoption. If millers want the sugar price to be a mark-up over cane cost, the same principle should apply to farmers as well. After all, we also incur costs on diesel, labour and other inputs. Shouldnt these be factored into our cane price, too? he asked. The Rangarajan formula can work in Maharashtra, where sugar recovery averaged 11.3-11.4 per cent and cane yields were also higher. Moreover, in Maharashtra, cane harvesting and transportation costs, which come to Rs 50-55 per quintal, are borne by the factories. In UP, the farmer pays for these, Singh added.Both Shriram and Singh were agreed on one thing, though: A BJP government both at the Centre and in UP offers a golden opportunity to resolve the endemic problem of cane arrears. In the ongoing 2016-17 season, UP mills have so far bought cane worth Rs 20,473.51 crore at the SAP. While Rs 18,264.20 crore of this was payable not later than 14 days after delivery, they have only paid Rs 14,345.12 crore. That translates into arrears of Rs 3,919.08 crore, over and above dues of Rs 255.22 crore and Rs 44.75 crore for the previous two seasons. Although some groups  DCM Shriram, Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering, Dhampur Sugar, Dalmia Bharat and Dwarikesh Sugar Industries  have no cane dues, this isnt the case with most others.Significantly, the BJP, in its 2017 UP election manifesto, has promised that its government will ensure farmers get full payment for their cane within 14 days of sale. This provision already exists in the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act of 1953. If the promise signals an intent to implement the law, we welcome it, stated Singh. His organisation won a major victory when the Allahabad High Court, on March 9, set aside the last Samajwadi Party governments decision to waive the interest on delayed cane payments by UP sugar mills for the 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons. While section 17(3) of the 1953 Act does give the state government the power to waive interest, the court, however, ruled that the relevant Cabinet decisions  in May 2015 and October 2016, involving a total amount of over Rs 2,000 crore  were totally lop sided/one way and taken with no application of mind. Interest on delayed payments, it held, was a substantive right and not a bounty to growers. That being so, the power of waiver could be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and not in a routine manner, as the UP government had seemingly done.The state government waived the interest, citing mills inability to pay in view of low sugar prices. But by that logic, shouldnt the interest being paid by farmers on loans from state-owned and cooperative banks also have been waived? In this case, farmers were basically supplying cane to mill at zero interest, even while borrowing at 10-15 per cent or more themselves, noted Singh. The BJP UP manifesto, incidentally, has also talked of waiving crop loans for all small and marginal farmers. According to Singh, the Allahabad High Court order will strengthen the new governments hand to effectively enforce the 1953 Act. If mills dont pay within the stipulated 14-day period, they will have to shell out interest. And that should be deterrent enough, he claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
