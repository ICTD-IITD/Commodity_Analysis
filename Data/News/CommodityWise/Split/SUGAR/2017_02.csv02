(File Photo) Ram Vilas Paswan. (File Photo)Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday ruled out bringing a separate legislation to regulate sale of packaged water and soft drinks above MRP (maximum retail price), saying the existing law has provisions to curb this unfair trade practice. To strengthen legal metrology enforcement, Paswan said it has been decided to provide technological support to states to prevent unfair trade practices in weights and measurements, set up a facility in gram panchayats where people can crosscheck the quality of weighing instruments besides mobile vans with labs to reach out to remote areas.MRP of products is fixed by private firms. But there have been complaints of charging more than MRP and declaring dual MRP. Recently, consumer court NCDRC had imposed a penalty on a multiplex for selling water above MRP. There is no need to have a new law to regulate MRP. The existing Act is sufficient and we have enough powers to take action against violators, Paswan told reporters after the national consultative meeting on legal metrology in New Delhi.The state governments have been asked to be more vigilant and take prompt action against violators. They have also been asked to create consumer awareness, he said. Besides the MRP issue, Paswan expressed concern over inaccuracy in critical instruments like thermometer and sugar testing devices used in daily life.Wrong and imprecise measurement builds mistrust and is often a source of safety hazard There are doubts expressed sometimes regarding the accuracy of petrol pumps, and weighing machines used in agricultural mandis, he said. In the wake of growing trade and commerce, Paswan said there should be more efforts to build consumer confidence in the system and stop manufacturers from indulging in unfair practices and pushing sub-standard products in the market.Issues of legal, administrative, operational challenges were discussed at the national consultation meeting and a strategy for a more coordinated and focused approach for the future was agreed upon. It was decided to give awards to three states for best legal metrology administration, earmark funds for creating consumer awareness programme and set up national and regional museums on legal metrology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) Sudhir Mungantiwar and Deepak Kesarkar ahead of Maharashtra Budget. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)The Maharashtra Government on Saturday proposed to raise tax on liquor and lottery while earmarking Rs 8,233 crore for irrigation projects in its budget for 2017-18 with an estimated revenue deficit of Rs 4,511 crore. Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar presented his third straight budget, which he described as agriculture-centric, in the assembly amid vociferous demand by the Opposition for a farm loan waiver.He said the BJP-led government has taken a major decision to merge plan and non-plan expenditure from 2017-18. The focus will now be on capital expenditure. This change will allow each department to use the entire fund allocated to it effectively instead of only the plan component which is 25 per cent of the total budget size, he said.After the merger, the concept of plan outlay will cease to exist, said the finance minister and added: A sum of Rs 77,184 crore has been earmarked for various schemes. He said in FY18, the revenue receipt is estimated at Rs 2,43,737 crore and revenue expenditure at Rs 2,48,242 crore. Consequently, there will be a revenue deficit worth Rs 4,511-crore.Mungantiwar said the government will try to reduce the deficit by cutting down avoidable expenditure and ensuring effective revenue recoveries. He proposed to increase the value-added tax (VAT) from 23.08 per cent to 25.93 per cent on the maximum retail price of the foreign liquor, the IMFL and the country liquor.Mungantiwar also proposed to raise tax on weekly lottery from Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The tax proposals are expected to result in additional gain of Rs 396 crore. Describing the budget as agriculture-centric, the minister said a provision of Rs 8,233-crore has been made for various irrigation projects.He earmarked Rs 100 crore for micro-irrigation projects in Yavatmal and Wardha districts which will be completed using Israeli technology. Mungantiwar said the government proposes to double the farm income by 2021. To achieve this, it has decided to focus on irrigation, electricity, farm ponds, food processing, technology, marketing, group farming and agriculture credit.The farm loan waiver issue, which has been dominating the proceedings ever since the budget session began last week, again hogged the limelight. Opposition members, including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil (Congress), former finance ministers Ajit Pawar and Jayant Patil (both NCP), were on their feet seeking relief for cultivators in form of a debt waiver. The members displayed banners, played cymbals and made loud noises as the minister read out his speech.Outlining tax concessions, Mungantiwar said in order to provide fair and remunerative price to sugarcane farmers, they will be exempted from purchase tax in 2017-18. Tax concessions on essential commodities like rice, wheat, pulses and their flour, turmeric, chilly, tamarind, jaggery, coconut, coriander seeds, fenugreek, parsley, papad, wet dates, solapuri chadars and towels will continue till the introduction of GST, expected to come into force from July 1.He proposed tax exemption of 6 per cent on geomembrane (plastic lining) used for water harvesting and storage, and lowered tax on aviation turbine fuel from 5 per cent to 1 per cent for a period of 10 years. VAT of 13.5 per cent has been exempted for soil and milk testing kits, card swipe machines, gas and electric incinerators.He said the state was ready for implementation of GST. For compensation post the new tax regime, annual growth rate of 14 per cent on revenue for 2015-16 shall be considered. Compensation amount shall include octroi in Mumbai and the local body tax, Mungantiwar said and announced setting up of three new benches of Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal.Asserting the government is committed to make farmers debt-free, Mungantiwar said at present 31.57 lakh cultivators, out of the total 1.36 crore, are indebted. The debt-ridden farmers face the risk of going out of the ambit of institutional credit. If farmers are to get crop loan, it is necessary for them to repay debts, he said.It is estimated that total institutional indebtedness is Rs 30,500 crore. The government has increased investment in the agriculture sector to help farmers come out of debt trap, Mungantiwar said. If the huge collective indebtedness is written off, it will have an adverse impact on investment in the sector, the finance minister maintained.There is no guarantee farmers will be perennially out of debt if a waiver is announced. On the loan issue, the state has sought assistance from the Centre, he said. We want to make it clear the state will give support and co-operation for any effort by the Centre to reduce farmer debt.A substantial provision of Rs 979 crore has been made in the budget for electrification of agriculture pumps and to clear backlog in eastern Vidarbha. An amount of Rs 125 crore has been allocated under the Punjabrao Deshmukh interest subsidy scheme. The government proposes to take steps to enable farmers to get remunerative prices for their produce and double their income, he said.These steps include providing godowns, strengthening competition through direct marketing of products and establish agro-marketing hubs. Mungantiwar proposed a scheme to provide refrigerated vans to facilitate faster movement of farm products. Adequate funds will be made available for the scheme.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Reflecting on the complexities of the agrarian crisis and challenges confronting the government, he said it is time to switch over to scientific farming.Water management expert Dr Madhav Chitale believes a loan waiver is not a solution to agrarian crisis. He says suchpopulist measures often pitched by politicians never serve the larger objective of farmer welfare. If any government is attempting such a decision, it can be best described as tatpurta malam patti (temporary ointment and bandage to cover a wound, says Chitale.The former chairman of the special investigation team (SIT) formed to look into the multi-crore irrigation scam and evolve guidelines for the irrigation sector says: If we look at the global agriculture scenario, nowhere do we find this short-term approach towards tackling farm crisis. As such decisions taken due to political pressure do not bring long term results for farmers.Reflecting on the complexities of the agrarian crisis and challenges confronting the government, he said it is time to switch over to scientific farming.Every district will have its geographical and climatic conditions, which have to be factored to decide crop pattern. We have to adopt to new challenges of climatic changes coupled with our dependence on rain-fed agriculture, says Chitale.Citing the example of Japan, Europe and other nations, he says: They are not dependent on rain. They have put in place mechanism to hold sufficient water to cater to their 12 months agriculture activities through new innovations and technology.Chitale, who had recommended 42 measures to increase the states irrigation potential that has remained stagnant at 18 per cent, said the government should invest in infrastructure for the agriculture sector to help double production. He says emphasis should be on organised farming. Sugarcane is the only cash crop that is a highly organised sector. It works on certain economics that brings better remuneration to farmers. Similar organised farming should be for all crops. Fruits and vegetables should be tied to markets and food processing units in every taluka or district. This will bring assured income, says Chitale.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, after taking charge in 2014, had enforced all 42 recommendations of the Chitale committee. Of these, 22 have been implemented.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo/File) Sugarcane fields. (Source: Express photo/File)The 2016-17 sugarcane crushing season has clocked four years high in terms of average fair and remunerative price (FRP) paid by sugar millers to growers. While the payment received by farmers might appear to be record high, decrease in yield and lesser crops have not resulted in any windfall gains to the farmers.Starting under the pall of the last years drought Maharashtra had seen only 6,33 lakh hectare of farmland under sugarcane and the expected yield was around 429.55 lakh tonne. Based on payment done till now, the average price paid per tonne of cane by millers works out to be around Rs 2,382. Mills in Western Maharashtra have led in excess payment with many mills paying Rs 400-500 in excess of the FRP to attract growers. Even the cane-parched Marathwada mills have paid excess to attract growers. Till Tuesday, only 2 of the 150 mills, which had taken season, are operational in Maharashtra with the state recording production of 41.62 lakh tonne of sugar.Compared to this years payment, millers had paid Rs 2,100, Rs 1,971 and Rs 1,942 as average FRP per tonne for the seasons of 2015-16, 2014-15 and 2013-14 respectively. The average payments in these years was in tandem with acreage and production figures of those years. Seasons of the 2014-15 and 15-16 has seen mills failing to pay growers and running into arrears. For both the seasons, the sugar commissioners office had to order for auction of sugar stock of errant millers to recover dues. This season as against the total dues of Rs 7,970.68 crore, mills have totalled payment to the tune of Rs 8,323.84 crore- but failure of some of the mills to complete payment has led to arrears of Rs 181.54 crore.Figures might point to bumper payment to growers but farmers say their profitability has been hit this year. Prahlad Ingole, Nanded district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana said growers had to face double trouble to save their crop. Ingole said farmers had to spend excess to arrange for water and in many cases the mills have tampered with the FRP payment system to show lower values before paying excess.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express photo Sunita and Ashok begin their day around 10 am, when the sugarcane is delivered to them from the nearby APMC market. Express photoTHE SOUND of ghungroos associated with sugarcane juice stalls in the city is missing from these hand-pulled carts. A common sight in the suburbs of Navi Mumbai and Thane, however, is a steady crowd around the carts, seeking a quick respite from the heat by guzzling sugarcane juice on street corners. The people operating these carts are mostly farmers from rural Maharashtra. Competing with sugarcane juice stalls, pulling along the hand-cart business is a tough task.Sunita and Ashok Andhale, a farmer couple from Ahmednagar, have come to Navi Mumbai for the first time this year. The two work as labourers in farms to cut sugarcane back home. With not much work between October and May, the couple decided to come to the big city this time, like others from their village have before this. The two first bought a cart built in a workshop in Ahmednagar from money got by selling their cattle. They then hired a tempo and brought the cart to Navi Mumbai. The first few days they observed other carts, before setting out to assemble their own.It took one whole day to build it together from dismantled parts, says Sunita. The three-wheeled cart has two wooden crushers between which the sugarcane sticks are placed. A long handle on top has to be pushed with a lot of strength to crush the sugarcane for its juice.Sunita and Ashok begin their day around 10 am, when the sugarcane is delivered to them from the nearby APMC market. They also buy ice, lemon and plastic glasses for the day before lugging the cart to a street corner, despite their frail frame. We carry many kilograms of sugarcane on the cart, so it becomes very heavy. The work involves so much labour that by the end of the day, we are too tired to walk, says Ashok. They work till 8 pm before returning to their rented space nearby.The couple is hopeful of making more money than their Rs 500 per day as labourers back home. Their three children, including a toddler, are in the care of their parents. We miss them but only manage to speak to them once or twice a week. It is difficult to make ends meet with the meagre amount we earn at home, and that is why we came here, Sunita says. For now, the couple is attempting to get used to the city hustle.They skip lunch every day, too shy to eat in a public place on a road. We do not eat sitting on the road in our village. We are not comfortable doing that here, 25-year old Sunita says.Others, like 22-year old Rajendra Shirsat, also from Ahmednagar, have been coming to Navi Mumbai for a few years now. We first came here over four years ago. We have a small farm for jowar and bajra in Ahmednagar district. We will go home once monsoon begins and the demand for sugarcane juice goes down, Shirsat says.Neelam,too, has been operating a cart for a few years in Navi Mumbai. Earlier, I used to hire a man from the labour market every day to help me with the cart. On days the labourer did not turn up, I would end up losing the entire days earning, since I could not operate the cart by myself, she says.Neelam then took a loan and bought a motor, through which the crushers could turn without any manual push. Estranged from her husband, Neelam single-handedly manages the cart to make enough for her only sons education. I began this work to earn more than I would as a domestic worker in other peoples homes. Summer is a good time, even though I will have to work in the scorching heat through the next two months. If I dont slog in the heat, I will not make my sons life better, she says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(PTI Photo/ TV GRAB)Cows are the only animal that inhale as well as exhale oxygen; ghee made of cows milk contains 47 per cent oxygen; and gaumutra (cows urine) in sugarcane field will ensure longer, thicker and sweeter sugarcane and yield more sugar, BJP MPs said in the Rajya Sabha on Friday.The remarks were made during a discussion on a private-member resolution moved, and subsequently withdrawn, by DMKs T Siva, seeking steps for protection of indigenous cattle breed. B K Hariprasad of the Congress, who supported the resolution, said there should not be any discrimination against buffaloes or bulls. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the government could keep in mind the suggestions offered by Siva.In the resolution, Siva sought amendment in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, to exempt bulls from application of provisions that restrict their utility and training for various purposes. Siva also batted for saving diesel by replacing tractors with cattle forploughing and transportation. Nine of 10 MPs who spoke on the issue supported Sivas resolution. Jairam Ramesh opposed it, saying the resolution was aimed at Jallikattu more than protecting the indigenous breed of cattle and promoting organic manure, as was made out by the DMK member.Basavaraj Patil, BJP MP from Karnataka, said, Ghee made of cows milk has up to 47 per cent oxygen. Cow is the only animal which takes oxygen and gives back oxygen. He claimed that if a cow carcass is buried, its chemical action is worth fertilizer amounting to Rs 8,000. La Ganesan of the BJP said he was happy to see a DMK member bringing a resolution that should have been brought by a BJP member, and that he wholeheartedly supported it.Meghraj Jain of BJP claimed that scientists researching on wheat at an institute in Karnal, Haryana, have said that cattle urine mixed with water for irrigation will increase productivity. If cow urine is used in sugarcane farms, the sugarcane will be longer, thicker and sweeter, and will yield more sugar, he said. Jain also claimed that an experiment done at Mumbais Tata Cancer Hospital had found that haemoglobin level of patients using cow urine does not fall even after chemotherapy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

With its policies, the government sought to underline its stated focus of making sustainable agriculture a reality complete with self-reliant farmers across the state.Although the developmental plan allocation for agriculture and allied services is Rs 7,035.73 crore and for irrigation and flood control is Rs 8,701.72 crore out of the total Rs 77,184 crore across sectors, allocations through various schemes undertaken in 14 crucial departments, including skill development, rural development, tribal and social justice and infrastructure, which is an attempt to bridge the rural and urban divide, could work to farmers advantage. If the total allocations of all the splintered projects to help farmers are summed up, it works out to more than Rs 25,000 crore, a source in the finance ministry said.The quantum leap from negative to positive growth in agriculture and allied sectors (12.5 per cent) is an outcome of the policy reforms in the last two-and-a-half years. Our larger objective is to bring the maximum number of farmers within the institutional credit bracket, said Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. While reiterating the governments commitment to higher allocation of funds in the agriculture sector till 2018-19, he said, Doubled income of farmers by 2021 is the next achievable target.An allocation of Rs 1,200 crore has been made for the governments flagship Jalyukta Shivar project, to make 5,000 villages drought-free by 2017-18. In addition, more funds will be provided from the district plan and central schemes for the project.A sum of Rs 225 crore has been provided for the ongoing farm pond scheme. Construction of irrigation wells under MNREGA have been further consolidated with daily wages hiked from Rs 192 to Rs 210.While stating that 80 lakh farmers have received the soil health card, the state government, with assistance from World Bank intends to launch climate-resilient projects to make 4,000 villages in Marathwada and 1,000 villages in Purna basin drought-free.The emphasis is on promoting agro-industries such as textile hubs,food processing, horticulture, animal husbandry and fisheries to achieve the double income goal in five years, sources said.The model adopted is to form a group of 20 farmers who would pool 100 acres of minimum cultivable land to promote community agriculture, making it economically viable. The condition is that individual farmer should not have more than 10 acres of land. The project is aimed at uplifting 2 crore small and marginal farmers with land holding less than five hectares. After accessing the pilot project, it would be extended across the state.As the sugarcane crop production is likely to decrease by 28 per cent, the government exempted sugarcane purchase tax for the year 2015-16 and 2016-17 of sugar mills to facilitate them to pay fair price remuneration to the farmers. Indicating that restructuring of APMC and market linkages would be scaled up to bring better support price for farmers crops, the government said public private partnership will be promoted in both agro and irrigation projects.To maximise the area under micro irrigation, it was decided to use Israels micro-irrigation technology for full utilisation of the Arvi Lift Irrigation project in Wardha district and Bemble project, Yavatmal. An amount of Rs 100 crore is being provided for the project in 2017-18. Ambedkar Krishi Swavlamban Yojana is being extended to scheduled tribes besides the scheduled caste beneficiaries. An amount of Rs 92 crore is earmarked for 2017-18.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But it's time doctors take their own advice seriously. A blood pressure screening initiated by the Indian Medical Association for more than 500 doctors across the country, including in Chennai, showed that despite medical knowledge, there was no difference in the incidence of blood pressure among doctors and the rest of the community.The Indian Medical Association, along with Heart Care Foundation of India and Eris Lifesciences, recorded blood pressure readings of 533 doctors in 33 cities on May 9. IMA president Dr KK Agarwal said it was done in an attempt to raise awareness about the benefits of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring - a non-invasive method of obtaining blood pressure readings over a 24-hour period.Doctors were asked to wear a cuff device for a day and the machine measured blood pressure at periodic intervals throughout the day. ""As doctors, we should practise what we preach. We decided to evaluate the incidence of the disease among doctors so that we can raise awareness,"" he said.The preliminary results of the day-long study released on Wednesday, World Hypertension Day, revealed that one in every five doctors had masked hypertension - a blood pressure that seemed normal when measured by the conventional technique but was actually high according to the ambulatory monitoring device.At least 37% off the doctors had nocturnal blood pressure - elevated blood pressure only at night - and more than half the doctors had irregular BP patterns at night, increasing the risk of cardiac diseases. ""It is a pointer that awareness without diet or exercise in a stressful work environment can cause serious health hazards. If this can happen to doctors, it can happen to anyone,"" he said.The IMA has been part of the universal BP screening programme launched by the Indian Council of Medical Research, where every doctor has been asked to measure the blood pressure of at least 20 visitors every day. ""These are not screenings done for patients. They will be carried out on attenders and visitors to ensure it reflects the community blood pressure,"" said Dr Agarwal. Hypertension is one of the most common lifestyle diseases prevalent today with one in three Indian adults suffering from it, but doctors say a large number of people remain undiagnosed or wrongly diagnosed because it is normally measured only once.Increasingly, doctors are prescribing 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure to make a more accurate diagnosis, said Hypertension Society of India president Dr Shashank Joshi. Doctors say a diet rich in fruit, vegetables and Omega-3 foods, and low in salt and sugar, besides regular exercise will help in containing blood pressure."

Since then, women and children are not venturing into the fields and there is a vigil in the area.The Indian bison or gaur has been the cause of massive crop damage in Shahuwadi, Chandgad, Panhala, Ajara talukas in the district over the past few years. Considered among the native animals of Kolhapur district, the grassland where the gaurs once inhabited have come under sugar cane cultivation in these talukas. Therefore, the gaurs enter the fields in search of their food.Namedev Kadav, a 60-year-old farmer from the village, says that sugar cane is the main source of income for his family. ""It is only crop that gives assured income for the family. We have been facing gaur attacks since last fifteen years. Earlier, they would attack if we ventured into the jungle, but now the habitat has changed and forced them to come downhill,"" he said.He added, ""The attack on Friday has created panic in all villages here. Farmers are scared to enter the fields fearing gaur attack as no one knows how to deal with the gaurs. Several requests to the officials to find a permanent solution to prevent such incidents have not been headed.""Sagar Kininge said his Murkte village is just seven kilometres from the tehsil area and he has often seen gaurs cross road without causing any nuisance. ""I regularly reach home after 8pm. These days, I am scared of a gaur attack and I have been making sure I reach home before dark,"" he said.Murkte village is located at the foothills of Bhudargad fort. Wildfires have destroyed grass on the hills and herds of gaurs are moving down to feed on sugarcane, villagers said.""Farmers have tried various measures to prevent gaurs from entering farms. They burst firecrackers, installed bug lamps in field, raised watch towers to keep gaurs away. Local villagers have no idea how to deal with the animals,"" Kininge said.Disturbance in the animal migration corridors, rampant mining and land development projects in rural Kolhapur have led to man-animal conflicts in the district and claimed two lives and 3,917 instances of crop damage in the last fiscal.Kolhapur boasts of national parks, a tiger reserve and wild life sanctuaries. Out of its total geographic area of 7,620 sq km, around 139.11 sq km, which account for 19.35% of the total, are under forest cover. But human intervention in these forest areas has resulted in the man-animal conflicts in the district.The Indian bison is known to become very aggressive between May and October to protect their young ones. The animal is known to attack any person seen as posing a threat to its newborns."

Lallu was wrong in that the said protest was by RLD members to highlight the plight of sugarcane farmers in the state in 2014.Lallu's allegation drew sharp reaction from parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna who said the statement was false and has been made with an intent to malign the image of a national party that was ruling in state and at Centre.Leader of Opposition Ram Gobind Chaudhary tried to diffuse the tension saying Lallu only wanted to draw comparison with a past incident but Khanna did not relent.Speaker Hridaya Narayan Dixit asked Lallu if he would apologise for his unsavoury remark. The CLP leader initially argued saying he what he meant was that the incident took place in presence of BJP members. BJP MLA Dalbir Singh, who was then RLD leader in the House clarified that it was two RLD members who had stripped and not BJP members.Lallu finally said if he had made any unsavoury remark against BJP members, it should be removed from records."

593550587be9e061b173643e,Centre tries flavoured pills to help kids finish TB treatment,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-tries-flavoured-pills-to-help-kids-finish-tb-treatment/articleshow/58724210.cms,2017-05-18,"NEW DELHI: Children diagnosed with tuberculosis are now given bitter-tasting pills four times a day, making it a loathsome exercise. These drugs will now come in orange and strawberry flavours, the director-general of health services (DGHS), Dr Jagdish Prasad, told TOI on Thursday.The Union health ministry has already introduced these flavoured pills in five states, including Himachal Pradesh and Kerala, on trial basis. ""By December, we plan to make them available across the country. Some new flavours might be added, too,"" Dr Prasad said.The introduction of flavoured drugs are in line with World Health Organisation's recommendations to improve treatment and survival rate among children suffering from TB , the DGHS said. Currently, parents often crush the drugs and add sugar make children consume them.Another problem with the management of paediatric TB is to ensure correct dosage. Children are given pills meant for adults in lower dosage. Prasad said the government was working to introduce dispersible drugs for children according to their weight.In India, about 70,000 children are registered with the national anti-TB programme and another 60,000 to 70,000 are under treatment of private practitioners. Easy availability of anti-TB medications, correct dosage and compliance can help reduce the burden, doctors said.According to Dr S K Kabra, professor of paediatrics at AIIMS, the incidence of drug resistance in children suffering from TB has gone up. ""Children mostly get the infection from adults. If we can reduce the incidence of TB among adults, the incidence among children will also come down significantly,"" he said.A recent study covering four metros found close to 9% of all paediatric TB patients are resistant to rifampicin, one of the first-line drugs used in treating infectious diseases. TB incidence, the survey found, was highest among children in Delhi at 12.2% and the least in Chennai at 5.4%.Diagnosis of TB is challenging in children due to high rates of extra-pulmonary TB and associated complications which can mimic other diseases, said doctors."

The reason is that the conditions a crop is grown in are, for the most part, far from optimum for it.Comparative data shows that the average per-hectare yield for major crops is substantially lower than their genetic potential , or the productivity that a crop is programmed for by nature when the conditions are just right for it.Data shows that the difference in productivity between parts of the state that have the highest yield for a particular crop and the ones with the lowest yield is very high, indicating a need to have a re-look at the cropping pattern in the state.Take rice, the genetic potential of which is 4,000 kg per hectare while the state average is 1,867 kg. The highest yield of 3,572 kg is recorded in traditional rice belts like the Konkan but the lowest stands at 641 kg, a yawning gap.Such a high difference in the productivity of a major crop shows that its cultivation in many parts of the state is done in conditions that are not favourable for it.Experts say that the key reasons for the gap between the productivity on the ground and the full potential of a crop are a lack of research-based inputs for farmers, old and redundant practices, absence of innovation, unavailability of assured irrigation facilities, small land holdings and non-adoption of a cropping pattern that is best suited to the geographical parameters of a particular area.The average yield of tur in the state is 695 kg per hectare when the genetic potential is 5,000 kg. Yet, the state remains one of the largest tur producers, enough to cause a glut this year and send prices crashing.The tur phenomenon is an illustration of low-productivity practices employed on a large scale to increase production  a waste of resources  instead of raising yield to achieve the same.Even the water-guzzling sugarcane , which caused a lot of debate during the 2015 drought, suffers from low productivity  though it remains popular as a cash crop with near-assured returns.The state has an average of 7.5 lakh hectares under sugarcane at an average productivity of 830 quintals per hectare against the genetic potential of 3,500 quintals.Experts say low yield is one of the key reasons why most farms are loss-making in the state.""It is unfortunate that research in the agricultural sector in the state has been completely neglected for years now,"" a retired vice-chancellor of an agricultural university said. ""None of the four agriculture universities in the state have a research director. More than 40% seats in these universities are vacant. There is a need to look at the cropping pattern of the state. There are many regions which are wasting time and money in growing crops that will not have much yield there due to geographical and weather-related parameters, but none of the universities give any such research-based inputs to the farmers.""Officials from the agriculture department said they had chalked out a detailed working plan to increase production.""The idea is to reduce the farm input costs by providing subsidies for everything that a farmer needs,"" an official said."

The counters open by 9am and the stock exhausts generally within two hours. One glass (200ml) of neera costs Rs10, and there are people who consume up to five glasses.""The response that we have so far from the public is amazing. Every day the distributors are provided 40 to 45 litres,"" said Anil Kumar Yadav, project manager at Jeevika.""We have over 286 counters in Gaya, Nalanda, Nawada, Banka, Bhagalpur, Samastipur, Aurangabad, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Saran, Jehanabad and Patna districts. There are nearly 16 counters in Patna district alone,"" said Yadav, adding that the response is very good at all places.To ensure daily availability of neera, Jeevika has roped in around 31,000 toddy tappers. ""We give two-day extensive training to toddy tappers on how to tap good quality of neera and how to keep it hygienic and increase its shelf life,"" he said.Talking about future plans, he said sugar-free neera peda would be launched soon. There are plans to open four more neera outlets this month near Gandhi Maidan, Sri Krishna Puri park (Boring Road), Patna Junction and Meethapur bus stand.""We are working on the idea of producing flavoured neera and neera ice cream,"" Kumar said.Jay Prakash, who trains the tappers, said more than 500 groups have already been trained by Jeevika and producing quality product like peda, ice cream,"" he said.Deputy director (industries department) Umesh Kumar Singh said 26,343 out of 3,18,400 trained tappers have been given licences. ""Apart from the 12 priority districts, Bihar Agricultural University is training tappers from 26 other districts and we also plan to make jaggery,"" he said. Bihar State Milk Cooperative Federation , also known as Comfed, has tied up with Jeevika for packaging of neera in bottles. ""The process is under experiments and sampling and we expect it will be soon available in the market,"" said Singh.Sanjay Kumar manning Jeevika's neera counter near Vidyut Bhawan said that usually his stock exhausts between two-three hours at max. ""We open the stall by 9am and to our surprise many people even consume five glasses in one go,"" said Sanjay.Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Nageshwar colony, said he consumes neera every morning. ""I feel it is better than any artificial cold drink,"" he said.Archana Tiwari of Mandiri road also wants government to increase neera sale as it has many medicinal properties. ""It is beneficial for liver, among other things. Once you drink it, you will feel coolness seeping through your body. Perfect for this hot summer,"" she said.Sexagenarian Baldeo Singh, a morning walker at Gandhi Maidan, was disappointed on Wednesday as the neera stall near Udyog Bhawan had shut down earlier than other days."

He died on Tuesday afternoon at the hospital with the officials stating the preliminary cause of his demise as complications from congestive heart failure.Patel arrived at the Atlanta airport on May 10 on a flight from Ecuador.US Customs and Border Protection subsequently denied him entry into the country as he did not possess the necessary immigration documents, the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement.Patel was transferred into the ICE custody last week at the Atlanta City Detention Center where he received an initial medical screening and was found to have high blood pressure and diabetes.On Saturday, two days after being in the ICE custody, a nurse checking Patel's blood sugar noticed he had a breathing problem following which he was shifted to a hospital where he passed away.ICE said it is firmly committed to the health and welfare of all those in its custody and is ""undertaking a comprehensive agency-wide review of the incident, as it does in all such cases"".The agency the informed the Indian consular representatives who notified Patel's kin about his demise.The agency added that fatalities in its custody are ""exceedingly rare"" and occur at a fraction of the rate of the US detained population as a whole.Patel is the eighth such individual who died in the custody of ICE the fiscal year 2017."

Rates on 1,211 items were finalised by the GST council with 81% facing a levy of up to 18%. ""There is no increase (in burden) on any commodity.On many commodities, there is a reduction in tax rates and tax-on-tax will also go away, lowering the burden,"" finance minister Arun Jaitley said. ""One criterion in mind is that the overall impact should not be inflationary... We are banking on GST checking evasion and buoyancy in collection,"" Jaitley said. The GST council decided to lower tax incidence on items such as sugar, tea, coffee and mithai as well as consumer durables but opted to retain the burden on cars.In addition, bikes with engine capacity of over 350cc, which are seen as luxury goods, will see a new cess of 3%. Foodgrains have been exempted from GST, which will lower the burden on consumers since they currently face various levies that add up to around 5%.Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said automobiles will attract 28% GST, with luxury vehicles facing an additional cess of 15%. Similarly, small petrol cars will face 1% cess, while diesel-powered small cars will attract 3% cess.In certain cases, such as hair oil, soaps and toothpaste, tax incidence has been reduced from around 28% to 18%. For coal, the reduction will be from 11.69% to 5%, helping lower the cost of power.Similarly, the burden on those buying refrigerators or washing machines will come down from around 31-32% to 28%, officers said. Instant tea and coffee are expected to be in a separate bracket although tea and coffee will be in the 5% slab.""Items that are part of the consumer price index will see ahuge reduction,"" Adhia said. With detailed rates due to be released, businesses will now sit down and calculate product-wise impact and also plan for the rollout. Auto companies said the incidence will largely remain the same even after GST is rolled out.There were, however, concerns over items in the 28% slab. ""Consumer products like soaps, toothpaste and hair oil under 18% is good news and should see price drop for consumers. Similarly, several food items such as edible oil, tea, coffee sugar etc have been kept at 5%, with exemption for milk and foodgrains, which would also bring cheer to industry. The only concern is that 19% items (over 200) would be kept under 28%, which was initially meant for only few commodities such as luxury cars, aerated beverages etc,"" said Pratik Jain, partner at consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.There are certain issues which are expected to be thrashed out on Friday, when the Goods and Services Tax Council is also expected to finalise the rates for services.The council will decide on the levy for gold, biscuits, packaged and branded cereals, footwear, bidis and textiles.Jaitley said the GST council had approved seven sets of rules, excluding those related to transition and returns, along with the forms. ""It was quite surprising that the decisions were taken so quickly,"" Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal said.The tax reform will subsume central and state levies such as excise duty, additional duties of customs, service tax, value added tax, central sales tax, entry tax, octroi and luxury tax and is expected to clean up the messy indirect tax structure."

According to a charitable trust , their fund raising drive is not running well because of prevailing cash crunch. The charitable trust, which distributes foodgrain among the needy every year during the holy month of Ramzan, said that it has been failing to generate the targeted funds because of slowdown in the market.Mufti Anees Ur Rahman , an office-bearer of Safa Baitul Maal , said, ""Over 200 members of the trust along with many other generous people contribute for the noble cause. We receive donations throughout the year and spend it before Ramzan. But due to demonetisation, many donors have cut short the amount to be released on account of zakat (obligatory tax for economically sound Muslims). We had planned to offer foodgrain to about 500 needy persons in the current season for which we are in need of Rs 10 lakh, but so far our collection has reached Rs 8.5 lakh mark,"" he said.""The trust will have to take financial loan from the market to meet the demand. It is not the first time when we have to avail loan, but this season the loan amount is certainly more than the previous occasions. Last year, we had to take loan of Rs 50,000 whereas in the current season the loan amount will be Rs 1.5 lakh,"" Rahman said.But undeterred by the shortage of funds, the trust is planning to go ahead with its plan and has initiated the process of distributing food grains among the needy persons. ""We have faith in the almighty and thus we are confident of repaying the loan amount soon after Ramzan,"" he said.Interestingly, the office-bearers have increased the number of beneficiaries from 400 to 500 for the current season for which they have started procuring the material.Every year the trust distributes wheat, rice, pulses, sugar, spices, edible oil, dry fruits and soaps among other commodities to over 400 needy persons before the holy month. On an average, the trust spends about Rs 1,500 per person for procuring these items."

Some of the top construction, sugar, and cement companies in Africa are owned by Gujaratis, mainly from Kutch and Saurashtra regions . This testifies to strong business links that Africa and Gujarat have enjoyed for decades. The African continent is a major market for pharmaceuticals, textiles, agriculture produce, ceramics, plastics, spices, agri-equipment, and auto parts to name a few. On the other hand, Gujarat imports pulses, sesame, and timber in large volumes from Africa. Rough diamonds mined in Africa are cut and polished in Surat, India's diamond city.""Pharma exports from Gujarat to African countries is around Rs 8,000 crore and it is growing at 8%-10% annually,"" said Chirag Doshi, former chairman of the Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association, Gujarat. For mid-sized companies, penetrating European and American markets is tough and therefore African and Latin American countries are ideal destinations for exports.Government data shows that Gujarat exported wheat, groundnut, fruits, onions, dairy products, among others, worth Rs 1,190 crore to Africa during the April-February period in the 2017 fiscal, while African nations exported wood and articles of wood worth Rs 1,186 crore to India during the same period. Kutch accounts for 70% of these imports. ""A host of Gujaratis who have settled in African countries are major exporters of pulses. In fact, a huge amount of these exports are sent to India,"" said Rajiv Vastupal, chairman, Gujarat state, FICCI.African Development Bank officials believe that there is ample scope for Gujarat-based players in power, infrastructure, services, agriculture, automobiles, and food processing sectors in Africa. Corporate houses have started looking at Africa for setting up manufacturing plants. Arvind Ltd established a garment-making plant, producing 3 million pieces, in Ethiopia last year. Apart from a 10-year tax holiday, duty-free access to the US, Europe, and 12 other countries have attracted the Ahmedabad-based textile-to-apparel giant to Ethiopia, which has a manufacturing facility of Cadila Pharmaceuticals as well. Sanghi Industries Ltd's promoters are also mulling investments in Africa. However, raising debt in local currency as well as the volatility in some African currencies are seen as deterrents by the industry.Tourism is yet another sector where there is great synergy between Gujarat and Africa. According to Manish Sharma, a tour operator, around 30,000 people from Gujarat visit popular destinations such as South Africa and Nigeria every year. ""Hundreds of farmers from Saurashtra have taken up agriculture in Africa,"" said Parag Tejura, president, Saurashtra Vepari Udyog Mahamandal, which has been organizing Africa trade show for the past three years.

But that's all about to change now. Railway stations across the city have come up with clinics, which are equipped to deal with all kinds of medical emergencies  be it accidents on the tracks, heart attacks or even heat strokes. What's more, these clinics are charging patients only 1 as consultation charges, giving affordable medical care a whole new meaning!These diagnostic centres, called 1 Clinics, were inaugurated last week at Dadar, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Wadala Road and Mulund stations and are already buzzing with patients. While these are open to emergency cases 24x7, they also have OPDs that are functional for 12 hours a day. In the next few months, 14 more clinics will open at other stations on the Central line.A few years ago, activist Samir Zaveri filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court, claiming there was a lack of prompt medical help for railway accident victims. The court ordered railway authorities to set up Emergency Medical Rooms (EMRs) at all stations in Mumbai . That's when brothers Dr Rahul and Dr Amol Ghule came on board and shared their idea of setting up subsidised clinics with the authorities.But not many know that it was a personal tragedy which became the driving force behind this mission. Dr Rahul shares, ""In 2015, my parents met with an accident on the road and my mother suffered from a severe head injury. Unfortunately, she didn't get immediate medical aid. Today, she is paralysed and bedridden because of the delay in her treatment. Despite being doctors , we couldn't help her. So, we decided to do something to make medical facilities more easily available for Mumbaikars.""Another reason that prompted them to deliver services at minimum costs is the lack of awareness among people when it comes to getting regular health check-ups. ""Most people visit a doctor only if they fall ill or have medical complications. We are trying to change that and these subsidised rates will definitely benefit them,"" says Dr Amol.Irrespective of their social and economic background, anyone can come visit these 1 Clinics. They boast of essential equipment including ECG machines, oxygen cylinders, ambu bags, pulse oximeters, emergency drugs and intubation. Dr Rahul says, ""Railway accidents are one of the major causes of deaths and disabilities in Mumbai. The aim is to provide treatment to accident victims within the golden hour. Once emergency medical aid is given, the patient can be taken to a nearby hospital for further treatment."" The clinics also give up to 25 per cent discount on pathology tests and medicines available in their pharmacies.According to on-duty pharmacist Parthiv Bhatia, it's the OPD section that has been getting a staggering response from the public. ""Though it has been just a week, we already have more than 150 patients a day in one centre alone. While getting your blood pressure checked is absolutely free, other basic tests like blood sugar can be availed at just 25,"" he says.Businessman Rahul Ambavane, who visited the Ghatkopar clinic for a routine health examination, shares, ""I did an ECG test and also checked my blood sugar levels. The minimum cost of an ECG at any hospital in Mumbai is 200 -300 rupees. But I just paid 76 here. Even my family physician charges 200 for consultation alone! I will recommend it to people who want to get a general check-up.""Apart from 14 new clinics on the Central line stations, there are plans of expanding these EMRs to Western Railways in the next two months. Dr Savita Uppud, a gynaecologist at one of the centres, says, ""Currently, we have a staff strength of four doctors, a nurse and a paramedic per dispensary. But seeing the response, we are getting more doctors on board from not only reputed hospitals in Mumbai, but also from cities like Pune. We are also roping in specialists in various fields, who will be available for consultation for a few hours every day.""A paramedic at one of the clinics shares, ""People with diabetes and hypertension have to get regular check-ups, which can be expensive. So, for them, we've started a membership plan. They will also get priority treatment at the centre.""Until May 14 this year, already 1,044 people  112 women and 932 men  have died in accidents on Mumbai locals. According to statistics, 3,202 passengers died and 3,363 were injured on the suburban railway network last year. The Central line recorded the highest number of deaths."

Dentists in the city say a few simple tips will prevent bad breath caused due to long hours of fasting, fight dental decay due to bacteria build-up as well as improve digestion and keep constipation at bay. City dentists have suggested a list of dos and donts for a healthy Ramzan fasting as the ninth month of Islamic Hegira calendar is also an occasion for feasting for some. Fasting Muslims often complain of bad breath. This can be avoided, say doctors, by brushing teeth after Sahar (pre-dawn meal) and Iftar (breaking of fast after sunset). This removes food particles stuck in the teeth that lead to bad breath and dryness of mouth.Dr Mohammad Siraj Ur Rahman, professor at Government Dental College (Osmania) and Neodent Dental Hospitals, recommends scraping of tongue after Sahar and Iftar as well. ""Scrape your tongue twice daily as it prevents bacterial biofilm, mucus and debris from forming on the tongue. Use odourless dental floss to prevent bad odour,"" he said, while recommending use of Miswak twig. It is a tradition of Prophet Muhammad to use Miswak twig for brushing teeth as it contains medicinal properties.Dr Rahman also recommends drinking a lot of water at Sahar and Iftar. People who wear dentures should put them in an antiseptic solution overnight to clean them. ""Cavities and broken tooth should be treated before Ramzan,"" he said.Dental surgeon Dr Nashwa Sultana Omer of Dinesh's Dental Paradise says it is crucial to maintain dental health during Ramzan. "" Oral health not only improves one's facial personality, but also boosts self-esteem and confidence in social interactions,"" she said.Dr Nashwa recommends that those on fast should take fruits and boiled vegetables at Iftar as they have high fibre content. This will help in re-mineralization of teeth naturally. ""Because fasting people stay up to 14.5 hours without food and water, it can accelerate the decay process, particularly if one consumes sugary foods while breaking fast,"" she said.Periodontally compromised and diabetic patients should use chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily to prevent further damage of gums. ""Get oral prophylaxis done before Ramzan begins to make sure the health of gums do not worsen during fasting,"" she added."

After a series of meetings with eminent endocrinologists from different cities around the world, including Hyderabad, in the last nine months, the SAFES has recommended safe and pragmatic use of the new medicines. Ramzan, the ninth month of Muslim calendar, will begin on May 27 or 28 in India depending on the sighting of the moon.The new drugs include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. They have been found to keep the blood sugar levels under control though they cause loss of wa ter. Dr Rakesh Sahay of the department of endocrinology, Osmania Medical College , was part of the team of endocrinologists that studied the efficacy of the new class of drugs on the management of type 2 diabetes. The consensus statement was published in the recent issue of the scientific journal, Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.Dr Sahay told TOI that the new drugs increase urinary glucose excretion by lowering renal glucose reabsorption. They also improve glycemic parameters with a low risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). ""People with type 2 diabetes preferring to fast during Ramzan should discuss with doctor on the safe use of the medicines. Those with hypoglycemia risk should not fast. Blood sugar tests should be con ducted during the fast as Islamic scholars allow such tests. If they notice hypoglycemia, they should consult doctor and act on the medical advice,"" Dr Rakesh said.He said those dependent on insulin should discuss with doctor for a change in the schedule of insulin administration and dose, if any. The new drugs were also tested in different parts of the world. There was not much problem.The SAFES guidelines suggested that there should be adequate fluid intake to prevent water depletion.According to the SAFES statement, "" South Asia faces a high burden of types 2 diabetes, coupled with a unique metabolic phenotype and macro-environmental challenges"" as many people across religions fast for long hours."

Involuntary passage of stool or urine in death is common in death following suffocation.The finding was detected with the help of Anurag's photographs taken at the crime scene on early Wednesday morning. Karnataka cadre IAS officer of 2007 batch, Tewari's body was found outside Meerabai Marg VIP guest house on Wednesday morning.While police had disturbed the original scene of crime by turning the officer's body over, sub-inspector Vinay Sharma had clicked some photographs on his mobile phone. The police team along with experts from Mahanagar based forensic science laboratory tried to recreate sequence of events on Saturday evening.Photographs clicked by Sharma and other professional photographers who were summoned to the spot later on, were examined thoroughly again. While zooming in, a police officer noticed some soiling on the lower. According to forensic experts, when a person is choked to death by strangulation, smothering or burking, it is normal for him to pass stool, urine and semen.As Tewari died due to asphyxia, police team were struggling to find out how supply of oxygen dropped all of a sudden in Tewari's body in an open area. Former director of Uttar Pradesh medico-legal cell, doctor YK Pathak said that deaths due to asphyxia can only be homicidal (murder) or accidental.""A person cannot choke to death in an open space. He may have been attacked somewhere else and dumped on the road. Police needs to find out if Anurag was with somebody in moving car or SUV before he was found dead,"" said Pathak.Meanwhile, SIT visited KGMU pathology department on Sunday to take samples of Tewari's heart and submit it to Mahanagar forensic laboratory for examination. SSP Deepak Kumar said, ""I will seek opinion of forensic doctors at AIMS if the need arises and family seems unconvinced. I will extend all support to them and will bring out only facts.""Conflicting points - Police says Tewari did not intend to travel on Wednesday and no airline confirmed that booking in his name was made.

Since Ramzan involves longs hours of abstinence from food and water, doctors suggest undergoing basic tests to rule out onset or complication of diabetes, hypertension and other borderline health issues.Caution while fasting is of special importance this year as Ramzan falls during summer and the mercury level is set to increase in the coming days. The arrival of the southwest monsoon will also bring in its wake certain infections. The monsoon is likely to set in during the first week of June, but Ramzan will conclude only on June 25 or 26.""Thousands of diabetics (type I and II) in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh prefer to fast. Worldwide, about six million people with diabetes fast during Ramzan. The risks associated with fasting for diabetic patients include low or high blood sugar, dehydration and blood clots. These conditions are often seen in patients whose drug doses and timings are not adjusted,"" said Dr Aftab Ahmad, specialist in internal medicine, Apollo Hospitals, Secunderabad.He recommends that besides pre-Ramzan assessment and education, self-monitoring of blood sugar should be done to find out if blood sugar is under control.In his nutritional advice, Dr Ahmad recommends avoiding eating large quantities of food rich in carbohydrates and fats at Iftar as they delay digestion and absorption. At Sahar, one should take more complex carbohydrates to keep the stomach full. Complex carbohydrates are absorbed slowly. One should also avoid consuming spicy foods and increase fluid intake during non-fasting hours.Senior nephrologist Dr Mohammad A Rafey also stands by this rule. He recommends consuming lots of fluids between Iftar and sleep so that the body can adjust fluid levels in time for Sahar and withhold the pressures of the subsequent long hours of fasting. He also recommends avoiding all sorts of refined foods.As Ramzan involves a lot of physical activity in the form of regular prayers and late night Tarawih prayers, doctors say the repeated cycles of rising, kneeling and bending as part Namaz will help keep the body fit and healthy. But not following a strict diet regime can undo all the benefits of this."

Naveen, who had expected to stumble upon a large herd of elephants in the course of his peregrinations through the forest, had been left disappointed, not having sighted even a single tusker on the first two days. However, on Friday - the last day of the census - his disappointment gave way to elation, when he spotted a herd of five elephants, which included a calf during the waterhole count.As part of the waterhole count conducted on the last day of the census, volunteers and resource personnel sit near a water hole, waiting for the elephants to assemble at the spot. While the sight of an elephant herd was a source of great delight for volunteers, Madappa M, a farmer of Hosa Birwalu village in HD Kote taluk, less than a kilometre from the park, watched them pass with trepidation. Madappa and members of his family fervently hope not to see any elephants, particularly near their field s where they have sown cotton.Madappa said that, the elephants trampled on the crops within two months of the seeds being sown. ""Elephants invading our fields is not new to us. But the problem has become serious over the years. They used to come into the fields once in a while, and feed on crops such as paddy and sugarcane. Lately, they don't spare any crops,"" Madappa added. Farmers living and working in villages on the periphery of Bandipur National Park share Madappa's concerns. As the three-day census operation came to an end on Friday, the threat that the tuskers posed to the livelihood of the farmers gave the volunteers much to ponder about. Tackling the humanelephant conflict has become a huge challenge for the forest department.While farmers in HD Kote taluk have traditionally cultivated paddy and sugarcane, they have started growing crops such as tomato, chilly, cauliflower and cotton in the recent years.Mallesha N of Badagalapura , another village lying close to the forest boundary, has tried several measures - from erecting a solar fence to changing the crop pattern -to keep elephants at bay. Blaming the forest department for its failure to restrict elephant movement, he said,""They don't allow us to graze our cattle inside the forest. They better keep the wild animals inside the woods."" Assistant conservator of forests for Hediyala sub-division that falls under Bandipur, Paramesh hoped that the forest department would be able to use the census data to combat the problem.""We're doing our best now.Trenches have been dug near the boundary, and night patrolling too has increased. We have also ensured farmers are compensated quickly for the crop loss. We're holding community meetings to increase awareness among villagers on the importance of wildlife,"" he added."

However, far from complaining, the hosts are now preparing to give them a permanent home. A herd of about 50 elephants, which crossed over Nepal to the terai region in India about two years ago has not returned to their place of origin. The elephants have converged at Banke Taal at the reserve. They are settled comfortably and mothers are seen nursing their calves as males vie for the attention of females.Senior forest official and former director of the reserve Sanjay Singh has shot videos and clicked photos of the herd, socialising and relaxing during dawn and dusk. He says there might be more herds other than the one at Banke Taal.Dudhwa's first elephant census, to begin on May 24, would find out the exact number of the jumbos and their locations. ""We assume the number to be anything between 52 and 75,"" said deputy director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve Mahaveer K.It will take about two months to count the number of elephants in all the re serves of the country . The census will give data on several factors regarding elephants, like the most frequented wildlife corridor by elephants.What is a matter of concern for Dudhwa authorities is that elephants have never been permanent dwellers of Dudhwa.The herds used to cross over from Sukla Phanta Wildlife Reserve and Bardiya National Park of Nepal to Dudhwa in the sugarcane season when there was ample food for them.However, every year, they would go back after the crop season was over. This year, despite sugarcane having been cut, the jumbos have chosen to stay. They eat grass and other vegetation. Moreover, half of the population is that of newborns, which shows that the once-migratory elephants are now breeding in Dudhwa.In the past, there have been incidents where elephants have crossed the border to mate. Females used for patrolling in Dudhwa always attract tuskers from Nepal and vice-versa.Chameli, a female from Dudhwa, had vanished in 2013. When it re-appeared after a few days, she was pregnant. Forest officers named her calf `Vinayak'.Chameli had only followed in the footsteps of its elderly mates Pawankali, Champakali, Sulochana, Pushpakali, Pakhri and Madhu, which have reproduced after mating with elephants from Nepal.Another area of concern for the reserve will be managing man-animal conflict as elephants stay permanently. Dudhwa has a permanent population o f tigers, leopards and rhinos, all mighty animals. Man-animal conflict is already high in the area.Resident elephants, if not managed, can add to the conflict."

""They are the ones who have to absorb the cost of this negotiation,"" he added.The U.S. sugar industry pressed the U.S. Commerce Department late last year to withdraw from a 2014 agreement that sets prices and quotas for U.S. imports of Mexican sugar unless the deal could be renegotiated.The U.S. sugar lobby wants Mexico to export less refined sugar and has become emboldened since Donald Trump took office in January.The two countries are approaching the deadline to renegotiate the ""suspension agreements"" on June 5 after which Mexican sugar could face high tariffs if a deal is not reached.Tensions over sugar bode poorly for upcoming talks to update the North American Free Trade agreement, which Trump vowed to scrap if he cannot renegotiate it to benefit U.S. interests.Mexican sugarcane farmers estimated income losses of about 6 billion pesos ($321 million).Limitations faced by Mexican sugar in the United States due to the suspension agreements mean refiners are forced to seek out markets with lower prices than those in the United States.U.S. fructose, which faces no restrictions in Mexico, is sold at lower prices and has displaced some of the sugar consumption in the country.""Cheap fructose comes in. It forces national sugar production into other markets,"" said Carlos Blackaller, president of the sugarcane producers union. Americans ""limit exports or displace it with fructose,"" he said.

Nashik district exported 1.21 lakh tonne of grapes during the 2016-17 grape season (Dec-April), as against 1.08 lakh tonne during the previous grape season in 2015-16.But grape prices declined in European and domestic markets due to rise in supply of grapes as compared to the demand. Ashok Gaikwad , past president of MRDBS, said the new generation of farmers are focusing on producing large quantity and size that creates pressure on plants and affect the quality of grapes.""The sugar developing process is affected in fruit due to greater focus on have large quantity and size. However, the climate was also not good and the plant growth process was delayed by 15 days more due to cold that affected the quality of fruit,"" he added.The quality of grapes was the major reason that led to crash in grape prices. Farmers sold grapes at Rs 10 per kg in domestic market due to inferior quality, while others sold it at Rs 50 per kg at the same time due to good quality.There is need to do proper packaging while exporting it to other countries, stressed Gaikwad. He added ""The quality of the fruit suffers if farmers undertake packaging of 20 kg of grapes. Actually, they should focus on packaging in five-eight kg of grapes.""Vilas Shinde, director of Sahyadri farmer producer group, said, ""This year, there had been excessive supply of grapes in European countries that led to crash in grape prices. Around 90% of grapes produced in the country are of Thomson seedless variety. Hence, farmers need to focus on new colourful grape varieties to capture the grape export market. There is also need to focus on quality grapes.""In 2009-10 grape season, European countries had rejected consignments of grapes from India on the ground of presence of pesticides. They had detected chlormequat chloride component, a plant growth regulator in excess of the prescribed maximum residue level for table grapes. Around 85 grape-growers in the state had incurred losses worth Rs 150 crore as their consignments of grapes were rejected."

It is not a just something related to overeating, extra pounds of fat or genetics. Obesity is now defined as a chronic, relapsing disease.As the World Obesity Federation (WOF) earlier this week confirmed its support for defining obesity as a chronic relapsing disease, doctors in Hyderabad warn that since obesity is a chronic ailment, the burden of ill health simply increases as time passes by .According to city doctors, the earlier one stands up to tackle obesity, the better the results. The WOF in a statement published in the May 10 issue of the scientific journal, Obesity Reviews , said obesity fits the epidemiological model of a disease process except that the toxic or pathological agent is diet-related rather than a microbe. Welcoming the new definition, local doctors warned that obesity is the cause of all bad diseases including high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) and cancers.It is also linked to problems like sleep apnoea, joint pains and infertility. Dr Tapas Mishra, senior consultant and advanced laparoscopic bariatric surgeon, Apollo Hospitals Hyderguda , told TOI that the WOF definition has come as a ray of hope for the obese. ""Unfortunately in this digital age when most of us are at our intelligent best, having coolest gadgets, places to eat mouthwatering dishes, best vehicles and modes of transportation, we did not realize all these have a side effect too. This generation is eating more variety of food (less healthy and extra calories), traveling more (walking less, no time to exercise), watching more TV movies (playing less) suffering from diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol in early life compared to their elders,"" he added.India has the third largest population of obese people but when it comes to the gross domestic product (GDP), the country stands at 144. ""This is a mismatch. Obesity has arrived with all its buddies (co morbidity) and the sooner we accept that it is a disease we will freely discuss with the health care provider concerned for a solution,"" Dr Tapas said.The new definition makes it clear that obesity should no longer be viewed as an after effect of lazi ness, gluttony , bad lifestyle or any curse, said Dr Rajib Paul , critical care specialist, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills.""As obesity has a genetic predisposition, impairs bodily functions and decreases life expectancy it easily qualifies to be called a disease rather than only a lifestyle-related problem. Physicians must learn to categorize obesity and individual patient risks and tailor therapy in the form of medical weight loss programme or surgery ,"" Dr Rajib suggested.Senior laparoscopic and bariatric surgeon Dr Rajneesh C Reddy said obesity is a disease. ""Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. If you consume high amounts of energy , particularly fat and sugars, but don't burn them through physical activity , much of the surplus energy is stored by the body as fat,"" he added."

593562d77be9e061b1737688,The simple secrets behind these classic jingles,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/the-simple-secrets-behind-these-classic-jingles/articleshow/58663989.cms,2017-05-14,"GURUGRAM: There is a certain fascination for advertising jingles . Children, especially, tend to pick them up quickly, and recite them with exasperating enthusiasm.Those of us who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s can recall those earworms. Who, growing up, did not sing along to the great Kamlesh Pandey's iconic jingle, 'Colgate ka chhota packet/Kholo dabao, brush pe lagao/Colgate ka chhota packet'?Who doesn't remember Nirma's iconic, 'Washing powder Nirma' jingle? In simple, everyday language, it informed us, the consumers, about the brand name and category (apparently, the word Nirma appears no less than 11 times in the jingle). Next, it educated us about the benefits of using Nirma, viz. 'Doodh si safedi' (and the fact that 'rangeen kapda bhi khil-khil jaaye'). It gave us an insight into the value of the product with the line, 'Thoda sa powder par jhaag dher saara'. And finally, it told us that Hema, Rekha, Jaya and Sushma were already using the product to their great satisfaction, thus reassuring us about its quality.Another unforgettable from that era was, 'Vicks ki goli lo, khich-khich door karo'. Notice the genius of the writer in using the seemingly nonsensical but extremely easy to understand phrase 'Khich-khich'. While you won't find it in any dictionary, you know exactly what it means in the context in which it has been used.Then there was the 'Doodh doodh doodh, piyo glassful doodh' jingle created for Amul Milk and Operation Flood. After decades, it still sounds modern, and is still as exceptionally catchy. Watch it on YouTube and it will be a week before you get its Hinglish lyrics and immensely 'sticky' tune out of your head.Walk up to anyone who grew up in that era and ask them to hum the soundtrack to a visual of a young girl dancing on a cricket field. And in a heartbeat they will begin to sing 'Kuchch khaas hai zindagi mein'. Such was the power of that Cadbury's ad (penned by the mighty Piyush Pandey).One is often asked how copywriters think up of these jingles. And what rules (if any) they follow in writing them. Allow me to attempt an explanation using one of the most memorable jingles ever in Indian advertising, the famous 'Jab main chhota ladka tha' song for Bajaj.Unless you are a Gulzar, the only rule you follow when writing a jingle is simplicity. In an ad, we do not have the luxury of time to get into the lyricism of the 'woh kaagaz ki kashti, woh baarish ka paani' type. There has to be a balance between hardsell of the product and entertainment to sugarcoat the sales message. The line 'jab main chhota ladka tha, badi sharaarat karta tha' cannot be put more simply. Yet it rings true, and also describes the action on screen.I was not able to find the long take of this ad on YouTube but the second stanza of the jingle is imprinted on my mind, even though I must have heard it last 25 years ago. 'Kya rangeen jawaani thi/Ek raja tha ek rani thi/Raja rani pakde jaate jab roshan hota Bajaj'. How succinctly the writer has managed to encapsulate the very essence of youth and romance  all in 30 words and with no word longer than three syllables.'Ab main bilkul boodha hoon / Goli kha ke jeeta hoon / Lekin aaj bhi ghar ke andar roshni deta Bajaj'. You have to be an untutored novice or a brilliant writer with complete command of his craft to write 'Goli kha ke jeeta hoon' to describe old age. That kind of brutal simplicity is very, very difficult to achieve otherwise. (Author is executive creative director, Ogilvy Group of Companies)"

Diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes 13 years ago, these simple pleasures of life eluded him as his sugar levels remained at 250-300 mg/dl even after taking multiple shots of insulin.The 'silent killer' eventually damaged his kidneys, leaving Chauhan, who is a production controller at a pharmaceutical company, extremely ill. Battling for life with chronic kidney failure, he was forced him to leave his job and undergo dialysis three times a week.Mitesh underwent transplant of kidney and pancreas on April 11. A month later, doctors discharged him. They called Chauhan's treatment the first case of successful pancreas transplant in Gujarat.""Mitesh underwent simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPK) and he has recovered very well,"" said Dr Jamal Rizvi, professor of Urology and Transplantation department at the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Center (IKDRC) in Ahmedabad.""His blood sugar levels have remained under 100 mg/dl without any diabetes medication. This means his transplanted pancreas is working well and his renal function is normal. This is a big breakthrough for Gujarat which is known as the 'diabetes capital of India',"" he said.The doctor further said that pancreas transplant is a technically challenging procedure. ""This success has encouraged us to expand the program so that more diabetics with renal failure can benefit,"" Dr Rizvi said. Mitesh got the kidney and pancreas of Ravi Dewan whose organs were donated after he became brain-dead after a road accident recently. Dewan was 22-year-old when he died. Dr Rizvi said that unlike kidneys, pancreas has to come from a young, healthy cadaver less than 40 years of age.""I now eat dal, rice, sukhdi, penda and other sweets and my blood sugar remains under control without any medication,"" Vadodara-resident Mitesh told TOI.Dr Rizvi said that pancreas-kidney transplant will be a boon for Type-1 diabetes patients with end-stage of renal failure. The pancreas of such patients does not produce any insulin. Type-1 diabetics are highly vulnerable to kidney failure, heart disease, digestive problems and other illnesses.Professor of neprology, Dr Himanshu Patel , who attended on the patient, said that a double transplant surgery is highly challenging. The patient has to be doubly protected from infections, he said."

If Mr Ghosh, who makes the best rasagulla in Kolkata, wants to send his fresh product to Bengaluru, he will confront a nightmare in terms of the cold chain logistics of transportation. Instead, if Mr Ghosh wants to consult a doctor in Bengaluru for acute chest pain from Kolkata, the doctor can converse with him on a video call and ask for some tests.With a map app, the doctor can then direct him to the nearest diagnostic lab. When the tests are done, before Mr Ghosh puts on his clothes the doctor can see the test reports online, reassure him that his heart is fine and prescribe a pain killer.Online retail needs to move products from point A to point B through complex logistics. Online healthcare just needs images and data to reach from point A to point B, which can be done from anywhere in the world virtually free. All it needs is an expert doctor with an internet connection and a payment gateway.When you hear that someone is unwell, 99% of the time a sick person doesnt need an operation. Technically, 99% of illnesses can be treated online. The treatment decision depends on history which video conferencing will provide, and interpretation of lab and organ image reports which can easily be done virtually.Today hand held devices can check blood pressure, pulse, saturation, ECG and sugar at home. Diseases like diabetes, hypertension, obstructive lung diseases, chronic heart failure, skin diseases, routine cold, cough and fever can easily be managed online. Online diabetes management under a consultant diabetologist supported by counsellors who keep a tab on patients blood sugar remotely should have better outcomes.Patients with psychiatric problems, in fact, prefer online consultation as it enables them to hide their identity. The family paediatrician needs to see the child if required once in few months. The rest of the time, such things as seasonal cold and cough can easily be managed online, which is convenient for both child and mother.The big advantage of online healthcare is that it is at ones fingertip, convenient for both patient and doctor since the patient can be in his bedroom and doctor may be stuck in a traffic jam. Patients from rural India can consult city experts at the click of a button. Because of the convenience, frequent consultation will improve outcomes in chronic illness like diabetes, heart failure and respiratory failure.Technically, patients from any part of the world can consult doctors anywhere without spending any money and time on travelling. Doctors will be able to see a lot more patients without wasting time on commuting. Patients can be discharged from hospital early since doctors can monitor them from home.Online healthcare cannot blossom without advanced electronic medical records (EMR) which will prevent doctors from making mistakes and give them real time feedback on how the patient is responding to treatment. When doctors and nurses in an American ICU are sleepy at midnight doctors and nurses from India, where it is midday, can monitor the patients virtually  thus enhancing safety and reducing costs.Indian doctors will love it because today they can only treat patients who they can touch. Geographical barrier is a major limitation for doctors who want to expand their practice. Online healthcare will allow them to treat patients in any part of the world. However, if Indian doctors decide not to adopt technology, it is a matter of time before doctors from Bangladesh or Pakistan will fill the vacuum.Some changes are, therefore, urgently necessary. The Medical Council of India should adopt regulations permitting doctors to offer virtual consultation and legalise virtual prescriptions. According to Indian law a doctors advice to patients even on telephone  a common practice today  is illegal unless it is a medical emergency.Second, the government should define the standards for EMR development  respecting data privacy but not following the expensive HIPPA compliance so that start-ups can create mind-blowing doctor-friendly EMR on a dynamic cloud platform, unlike the billion dollar US EMR which doctors hate.To develop doctor-friendly EMR, a technologist should work with doctors with free access to patients data. In the US  a country where patients data is more sacred than patients lives  this cant happen. This is a billion dollar opportunity awaiting Indian technologists.Through a digital sharing economy, India can become the first country in the world to dissociate healthcare and other essentials of life from affluence. India will prove to the world that the wealth of a nation has nothing to do with the quality of healthcare its citizens enjoy by offering high-tech care to the common man on a digital platform.However, this will only happen if IT solution providers dont get carried away with billion dollar valuations and offer services for a tiny amount of money for each transaction. Of course they will make enough money to justify their effort. But if they dont follow the rules of the game cheap clones will follow and government will intervene, as is happening now with Uber and Airbnb.My simple message to young tech entrepreneurs is to learn to differentiate need from greed. Success is never a zero sum game. When customers, providers and the government win, you win.In the game of real life, winner takes it all never happens."

Name is also said to be derived from Shenga, the Marathi word for groundnuts, or Sanga, Sanskrit word for friendship and union.Wuhan: First settled by nomadic Indian tribes who named it Wahan. They shuttled between here and a nearby twin city called Yahan and eventually came to be called the Yahan-Wahan tribe. Yahan is now a lost city somewhere near Wahan or Wuhan.Chengdu: Also called Chengdu during the reign of Ramayya Vastavayya, the Telugu troubadour who travelled here and spread Telugu song, letters and literature.Xian: Originally called Xianivarpet or Shanivarpet. A saturnine, star-crossed city that was Xhunned by everyone after it was established by Bajiraos rebel son Changan Bhujbal.Tianjin: Site of conquest by Rajaraja Chola (Cho La, in Chinese) who named it Thanjavur after a city in Tamil Nadu, before it was shortened to Thanjin and later Tianjin.Nanjing: Originally known as Nanjingud or Nanjangud, site of Hoysala conquest and named after Indian monk Nanja (Nan Ja in Chinese) who was famous for drinking poison for pleasure.Similarly, there are thought to be many other Chinese cities steeped in Indian antiquity. Guangzhou was originally a Kashmiri settlement called Ganju, and later called Ganga Nagar; Chongqing was a Bengali colony called Chondropur; and Hangzhou was definitely Hajipur, settled by Yadavs (called Ya Dav in Chinese). Some Chinese provinces (eg Fujian) are thought to have Punjabi origins and others (eg Anbei) are Tamil.In fact, China itself was called Cheen or Cheen Na in Hindi, an expression that means grab or snatch. But when they found they could not do it so easily, it was corrupted to Chini, meaning sugar, in an effort to win it over with sweet overtures.China has responded to that with bitterness, putting an end to that outreach."
593565887be9e061b17377cf,What is more healthy-rice or chapati?.,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/myth-0-logic/what-is-more-healthy-rice-or-chapati/,2017-04-23,"Nowadays people think that rice or chapati is sole reason for obesity. This article will make sure that both are important if taken correctly.Rice vs chapati (wheat roti) is a very common and controversial topic; both these grains being the staple food in many parts of the globe. People blame rice for causing obesity, diabetes and related conditions. Is it really true?Basically, we most commonly use polished / white rice, which looks white due to the removal of fiber-rich outer covering (husk and bran). During this process, most of the micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals) are washed away. Thus white rice is devoid of B complex vitamins, iron, calcium etc.Whole wheat flour, the main ingredient in chapatis, is high in fiber (unless sieved) , protein and minerals like iron, calcium, selenium, potassium and magnesium.Some other important considerations are-1. Chapatis are higher in sodium and potassium content. Rice doesnt contain any sodium (unless salt is added) and contains very little potassium. Thus for people on sodium & potassium restricted diets, rice could be a better choice than chapati.2. Rice is easy to digest as it is low in fibers. Thus for people with loose stools / diarrhea, indigestion etc. rice is a good choice.3. For people who manage their diabetes & diet plan, eating whole wheat chapati is a better alternative. White rice has a higher glycemic index than chapati , which means, it increases blood sugar more rapidly. Thus chapati is always a preferred option for diabetic individuals.4. For those who are overweight & obese, chapati is a better choice as it contains more fibers. Eating rice more often, more in quantity and especially at dinner can lead to weight and fat gain.Thus, nutrient content-wise, chapatis are healthier than rice. Brown or unpolished rice could be a good replacement for white one which retains almost all micro-nutrients."
593565957be9e061b17377d6,Is the cougar the hunter or the hunted?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/heartchakra/is-the-cougar-the-hunter-or-the-hunted/,2017-05-07,"Recently, Ive had a spate of young men, even 20 years younger to me, flirting outrageously and attempting to get into various sorts of relationships with me. When I laugh and tell them they should be more interested in my daughters generation, they inevitably respond with, an elder woman is so much more interesting and wholesome. Im not sure whether its just a good time or something more meaningful they seek, but its interesting to note that these young, hunky, good looking men, some of whom are extraordinarily successful professionally, and could easily charm much younger women, just dont seem to be interested in pursuing them.Conversely, Ive seen a lot of men in their mid-40s & early 50s pursuing women at least 20 years younger. It makes me wonder, why equations are openly changing to elder men pursuing younger women and younger men pursuing older women.Over the last 15 years Ive had 3 long term relationships with younger men. One was 12 years younger, one was 8 years younger, and one was 4 years younger. By common definition and analysis I would classify as a cougar and middle aged men seeking much younger women tend to classify as going through a mid-life crisis or referred to as sugar daddys. Strange how men are perceived to be in crisis or as benefactors, while women are seen as predators. A predator is one who hunts, but as is the case with me and many women in my age bracket, we are being actively pursued by the younger generation of men who claim to be seeking the balance, maturity, wisdom, experience and grounding that comes with an older woman. Speaking from personal experience, I found the younger man dynamic a perfect fit for my high energy, zest filled attitude to life. However, reactions from family and friends differed greatly. Any systemic change of this nature, is naturally met with discomfort, disagreement, disrespect and sometimes even disgust.The same hostile reactions were evident in society with the introduction of love marriages, inter-caste marriages, and inter-religious marriages, but eventually people and families are adjusting well to those realities. The older woman-younger man equation is clearly not the odd case exception anymore, nor a trend. Its an expression of how people are making choices that work for them openly and fearlessly. Lets drop the biases and prejudice that limit only ourselves. Live and let live, respectfully.1) My friends and I had planned a weekend after a very long time. However, my boyfriend keeps nagging and saying that how can I leave him and go alone with my friends. He says that this shows that I do not care for him and do not love him. This isnt true and I have tried various ways to explain this to him. But, it seems that he doesnt understand. What should I do?Its just the opposite! By trying to control you, limit your happiness, not trusting you and not wanting you to have personal freedom, it is he who is displaying a lack of love. Love is about loving a person for who they are. Not for who you would like them to be or to cage them, upset them and limit their happy experiences with people who matter.2) am a 32-year-old man and was married until a year back. I separated from my wife and started dating a colleague of mine. However, I have recently learnt that my ex-wife has started visiting this colleague after office hours and also calls her on weekends enquiring about me. I dont want trouble to start brewing all over again. Please help.Tell your colleague to stop entertaining your ex-wife. Your ex-wife needs to let go, your colleague needs to understand she is not google, and you dont need to be starring in a spy movie. Its as cut and dry and simple as that!3) I have recently started dating a professor of mine who is just a few years older to me, say about five. Now, my mother has come to know of it and she has been emotionally blackmailing me saying that she will cut off all relations. It isnt that I am dating a guy who is 20 years older to me. I have tried explaining this to my mother, but she isnt willing to listen to me. What should I do?Even if hes 20 years older, your mom needs to meet him and assess him based on personality, what he brings to your life, and what he intends for the relationship. Tell your mom blackmailing is childish, controlling anddamaging and solves nothings. Parenting is not about ownership, its about guidance, feedback and trust."

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. discusses the Republican agenda as he faces reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 30, 2017. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)After their humiliating loss on health care, Republicans in Congress could use a quick victory on a big issue. It wont be an overhaul of the tax code. Overhauling the tax code could prove harder to accomplish than repealing and replacing Barack Obamas health law. Congressional Republicans are divided on significant issues, especially a new tax on imports embraced by House Speaker Paul Ryan. And the White House is sending contradicting signals on the new tax, adding to the uncertainty.House Republicans also cant decide whether to move on from health care. Ryan canceled a scheduled vote on a House GOP plan after it became obvious that Republicans didnt have the votes.This is a setback, no two ways about it, Ryan said of the loss on health care. I will not sugarcoat this, this is a disappointing day for us.Ryan said he will continue to work on the issue but one of his top lieutenants on health care, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, says he is now 100 per cent focused on a tax overhaul. Ryan says Congress can work on both at the same time. It wont be easy. Heres why:___REPUBLICAN DIVIDEHouse and Senate Republicans largely agree on the broad outlines of a tax overhaul. They want to lower tax rates for individuals and corporations, and make up the lost revenue by scaling back tax breaks.But they are sharply divided on a key tenet of the House Republican plan.The new border adjustment tax would be applied to profits from goods and services consumed in the U.S., whether they are domestically produced or imported. Exports would be exempt.House GOP leaders say the tax is key to lowering the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 per cent.But good luck finding a single Republican senator who will publicly support the tax. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, is the latest in a long line of Republican senators to come out against the tax.___ABSENT DEMOCRATSSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, says he wants to work with Democrats to overhaul the tax code.A bipartisan bill would allow us to put in place more lasting reforms and give the overall effort additional credibility, Hatch said.Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said it is bad policy to pass major legislation without bipartisan support.Without some meaningful buy-in, you guarantee a food fight, McConnell wrote in his memoir last year. You guarantee instability and strife.But in the House, Republicans havent reached out to Democrats in any meaningful way.___WHERES THE WHITE HOUSE?Obviously were driving the train on this, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.But President Donald Trumps administration has been all over the map on tax reform. Trump at one point said the House border tax is too complicated, then said its in the mix.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a Senate panel that there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class in Trumps tax plan.However, the plan Trump unveiled during his presidential campaign would provide big tax breaks to high-income households.Since taking office, Trump has promised massive tax cuts for the middle class.A former Treasury official under President Barack Obama says the White House needs to stake out clear goals on tax overhaul to guide the debate in Congress.I think its important for the administration to signal early the general shape of what they would like to accomplish so that there are fewer proposals vying for attention, said Michael Mundaca, a former assistant Treasury secretary now at Ernst & Young.___TAX CHANGE IS DIFFICULTThere is a reason its been 31 years since the last time Congress rewrote the tax code. Since then, the number of exemptions, deductions and credits has mushroomed. Taxpayers enjoyed USD 1.6 trillion in tax breaks in 2016  more than the federal government collected in individual income taxes.That huge number could provide plenty of tax breaks that lawmakers can scale back so they can lower tax rates significantly. There is just one problem  all of the biggest tax breaks are very popular and have powerful constituencies.Nearly 34 million families claimed the mortgage interest deduction in 2016. That same year more than 43 million families took advantage of a deduction of state and local taxes.The House Republicans tax plan would retain the mortgage deduction and eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes.___HEALTH CAREBoth Trump and Republicans in Congress made big campaign promises to repeal and replace Obamas health law, so the issue wont go away.However, several players say negotiations on a way forward are non-existent. In the meantime, Trump is stoking animosity among a key voting bloc by criticizing them on Twitter.Two factions in the House GOP had members oppose the health plan: the hard right Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group.Ryan has suggested that they get together to sort out their differences, but its not happening, according to one key lawmaker.We are not currently negotiating with the Freedom Caucus. There was never a meeting scheduled with the Freedom Caucus. We will never meet with the Freedom Caucus, said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a member of the Tuesday Group.Trump tweeted: The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they dont get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!To quote a favorite saying of the president, Not nice.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(REUTERS/Gary Ramage/Pool) Flooded areas can be seen from an Australian Army helicopter after Cyclone Debbie passed through the area near the town of Bowen, located south of the northern Queensland town of Townsville in Australia, March 30, 2017. (REUTERS/Gary Ramage/Pool)Australian authorities ordered the evacuation of large parts of a major town of more than 25,000 people on Thursday as a storm system generated by a powerful cyclone that pummelled the northeast two days ago swept down the coast with heavy rain. Cyclone Debbie hit as a category four storm in the north of tropical Queensland state on Tuesday, smashing tourist resorts, bringing down power lines, flattening canefields and shutting down coal mines.This severe weather system that began with Cyclone Debbie and is tracking down the coast is causing havoc across our state, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters in the state capital, Brisbane. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical low depression on Wednesday but it was driving squalls with torrential rain across a 1,200-km (745-mile) stretch of Australias east coast, swelling rivers, causing flash floods and prompting Queensland to close about 2,000 schools.In Lismore in the north of neighbouring New South Wales state, the State Emergency Service told 7,000 residents in low-lying areas to leave after forecasts predicted the towns worst flood in nearly 20 years. A levee protects the rural hub in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, home to at least 25,000 people, but most of those downtown planned to seek higher ground, Geoff Baxter, a barman at the Richmond Hotel told Reuters.Were clearing out the pub, mate, and closing it up. All the shops got closed, everyones clearing up their cellars, he said. Further north, Queensland closed more than 2,000 schools as sustained heavy rainfall brought flash floods to the Gold Coast tourist area and Mackay further north.In the cyclone-hit zone further north still, military helicopters, ferries and planes brought hundreds of holidaymakers stranded on resort islands in the storms path to the mainland, where tens of thousands more people were without power. Resorts along the world-famous Great Barrier Reef and the Whitsunday coast bore the brunt of the storm with wind gusts stronger than 260 kph (160 mph).Its kind of chaos down here, Jon Clements, an architect awaiting evacuation from Hamilton Island, told Reuters. I think theres probably three times the number of people they can put on aeroplanes at the moment down there. At nearby Daydream Island, where water supplies had run low since the storm, troops brought food, fuel and water while helicopters carried sick guests to the mainland.The resort will be closed for at least a month for repairs, management said in a statement, as tourism operators statewide reported cancelled bookings and anticipated a long-term hit to trade. Thats the kind of collateral damage we suffer sometimes in our industry, Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind told Reuters.In the Bowen Basin, the worlds single largest source of coal used to make steel, major miners Glencore and BHP said they were still assessing the extent of any disruption to shipments. All four coal rail networks run by operator Aurizon were closed, alongside its road and rail operations from the Bowen Basin to Brisbane. Ports at Abbot Point, Hay Point and Mackay also shut, but did not report extensive damage.Of the smaller miners, Yancoal had called force majeure on its Middlemount mine. About 2,500 insurance claims have been filed but Queenslands top two insurers, Suncorp Group Ltd and RACQ, said it was too early to put a dollar figure on the damage.Hundreds of hectares of sugarcane crops were flattened, but Wilmar on Thursday restarted sugar mills at Proserpine and Sarina. One female tourist was killed in a car crash on Monday that police said was due to wild weather as Cyclone Debbie approached. Another two people were injured as the storm passed through.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Monocrotophos was meant for use on sugarcane crop.The Bihar Police was put under tremendous pressure to establish foul play in the deaths of 23 schoolchildren in the Gandaman primary school midday meal tragedy, but its investigations showed only criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, the officer in charge of the probe told The Indian Express.The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police exculpated the husband of the principal, who had bought the pesticide that made its way into the childrens meal.Read |Bihar midday meal tragedy: Everything you need to know about the incidentAccepting the CIDs supervision note, an additional district judge in Chhapra, Saran, in August 2016 convicted the principal, Meena Devi, and sentenced her to two jail terms of 10 years and seven years, to run consecutively rather than concurrently, adding up to a total sentence of 17 years.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe court acquitted Meenas husband, Arjun Rai alias Arjun Yadav, of all charges.This is how Vinay Kumar, additional director-general of police, CID, reconstructed the events of July 16, 2013  the day of the tragedy  in an exclusive interview to The Indian Express.Read | In Bihar primary school where mid-day meal killed 23, children go hungryThat day, Meena Devi, the principal of Gandaman primary school in Bihars Saran district, had planned to distribute free government textbooks to about 100 children studying in Classes 1 to 5. The school was running in a community hall measuring 30 ft by 20 ft. An open part of the verandah was being used as the midday meal kitchen.Meenas husband, Arjun Rai, had announced to the children and their parents that books would be distributed, and almost three times the usual number of 30-40 students had turned up. The midday meal menu, according to a chart prepared by the government, was rice and soybean curry.Rai, a farmer, had decided to grow sugarcane that year, and had purchased monocrotophos, a cheap but acutely toxic organophosphate agricultural insecticide. He had kept the container on the verandah of their house, some 600 metres from the school.Meena asked one of the two school cooks to bring the container of mustard oil from the verandah, which had no separately marked space for the midday meals groceries.The cook saw two similar containers. Arjun Rai had brought two litres of monocrotophos, an agricultural pesticide, from the neighbouring Sidhwalia Sugar Mill for his sugarcane crop. Monocrotophos resembles mustard oil. Instead of picking up the container of mustard oil, the cook picked up the one containing monocrotophos, ADGP Kumar said.Once on the fire, the pesticide turned black. The two cooks and some students brought this unusual behaviour of the mustard oil to the notice of the principal. Meena Devi, however, dismissed their concerns, saying old mustard oil can turn black with heat.Around 1.30 pm, the first batch of 60-odd students were ready to have lunch. Some, like Laxmi Sah, daughter of confectioner Raju Sah, went back home because they did not want to eat what was being served, but others like her brother Krishna stayed because they liked soybean. By 2.30 pm, there was complete chaos: parents were rushing their children to Masrakh hospital with complaints of giddiness, vomiting and breathlessness.In the end, 23 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 12 years had died of poisoning.CID officers picked up the residue of the cooked soyabean from utensils and put it through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), a chemistry technique to identify the amount and types of chemicals in a sample, and were able to establish the presence of the pesticide. It was known that Arjun Rai had procured monocrotophos for his sugarcane crop; what the CID now needed to find out was whether he had a motive for murder.We were under tremendous pressure to prove foul play. Rai could have added monocrotophos to the container of mustard oil. But his only mistake was to keep the pesticide container in the vicinity of the mustard oil container, ADGP Kumar said.It was criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, who should have responded to the complaints of the cooks and the students, said the officer. Naming Arjun Rai would have been poor padding for a conspiracy theory. Rai had no motive to conspire to kill students. The school principal was solely responsible for the tragedy, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

One is increasing foodgrains allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters after the meeting.In the meeting, sources said that the Kerala Chief Minister demanded that state should get foodgrains for PDS supply that it used to get before implementing the NFSA.Under the NFSA, the state is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, lower than 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.To this, the the Food Minister said that an uniform formula has been applied to all states while allocating foodgrains to each state under the food security law.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account last three years average foodgrains lifting of the state.

But more is being given to protect poor people, a senior Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population.Among other demands, the Kerala government has asked more subsidy support as the state wants to sell subsidised sugar to entire population under the PDS. At present, sugar is supplied to only families of below poverty line (BPL).It has also asked for paraboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state.The state has also demanded up foodgrains allocatin to 550 tonnes per month for welfare institutions from existing monthly allocation of 212 tonnes , while it has also sought central support to make extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.That apart, the Kerala government has asked the Centre to extend rice procurement period for three months.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A resort in the area has begun producing the worlds first ever chikoo wine  the product was launched earlier this month. One of the attractions at the festival will be a wine tour followed by a wine-tasting session.Watch what else is making newsGiven the brand name Fruzantte, the fruit wine began as an experiment by Shrikant Save, a hotelier from Bordi, to boost the declining sales of the fruit in the traditional chikoo-growing belt of Dahanu-Gholvad. With the support of his daughter Priyanka Save, a trained sommelier (wine taster), the family began experimenting with the fruit and began making chikoo wine at home. Soon they roped in Dominic Rivard, a Canadian wine-maker, to prepare a recipe for the wine and imported machinery from Italy for large- scale production.Chikoo has all the qualities required for wine  the right acidity, sugar and Ph value. Since the fruit in its original form perishes quickly, we felt making it into wine would be a good way to boost its market value, said Save.After almost a five-year struggle for licences, they began production in a small area of Saves Bordi resort in August last year. By January, they were ready with close to 10,000 bottles of wine.Cartons of the wine.

Chikoo wine will get more popular and have wider distribution only when there are more producers, explained Nagesh Pai, Saves son-in-law.Priced at Rs 255 a bottle, the chikoo wine is a fresh bubbly drink with only eight per cent alcohol content. Presently, it is distributed only in the surrounding areas of Bordi, and a few pubs and hotels in Mumbai.The wine can be kept for two years. However, if the sap from the fruit remains, its life is reduced drastically. While wines are known for their longevity, a lot of care is needed for ageing fruit wines. Getting rid of the sap from the chikoo fruit was one of the greatest challenges we had to overcome. If it is not removed properly, the wine gets ruined in six months, said Vikas Pujari, assistant wine maker in the unit. After the juice is crushed out, the remaining fruit is used as manure in their farms, mixed with cow dung.Taking the idea of fruit wines further, they plan to begin making wine from other fruits including litchi, mango, black plums and even star fruit by April.

According to the department, money received by them was later transferred to business entities carrying out sugar manufacturing.Both Ramesh Jharkhiholi, Karnatakas Small Scale Industries Minister and a close associate of Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, and state Mahila Congress president Lakshmi Hebbalkar, are under the scanner after the raids allegedly unearthed undisclosed income to the tune of Rs 162 crore. Jharkhiholis houses in Gokak and Belgaum, and Hebbalkars residence in Belgaum were raided on January 19 as part of an I-T probe into illegal wealth.Watch What Else Is making NewsIt was also seen that non-existent persons were shareholders and investors in one of the sugar companies, the IT department has stated.A sugar baron with immense clout in Belagavi district of north Karnataka, bordering Maharashtra, Jharkhiholi had declared his assets at Rs 59 crore before 2013 Assembly elections  one of the highest among the candidates.Hebbalkar, who unsuccessfully contested from Belgaum Lok Sabha seat in 2014, had declared assets of more than Rs 8 crore.Jharkhiholi had made news in November when, days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of high-value currencies, he had conducted an extravagant wedding for his son on the lines of former BJP minister and mining baron G Janardhan Reddys daughters wedding the same month.Ramesh Jharkhiholi, 55, eldest of the five Jharkhiholi brothers, has a huge sway in the district.

The I-T searches reportedly yielded Rs 41 lakh cash and gold, jewellery weighing 12.8 kg.In June 2015, a State High-Level Clearance Committee headed by CM Siddaramaiah had cleared investment of Rs 213 crore in Harsha Sugars Ltd, a sugar factory being set up by Hebbalkar and associates. Company records for Harsha Sugars show that the firm got Rs 215 crore through loans from seven cooperative banks to finance the project.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson) Trump supporters celebrate as they attend the Inauguration Freedom Ball being held for US President Donald J Trump and first lady Melania Trump in Washington, US, January 20, 2017. (REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson)Many of President Donald Trumps core political supporters had a simple message on Sunday for the fiercest opponents of his immigration ban: Calm down. The relaxed reaction among the kind of voters who drove Trumps historic upset victory  working- and middle-class residents of Midwest and the South  provided a striking contrast to the uproar that has gripped major coastal cities, where thousands of protesters flocked to airports where immigrants had been detained. In the St Louis suburb of Manchester, Missouri, 72-year-old Jo Ann Tieken characterized the president as bringing reason into an overheated debate. Somebody has to stand up, be the grown up and see what we can do better to check on people coming in, she said. Im all for everybody to stop and take a breath. Just give it a chance.Watch: US President Donald Trump & His Mexican Counterpart Mutually Agree To Cancel MeetBy executive order on Friday, Trump banned immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries  Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen  and temporarily halted the entry of refugees.In the electoral strongholds for Trump, residents seemed nonplussed about the uproar flashing across their television screens. They shrugged off concerns about botched execution, damage to foreign relations and legal challenges across the country.In New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities, Trumps action set off an outpouring of anger.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, evoked an image of the Statue of Liberty weeping. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York teared up himself on camera as he seethed over the mean-spirited and un-American immigration ban.Veterans in government agencies, including the Homeland Security and State departments, blasted Trumps team for what they called slipshod planning and scant interagency communication, criticism the White House rejected.At airports, security officials also struggled to consistently enforce vague rules.But allegations of operational or administrative blunders may do little to dampen enthusiasm for a president who rose to power on a populist and protectionist platform, political analysts said.Louise Ingram, a 69-year-old retiree from Troy, Alabama, said she forgave the new administration a few glitches, such as widespread confusion over treatment of green card holders, as it moved to protect US citizens from attacks.Im not opposed to immigrants, she said. I just want to make sure they are safe to come in.FEAR OF EUROPEA senior Trump administration official said political considerations had little to do with the executive orders. They rather represent a reaction to the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California; the Boston Marathon bombing; and multiple attacks by radicalized groups in Europe.The reality is that the situation that exists today in parts of France, Germany and parts of Belgium is not a situation that we want replicated inside the United States, one official told Reuters.Candace Wheater, a 60-year-old retired school cafeteria worker from Spring Lake, Michigan, also referenced the attacks in Brussels and Paris.Look at whats happening in Europe, she said. I dont dare travel there, out of fear.Steve Hirsch, 63, from Manassas, Virginia, drove to Washingtons Dulles airport on Sunday to pick somebody up, rather than to protest as hundreds of others did.He said he supported Trumps order. A country is not a country if it doesnt have borders, he added.He lauded Trumps actions as a calculated step toward the larger goal of tightening border security.He probably went as far as he thought he could, Hirsch said. You cant ban everybody in the world, but I think its prudent considering the conditions in certain places in the world.FIRM BASE OF SUPPORTTrent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader from Missouri who is now a lawyer in Washington, DC, said the orders made sense to working-class Americans in the real world.Out in the rest of the country, people are excited to see the president moving forward with securing the border, he said.University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato agreed that the weekend protests over the executive orders would not hurt Trump politically.His base is as firm as ever, he said. What hes lost in the very early polls is the Republicans who were never Trumpers and ended up voting for Trump.Trump opponents have succeeded in winning some early court decisions that could undermine the practical impact of his executive orders, but Sabato said his base would perceive those as attacks from liberal elites.Trump could eventually lose support if he fails to keep promises important to regions that supported him, such as delivering jobs to the so-called Rust Belt, the Midwestern states dotted by dying factory towns.DEEP DIVISIONSWhatever Trump ultimately accomplishes, his election has ushered in a new extreme of political polarization to an already deeply divided country.I just have not found a single person who has any neutrality at all about Donald Trump, Sabato said.In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 40-year-old teacher Trista Carles said she had been ordered to keep her views about Trump out of the classroom.We were told to be Switzerland, she said. Were not allowed to take any sides or views.She has her own opinions, of course, and said she appreciated that Trump, in his blunt way, gave voice to them with no sugar-coating.I think its just too easy to get into our country and stay illegally, she said. I feel like he is going to  to the best of his abilities  make a lot of things he said happen.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Express Leopard Krishna died at age 18 on Sunday morning. ExpressKrishna, the oldest captive leopard at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SNGP), died in the early hours of Sunday. The 18-year-old feline had been suffering from chest infection for the past four days, said officials, adding that her condition deteriorated and she breathed her last at 2 am. Dr Shailesh Pethe, a veterinary officer who treated Krishna, said, Her old age had attracted the chest infection. On Saturday, she stopped responding to treatment. The average lifespan of a leopard is 12 to 14 years.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe officials added that Krishna had not eaten any meal since Friday evening and was not able to get on all four limbs.They said the leopard had similar health issues a few months ago. Though she had recovered then, the condition could have relapsed due to her old age.There are currently 15 leopards  eight female and seven male  at SGNPs leopard rescue centre. Four of them are aged 14 to 16 years.Krishnas death comes less than a month after a 16-year-old male leopard died at SGNP.Krishna is believed to have had a few wounds also, that she was being treated for.We tried to apply medicine but were not able to clean the wounds. We would have had to tranquillise her to make her stable, but given her old age and health condition, she could not be sedated, said an official.Krishna was a three-month-old cub when she was brought to the park in 1999, said the officials. She had been abandoned by her mother at a sugarcane field near Pen in Raigad district. Her mate died in 2014.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Dr Archana Patil, Additional Director of Health, State Family Welfare Bureau, said the campaign will, for the first time, use bOPV (bivalent oral polio vaccine). The global switch from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) to bOPV took place on April 25 last year and the last round using the tOPV was conducted on January 17 and February 21 last year. This year, the campaign will be conducted on January 29 and April 2.Dr Vijay Bawiskar, State Immunisation Officer, said special attention will be given to migratory population, such as the families of the homeless, construction workers, slum dwellers, sugarcane cutters, among others.A total of 84,782 booths have been set up with a workforce of about 21,8,486. Patil said India has adopted the polio eradication and endgame strategy plan declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO), 2013-18. The last case of polio was reported on January 13, 2011, and India was declared polio free on March 27, 2014.Patil further pointed out at the decline in the number of Muslim families refusing vaccination for children at Malegaon and Bhiwandi. There are now a handful of 500 such families who still refuse vaccination and we are trying to appeal to the religious leaders and clerics to help us change their attitude. Meanwhile, to ensure that private practitioners are no longer using tOPV, health teams will also be monitoring the situation on January 29.Pointing out that there was also a global shortage of injectible polio vaccine (IPV), Patil said they have provided sufficient stock of IPV to government-run hospitals and primary health centres.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
593725c77be9e015d564a2dd,IT heat on two Karnataka sugar mills owned by Congress leaders,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/income-tax-heat-on-two-karnataka-sugar-mills-owned-by-congress-leaders-4496599/,2017-01-28,"In searches of properties including the two sugar factories  linked to the two Congress leaders on January 19, the IT department had found the leaders to be holding Rs 162 crore in undisclosed assets. In searches of properties including the two sugar factories  linked to the two Congress leaders on January 19, the IT department had found the leaders to be holding Rs 162 crore in undisclosed assets.Two sugar factories, one owned by a minister in Karnatakas Congress government and the other by the president of the partys womens wing of the state, are under the scanner of the income tax (IT) department in connection with loans adding up to over Rs 530 crore given to them by a group of co-operative banks led by the Karnataka State Apex Co-operative Bank.In searches of properties including the two sugar factories  linked to the two Congress leaders on January 19, the IT department had found the leaders to be holding Rs 162 crore in undisclosed assets.The department is investigating whether unexplained funds in the accounts in some co-operative banks were transferred to the two factories as loans.Filings with the Registrar of Companies show that Soubhagya Laxmi Sugars Ltd, a sugar mill started in 2008 by Karnatakas Minister for Small Scale Industries Ramesh Jharkhiholi, got loans of Rs 318 crore from the Karnataka State Apex Co-operative Bank-led consortium after the Congress government came to power in 2013.Filings for Harsha Sugars Ltd, started in 2014 by the president of the Congress womens wing Laxmi Hebbalkar, show that the under-construction mill received a Rs 215 crore loan in 2015 from almost the same group of banks.The 23-member board of directors of the Karnataka State Apex Co-operative Bank is headed by Congress MLA K N Rajanna, and has on it five other Congress leaders along with the heads of other co-operative banks in the state.The IT department in an official statement said that investigations had so far confirmed that huge unexplained cash deposits have been made in the bank accounts of family members and associates and in benami names in primary cooperative societies which were transferred to business entities carrying out sugar manufacturing.The statement also said that Evidence of creation of bogus assets and siphoning off money from the company through various concerns engaged in turnkey projects for setting up of sugar factories have also been gathered.It added that the case was still under investigation.Documents filed with the RoC by Harsha Sugars for borrowing Rs 215 crore in October 2015  shortly after the investment was cleared that June by a high-level clearance committee headed by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah  show that the firm mortgaged around 51 acres of land in Savadatti in Belgaum against the loan.Harsha Sugars sought the loan to set up a 5,000-tonne plant with a 30 MW co-gen power plant at survey No. 411 in the same village.The Apex Bank contributed Rs 50 crore to the loan; Bagalkot District Central Co-operative Bank gave Rs 40 crore; South Canara DCC Bank Ltd, Rs 30 crore; Bijapur DCC Bank, Kanara DCC Bank, and Tumkur DCC Bank, Rs 25 crore each; and Bajpe Vyavasaya Seva Sahakari Bank, Rs 20 crore.Soubhagya Laxmi Sugars, owned by Minister Jharkhiholi, got a loan of Rs 318 crore in four parts between mid-2013 and early last year.It was sanctioned Rs 60 crore in February 2016 by the Apex Co-operative Bank for the sugar season 2015-16 against a mortgage of the plant and some 126 acres of land in the Hirenandi village of Gokak in Belagavi district.Earlier, between September and November 2014, the company had received Rs 120 crore from the Apex Co-operative Bank-led consortium: Rs 30 crore each from South Canara DCC Bank Ltd and Bijapur DCC Bank; Rs 25 crore each from Kanara DCC Bank and Tumkur DCC Bank; and Rs 10 crore from the Apex Co-operative Bank.The loan was given to increase the plants capacity from 3,500 tonnes to 7,000 tonnes, and co-gen power production from 18 MW to 36 MW. The firm pledged 200 acres of land and the factory after getting no-objection certificates from State Bank of India, IDBI Bank, and Andhra Bank, to whom the property was already pledged.Before that, in June 2014, Soubhagya Laxmi had got a loan of Rs 45 crore  Rs 35 crore from the Apex Co-operative Bank, and Rs 10 crore from two smaller Gokak co-operatives  to set up a 45 kilolitre-per-day ethanol plant. And in July 2013, it had got a Rs 93 crore loan from the Apex Co-operative Bank.The IT department has alleged that the two Congress leaders followed almost similar modus operandi for tax evasion through the use of common entry providers/facilitators. The department, under the Directorate General of Income-Tax (Investigation), Karnataka and Goa region, conducted searches at locations linked to the two leaders in Gokak, Belgaum and Bengaluru on January 19. The search led to admission of undisclosed income of Rs 162.06 crores, the department said in an official statement last week.The minister has said the investigation was aimed at tarnishing his image. My enemies are not able to digest my political growth. They are trying to get me removed me from the ministry, he said in a statement. All his wealth is accounted for, he has said, and promised to prove it before the tax authorities.Following the IT action, the state working president of the Congress, Dinesh Gundu, has accused the Narendra Modi government of using central agencies as a political weapon to target the Congress in the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593781f07be9e015d564b9cb,Next year isn’t exactly smooth sailing: Economic Survey,http://indianexpress.com/article/business/budget/union-budget-next-year-isnt-exactly-smooth-sailing-economic-survey-arun-jaitley-4501572/,2017-01-31,"Finance Minister Arun Jailtey (File Photo) Finance Minister Arun Jailtey (File Photo)A day ahead of the Union Budget, the Economic Survey for 2016-17 tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley does not present a bright picture for the next financial year 2017-18. While it does expect the growth rate to inch up, placing it within a wide band of 6.75-7.5 per cent, it warns of downside risks due to rising oil prices, trade tensions and increasing protectionism.Read | Economic Survey 2016-17: Here are the highlightsIn the current year or 2016-17, the Survey expects the economy to grow 6.5-6.75 per cent, with demonetisation lopping off 0.25-0.5 percentage points from a baseline growth of 7 per cent.Read | Economic Survey 2017: Everything you need to knowWATCH VIDEO | Budget 2017 Interview: Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman & CEO, HDFC On Affordable Housing & MoreThe Central Statistics Office (CSO), in the first advance estimates for 2016-17, had projected Indias GDP to grow 7.1 per cent, not taking into account the impact of demonetisation. The Survey also adds that recorded GDP growth in the second half of this year will understate the overall impact because the most affected parts of the economy  informal and cash-based  are either not captured in the national income accounts or their measurement is based on formal sector indicators.In an interview to The Indian Express, the Surveys principal author and Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian, however, warned that closing H1B visas and restrictions on outsourcing will affect growth by affecting exports. While the Survey is optimistic about exports due to expectations of a fiscal stimulus by the US, he said India was quite vulnerable to restrictions on services.WATCH VIDEO | Does Budget 2017 Incentivise Investment Into Housing Or Not?The kind of difference between China and Mexico and us is that Mexico and China are much more vulnerable to restrictions on manufacturing.We are much more vulnerable to restrictions on services and the H1-B kind of attack in a direct way, so one has to worry quite a bit that any reversal of globalisation in this atmosphere could also mean restrictions on exports of services and thats bad news. We cannot move towards 8-10 per cent (growth) if thats the way the world markets (behave)then we have to revise down realistically our growth target and potential, Subramanian said.Indias period of rapid growth of 8-9 per cent would not have been possible without the exports growth of 25 per cent, he added.According to the CEA, the immediate challenge faced by the economy was the twin balance-sheet problem  over-leveraged companies and bad loan-encumbered banks.When asked why has the government not been able to tackle this festering problem, he said, world over this is a very difficult problem. Its less about banks than it is about companies. Most stressed debt is with large companies. And then, there is always a temptation to see this as a morality play  that the guy has got away with it, and not as an economic problem, which it is today. In India, its doubly difficult because you have what you call the 4C problem  Court, CVC, CBI and CAG. I dont mean to be pejorative, but this is a fact of life, Subramanian said.WATCH VIDEO | Does Budget 2017 Incentivise Investment Into Housing Or Not?The Survey has advocated the setting up of a Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency, similar to what East Asian countries did after severe twin balance sheet problems in the 1990s.Also, private investment is unlikely to recover significantly, the Survey said, from the levels of FY2017. Some of this weakness could be offset through higher public investment, but that would depend on the stance of fiscal policy next year, which has to balance the short-term requirements of an economy recovering from demonetisation against the medium-term necessity of adhering to fiscal discipline  and the need to be seen as doing so, it said.The document has also flagged the Universal Basic Income (UBI) scheme as a conceptually appealing idea that could work as an alternative to the various social welfare programmes that are targeted at reducing poverty. There were a number of implementation challenges, especially the risk that it would become an add-on to, rather than a replacement of, current anti-poverty and social programmes, which would make it fiscally unaffordable, it noted.Listing the other challenges, the Survey said that vigilance would be essential to prevent a price spiral for certain agricultural products such as milk, sugar, potatoes and onions, whose supplies get affected due to currency shortages. The scope for monetary easing might also be narrow, if higher oil prices stoked inflationary pressure, it added.WATCH VIDEO | Budget 2017 Expectations: TaxesDetailing the impact of demonetisation on the economy, the Survey said, short-term costs have taken the form of inconvenience and hardship, especially those in the informal and cash-intensive sectors of the economy which have lost income and employment. These costs, however, are transitory, and may be minimised in recorded GDP as it estimates informal activity on the basis of formal sector indicators, which have not suffered to the same extent as informal sectors, the document said.In the long-term, demonetisation has the potential to generate benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitalization of the economy, increased flows of financial savings, and greater formalization of the economy, all of which could eventually lead to higher GDP growth, better tax compliance and greater tax revenues, it said.Since the magnitude and extent of short-term costs of demonetisation are uncertain, the Survey said that certain policy responses are needed by remonetising the economy expeditiously by supplying as much cash as necessary, especially in lower denomination notes, bringing land and real estate into the GST, reducing taxes and stamp duties and ensuring that the follow-up to demonetisation does not lead to over-zealous tax administration.The Survey said that the Indian economy recovering from demonetisation will need policy support, which could be in the form of lower policy rates and fiscal policy support as there is cyclical weakness on account of demonetisation.For all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App"

(File Photo) Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. (File Photo)The BJP-led government in Maharashtra has revoked the action that the Excise department had launched against two Marathwada-based distilleries accused of taking part in alleged illicit liquor frauds. Sugar baron Ratnakar Gutte owns one of the distilleries being probed. NCP sitting MLA Babanrao Shindes family controls the other. Gutte had unsuccessfully contested 2014 Assembly polls from Parbhanis Gangakhed as candidate of BJP-led alliance.Last October, state Excise Commissioner V Radha had permanently revoked the licences of both distilleries for their alleged role in separate illegal liquor nets. Her department had also lodged criminal complaints in both cases.On January 10, state Excise Minister Chandrasekhar Bavankule issued separate orders ordering restoration of the permits and cancellation of the Excise Commissioners orders. The Sunday Express possesses copies of both orders. The governments intervention comes at a time when proceedings in related matters are on in Bombay High Court.Bavankule has remarked that his orders were interim in nature and will be subject to the outcome of court matters. Both firms had filed appeals to the ministers office challenging the departments action. While deciding the appeals, Bavankule has gone with evidence put forth by Excise officials in justification of the action against the firms, but has cited long-term social impact that a permanent closure of these units may have on the backward Marathwada region as the main reason to upturn the revocation.Production was shut in both distilleries for three months; no further penalties have been imposed in the ministers orders.The firms should pay up the full extent of evaded duty on the goods, Bavankule has observed. The department must continue the legal process in criminal complaints filed in this respect.In Guttes case, licence of his molasses-based distillery  Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Pvt Ltd (Parbhani), which has a capacity of 60 kilolitres per day  was revoked on October 21, 2016. The department accused the firm of illegally supplying ethanol or rectified spirit for manufacture of illicit liquor. The firm was also charged with unauthorised transportation of intoxicants, unauthorised sale of duty-evaded intoxicants and violation of norms.On September 6, 2016, the departments enforcement division claimed that it had intercepted a tanker (MH04 DS 9808) containing 20,000 litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Pathardi. Investigators said driver and cleaner were arrested and revealed that the consignment had originated from Guttes distillery and was being transported to an illicit alcohol maker, a contention Gutte has denied.Gutte contended that all processes in the distillery were carried out under the supervision of the excise officials.On October 17, 2016, V Radha had revoked the country liquor licence of Osmanabad-based Vitthal Distilleries Private Limited, run by Shindes family, in a two-year-old case where Excise investigators had accused the firm of illegal sale and disposal of 23,227 litres of country liquor. The firm challenged the contention. The minister sided with the investigators but granted relief, making similar grounds as in Guttes case.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI photo)At his first election rally in Uttar Pradesh since polls were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the Samajwadi Party and Congress, saying the corrupt had joined hands to bring him down.Saying he wanted to return UPs debt to him for making him the PM  the BJP won 72 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state  Modi urged people to get rid of gangs and SCAM, so that development could be brought to the state, jobs could be provided to youths and security could be ensured for women. By SCAM, I mean S for Samajwadi (Party), C for Congress, A for Akhilesh (Yadav) and M for Mayawati. If you want to change UPs fate, change the government. You demolish the rule of SCAM with your votes, the PM said.He added, No matter how I try to help UP from Delhi, if the state government is not in our side, nothing can take place.In his hour-long speech at the meeting, dubbed Vijay Shankh Nad rally, corruption, nepotism, criminalisation and opportunism remained the main themes, with Modi talking of surgical strikes, demonetisation and the Union Budget sparingly. He also concentrated his attacks on the SP and Congress, and mentioned the BSP only twice.The crowd at Madhav Kunj Maidan cheered Modi every time he targeted his opponents.The BJP is facing a tough battle in western Uttar Pradesh, a region where it had made considerable gains in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls following the 2013 communal violence. BJP leader Chandra Mohan admitted the party campaign here would focus on law and order, alleged exodus of Hindus from the region, and the plight of sugarcane farmers.Invoking Meeruts link to the beginning of the 1857 mutiny against the British, the PM said he had chosen the city to start the war against poverty, corrupt forces and land-grabbers.It is the people of UP who made me the Prime Minister. And I have done everything in my capacity to bring honour to the state. Its been two and a half years. Is there any spot on me? However, I have not been able to repay my debt. I can repay my debt to the people of Uttar Pradesh only by joining hands with a state government that will work with me, he said.Only about Rs 2,800 crore of the Rs 7,000 crore the Centre had sent to UP for healthcare development in 2015-16 was spent and not even Rs 40 crore of the Rs 950 crore sent for Swachh campaign was used, the PM claimed. The funds could have been diverted by SP leaders, he added, but they could not do it because of him. Ye Modi hai, pai-pai ka hisaab manga hai (This is Modi. He accounts for each paisa).Modi went on to accuse Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of using Central funds for particular communities for vote-bank politics. It (the SP government) believes if the money cannot be spent on those who are its vote bank, it will let the funds rot. Tell me if assistance to those who are ill should be based on vote-bank politics, he said.The PM also ridiculed the new SP-Congress alliance, after the Congress had spent years criticising the SP government. Raaton raat, aisa kya ho gaya (What changed overnight)? They are embracing each other. They are sitting on each others shoulders to help each other. But those who could not save themselves cannot save UP, the PM said as the crowd cheered him.Targeting the Mulayam Singh Yadavs familys internal fights, Modi said, The whole day the government is busy with uncle, son, papa, nephew If you want to change UPs fate, change the government.Addressing the note ban issue, the PM said his move had upset those who had accummulated wealth over 40 years and filled their rooms with currencies. Those who filled rooms with currency notes collected by selling party tickets are very anguished as I forced them to deposit their money in banks. I knew they would all gang up against me. They will kick up a storm because Modi has robbed them.He reiterated his commitment to eradicate black money. Modi will not sit in peace until the fight against corruption reaches a conclusion. I will not let the robbers rest.Modi also tried to evoke the nationalism plank, which had earlier kept the party upbeat, by referring to the border surgical strikes, One Rank One Pension issues, and the Diwali he spent with soldiers. Now countries across the world are studying as to how Indian forces did such an operation on Pakistani soil. We made them (enemies) account for everything, the PM said.Criticising those who had expressed doubts on the surgical strikes, he said, Some of them doubted the operation because no Indian soldier lost his life.He reiterated the partys promise to waive loans of small and marginal farmers and to pay the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

Shetti, during his first Assembly election, had coined the phrase Vote Daya Note Daya (Give me your vote also give me a note).Watch What Else is Making NewsIn 2015, Ingole had made the headlines for his public interest litigation (PIL), seeking payment of interest to cane growers on late fair and remunerative price (FRP). The Aurangabad bench of the Mumbai High Court had directed the sugar commissioner to look into the matter and repeated hearings were held. Notwithstanding low sugar prices, millers had raced to clear the dues in fear of payment of interest.Talking about his debut in electoral politics, Ingole said, Being a small-scale farmer, Shetti had managed to take on the ruling elite and fight elections through crowdfunding. When I decided to throw in my hat for the electoral battle, I decided that my campaign too, would be crowdfunded.Ingole is seeking election from the Malegaon Panchayat Samiti ghat, which has 10 villages in it.Ingole said the response to his decision was overwhelming. Till Monday, I had already managed to collect Rs 15,000. Every village I went to, people went out of their way to help me, he said.At a few places, Ingole confessed, he could hardly control his tears. Farm hands went out of their way to donate for my election. Even though they are not voters in my constituency, he said.The villages, Ingole aims to represent, are from the arid regions of Ardhrapur taluka of Nanded district. Other than cane and soyabean, pulses are major crops in the area. The region has seen a rise in farmer suicides over the last few months. If elected, Ingole hopes to raise the issues related to farmers.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Between November 8 , 2016 and January 2017, 31 banks have reported Rs 7,087 crore being debited from their accounts and only Rs 2,241 crore being credited back to them. In the absence of any concrete move by both the RBI and Nabard, directors of these banks now fear for bankruptcy if urgent steps are not taken to address this exodus of funds.Watch What Else is Making NewsKnown for their wide rural footprint, the DCCBs have served as the nearest bank for many remote areas. Over the years, the share of the DCCBs in distribution of crop loan might have fallen to just 30 per cent of the total outlay but these banks still play an important role in the rural economy serving as the banking outlet for sugarcane payments, salaries for primary teachers etc. All cooperative institutions like sugar mills, dairies, spinning mills etc solely bank on these banks and disburse their payment through them.Since demonetisation, operations and transactions in these banks have almost stopped due to various restrictions put on them by the RBI. These banks were stopped from exchanging or depositing withdrawn notes and their demands for cash for distribution to their customers was hardly met. The RBI had maintained that the KYC norms of the account holders was not up to the mark. Following a PIL in the Supreme Court, Nabard had collected voluminous information about the accounts but the process of physical verification of the accounts is yet to start. The old currency notes that the banks had collected before the ban on them still lies unremitted in the vaults of the banks. On paper, these banks are now saddled with Rs 2,743 crore in withdrawn currency notes which the RBI or any other currency chest bank has refused to exchange with new currency notes.Between November and January, these banks had received Rs 2,241 crore of cash of which Rs 1,600 crore was from currency chest banks while Rs 641.49 crore was from local sources. As cash runs, account holders in these banks have taken to electronically transfer their money into banks, which are in a position to disburse cash. Thus, records show that between November and January, Rs 7,087.21 crore has been transferred out of these banks through RTGS while incoming RTGS is to the tune of Rs 4,971 crore  mostly in form of payments and salaries. Pune, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Raigad and Thane DCCBs have reported maximum outgoing RTGS.The imbalance, bankers say, is like a ticking timebomb that might result in around 7 banks losing their licence. RBI regulations have mandated that banks which fail to have 9 per cent capital adequacy ratio (CAR) by March 2017 might end up losing their banking licence. If the imbroglio continues, 7-8 banks might just lose their licence, said a senior official from the cooperative department.Suresh Birajdar, chairman of the Osmanabad DCCB, said despite them submitting all the documents to Nabard, the cash crunch continues at their ends.

(Reuters File Photo) Farmers collect corn for a cargo at a farm in Gaocheng, Hebei province, China. (Reuters File Photo)Beijing is urging regional authorities in the nations top four corn producing regions to offer subsidies to livestock feed companies, the latest move to boost demand for a bumper crop, according to a source briefed on the matter. The countrys State Administration of Grains and the Ministry of Finance issued a joint document dated Jan. 13 outlining the recommendations to northeastern regions of Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning and Jilin, according to the source and local media.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOnly feed producers that produced more than 50,000 tonnes in 2015 and have local operations can apply for the subsidy. The corn must also be bought by end-April and processed by end-June, according to the source.Other stipulations are that they must only use the funds to buy local corn harvested in 2016 and store it in their own facilities, the source said citing the document.The size of the subsidies, which would effectively make corn cheaper for feed producers, was not disclosed.Analysts also questioned the impact of the move as the bulk of Chinas vast feed-making industry, the top user of the grain is located in the countrys south and would not be eligible for the subsidies.Industry websites, including Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. Ltd (JCI) and cofeed.com, have also reported the details of the release without citing sources and photos of the document were circulating on Wechat, Chinas mobile social platform. Their authenticity could not be verified.A spokeswoman for the Grains Administration declined to comment. The Ministry of Finance had not responded to requests for comment.Its not known if the provinces, which are home to most of the countrys corn farmers, have complied with the recommendation.The move comes after China announced a strategy at the end of December to tackle its corn glut following a decade-long stockpiling programme, including a push to use more grain as livestock feed.It reflects an intensifying effort by Beijing to force regional authorities to bear the financial burden of buttressing their corn industries.In October last year, Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin doled out subsidies to corn processors, the second-largest users of the grain who make products such as corn starch, sugars and alcohol.But analysts said more corn processors had benefited from the subsidies and the impact of subsidies for only a few feed producers was likely to be limited.This wont help increase the demand for corn unlike the subsidies to corn processing companies, said Cofco Futures analyst Meng Jinhui.Still, it could give sentiment and prices a further boost.Hopes of central government measures to spur consumption have triggered a months-long rally, with prices hitting 18-month highs on Monday.

PTI Photo Rampur: UP CM and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav addresses an election rally in Rampur on Wednesday. PTI PhotoWith 73 constituencies and the possibility of triggering a wave that may just affect elections across Uttar Pradesh, an estimated 2.6 crore people in its western region will cast the first votes in the state Saturday. Ground zero for the 2013 violence that killed at least 65 and rendered thousands homeless and an alleged Hindu exodus, the region accounts for the most sensitive polling booths  at least 600  where video cameras will be installed to maintain law and order. The region has witnessed hectic campaigning over the last two weeks as parties fielded star campaigners in a last-minute rush to garner support. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and several cabinet ministers have addressed public meetings.At a rally in Muzaffarnagar last week, Akhilesh stressed the importance of being the first voters in UP. You are voting first in UP. You will set the tone for the rest of the state, he said. Sources in SP and BJP in western UP agreed. In such a phased election, the mood is very important. People can sense which way the wind is blowing and this is an advantage for everybody. To win UP, performance in western UP is a must, a senior BJP leader in Muzaffarnagar said. In the 2012 assembly polls, the SP and BSP won 24 seats each, followed by BJP (11), Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (9) and the Congress (5).The contours of the region changed a year later when violence  Muzaffarnagar and Shamli formed the epicentre  spread across several districts. Over three days starting September 7, 2013, at least 65 were killed, hundreds injured and thousands displaced  most of the affected were Muslims  as they fled villages to escape the carnage. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP swept all seats in western UP. While the BJP, SP and Congress have played down the 2013 violence in campaign speeches, it became the fulcrum for the BSP poll pitch. In her speeches, Mayawati has constantly referred to the riots and extolled her partys superior law and order track record. The region was also once a BSP bastion, where the party had enjoyed support from the combination of Muslims and Dalits.In 2017, Mayawati and BSP face stiff competition for the same electorate, particularly Muslims, after the Congress and SP announced an alliance and seat-sharing in UP. Other issues in the region include development of infrastructure and payment of sugar cane dues, the latter of which the RLD hopes to cash in on. There are 839 candidates in the fray in 15 districts where 26,823 polling stations have been set up. Among the electorate are 1.17 crore women and 1,508 belonging to third gender category. The largest constituency is Sahibabad, while Jalesar is the smallest.The maximum number of 26 candidates are in fray from Agra South, while the least number of aspirants are in Hastinapur with just six candidates. Prominent candidates include Pankaj Singh, son of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, from Noida; Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur from Mathura; Mriganka, daughter of BJP MP Hukum Singh who raised issues of a Hindu exodus, in Kairana; and, controversial BJP MLAs Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana from Sardhana and Thanabhawan.The Election Commission of India said elaborate security arrangements had been made in all districts. Around 6,000 paramilitary personnel are being deployed in all 887 polling centres in Muzaffarnagar and neighbouring Shamli, particularly areas that witnessed communal riots in 2013. Districts going to polls in the first phase are Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras, Agra, Firozabad, Etah and Kasganj. Chief Election Commissioner Naseem Zaidi, who reviewed poll preparations, said those who had migrated from Kairana for any reason, will be extended security if they take part in the polling process in their respective areas. The six other phases of polling are on February 15, 19, 23 and 27 and on March 4 and 8, while counting of votes will take place March 11.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

Elections are a complicated logistical exercise that blends colorful pageantry with more serious political issues. A village fair atmosphere takes over rural India as people troop to the nearest voting stations. Five key states, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand, are currently in the middle of elections to choose local legislatures. The voting began February 4 and ends on March 8. Votes from all the state polls will be counted on March 11. A look at some of the key election features:ELECTION SYMBOLSA bottle, an air conditioner, a television set, a lantern, an arrow, a bicycle, a loaf of bread: these are not shopping items but some of the many objects voters will see on the electronic voting machines as symbols for the dozens of political parties and independent candidates in the fray.More from Express:Symbols have been allocated to political parties since Indias first national election in 1951. Since barely a fifth of the population could read or write in the early 1950s, the symbols were introduced on ballot papers to help the unlettered cast their votes. Nearly three-quarters of Indians can now read but the icons remain evocative symbols of the major political groups.Indias best-known political symbols are the lotus flower for the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the outstretched hand or palm for the main opposition Congress party.The newest political party in the country, the Aam Aadmi Party, or the Common Mans Party, chose the broom as its election symbol, reflecting their claim that they mean to sweep clean the political system.The choice of symbols still available for selection with the countrys independent Election Commission includes an electric pole, cricket bat, pliers and even food items including a coconut and a cauliflower. Also available: a toothbrush and nail clippers.FREEBIESElection season in India is the time when political parties offer freebies in return for the votes.On offer this year are promises of laptops, smartphones, spice grinders, fans and loan waivers. The governing BJP is even offering sugar and clarified butter at low prices in northern Punjab state.In the past, farm workers got cows and goats in a southern state. Freebies are a fact of life in Indian politics. Some 270 million people, nearly 22 per cent of the countrys population, live in poverty, making giveaways particularly attractive to voters.The election-season freebies, however, raise questions about a fair playing field for smaller parties and independent candidates.In the absence of laws barring such campaign promises, the practice continues. In Indias northern Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the states top elected official, is promising free smartphones. In the previous 2014 election, he fulfilled his promise of free laptops for students after winning the vote.His main challenger, the BJP, also promised laptops, free internet and cooking gas to those who vote for them.ELECTION FUNDINGAnonymous cash donations to political parties, running into billions of rupees (hundreds of millions of dollars) are seen at the heart of Indias endemic corruption.Only a quarter of the annual income of the two main political parties, the BJP and the Congress party, comes from known sources and are declared in their tax returns. The rest is from anonymous donors, according to the Association of Democratic Reforms, a non-political group working for governmental and electoral reform.Corruption is a top issue in the elections, which came on the heels of a surprise Nov. 8 announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi eliminating the countrys highest denominated currency bills in what he called an attack on tax fraud and graft.The government also appears to have taken some steps to bring transparency to party funding.On February 1, Indias Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced in his budget speech that political parties will not be allowed to accept donations of more than 2,000 rupees ($29) in cash from an individual donor, instead of the 20,000 rupees ($295) allowed at present.A powerful regional group, the Bahujan Samaj Party, showed all donations it has received so far to be anonymous, below the legal limit of 20,000 rupees per donor.But several economists say that if the government were really serious about transparency, it should ban all cash donations.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Lending his father a hand as he proceeds to stand up, Vinayak admonishes, smiling, Dont shake them too much!Deshmukh is 97, and currently recovering from a surgery to repair a severely crushed spine that paralysed him last year. A follow-up visit on February 1 this year showed he had made remarkable recovery.Dr Ketan Khurjekar, Head of the Department of Spine Surgery at Sancheti hospital here, who led the operation, told Deshmukhs sons, He will be able to walk after regular exercises.Watch what else is in the newsAround June last year, Deshmukh started getting pain in his legs, rendering him almost immobile. Doctors found that he was suffering from tandem spinal stenosis, in which neurological compression in numerous areas of the spinal cord leads to functional loss.Vinayak admits that his father, a farmer from Bondle village in Maharashtras Solapur district owning 70 acres, who had been active all his life, found it impossible to lay inert in bed. They are a large family, comprising Deshmukhs nine children, including two daughters, and several grandchildren.Says Vinayak, My father could not lift his legs, passed urine without realising it and was heartbroken over the fact that he could no longer go to the temple and sing bhajans. His elder brother was a freedom fighter and was fit till he died at the age of 99. Deshmukhs wife too lived to old age, dying five years ago.Deshmukh pressed his sons for a surgery. The family also explored a hospital in Solapur and read about the disease on the Net before zeroing in on Sancheti Hospital.Dr Khurjekar admits that when the family first approached him for the operation, he was sceptical. Bhanudas had slipped vertebrae, bony outgrowth pressing over the spinal cord, and we were unsure whether a 97-year-old man could sustain anaesthesia.Apart from that, repairing the compressed spinal cord in the upper and lower back in a double surgery, over one sitting, was a challenge. The doctors only gave the go-ahead after experts monitored Deshmukhs vital parameters and found him fit for his first ever surgery.Vinayak points out that Deshmukh has never suffered from anything more major than fever or cough. The local ayurvedic doctor would manage all that. He doesnt have diabetes or hypertension etc, and doesnt even need spectacles.Dr Khurjekar told the family that after surgical decompression, there could be complete recovery of bowel function, and with therapeutic exercises, the patient could walk. That was all the 97-year-old wanted to hear.After pre-operation procedures that reconfirmed that Deshmukh was in excellent health, he underwent the two-hour-long operation on December 8 last year. While he was discharged after 10 days, a medical team including chief anaesthetist Dr Bharati Adhye and several others monitored him constantly.Deshmukh, who still enjoys his milk, sugar and bhakri made of jowar or bajra, is now waiting to resume his monthly visits to the temple town of Pandharpur, a distance of 30 km, which he used to cover on foot. I have missed going there for six months. My time has come again, he says, flashing a wide smile.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

In a democracy, people must equally participate in social welfare work as government, NGO and designated local bodies. As a state that understands the significance of water, people must come forward and join hands with the authorities to make conservation initiatives a success.I started working on check dam sites in the beginning of April. Ever since, I spend two hours working with labourers on sites every Saturday, and have worked on seven sites so far.Ever since I have started lending physical labour on sites, I have seen many students and youngsters join me when I step out for work. In my open letter I had listed out the ways in which people could do their bit; under the State's Self-Sufficiency Scheme (SSS), one can provide monetary help by sponsoring one-third of the expenditure of any village-level infrastructure project. I have appealed to people to join work at check dam sites and build recharge pits in their own neighbourhoods, which many are now doing, according to the reports we get. People have also been stone-walling their farms to prevent soil erosion and are coming forward to cut seemai karuvelam (Prosopis juliflora) trees too.The main challenge is that we don't view water scarcity as a long-term issue. I have mentioned this in my letter too. Rains are like a guest; they may come for four to five months and leave. The water that percolates during these months is all we have to survive the next eight months. We must work towards recharging ground water  our only permanent source of water. If it is limited, sustain it like you would sustain a limited salary for an entire month. I see farmers living near water bodies planting water-intensive crops such as sugarcane or banana, even as the rest of the village runs dry and opts for millet cultivation. These farmers must understand that percolated water is a common resource that everyone is entitled to. There is an urgent need for collective water management.In Thiruvannamalai district alone, we have 1900 tanks. The government has come up with the Kudimaramathu scheme , under which the Water Users' Association can contribute along with the government towards tank restoration projects. We had planned to build 1037 check dams in one month, out of which 1011 are done. But a check dam is just one step towards water conservation. The message we want to send out is one that is popularly used in water conservation: 'make running water walk, walking water stop and stopped water percolate.'"

More rains are expected in the next two days as the depression in the east central Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclonic storm 'MORA' and is now moving away from the island, it said.The incessant rains experienced since Thursday night have driven nearly half a million people out of their inundated homes in the southern and western regions.Police said a Sri Lankan Airforce helicopter (SLAF) MI-17 carrying relief aid for flood victims crashed in the southern Galle district, the worst hit of the 14 districts by flash floods and earth slips in the on going monsoonal rains, while carrying out relief operations in the flood-stricken areas. There were no casualties and Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena telephoned Squadron Leader Bhanuka Delgoda, the pilot of the MI-17, to congratulate him for his bravery.The pilot lost control of the helicopter due to bad weather and crashed into woods, police said.On Saturday, a Lanka Air Force airman, Y M S Yaparatne, 37, died while carrying out relief operations in the Galle district as he fell off from the helicopter.Flood waters were receding in the worst affected districts of Ratnapura and Kalutara but the authorities said cleaning up operations could take weeks. Some 412 houses were fully damaged with over 4,200 houses suffering partial damage. Some 471,000 people remain displaced while over 75,000 people are currently being housed in over 330 temporary relief accommodation.Following India's lead in sending out emergency relief to Sri Lanka, more countries have started pledging assistance to provide relief to the flood victims. China is to donate relief items worth of USD 2.2 million.The relief goods, to be dispatched to Colombo by a chartered flight soon, include tents, blankets, sheets, rain boots and life jackets. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang sent condolence messages to President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe respectively on the loss of the lives and property in floods and landslides caused by heavy rain.The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful Southwest monsoon, officials had said.Sri Lanka, which has been heavily deforested for cash crops, often witnesses landslides during the monsoon season."

Some of the risks associated with fasting are hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and dehydration. Its always advised to see your doctor a month prior of Ramadan to check your blood sugar levels and get advice about fasting.Can you fast?Based on the difference in blood sugar levels, Dr SG Mozam identifies three categories based on risks ; high, moderate and low. High risk patients should not fast for they have uncontrolled blood sugar levels.This would include people who have recently been hospitalized due to diabetes, pregnant women, who have acute illness, etc, . Moderate risk patients can safely fast if they keep to all the precautions. This category would include people who are suffering from pre and borderline diabetes.A healthy balanced dietDiabetics are always on a strict diet to maintain their health. This becomes impossible to follow during Ramadan due to irregular eating times and fasting. Its important to consume food rich in high carbs and fiber to satiate the hunger and provide strength.Don't drift to oily and spicy dishes for they fill up the stomach in less quantity and are bad for longer intervals. Fruits and green vegetables are your friends who will fill you up with important nutrients. Avoid juices and carbonated drinks for they have high sugar content."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 16: Untimely rain had forced residents to reach for their umbrellas, but the brief wet spell is set to give way to a gruelling summer as the local weather office has predicted. The weatherman says the mercury will rise gradually from March 20. According to today's Met report, rain and thundershower, along with squall, would continue in some parts of the state, but such weather conditions will be replaced by heat after March 20. The mercury may increase by 3-4C from what it is now, it said. Met director Sarat Chandra Sahu said the trough line, which runs from sub-Himalayan region to the southern parts of the state, continues to persist and was contributing to the squally weather condition. ""There are indications that the trough will weaken in the next 48 hours and simultaneously vanish around March 20,"" said Sahu. He further said the anti-cyclonic system, which was persistent over the Bay of Bengal, had also weakened recently. ""The present weather condition is favourable for a rise in the day temperature in the coming days. At present, the maximum temperature remains 3C below normal. It will rise by 2-3C after March 20,"" he said. In its weather bulletin, the Met department has forecast rain or thundershower in some pockets of the state. It also warns of thunder squall with wind speed reaching up to 60kmph in the coastal parts during the next 72 hours. City vendors, however, are gearing up for the summer and have already set up kiosks selling watermelons, sugarcane juice, lassi and sherbet.

593adadb7be9e07e719f27fa,GST rollout may not be rosy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/613950/gst-rollout-may-not-rosy.html,2017-05-28,"Mohan R Lavi, Bengaluru, May 28 2017, 0:00 ISTApart from finalising a few rules, the recent meeting of the Goods and Services Tax Council held in Srinagar ended with the announcement of the GST tariff for most goods and services. Last year, the Council had come to an agreement on five rates of GST  0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.The transition to GST provided an excellent opportunity to the lawmakers to substantially shorten the Central excise tariff and fit the shortened tariff into the above five rates. A simple method to do so would have been to fix the GST rates on the chapter headings instead of going into the detailed contents of each chapter.Like in most other things, in the GST law, the makers of the law have decided to use existing laws as the foundation on which to frame GST instead of thinking afresh. In fact, they have made it even more exhaustive and complicated by adding a list of more than 500 services classified into about 100 groups.The tax rates announced have generally pleased most people since essential items like sugar, edible oil, normal tea and coffee attract a GST rate of 5% while other items like cereals and jaggery have been exempted. Hair oil, toothpaste and soaps will be taxed at 18%  significantly lower than the present effective rate of 28%. The Council was unable to come to an agreement on the rates of taxes for two highly sensitive sectors  gold and textiles.While there was a general expectation that the tax rate on services would be 18%, the Council has allocated services among the four main rates of taxes. It is apparent that it has decided the rates on three criteria  extremely sensitive items, not so sensitive items and certainly not so sensitive items.Extremely sensitive items have been placed in the 0% and 5% brackets, not so sensitive items in the 12% bracket and luxury items in the 28% bracket. All items of goods and services that have not found a place in the above three brackets automatically came in the 18% bracket. The above observation is apparent if we look at the entries in Chapter 90.Hearing aids are taxed at 0%, coronary stents at 5%, spectacle lenses at 12% and goggles (other than corrective) at 28%. Since frames and mountings for spectacles, corrective goggles or the like and parts thereof did not meet the requirements of the above three rates, they were placed in the 18% category.There was a genuine concern in many quarters that high GST rates would lead to inflationary pressure. Inflation is usually a result of demand and supply and a high tax rate could curtail demand and also reduce supply. However, studies have proved that tax rates alone would not contribute much to inflation. Tax rates combined with other regulatory actions such as interest rate and monetary policies could have a spiralling effect on inflation in certain sectors.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could be looking at the impact that GST rates could have on certain sensitive sectors so they can tailor their monetary policy accordingly. Even otherwise, GST would have a small impact on inflation due to the fact that the general rate of tax on services and a number of goods is 18% and the input tax credit scheme under GST puts artificial restrictions on seamless availing of credit.Sensitive sectorsWhile the government has done well to protect sensitive sectors such as agriculture, healthcare and education, they should keep a watch on other equally sensitive sectors such as jewellery, textiles and infrastructure to ensure that the GST rates do not impact the sectors much. An uncomfortable rate for gold is going to only further encourage smuggling, one for textiles is going to have a direct impact on inflation while the one for infrastructure could add to the bad debts of banks.Many a time, industry resorts to reactionary inflation  creating an artificial shortage in goods in expectation of a negative tax policy from the government. The revenue secretary of the Ministry of Finance has stated that their internal estimates indicate a 2% fall post GST. While this seems good to hear, it would have had the desired effect had the basis for their estimates been revealed. The government may appear confident of containing inflation due to the anti-profiteering provisions in the GST law. However, it has to be stated that anti-profiteering as a concept is new to India and will take time to have an impact on prices on the ground.There can be no two thoughts on the fact that the GST tariffs for both goods and services need a relook. The GST Council must realise that a long tariff list does not necessarily mean a good tariff list. As a first step towards simplifying the GST tariff, the Council should stick to chapter headings and not get into minute details of each chapter. Is it really necessary for the government to pick and choose food preparations of flour, groats, meal, starch or malt extract, not containing cocoa or containing less than 40% by weight of cocoa calculated on a totally defatted basis, not elsewhere specified or included and tax it at 28%?Assuming for a moment that the government does want to revel in such minute detail, how is the tax officer going to know that the food preparation does not contain cocoa or containing less than 40% by weight of cocoa calculated on a totally defatted basis?Ideally, one would have thought that the first couple of years in the GST era would be devoted to comprehending the law and complying with it. The GST litigation would commence after a couple of years. The GST tariff classification ensures that the above expectation is unrealistic  litigation would commence from the day GST is rolled out. In short, the more one expects changes in GST, the more things remain the same.(The writer is a tax expert based in Bengaluru)"

Khot, who is a minister for state in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government, has become the target of ire of many for his alleged role in trying to break the ongoing farmers strike.Shettis Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) has a strong presence in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra. The farmers body had allied with the BJP both for the union and state elections of 2014. While the party itself could not better its previous performance, its alliance with the BJP had helped the party make inroads in the rural parts of western Maharashtra. Party leaders Ravikant Tupkar and Khot were accommodated in the state cabinet. Khot was made the minister of state for agriculture and marketing while Tupkar was made the chairman of the state textile corporation.Differences between Khot and Shetti started cropping up since the recently concluded zilla parishad elections. Khots son, Sagar Khot, had stood for elections which had not gone down well with the rank and file of the farmers body. Shetti had openly expressed his displeasure about the matter and when Sagar lost the polls, his father was quick to blame the MP for it. The rank and file of SSS were also not comfortable about the apparent closeness of Khot with the BJP. Murmurs of protest were heard from various factions of the Sanghatana, but Shetti had not taken a public stance about it. The complex caste equations in the sugar belt and Khot being the Maratha face of the party was one of the reasons for Shettis vacillation.As the demand for loan waiver gained ground, Shetti had launched a padyatra from Pune to Mumbai to do the same. The padyatra was called a Walk of Repentance, with Shetti expressing regret over his decision to go with the BJP in the polls. Khot was conspicuous by his absence from the walk and cited health issues when asked. The padyatara had received unprecedented support from farmers.After the padyatra, Shetti had announced that a large section of farmers wants him to severe his ties with the NDA and the ongoing farmers strike has upped the decibel level of the same. My supporters want me to severe tie with the BJP and I will put the matter before the executive council of the party, he said. Asked about Khot, Shetti said as the former was a disciplined party worker, he will abide by the partys decision. Tupkar told The Indian Express he would resign from his position if asked by the party. My alliance is with the movement not with the government, he said.While Khot remained unreachable for his quote, party workers said the farmers strike and his supposed role in trying to scuttle the same has maligned his image. Khot was the governments face for negotiation and it is alleged that he had planted his supporters in the now disbanded core committee to break the protest. In the sugar belt of Sangli, rumours are rife that Khot and his son will both join the BJP.

No official communication was forthcoming even at the end of these two sessions, intensifying rumours further.According to sources, during the meeting that lasted over one-and-a-half hours, the cabinet discussed topics including reduction in guideline value for unapproved plots, providing mortgage loans for unapproved properties, GST Bill, ensuing budget session, increasing the sugarcane procurement price, and appointment of vice chancellors to universities.After this, the cabinet, comprising most of the key leaders of the ruling faction, held a 30-minute discussion. Senior officials present during the cabinet meeting had left by then, sources said, adding that some significant announcements were likely in the coming days.Chairing the meeting, Chief Minister and leader of the ruling faction Palaniswami, delivered a plainspeak about the state of party affairs, and advised them on winning the hearts of the people, especially with the local body election round the corner.A section of party members are expecting a reshuffle in the State Cabinet to accommodate some of the influential leaders to ensure continuation of the government, which is under siege from the rebels and rivals alike. This was strengthened by the steady stream of MLAs who called on the chief minister in the last few days. One of them confided to Express that he had indeed sought the post of minister for himself, pointing out that his community was unrepresented in the cabinet.On Thursday, Perambalur MLA R Thamizhselvan (who was part of the team of disgruntled MLAs who held a meeting a few days ago) and former minister KT Pachaimal met Chief Minister Palaniswami.Immediately after the Cabinet meeting, Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan rushed to Raj Bhavan and held discussions with Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao for about 30 minutes. She was accompanied by Higher Education Secretary Sunil Paliwal, indicating that the appointment of vice chancellors to three State universities was on agenda."

Srinivasan asserted that the proposed rates of 12 percent and 18 percent tax for non air-conditioned and air-conditioned restaurants respectively under the new tax regime were too high and could discourage patrons from eating out, thus curtailing their profits.The hotel owners will once again put forth their demand for a five percent slab to be maintained in the forthcoming GST review meeting slated to take place on June 3 in New Delhi.With the new tax regime in place, Srinivasan believes that as the cost of food goes up, common man will be worst hit. Also, with eateries up to an annual turnover of Rs. 20 lakh being the only ones exempted from the GST, the overall cost of even the most basic items like tea and coffee are projected to go up, added Srinivasan.In a meeting held early last week, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the implementation of GST will enable a more consumer-friendly taxation system, which will exempt daily-use commodities from the levy.""Four different rate slab for services are five percent, 12 percent, standard rate of 18 percent and luxury rate of 28 percent, out of which five percent mostly comprises of transport services,"" said Jaitley while addressing the media in Srinagar.With regards to restaurants, Jaitley asserted that those with a turn-over of 50 lakhs or below can go over with a composition of five percent, while service tax on non air-conditioned restaurants will be 12 percent, and that on air-conditioned and liquor license will be 18 percent.Currently, some states levy Value Added Tax (VAT) on them. Daily-use items like sugar, tea, coffee (barring instant coffee), edible oil and life-saving drugs will attract the lowest tax rate of five percent, almost the same as current incidence.Hailed as a revolutionary tax regime, the GST is said to be India's biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It will replace a slew of federal and state levies, transforming Asia's third largest economy into a single market."

Fasting during Ramadan is a personal choice and for healthy adults, a decision easier to take than for those who may have a chronic illness such as diabetes.Even healthy adults sometimes experience short-term effects such as headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, low blood pressure and the inability to focus on certain attention-driven tasks. For people living with diabetes, there is a higher risk of managing these situations and most of all, ensuring that their blood sugar levels remain at a healthy level throughout the fasting period.The Ramadan fast ranges anywhere from 14 to 16 hours. Patients with diabetes need to have their meals at regular intervals which they cannot do if they are fasting for so long. Hypoglycemia, i.e. low blood sugar, is a common complication that arises when patients go for long periods without a meal. Other complications that could arise include compensatory hyperglycemia, dehydration and diabetic ketoacidosis.People with diabetes who wish to fast during Ramadan should consult their doctor who can give them a personalized management plan to minimize such complications. Three key factors that can help patients experience a healthy Ramadan are:Pre-fest health educationEvery patient should be made aware of his or her specific diabetes case and the potential risks of fasting. Ramadan-focused diabetes education is necessary to give knowledge that helps to make informed decisions on how to manage diabetes through the whole month and during the daily fast. Patients must also be informed about blood glucose monitoring, nutritional dos and donts, exercise, and medication adjustments.Such an education plan also alerts when their medical situation requires breaking the fast. Doctors must be contacted if:l One experiences symptoms of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia or any other physical uneasinessl One experiences strong headaches, excessive fatigue, blurry vision or a feeling of losing consciousnessA diabetes management planFor patients with diabetes, therapeutic modification is the cornerstone of a good Ramadan management plan. The type of medication to manage diabetes can influence the risks that come with fasting and therefore needs careful attention and possible modification. If a diabetes patient is on insulin therapy, he or she might need lesser dose of insulin before the start of the fast.Moreover, there may also be need to change the type of insulin used if patients choose to fast for Ramadan. Patients must visit their physicians about 6-8 weeks before Ramadan, and if needed, also consult a nutritionist. A doctor and nutritionist can provide the right guidance on medication and diet modification to manage the physiological changes brought on by fasting and ensure that blood sugar levels remain fully manageable during the fast.Regular blood sugar monitoringAn increasing number of doctors now believe that patients with diabetes who wish to fast should check their blood sugar levels regularly through the day and during the entire month of Ramadan. Patients must consult their doctor if their blood glucose levels drop below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or rise above 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L)For those living with diabetes, a condition that requires life-long management, it is easy to see why religious and medical recommendations allow exemption from fasting during Ramadan.However, for many people, fasting is a deeply spiritual experience and they insist on participating. For this reason, it is important for doctors and patients to work together and plan well ahead for a healthy and safe Ramadan.High risk groups advised against fastingl Pregnant women with hyperglycaemial History of recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemial Lack of understanding of hypo/hyperglycaemial History of poor diabetes control and/or non-compliance with medical treatmentl Patients unwilling or unable to monitor and manage their blood glucose levels(The doctor is a founder of Dr A Ramachandrans Diabetes Hospitals, Chennai and president of India Diabetes Research Foundation (IDRF)"

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, March 14: Police recovered a rhino horn from a vehicle carrying three suspected poachers which collided with a bus in the wee hours today on National Highway 27 at Baihata Chariali in Kamrup district. Two of the suspected poachers - Laminlal and Jakab Tulangchisi - died on the spot while Jakab Luwanga died at GNRC Hospitals this afternoon. Police recovered a rhino horn, arms, tranquillisers and 50g of brown sugar from the vehicle in which the trio were travelling towards Guwahati. The accident site is around 38km from here. ""After the accident, locals extricated two bodies from the mangled vehicle and sent the third person to hospital. We handed over the rhino horn to forest department officials and seized the drugs. We learned from the documents found on the trio that they were from Manipur,"" Twinkle Goswami, officer in-charge of Baihata Chariali police outpost said this evening. Baihata divisional forest officer (DFO) Bankim Sarma said, ""From our preliminary inspection, we ascertained the horn belongs to a female rhino around nine years old. The horn was cut out in haste, which is evident from the parts of the nasal bone, muscles and tendons stuck to it. From the blood clot, it can be assumed that the horn was chopped off last night. The horn weighs 400g."" Since the poachers died, forest officials are on the lookout for the dead rhino. Forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma said the district forest officers did not have any information of rhino being killed yesterday. ""The poachers were punished by God. I have asked all DFOs to find the dead rhino's carcass. The Kaziranga and Orang National Parks have already confirmed that the incident did not take place there. Combing operations are going on in the forests,"" she said. Brahma said the poachers are using new technology to enter national parks in Assam. ""I have been told that high-tech arms and tranquillisers were found on the poachers. Forest officials said the poachers were using inflatable rubber boats to cross rivers and enter Assam,"" Brahma said. There have been 10 cases of rhino poaching in Assam so far this year."
593adb3e7be9e00e1ecd2dd1,Prices give headache,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170315/jsp/business/story_140664.jsp,2017-03-15,"New Delhi, March 14: Retail inflation rose to 3.65 per cent and wholesale inflation spiked to a three-year high of 6.55 per cent in February as food prices became costlier, leaving no room for the central bank to ease the interest rate in its policy review in April. Consumer price (retail) inflation inched up to 3.65 per cent in February from 3.17 per cent in January, as the remonetisation pace picked up and spurred consumption demand. CPI (consumer price index) food inflation firmed up to 2.01 per cent in February from just 0.61 per cent in the previous month. The wholesale price-based inflation spiked to a three year high of 6.55 per cent in February mainly due to a spurt in mineral and fuel prices, while food prices started rising as well. WPI inflation has risen rapidly from 3.39 per cent in December to 5.25 per cent in January and over 6 per cent now. February WPI inflation was the steepest since August 2013 when it printed at 6.99 per cent. ""The uptick in CPI inflation in February 2017 was entirely expected given the unwinding of the base effect, and therefore, does not pose much concern. Nevertheless, the likelihood of a repo rate cut by the RBI in April 2017 remains subdued, given its focus on bringing inflation to 4 per cent in a durable manner. In fact, CPI inflation is expected to rise to above 4.5 per cent in March 2017, as the base effect continues to unwind and prices of perishables track a seasonal uptrend,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist with Icra, said. Inflation in fruits was higher at 8.33 per cent, fuel and light at 3.9 per cent in February. The rate of price rise in meat and fish was 3.5 per cent in February. Prices of sugar and confectionery items rose 18.83 per cent, while inflation in milk and milk product increased 4.22 per cent. The spurt in CPI and WPI inflation adds to the worries of a pent up demand after demonetisation which may prompt the RBI to keep policy interest rates unchanged for some more months. Last month, the RBI changed its monetary stance to ""neutral"" from ""accommodative"", marking an end to a period in which it cut interest rates by 175 bps from January 2015 to October 2016."

More than 80,000 others remained in relief camps as their homes were either destroyed or wiped out.The Indian contingent of more than 300 navy personnel was assisting in the relief, with divers searching the brackish waters and medical teams seeing patients in makeshift tents set up at shelters.INS 'Shardul' has nearly 200 personnel on board, including specialised rescue, diving and medical teams, as well as a large amount of relief material and Gemini inflatable boats.INS 'Kirch' was carrying 125 personnel. It had diving teams, relief supplies, inflatable gemini boats and a mobile medical teams.A third Indian naval ship arrived today, bringing relief supplies including rice, lentils, sugar, milk and blankets for the displaced.""Secy to President of SL and SL Navy chief receiving symbolically the relief material on board the 3rd relief and rescue ship INS Jalashwa,"" the High Commission of India in Colombo tweeted.India's Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Gopal Bagley tweeted ""SL Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and High Commissioner encouraging India n SL Navy jt medical and rescue teams from the 3rd Indian Ship"".Lankan army trucks transported drinking water and food to affected areas. Helicopters ferried medicine, relief supplies and inflatable boats to remote areas, while small vessels plied the floodwaters in search of people.Lankan Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said foreign assistance is continuing to flow in with India, China and Pakistan among the countries sending ship loads of humanitarian aid.The rebuilding effort was well underway with the government approving Rs 2.5 million for every damaged house. Over 900 hosues in 15 districts have been completely destroyed, the spokesman said.The disaster is described as one of the worst-ever calamities since the 2003 floods.The official death toll was at 193, with 94 others listed as missing, the Colombo Gazette reported.The MeT department in its weather forecast said the cyclonic storm MORA is expected to get weakened when it enters Bangladesh and the possibility for heavy rain and strong winds will be reduced by tomorrow.However, under its influence cloudy skies, windy and showery conditions are expected over the country.The MeT department warned that the sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Kankasanthurai and sea area off the coast extending from Galle to Batticaloa via Hambantota can be very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 70-80 kmph.There were scattered showers in many parts of Sri Lanka in the past 24 hours but flood waters were rapidly receding, officials said.State television broadcast called for public assistance to clean drinking wells contaminated by the monsoon floods.Lanka's water supply minister Rauf Hakeem said 40 per cent of those affected did not have access to piped drinkingwater, and there was an urgent need to clean contaminated wells in flood-affected areas.""Our workers have volunteered to join a major clean up,"" the minister said, adding that water distribution stations were flooded, disrupting the piped supply.In total, 545,243 people of 142,811 families were affected by the weather calamity. The South-West monsoon unleashed torrential rains, which ravaged fourteen districts in the western and southern parts on Friday and Thursday.The DMC had issued an urgent evacuation warning last evening instructing residents living along the Kelani river and within the Divisional Secretariats of Kollonnawa, Kaduwela, Wellampitiya, Kelaniya, Biyagama, Sedawatte, Dompe, Hanwella, Padukka and Avissawella to move to safer areas.It said water levels in the Kelani river were rising rapidly as indicted by the water gauges at Nagalagam Street, Hanwella and Glencourse and warned residents to move away from the vulnerable area as it was under an imminent flood threat.Those living along the banks of Nilwala Ganga, The Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga were also asked to move to safer areas because of the rising water levels.Meanwhile, the DMC requested the people to be vigilant on rising water levels.""Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western provinces. Heavy falls (about 150 mm) can be expected at some places,"" it said.Charities have warned on Monday that thousands of people affected by the floods and landslides are at the risk ofpotential fatal diseases such as dengue fever, as the death toll from the disaster continued to rise.On Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's orders, Rs two billion have been set aside to help the small and medium scale businesses destroyed by the floods, Senaratne said.Senaratne has rejected criticism that the goverment was not prepared to face the disaster.The government came under immense criticism over the absence of Minister of Disaster Management Anura Yapa who has not returned from a disaster management conference in Mexico.Wickremesinghe left the country yesterday for medical treatment after postponing the visit over the last 18 months, Senaratne said.Sri Lanka had sought international assistance, with India sending three naval ships laden with supplies in the last a couple of days.Following India's lead in sending out emergency relief to Sri Lanka, more countries started pledging assistance to provide relief to the flood victims.Australia has said it would provide 500,000 dollars.A Pakistani relief ship was also expected to arrive later today. At least three Chinese ships will come a day after tomorrow."

For this to be true, our dishes need to be prepared using hand-ground masalas and mud pot.I began cooking when I was seven. I used to help my mother with cooking and that's when I decided to take this as my profession. It was hard to accept when people addressed me as cook while I wanted to be called 'chef'. I had to earn the title. So, I spent 20 years to carve my identity.Now, I hold three Guinness World Records, one for the longest cooking marathon by an individual. I cooked 617 dishes weighing 190 kg in 24 hours 30 minutes and 12 seconds, using 486 kg of raw material. The other one was for making a 48.2 ft dosa with the help of 22 dosa masters. We sold that dosa for `10 lakh via auction and we donated the amount to orphanages.I set another record by cooking 15.4 tonnes of curry which fed 1.4 lakh people. Now, I plan on making 275 kg of idlis that can feed around 7,000 people. I am working on this and should be doing this by August.I love to experiment. I like to cook different varieties of food such as bitter guard soup, chilly halwa, potato jamun, sepa kelangu sweet and so on. South Indian, Chinese, tandoori, continental, Japanese, German and Italian cuisines are my forte. You can experiment a lot in Italian and continental dishes.The first dish that brought me fame was Andhra Kodi Vepudu in 2006.

Even as SUN's efforts to persuade India to join it have not been very successful, Maharashtra joined the movement in 2014 and Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand in 2016. SUN coordinator Gera Verburg of Netherlands is expected to meet Niti Aayog officials this week.Many countries that did not join the SUN network have raised the issue of conflict of interest in the SUN Business Network (SBN), which includes multinational food corporations like Pepsi, Cargill , Nutriset, Britannia , Unilever, Edesia, General Mills, Glaxo SKB, Mars, Indofood, Nutrifood, DSM and Valid Nutrition. In a document detailing the reasons for not joining networks like SUN, officials from a Brazilian government agency said that international initiatives on fighting malnutrition ought to forbid ""the participation of the business sector in the decision-making process and the management and implementation of both international and national strategies and policies"".They pointed out that ""such participation creates conflicts of interests and favours market-guided measures that ultimately result in the increase of food insecurity,"" and added that it goes against the concept of food sovereignty. Of the 58 countries in the SUN network, over 40 are from Africa . Though SUN -- started in 2010 -- claims to be a global movement, it has only aided recipient countries. The letter to Niti Aayog stated: ""We cannot see how the Government of India - or any other government claiming to uphold democratic principles - can allow themselves to be accountable to transnational corporations or philanthropic foundations rather than their citizens. Nor can we see how effective nutrition and public health policies can be adopted if consensus must first be reached with transnational food corporations.""The SUN approach, the letter argued, results in members sidelining sustainable strategies for prevention of malnutrition that NGOs focus on and instead promotes ready to use foods as a solution. Activists warned the agenda was to get India to sign up as it would add to SUN's profile to get India into its network, but this would bring little for India while facilitating business for multinational food corporations selling processed foods, especially those with high sugar, salt and fat content. Research in India has shown that commercially produced fortified, energy-dense food is not effective in treating children suffering from severe acute malnutrition."
593adbe57be9e07e719f28e0,Viewing visiting VVIPs,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/614342/viewing-visiting-vvips.html,2017-05-29,"Suryakumari Dennison, May 30 2017, 2:06 ISTLast week, there was a sudden burst of activity in my locality. Someone important was expected, and the traffic police rushed to clear vendors and vehicles off the streets. I did not stay to witness the grand arrival.How different from my childhood days in Delhi, when I avidly looked out for prominent personalities! The capital regularly played host to foreign dignitaries, and it was easy for me to see them. This was because I lived near that beautiful boulevard, Rajpath, which leads up Raisina Hill to the Presidents residence.Whenever a Head of State was in the city, a motorcade would wend its way through Rajpath, bearing the distinguished personage to Rashtrapati Bhavan. A similar scenario would unfold, as he or she emerged from that majestic edifice to embark on official engagements. A siren announcing the approach of the cavalcade would send my brother and me scurrying to catch a glimpse of the VVIP.More than a glimpse! Over five decades ago, security was not stifling, and we could stand close to the road. The famous figures we had gone to greet would move unhurriedly in open cars, acknowledging our cheers. On formal occasions, they would travel in the horse-drawn, presidential carriage, waving to the public.Racing to Rajpath was not always possible, but I managed some significant sightings. In December, 1959, when I was five years old and my brother yet unborn, my father pointed out the 34th President of the USA. I have no recollection of that illustrious gentleman, but I remember mishearing his name as Icing. Even today, at the mention of Eisenhower, I envisage a cake with pink and white frosting!Queen Elizabeth II evokes no such sugary image. Neither, however, do I recall the regal young woman she must have been, when she came to India with her husband, three months before her 35th birthday. I retain only a hazy impression of the royal couple but distinctly recall the Queen at a ceremony in London that I attended much earlier. At Trooping the Colour, she was resplendent in a military uniform and a bright shade of lipstick!Queen Elizabeth was the chief guest at our Republic Day Parade in 1961. As I watched the proceedings with my family, an onlooker remarked that the monarch was seated beside a man whom her father had imprisoned. I learnt later that the freedom fighter, who went on to become our first President, had been jailed during the Quit India Movement.It is unlikely that George VI was directly responsible for his incarceration, but my immature imagination ran wild.

Srinivasan asserted that the proposed rates of 12 percent and 18 percent tax for non air-conditioned and air-conditioned restaurants respectively under the new tax regime were too high and could discourage patrons from eating out, thus curtailing their profits.The hotel owners will once again put forth their demand for a five percent slab to be maintained in the forthcoming GST review meeting slated to take place on June 3 in New Delhi.With the new tax regime in place, Srinivasan believes that as the cost of food goes up, common man will be worst hit. Also, with eateries up to an annual turnover of Rs. 20 lakh being the only ones exempted from the GST, the overall cost of even the most basic items like tea and coffee are projected to go up, added Srinivasan.In a meeting held early last week, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the implementation of GST will enable a more consumer-friendly taxation system, which will exempt daily-use commodities from the levy.""Four different rate slab for services are five percent, 12 percent, standard rate of 18 percent and luxury rate of 28 percent, out of which five percent mostly comprises of transport services,"" said Jaitley while addressing the media in Srinagar.With regards to restaurants, Jaitley asserted that those with a turn-over of 50 lakhs or below can go over with a composition of five percent, while service tax on non air-conditioned restaurants will be 12 percent, and that on air-conditioned and liquor license will be 18 percent.Currently, some states levy Value Added Tax (VAT) on them. Daily-use items like sugar, tea, coffee (barring instant coffee), edible oil and life-saving drugs will attract the lowest tax rate of five percent, almost the same as current incidence.Hailed as a revolutionary tax regime, the GST is said to be India's biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It will replace a slew of federal and state levies, transforming Asia's third largest economy into a single market."

Fasting during Ramadan is a personal choice and for healthy adults, a decision easier to take than for those who may have a chronic illness such as diabetes.Even healthy adults sometimes experience short term effects such as headaches, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, low blood pressure and the inability to focus on certain attention-driven tasks. For people living with diabetes, there is a higher risk of managing these situations and most of all, ensuring that their blood sugar levels remain at a healthy level throughout the fasting period.The Ramadan fast ranges anywhere from 14 to 16 hours. Patients with diabetes need to have their meals at regular intervals which they cannot do if they are fasting for so long. Hypoglycemia, i.e. low blood sugar, is a common complication that arises when patients go for long periods without a meal. Other complications that could arise include compensatory hyperglycaemia, dehydration and diabetic ketoacidosis. People with diabetes who wish to fast during Ramadan should consult their doctor who can give them a personalized management plan to minimize such complications. Three key factors that can help patients experience a healthy Ramadan are:Pre-fest health educationEvery patient should be made aware of his or her specific diabetes case and the potential risks of fasting. Ramadan-focused diabetes education is necessary to give knowledge that helps to make informed decisions on how to manage diabetes through the whole month and during the daily fast. Patients must also be informed about blood glucose monitoring, nutritional dos and donts, exercise, and medication adjustments.Such an education plan also alerts when their medical situation requires breaking the fast. Doctors must be contacted if: One experiences symptoms of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia or any other physical uneasiness One experiences strong headaches, excessive fatigue, blurry vision or a feeling of losing consciousnessA diabetes management planFor patients with diabetes, therapeutic modification is the cornerstone of a good Ramadan management plan. The type of medication to manage diabetes can influence the risks that come with fasting and therefore needs careful attention and possible modification. If a diabetes patient is on insulin therapy, he or she might need lesser dose of insulin before the start of the fast. Moreover, there may also be need to change the type of insulin used if patients choose to fast for Ramadan. Patients must visit their physicians about 6-8 weeks before Ramadan, and if needed, also consult a nutritionist. A doctor and nutritionist can provide the right guidance on medication and diet modification to manage the physiological changes brought on by fasting and ensure that blood sugar levels remain fully manageable during the fast.Regular blood sugar monitoringAn increasing number of doctors now believe that patients with diabetes who wish to fast should check their blood sugar levels regularly through the day and during the entire month of Ramadan. Patients must consult their doctor if there is any noticeable change, i.e. if their blood glucose levels drop below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or rise above 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L)For those living with diabetes, a condition that requires life-long management, it is easy to see why religious and medical recommendations allow exemption from fasting during Ramadan. However, for many people, fasting is a deeply spiritual experience and they insist on participating. For this reason, it is important for doctors and patients to work together and plan well ahead for a healthy and safe Ramadan.High risk groups advised against fasting Pregnant women with hyperglycaemia History of recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia Lack of understanding of hypo/hyperglycaemia History of poor diabetes control and/or non-compliance with medical treatment Patients unwilling or unable to monitor and manage their blood glucose levelsThe author is a founder of Dr. A Ramachandrans Diabetes Hospitals, Chennai and president of India Diabetes Research Foundation (IDRF)"

(Source: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Dairy farmer Nitin Dhanvate with his cross-bred cows and six-month-old daughter. (Source: Partha Sarathi Biswas)After one-and-a-half years of incurring heavy losses, Nitin Dhanvates dairy business has just about turned around in the last four months. The 32-year-old is now receiving Rs 28 per litre for the cow milk, containing 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent SNF (solids-not-fat), he is supplying to Prabhat Dairy Ltd. The same dairy  and also the Godavari Khore cooperative and two private milk contractors operating in the village  was till December paying Rs 18 per litre.Dhanvate sells on an average 40 litres from his six Holstein-Friesian crossbreds, not all of which yield milk at the same time. My total monthly outgo on feed concentrates and other inputs comes to roughly Rs 24,000. Only since February have I been making a profit of nearly Rs 10,000 per month, as against losses of Rs 2,400 when the milk price was Rs 18 per litre, notes this full-time dairy farmer, who grows kadba (lucerne or alfalfa fodder) on his entire four-acre land. Had I been buying fodder, my losses would have been even more. But despite that, I have had to reduce my herd size from the 15 cows giving 100-odd litres daily two years back, he adds.Dhanvate epitomises the average angry young Maratha farmer of Puntamba, the village on the banks of the Godavari in Ahmednagar districts Rahata taluka that has spawned the ongoing agitation by ryots across western Maharashtra. He, like all other farmers here, has since June 1 stopped supplying milk to the four dairies/contractors procuring 5,000 litres or so daily from the village. Puntambas Gram Sabha, on April 3, passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to the Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included implementation of the MS Swaminathan committees recommendation of ensuring crop realisation levels at least 50 per cent above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100 per cent subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and  of immediate relevance to Dhanvate  a minimum milk purchase price of Rs 50 per litre.We not only wanted this price, but also a mechanism forcing dairies to pay it. Last June, the state government raised its official procurement price for cow milk from Rs 19 to Rs 22 a litre, but the dairies, both private and cooperative, were still paying us Rs 18. They started paying more from February, only because of milk shortages arising from farmers cutting back on production and herd sizes. And even the current prices will not be paid, once milk production recovers with the onset of the monsoon and increased fodder availability, says Dhanvate, who has seen better times when he selling his 100-plus litres that fetched a rate of Rs 25 or more.A billboard at the Puntamba village square asking farmers to participate in a Maharashtra bandh on June 1. Partha Sarathi Biswas A billboard at the Puntamba village square asking farmers to participate in a Maharashtra bandh on June 1. Partha Sarathi BiswasBut Puntambas crisis isnt about milk alone. Farmers in the 16,000-strong village with over 4,500 acres of largely-irrigated farmland and seven primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS)  which makes it relatively prosperous compared to the drought-prone rural landscapes of Marathwada or Vidarbha  also talk of their losses over the last 2-3 years from growing other crops, including onion, soybean and sugarcane.Sunil Pare, 49, claims to have spent Rs 70,000 on seed, fertiliser, labour, pesticide and other inputs for cultivation of rabi onions on his two-acre holding. Despite harvesting 130 quintals of the bulb in March, he is yet to sell a single kg so far. Prices at the Rahata market yard were Rs 500 per quintal in March and have only fallen further since to Rs 400-450. At these rates, I cannot even recover my investment. What alternative do I have other than holding on to my crop? he complains. The same story is repeated in soyabean, where Pare could realise just Rs 2,700 per quintal for the nine quintals that he sold in November  just after the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes. The previous years rate that Pare got was Rs 3,500 per quintal.Dhanajay Dhanvate, a 24-acre landowner and homeopathic doctor, who is also manager of the Asha Kiran Paraplegic Rehabilitation Centre at Puntamba, puts the total farm loan defaults in the village at Rs 1.80 crore. 80 per cent of our farmers are staring at economic insolvency. And these are not people who you could call poor by traditional standards, he says. But according to him, loan defaults  hence the demand for waiver  are only symptom; the real underlying disease is low prices. The unpaid loans owed by Puntambas farmers are primarily to Bank of Maharashtra, Axis Bank and four PACS, which, in turn, have borrowed from the Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank.The Puntamba farmers decision to go ahead with their Shetkari Sampa found favour with their counterparts in neighbouring villages and beyond. As the movement spread to the entire western belt  from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune down to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur  a five-member core committee was formed to negotiate with the state government. The committee included Dhananjay Jadhav, who belonged to Puntamba, and Dhananjay Dhorde from Dongaon, a nearby village in Vaijapur taluka.The stir began as scheduled on June 1, but was called off after two days, following a meeting of the core committee with the Chief Minister Fadnavis, who announced a Rs 30,000 crore loan waiver package targeting small and marginal farmers in the state. That decision, however, did not go well with most of Puntambas farmers. This was a complete betrayal. How could they have taken the decision to withdraw? They should at least have consulted the Gram Sabha, remarks Dhananjay Dhanvate. One indicator of the mood at Puntamba is that Jadhav has not returned to the village since the June 3 meeting in Mumbai that went on late into the night.The Puntamba farmers basic demand is a robust mechanism to ensure remunerative prices, which is the ultimate antidote to their chronic debt problems. What stops the government from forcing dairies to pay its declared procurement price? The Rs 22 per litre price is not much, but can at least keep us afloat. We can, then, try and cut costs through increased fodder yields and optimal feeding practices, observes Nitin Dhanvate.There are some others  such as Yogesh Rayate of Khadak Malegaon village of Nashiks Niphad taluka  who suggest that the government could also disseminate regular production and sowing area updates for crops such as onions: The government already knows the minimum area required to avoid production shortage. With satellite imagery, it is possible to also know the progressive area coverage on a daily basis. If the farmer is provided both the former and latter data during the sowing season, he will know how much exactly to plant and avoid overproduction.That suggestion is, perhaps, well worth considering in these troubled times.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This rather unthoughtful decision has caused panic and distress among the poor who cannot afford to purchase costly ration, Hridayesh said, demanding the BJP government immediately bring down the prices of the subsidised rice and wheat to the earlier slab.The APL families will have to shell out Rs 8.60 and Rs 15 to buy wheat and rice per kg respectively, for which they used to pay Rs 5 and Rs 9 before the price hike. To add to their woes the government has also banned the supply of subsidised sugar for them.Hridayesh claimed that the previous Congress government introduced the State Food Security Act to ensure that 45 lakh APL families could easily access subsidised ration. The legal provision was introduced for the left-out APL families which couldnt be covered under the National Food Security Act.Former minister Pritam Singh took a dig at the Rawat government, saying doubling the prices of subsidised ration for the poor was its only achievement since it formation a little over a month ago.Parliamentary affairs minister Prakash Pant defended the governments decision to hike prices. The prices were hiked in view of the market situation and the paying capacity of the APL families, he said.Unconvinced by the reply, angry Opposition members trooped into to the well of the House while sloganeering against the anti-poor Rawat government. In the din that followed, Speaker Prem Chandra Aggarwal rejected the oppositions demand for a debate on the issue of price hike of the subsidised ration.Angry opposition members staged a walkout in protest. The House witnessed uproarious scenes during zero hour as well. As soon as it began, BJP legislator Deshraj Karnawal thanked the Chair for accepting his request to put Dalit icon BR Ambedkars portraits on the walls of the Vidhan Sabha Bhawan.His statement evoked a sharp reaction from the opposition members who again trooped into the well of House to protest. An irate Congress legislator GS Kunjwal drew the Houses attention to vandalisation of Ambedkars statues in Pithoragarh and Almora.The former Speaker questioned Karnawal for not raising such a sensitive issue. This led to heated arguments from both sides, forcing Pant and Hridayesh to intervene. The legacy left behind by Babasaheb belongs to all of us. So, no one should try to appropriate that legacy, Hridayesh said.Later, Pant tabled the Uttarakhand Cooperative Committee (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the House, which was passed by a voice vote. He also tabled the State Goods and Services Tax Bill and the State Contingency Fund Bill. Both the bills are likely to be passed in the House on Tuesday."

Its liquor policy has rendered thousands unemployed and the poor are having a tough time since it hiked the prices of the subsidised ration, Leader of the Opposition Indira Hridayesh told a press conference here.We will raise these issues on the floor of the House, she added.Hridayesh said the Opposition would make a disclosure on a BJP leader threatening a Congress leader and seeking bribe after this years assembly election. We will raise this issue in the House and also handover a copy of the CD, showing the BJP leader asking for bribes, to the Speaker, she said.The Opposition was studying the Draft State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) Bill to be tabled in the assembly during its two-day session, Hridayesh, a former finance minister said.She warned that if the latest provisions incorporated into the SGST Bill were not found to be people friendly or went against the traders interests, the Opposition would vociferously take it up in the assembly.Hridayesh also hit out at the Trivendra Rawat government for its decision to raise prices of the subsidised ration for the Above Poverty Line (APL) families. According to officials more than 10,000 APL families covered under the State Food Security Act (SFSA) would now have to pay more to secure their quota of ration. Another 62 lakh APL families in the state are covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).She claimed that the previous Congress government had ensured that the APL families not covered under NFSA got subsidised ration under the SFSA. However, they are having a tough time now as the government doubled the prices of the subsidised rice and wheat, she said, claiming that they have also not been able to access the subsidised sugar after its supply was stopped by the BJP regime.She also alleged that the skewed liquor policy of the current dispensation has rendered thousands of people jobless in the states four districts, where Rawat government has banned liquor. They were hired by restaurateurs and hotel owners to serve liquor to guests at bar counters, Hridayesh claimed.Conversely, this government recently moved the Supreme Court urging it to allow sale and consumption of liquors in the nine hill districts on the lines of the Northeast states, she added.Hridayesh alleged that the BJP governments policy of zero tolerance on corruption has reduced to a mere slogan.That is evident from the fact that the CBI probe the government had recommended into the Rs 500-crore NH-74 scam has got nowhere, she added."

Photo credit: Twitter.The Income Tax Department has started a probe into the mining contracts allegedly bagged by four former employees of Punjab minister Rana Gurjit Singh. The department has also written to the Punjab government, seeking details of the mining contract bagged by four ex-employees of the minister.""An inquiry into the mining contract awarded to four persons whose names have appeared in newspaper reports, has been initiated but it is at preliminary stage now,"" an income tax official said today.Opposition parties, the AAP, the SAD and the BJP, have been demanding sacking of Rana, the state power and irrigation minister, for allegedly acquiring sand and gravel mines through ""benaami transactions in the name of his former cook and staff"".They had raised questions over the allotment of mining contracts to Amit Bahadur at Saidpur Khurd village in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar for Rs 26.51 crore, Kulvinder Paul Singh at Mehadipur in SBS Nagar for Rs 9.21 crore, Gurinder Singh at Rampur Kalan village in Mohali district for Rs 4.11 crore and Balraj Singh at Bairsal village for Rs 10.58 crore.A two-day e-auction of sand mines in Punjab had culminated with bids worth Rs 1,026 crore secured for 89 mines.The department has written to the state government to provide all details about the mining contracts. The IT sleuths have sought details such as at what rate the mining contract was allotted to them, how much upfront money has been deposited and what are their addresses, the official said.Tthe AAP had said the party leaders would sit on a 'dharna' outside the Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's house on May 30 if no action was taken against Rana. ""It is the money of Rana Gurjit Singh who pumped it through his four former employees to get the mining contracts in Punjab,"" AAP MLA Sukhpal Khaira had alleged.Khaira had also showed the copy of the purported income tax return of Bahadur, one of the minister's former cooks, to the media. ""As per income tax return for the financial year 2014-15 of the former cook, his income was about Rs 95,000. He was getting a salary of just Rs 11,706 per month. With such meagre income, will a cook be able to bag a mining contract of Rs 26 crore,"" Khaira had asked.Yesterday, the Congress had said the chief minister was looking into the allegation that Rana had acquired mines through ""benaami transactions"" and assured that the government was committed to uphold the trust reposed in it by the people.However, Rana had denied the charges, saying neither he nor his company, Rana Sugars Limited, had any direct or indirect stakes in sand mining business. ""The fact that some of my former employees reportedly bid for the mines does not in any way imply that I have interests or stakes in the business,"" he had said.""There are thousands of employees who have worked with me and left from time to time and I cannot be held accountable for what they do after leaving my companies,"" he had said. The Congress government had earlier claimed that there would be complete transparency in the e-auction of sand mines."

""He will be questioned to ascertain how he procured the contraband,"" said an excise official.The slum in Lakshmisagar police limits appears to have become a safe haven for brown sugar peddlers with a dozen of such cases being detected in the past 10 months.On April 4, the police seized 20 grams of brown sugar from one Arun Lenka at Lakshmisagar. On February 16, Lakshmisagar police arrested four drug peddlers from the slum and seized 40 grams of brown sugar from them.The police said the banned contraband was mostly smuggled into Odisha from states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal and then sold in cities, including Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Puri and Balasore. ""Most slum dwellers procure the contraband from Balasore and sell it in small sachets at prices between Rs 150 and Rs 200.

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, April 14: Pramod Kumar Sahoo was delighted when he received an order from the Lingaraj Temple office to prepare the special ""korakhai"" for the Prime Minister during his visit to the temple on Sunday morning. Korakhai will be offered to Lord Lingaraj and later it will be given it as prasad to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Not just Sahoo, the people of Old Town, where the 11th century Lord Lingaraj is located, are excited as this is the first time that they will catch a glimpse of the Prime Minister who is scheduled to visit the Lingaraj shrine. Incidentally, this is also the first prime ministerial visit to the shrine. Korakhai, a special kind of sweet, is made of khai, jaggery or sugar, coconut, and cardamoms. It involves a unique procedure that makes the taste different compared to other similar preparations of khai. Korakhai is associated with the culture of Lingaraj. The confectionary family of Old Town has been making the item for generations although there is no recorded history. The korakhai, also known as baikorakhai, is considered the sweet that every person who lives in Bhubaneswar loves, as it is offered to the presiding deity of Bhubaneswar, Lord Lingaraj, every day. Sahoo, 65, said: ""We have been making the special korakhai for the last 200 years. The legend goes that our family deity Basudev came in a dream to Bairagi Sahoo, our ancestor, and asked him to prepare the korakhai. Since then, we have been making this special item."" The confectioner said: ""Earlier, korakhai was the only sweet available in our area. Now, a number of sweetshops have come up. Besides, the number of diabetic patients has gone up. It has its impact on sales."" Sahoo said: ""We sell the special korakhai for Rs 220 per kg and the ordinary one at Rs 180 per kg. We sell 20 to 30 kilograms of korakhai each day. The sweet-making business is our livelihood. We cannot compromise with the quality as it will put a question mark on our family history."" However, he lamented that many shops without any ""pedigree"" have come up in the city and they too sell it. ""They call it baikorakhai. Earlier, I used to protest. But over the years, I stopped asking them not to use my family's name. The people who are aware of the quality of the baikorakhai still come to Old Town to buy our special korakhai."" His grandsons Pratik and Pradosh Sahu, are both engineers and are pursuing their careers independently. They are also proud of their family's ages-old tradition. ""As our elders are going ahead with the business, we have never interfered in this. But if the situation demands, we will take up the reins and take the family business forward. It is associated with our culture,"" said Pratik."

Next January it plans to impose a 5 percent value-added tax, a much bigger revenue-generating step.The other countries in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council have also agreed to impose the tax on tobacco and sugary drinks, and are expected to do so in coming months.

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170413/jsp/jharkhand/story_146033.jsp,2017-04-13,"Students of Narbheram Hansraj English School rustle up summer sips in Bistupur on Wednesday. Picture by Bhola Prasad When the scorching sun saps your energy, what do you do? Gulp down a can of soft drink perhaps. Now, that is super unhealthy because they contain carbonated water, sweetener and artificial flavouring. To keep you safe and going this summer, students of Narbheram Hansraj English School in Jamshedpur have taken it upon themselves to promote healthier and Made in India thirst quenchers, aka nimbupani and sattu sherbet. The students' club of the Bistupur-based cradle took to the streets of the steel city on Wednesday to offer commuters on the main road their swadeshi mocktails for free. The 9am to noon campaign was launched by principal Paramita Roy Chaudhury. Twenty-one students from Classes IX and XII, all members of the school's GK Club, divided work to rustle up the summer sips. The team, led by Kathakali Ghosh and Edward Manuel, both moderators of the club, bought 1,500 lemons, 20kg of sattu and 500 litres of water to push their swadeshi drinks. While offering glasses of the cool, refreshing drinks, the students also educated people on the detrimental effects of carbonated beverages. ""We too liked soft drinks once, but have pledged abstinence for a healthy life. We are promoting homemade summer coolers here,"" said Manu Sharma, a Class XII student. Aafreen Perween, also a twelfth grader, listed the pros and cons. ""With fizzy drinks, we are exposed to risks of obesity because of high sugar content, poor nutrition, reduced bone strength and tooth decay. In contrast, lime water helps in weight loss, it is good for digestion and also has an detox effect on our body. It is our new health mantra,"" she said. The Bistupur school, as a part of its social responsibilities, has started this mocktail promotion. On Tuesday, summer coolers were prepared on the campus for parents of kindergarten students to generate awareness. The school plans to undertake more such campaigns in the future. ""The response was very positive from parents. This is our way to tell people, especially teenagers, to stay away from harmful beverages. Obesity among students is a major concern and fizzy drinks have a lot to contribute to that problem. We shall continue organising the summer campaign,"" said moderator Ghosh. The student team not only promoted health drinks, but also proper hygiene habits. They used gloves to handle the ingredients and threw used plastic cups only in a trash bin. "" Sattu sherbet and nimbupani are anytime better than aerated beverages. These drinks give you an instant burst of energy,"" said Priyanka Jadav, a sales girl who enjoyed the swadeshi sip on her way to office. Another commuter admitted that he drank soft drinks in summer to quench thirst. ""But now, I will try and keep a bottle of lemon water while I am out for work,"" she said."
593add707be9e00e1ecd3090,Sacred Turf,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170417/jsp/opinion/story_146634.jsp,2017-04-17,"To mark the 100th year of M.K. Gandhi's political pilgrimage to Champaran, the Bihar government has organized a week-long celebration from April 10 to 17. This will be followed by other functions throughout the year. It was two years after Gandhi touched down on Indian shores - January 9, 1915 - following over 20 years of stay in South Africa, that he decided to explore the rural interiors of India. As the British had adopted a strategy of deception to conquer India after over a century-long campaign involving several small battles and skirmishes, Gandhi opted for the weapon of peaceful satyagraha to beat them back. Thirty-two years later, when the truth finally prevailed, instead of celebrating Independence in Delhi, he was in Noakhali (now in Bangladesh) fighting communal strife, the by-product of British rule. It was in South Africa that Gandhi witnessed first-hand the sufferings of indentured labourers, many of whom were from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. He campaigned against this practice of bonded servitude, which had started after the abolition of slavery in England in 1834. Surprisingly, it was in 1917 that the system of indentured labour was abolished officially. The peasants of Champaran, forced by European planters to grow indigo, provided Gandhi with the best possible launching pad for his struggle. The region was among the least industrialized. Cultivators were compelled to grow indigo for cotton mills that were owned by the British. A year later, Gandhi was in Ahmedabad and then in Kheda to fight for the cause of mill workers and farmers, respectively, in his home state of Gujarat. Common strands A century later, Champaran continues to be largely agrarian and the least industrialized part of Bihar. Some sugar mills did come up in the district - later divided into East and West Champaran - in the name of industries. Now they are facing closure. Most goods from Nepal enter through Raxaul, a border town in East Champaran, after passing through Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar as Calcutta serves as the transit port for the Himalyan republic. Champaran is known for smuggling as well as cross-border Maoist activities. Champaran is also the birthplace of the English novelist, Eric Arthur Blair, famously known as George Orwell. He was born in Motihari in 1903, and his father was a narcotics officer employed with the British civil service. Champaran has hardly any 'animal farm'- a satire written by Orwell - even though it has the Valmikinagar forest reserve. By '1984'- another book by Orwell - the largely flood-prone riverine belt had become a hotbed of robbery and kidnapping. Several years later, the then West Champaran superintendent of police, Abhayanand,who went on to become the DGP of Bihar, played a key role in crushing these problems. A hundred years later Gandhi's janmabhoomi - Gujarat - and his first karmabhoomi in India - Bihar - have one thing in common: prohibition. Gujarat imposed prohibition a long time back while Bihar was declared a dry state by the present chief minister, Nitish Kumar, in April 2016. Motihari, the district headquarters of East Champaran, can boast of a Central university named after the Mahatma. Even though it came up during the reign of the United Progressive Alliance, it is yet to function as a full-fledged institution. Incidentally, Gandhi, who was born in the western coast, and graduated from the political nurseries of Champaran, Ahmedabad, Kheda and Dandi, among other places, died in Delhi. For millions of lesser mortals across India, he is still their loving Bapu, and not an Orwellian Big Brother."

""The department is yet to procure reagents kits to conduct tests. We are waiting for the tenders to be processed soon,"" said Dr Ashok Tiwari, in-charge of Shakir Ali Khan hospital located along Hamidia road.All three automated analyser machines were procured with a three year warranty period. Two of these machines have run out of warranty time but the department of gas relief and rehabilitation is yet to get diagnostic kits, said an activist.Automated analyser is a medical laboratory instrument designed to measure different chemicals and other characteristics in a number of biological samples quickly, with minimum human assistance. The fast and accurate tests conducted by the analyser can be utilised to check various disorders.After the issue was brought to the notice of the SC-appointed monitoring committee looking into relief and medical rehabilitation of gas victims, the Gas Rahat hospital administration started focussing on procuring diagnostic tests for blood sugar, kidney and jaundice.Automated analyser can conduct about 300 plus tests in one go. A test kit for diagnosing common ailments costs about Rs 3,000. The shelf life of these kits is usually about a month. Gas rahat department officials say that in hospitals like Shakir Ali Khan the number of diagnostic tests range from 70 to 100 per day. ""Auto-analyser machines should be utilised in patients' interest.

593addea7be9e009ad91b5d8,Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Jawan rum! Travancore sugars gets high on profit,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/jun/06/yo-ho-ho-and-a-bottle-of-jawan-rum-travancore-sugars-gets-high-on-profit-1613281.html,2017-06-06,"TIRUVALLA : Antiquated buildings peppered with rust and dust give you the creeps as you walk into the premises of this public sector undertaking. It may appear as yet another neglected white elephant, sucking dry the state exchequer.But make no mistake, the Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd (TSCL) in Pulikeezhu is a goose laying golden eggs. It is one of the few units in the state brewing success, literally. The seven-decade-old enterprise on the banks of the Pampa River churns out a profit of Rs 1 lakh a day by producing just one item - the Jawan Deluxe XXX Rum.The sugar factory-turned-distillery raked in a profit of Rs 4.57 crore in the year 2016-17 with a turnover of Rs 59.34 crore from the sale of 15.53 lakh cases of the brew. Apart from its 50-odd staff, the unit also employs 75 women belonging to the Kudumbashree units of Kadapra, Peringara and Niranam panchayats under Pulikeezhu Block Panchayat. When many other PSUs turned out to be loss-making ventures, how did TSCL manage to mint money?We are the market leaders because we keep the standards of quality high , TSCL general manager and MD Alex P Abraham told Express. We can match any of the market leaders in quality. The best extra neutral alcohol and spirit are used here.Both ENA and the rum undergo tests at the government lab, he said.Working on an 8 am to 5 pm schedule, the company produces 6,000 cases of liquor daily, amounting to nearly 60,000 litres of rum a year. A one-litre bottle of rum -costing Rs 42.20 in the factory - is sold for Rs 400 (inclusive of all taxes) at retail outlets. Jawan reached the common man in 2008.Earlier, the supply was limited to the military. The company started producing rum and a few other alcoholic beverages during the British rule. Later, the commercial production of arrack from the byproduct of sugar was also begun. Though we had the monopoly in the beginning, trouble started as the government lifted control over buying spirit from outside the state , deputy manager P M John said. Then the production itself stopped as the government banned arrack in 1996. In a way, it turned to be a boon for us.The company had to face many obstacles when it was under Industries and Taxes and Excise departments. The labyrinth of red tape hindered its progress. Ego clashes between various political parties and fights within different groups of the same outfit had an adverse effect on TSCL.Even the earnest attempts by veteran Congress leader Oommen Chandy, who was a union leader here from the late 70s, proved futile. However, the steps taken by the LDF Government in 2006 and the initiatives by the then Industries Minister Elamaram Kareem and Excise Minister P K Gurudasan ushered in a new era.TSCL underwent major changes on its journey to progress. The government shifted it to the departments of Taxes and Excise and clubbed its post of MD and director board with that of the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC), ushering in a new chapter. Once spread across 90 acres, the campus has been reduced to 50 acres as a portion of the land was set apart for some other government facilities.Even then, the factory and the warehouses occupy only 10 per cent of the plot. A large channel connected to the Pampa river remains a mute witness to the factorys hey days when hundreds of boats carrying sugarcane used to criss-cross it . It can mint millions if the capacity of the unit is hiked to one lakh cases per annum, said Alex. However, it depends on government policy as the product is liquor, he said."

He said the state government decision to scrap 15 public holidays in the name of prominent personalities was already projected to save Rs 50,000 crore of state revenue annually.Yogi reasoned that state gross domestic product (GDP) was to the tune of Rs 12 lakh crore, which comes to Rs 1 lakh crore per month. By scrapping 15 holidays, therefore, the state government would be able save Rs 50,000 crore through maximum utilisation of manpower. He said the state government also intends to save funds in the health sector by roping in ambulances provided by Centre free of cost. Maintaining that as many as 150 such ambulances have already been pushed into service, Yogi said the bigger districts would be provided two more ambulances in the near future.His statement came minutes after Opposition led by the Samajwadi Party created uproar in the House accusing the BJP government of digressing from its commitment to waive off loans of farmers. Yogi, however, said the state government was committed to its promises and would do its bit for welfare of the people. The farm loan waiver alone is expected to cause an additional burden of Rs 36,000 crore on the coffers. This would be apart from financial burden of Rs 30,000 crore with the implementation of the 7th pay commission.He said ongoing wheat procurement process in the present government was 2.5 times more than what it was in the previous government. ""This was being done without any discrimination in terms of caste, religion and region,"" he said.The CM said state government has already paid Rs 22,000 crore to cane growers in the present crushing season. This, he said, was much more than what was paid in the previous crushing season. Yogi said while sugar mills formed the backbone of the state's industrial economy, mills faced closure. ""The previous government did nothing for the better of sugar industry and instead sold them off clandestinely,"" said Yogi, adding that all CHCs, PHCs and government hospitals would soon be equipped with 'Jansuvidha Medical Stores' where cheap medicines would be made available."
593ade4c7be9e00e1ecd31ef,Nitish taps Pasis with deft neera move,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170414/jsp/bihar/story_146245.jsp,2017-04-14,"(From left) Industries principal secretary S Sidhartha and excise commissioner Aditya Kumar Das inaugurate the workshop in Patna on Thursday. Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Patna, April 13: The Bihar government has announced a plan for the toddy-tapping community in what political pundits said was a deft move that would carve out a fresh vote bank for chief minister Nitish Kumar. The state government will provide licences to tap neera (unfermented palm/ date/coconut sap) free of cost, but the licences will be given only to those who climb the trees for it. The licences will mention the number and location of trees the person climbs. The government will also provide social security cover and insurance against accidents to the licence holders. They will be allowed to sell neera without any restrictions across the state, or process it into jaggery, sugar and other products. Those who want to move away from their traditional occupation will be given opportunities to avail loans up to Rs 1 crore, which the state industries department would facilitate. ""We are making efforts not only to provide alternative employment opportunities to the people who were previously engaged in the toddy business for livelihood, but also to provide a better standard of living,"" industries department principal secretary S Siddharth said. He announced the measures while inaugurating a daylong workshop on the ""Neera project"" in Patna today to train members of the Pasi community on how to tap palm sap and store it so that it doesn't ferment or become contaminated. Excise commissioner Aditya Kumar Das was also present. ""The government wants to help them (toddy-tappers) if they want to move to other professions or businesses,"" Siddharth said. Those who climb palm trees to tap toddy mostly hail from the Pasi community, which is a Scheduled Caste. According to the Akhil Bharatiya Pasi Samaj (ABPS), around 40 lakh people - the figure could not be independently verified - in Bihar are part of the toddy-tapping community. When Nitish clamped total prohibition on April 5, 2016, somehow the impression went out that toddy has also been banned though it was not. This led to widespread agitations by Pasi groups. The chief minister later clarified that toddy would be banned from the next financial year, i.e. 2017-18, and only after alternative livelihood arrangements for toddy-tappers are put in place. Toddy was finally banned through the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, which came into effect from October 2, 2016. By that time the toddy season was practically over so no agitation happened. The government pushed ahead with its neera plan and things are being put in place for the toddy season that has now started. ""At first the Pasis, who are socio-economically among the weakest sections in the society, had opposed the 'ban' citing loss of livelihood,"" said a senior professor of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies who did not want to be identified. ""Some political parties had tried to exploit their sentiments. But Nitish not only deftly overcame the issues, he also promised them better employment opportunities and kept his word. He will surely have immense electoral benefits of this move."" The government has also set up four neera processing plants at Hajipur (Vaishali), Khijarsarai (Gaya), Biharsharif (Nalanda) and Barari (Bhagalpur), with capacity to process 10,000 litres daily. ""Our aim is to promote local consumption of neera and jaggery or sugar made from it,"" Siddharth said. ""The unsold sap would be lifted for processing plants. We are working out the rates that would be given to the tappers."" The ABPS is demanding a rate of Rs 50 per litre. Industries department officials said these plants will start production in a couple of weeks. According to an agriculture department survey, there are around 1.3 crore palm trees (including date and coconut trees) in the state, and each tree can produce up to 10 litres of neera daily."

A truck full of milk packets destroyed in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh even as the Congress party backs the protestsMUMBAI/BHOPAL:The call for a shutdown across Maharashtra, except Mumbai, as part of the ongoing farmers protests, evoked good response on Monday from various sections of the society, though it disrupted normal life in different parts of the State. In some places, the protests turned violent.With Puntamba, the epicentre of the protests, remaining completely shut, Nashik, Kolhapur and Sangli were some of the other major centres where life was thrown out of gear due to the bandh.Farmers and Jai Jawan Jai Kisan activists pour milk on the road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh in Nagpur on Monday;The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) remained open in some places such as Pune, Solapur, Dhule and Navi Mumbai.All major APMCs from Nashik district, including Lasalgaon, Pimpalgaon and Niphad, remained closed. Life in cities across the district too was affected. Major markets in Sangli and Kolhapur were completely shut down.Farmers in Chandwad resorted to road roko on the Manmad-Chandwad road. There was also a onion-throwing protest in Yeola of Nashik district. Farmers on bullock carts blocked the Nashik-Niphad-Chandwad road to extend support to the bandh.Farmers in Puntamba also stopped trains carrying agricultural goods from Gujarat to Pune. In Sangamner, farmers burnt an effigy of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and condemned the policies of the government.Minor clashes over closing of shops were reported from Kolhapur, where workers of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana were aggressive. Milk tankers from Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara going to Mumbai via the Mumbai-Pune expressway were given Z-category security to avoid untoward incidents.In Madhya Pradesh, the 10-day farmers stir took a political turn on Monday, with the opposition Congress announcing support to the agitation. State Congress chief Arun Yadav said the Congress is aggressively supporting the agitation by the farmers and party workers have been instructed to join the crusade of the agitating farmers.Reports of farmers enforcing a shutdown in Mandsaur and looting and destroying a truck full of milk packets in Jhabua district surfaced on Monday.MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan launched a veiled attack on the opposition party, alleging that certain vested interests were behind the violent protests. The farmers are not at all involved in violence, its anti-social elements and certain vested interests who are behind the violence, said Chouhan. He also stressed on the need for the government to purchase agricultural produce at more cost whenever the market prices go down. The CM announced that a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs 1,000 crore is being set up for this.While maintaining that a bumper onion crop had triggered price crash, Chouhan said the government has decided to purchase onions from farmers at Rs 8 per kg. The process has already begun in Indore, Ujjain and Mandsaur districts. Also, it has been decided to purchase moong and toor pulses at Rs 5,500 and Rs 5,050 per quintal.While the RSS-affiliated Bhartiya Kisan Sangh had called off the stir following a meeting with the CM on Sunday, other bodies like Bhartiya Kisan Union and Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh are yet to call of the 10-day long protest.Why are the two states facing trouble?Farmers from the drought-hit states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh have taken to the streets in the last few days.

593ade767be9e07a5a19f9c2,"Truant monsoon, odd weather sting them more than honey bees",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/truant-monsoon-odd-weather-sting-them-more-than-honey-bees/articleshow/58795895.cms,2017-05-23,"CHENNAI: Erratic climatic conditions and a truant monsoon last year seem to have taken a toll on the production of honey in Marthandam, a small town in the western part of Kanyakumari district. Known as the honey capital of the state, Marthandam along with its surrounding villages, generates (from hives kept in Kanyakumari and Kerala) around 6 lakh kg of honey annually. While a profitable yield in a season ranges from 18kg to 20kg per hive, this year the yield was hardly 5kg per hive. Beekeepers blame it on the failure of the monsoon and untimely rains that aborted the blossoming of flowers. Even the small amount of flowers that blossomed was damaged due to unseasonal rains, rue beekeepers. Honey bees store nectar in the hives to feed the larvae. But a lack of flowers has led to a negligible collection of nectar this year,"" says P Henry, a large scale beekeeper from Kottur village near Marthandam.The industry that employs around 50,000 beekeepers and labourers in and around Marthandam operates along the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Kerala for easy access to the flora of the region. Rubber estates in the region are an added advantage. Rubber trees sprout new leaves after winter and the buds carry nectar, which serve as a raw material for honey.The harvesting of honey which starts in February is done in two spells  first in Kerala from February to March and in Tamil Nadu from April to May. Beekeepers place their hives in rubber estates and plantations and move from place to place to maintain hives and harvest them during the respective seasons. During off seasons, they feed the bees with sugar syrup.While the scarcity of flowers has hit them hard, beekeepers say unseasonal rains also washed away their only alternative  nectar from the sprouts of rubber trees. Sources from the Marthandam Beekeepers' Co-op Society said unusual climatic conditions, especially prolonged sunlight without monsoon rains contributed to steep fall in honey production this year.The crisis has heavily hit small-time beekeepers who had invested a lot on artificial hive boxes, bees and maintenance charges, says D C Wilson Brow who had placed 150 hives in Pechiparai area this year. A beekeeper spends around `1800 to maintain an artificial hive and honey bees. Brow couldn't get returns from even 50 boxes. ""We get only three months to harvest honey after nine months of maintaining hives,"" he says. Dejected by the loss, Brow abandoned plans of expanding to 250 boxes in the coming season.The menace of sloth bears in hilly terrains is another challenge that beekeepers have to encounter this year. Due to the scarcity of food, bears raid bee hives for honey and break the hive boxes, says environmentalist S S Davidson, who runs Tribal Foundation for Kani Tribe people living in forest areas of Western Ghats in Kanyakumari district.The situation is no better for the Kani tribe that harvests natural honey for a living. ""They are unable to locate bee hives in the usual places as there is a probability that honey bees withdrew into deep jungle areas in search of flowers,"" he adds.Beekeepers who feel they don't get reasonable prices for their produce despite an enormous demand for pure honey in the market say the government should come forward to procure honey from beekeepers of the region at minimum support price. ""We have also been demanding to set up honey bee research centre at Marthandam and provide us guidance from experts in apiculture ,"" Henry adds."

With 10 albums under their name, South Asian acapella group Penn Masala comprising Anvit Reddy, Sanjit Chakravarty, Hari Ravi, Ajay Vasisht, Pranay Sharma, Praveen Rajaguru, Brendan McManus, Kasish Hora, Yamir Tainwala, Vishnu Rachakonda, Nikhil Raman, Atman Panigrahi, Anirudh Bikmal and Wrik Sinha recently performed in the city. In an exclusive chat with Bangalore Times , the members of the music band spoke about their music and how they handle female fan following. Excerpts:""The group was formed in 1996 with four guys in a dorm room at the University of Pennsylvania. A capella was just on the rise back then. So, these guys saw all sorts of a capella groups on campus and thought 'why not form a group that mixes Hindi and English music, combining the two heritages that they grew up with.' It's been 20 years now,"" says Hari.""We try and highlight different genres that are also based on every member's individual interest. We also look at what songs are popular and try to incorporate those numbers into our list. And we choose tracks that have a different meaning, and can be weaved together. If we have two songs with different meanings, we try to bring it together and don't just do a mash-up of two songs. The songs have to have a meaning and certain charisma to them. In addition, we have released 10 albums, and originals are a huge part of our music. We try to do one or two originals for every album,"" Hari adds.""While putting together an album, we try to take our influences from many genres and put them together in a package. Some of them include R&B, EDM, classic and alternate rock,"" he further says.""Our primary challenge is that we keep rotating our members. Every year, the seniors graduate and we take in freshmen, which is a new learning curve for us because we have to teach the newest members a capella background and such. However, that is also our strength because it keeps our music fresh since we keep taking in new talent, and are exposed to new genres of music. It keeps our music fresh with time,"" adds Hari.""Hari and I have performed songs at an award ceremony for the music directors who have created those songs, with the Bollywood stars that we all grew up watching, it was a mind-blowing experience for all of us to perform for them. It's not something that we are going to forget anytime soon. In terms of moving forward, it has been a great way to move ahead and keep coming back to India and hopefully we get to do that more in the future,"" says Pranay.""All are fans are amazing. It's great to see how much of energy they bring in to a show, how much energy they show when we put out new content. We are just happy that we have such extreme fan following,"" adds Hari.""We do try and incorporate other languages in our songs. In the past, we have incorporated Urdu, Arabic, Malayalam, and Tamil in various aspects. Moving forward, we would love to do more musical tracks,"" says Hari.""We plan to put up more mash-up content, and are focusing on short one to two minute songs and finding popular Hindi and English songs and mashing them up together,"" says Anvit.""There are so many but we would love to collaborate with Arijit Singh. We are such big fans of his music and we sing a lot of his songs. Even meeting him, not collaborating with him would be amazing,"" says Pranay.The group was greeted by some unexpected rain showers at the venue. However, when they saw eager fans waiting for them to perform, they went ahead and did a mic-less performance (before alternate arrangements were made) and sang some foot-tapping numbers like Humma Humma , Sugar by Maroon 5 and Dilliwali Girlfriend much to their fans' delight. The band said that if their fans can wait for them in the rain, they can perform for them in the rain as well."
593adeae7be9e00e1ecd3285,Mill duo's suicide bid,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170411/jsp/bihar/story_145683.jsp,2017-04-11,"Two persons attempted suicide by immolating themselves in Motihari in East Champaran district on a day countrywide celebrations began to mark the centenary of the Champaran Satyagraha of Mahatma Gandhi. Motihari, around 155km north of the state capital, is associated with Gandhi, who had arrived there in 1917 to wage a non-violent battle for the emancipation of indigo farmers from the harassment of the British. The two persons, identified as Suraj Baitha (51) and Naresh Shrivastava (54) are employees of a now-closed Motihari Sugar Mill, which belongs to the Calcutta-based Nopani family. They have suffered 35 per cent and 93 per cent burns, respectively. Condition of both is said to be critical and they have been shifted to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment. ""We have kept Suraj and Naresh in the ICU. Their condition is serious and we are making all efforts to save them,"" a doctor taking care of them at PMCH said. The incident coincided with police firing and lathicharge on a gathering of over 200 sugar mill employees who were agitating to demand revival of the mill and settlement of their unpaid wages since 2002, when it was shut. Eyewitnesses said the sugar mill workers have been agitating to press for their demands for the past several years and had also threatened self-immolation, but the district administration had not anticipated that the matter would suddenly worsen. As administrative and police officials arrived at the place of agitation under Chhatauni police station, the workers panicked and attacked them. It was followed by police firing in the air, teargas and lathicharge to disperse the crowd in which around three dozen people were injured. The incident has come as an embarrassment for the state government, which has organised a two-day national conclave on the occasion to discuss Gandhi's thoughts and find a way out for the country plagued with intolerance and agrarian crisis. East Champaran superintendent of police (SP) Jitendra Rana told The Telegraph: ""The police team had gone there to escort a delegation of agitating mill workers to meet the district magistrate as part of the ongoing talks between them and the district magistrate. However, some criminals present among the workers attacked the police team."" The East Champaran SP pointed out that while the melee was going on, Suraj and Nagesh tried to immolate themselves. Jitendra asserted that the police ""fired three bullets in the air, used teargas and resorted to lathicharge only after the crowd present there tried to prevent the police from rescuing the two victims"". An FIR has been registered against seven persons and the police is viewing photographs and videos of the incident to take action. ""There is a distinct possibility of involvement of criminals in the garb of sugar mill workers because the police team had gone to the spot to escort their delegation to DM's office. We are investigating the case to find out what happened to worsen the situation when talks were scheduled between workers and district administration,"" the SP added."

Despite the government's decision to allow duty free import of raw sugar up to 0.5 million tonnes, lower inventory because of a fall in production is expected to keep prices range bound, according to mills and market analysts. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) has lowered its production estimate to 203 lakh tonnes from 213 lakh tonnes as sugarcane yield in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in January and February was lower than expected. ""Sugar prices are expected to remain firm in sugar season 2017 because closing inventory is seen to be at an eight-year low following a fall in production in Maharashtra and Karnataka. That's despite the government's recent move to allow duty-free import of raw sugar of 0.45 million tonnes till June 12, 2017, and a fall in consumption because of demonetisation,"" research firm Crisil said in a report. Crisil, however, added that the government's policy on imports would remain ""a key monitorable"" in the coming months. With high cash accruals (because of stable prices) and no proposed greenfield expansion, Crisil also expects the debt burden of the mills to ease. ""According to Isma and Icra estimates, mills are likely to produce 203 lakh tonnes in sugar season 2016-17, 19 per cent lower than last year's 251 lakh tonnes. Moreover, mills have stopped crushing early this year because of insufficient availability of sugarcane in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We expect the prices to remain firm in the coming months because of a deficient production forecast and diminishing stocks in the domestic market,"" said Ritesh Kumar Sahu, analyst (agri commodities) at Angel Broking. ""Domestic prices are likely to reign at Rs 37-40 per kg. If the import duty is scrapped, this will fall to Rs 29-30 per kg,"" said India Ratings and Research. There is a 40 per cent duty on sugar imports in India. The research firm also expects northern millers to perform better with profitability 15-20 per cent higher than units in the south and west. According to Isma data, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 9 lakh tonnes more than what it was last year. Isma, however, expects sugarcane availability to improve next year in Maharashtra and mills in the west and south are likely to start crushing cane in the first half of October 2017. ""With Diwali now being earlier on October 19, 2017, the mills in north India will also start crushing by the latter part of October. Hence, sugar from the new season will be available in the market by the end of October,"" said Isma."

Residents can enjoy khaja (wafered sweet) from Silao, belgrami (made of solidified milk) from Udwantnagar in Bhojpur, lai (cereal mixed with khowa in the shape of a ball) from Barh and tilkut (made with sesame seeds and jaggery or sugar) from Gaya at reasonable rates. If sweets are not enough, something spicy such as Champaran meat and Darbhanga fish is also on the table. People made a beeline for Ahuna mutton that is cooked in an earthen pot in Champaran. The pot is covered with a layer of wheat flour. Taash, another mutton dish from the Champaran region, is also available. ""We serve the real taste of Champaran meat.

DH photoMySugar factory in Mandya has been abuzz with activity for the past one month. This has raised the hopes of farmers and the people in the region that the factory will resume operations soon.The factory, which is the lifeline of the people of Mandya district, has stopped crushing for the past three years. The renewed activities have raised hopes that the factory would resume operations from July 15, the date set by District in-charge Minster M Krishnappa.According to sources, the Boiler Inspector is expected to visit the factory on May 27 and issue a certificate. Around 4,000 tonnes of bagasse (sugarcane husk) and 2,000 tonnes of firewood have already been collected for beginning the power generation unit. With 2.5 lakh tonnes of sugarcane grown in the region, discussions are being held with farmers for procurement.Puttaswamy Gowda, the new Sugarcane Development Officer of the factory, has approached cane growers and issued permission for a supply of cane grown on one lakh hectares.Salaries disbursedSpeaking to DH, an employee of MySugar said that the management recently released one months salary and they hope that the factory would begin functioning by July 15.The boiler was started on April 14 on Ambedkar Jayanti. District in-charge Minister Krishnappa, MLA Ambareesh and others participated in the puja and promised to provide all financial help to revive the MySugar factory.MySugar Managing Director Prakash said that both the factory and the power generation unit will be started at the same time and all preparations are being made to ensure that the factory becomes functional. Raw materials have been procured and salaries have been disbursed to the employees to instil confidence among them, he said.Interviews have been held at the factorys Bengaluru office for filling the posts of engineers. The appointments will be made on a contract basis, he said.Challenges aheadHe said the biggest challenge before the factory is fixing the price for sugarcane. The jaggery-making units are ready to pay Rs 3,200 per tonne. As per the Centres directive they should pay Rs 2,550 per tonne. The excess price is decided by the state government. Discussions are on to fix a scientific price so that farmers are not disappointed, Prakash said.Emotional bondRaitha Sangha district unit president Shambunahalli Suresh said that farmers will supply sugarcane even if the factory pays Rs 100 less as they share an emotional bonding with the factory.The Sugar minister has failed to take any step to begin the factory. The ministers are succumbing to the lobby of private factories. Stopping of MySugar is the reason behind the rise in suicide of farmers in the district.

The Noida authority had in October 2016 allotted 30 acres of industrial land to Samsung India Electronics, which aims to expand its smartphone manufacturing unit in Noida. Samsung already had one industrial unit on an around 45-acre plot in Phase-2 industrial area in the same sector.Noida and Greater Noida have the potential to become a Singapore soon in terms of manufacturing of electronics products. And Samsung can become a global manufacturing lion, said Prasad.Noida houses 600 IT units, mostly along the Noida Expressway in sectors 125, 126, 127 and 135 among others. Around 1.5 lakh IT professionals are working with various IT firms, BPO units and MNCs operating from Noida. IT major Infosys is also developing its campus in Noida with an investment of Rs1, 354 crore.Apart from IT services, Noida has also become a hub of smartphone makers. Chinese smartphone maker Oppo has its manufacturing unit in Noida and is also planning to build a 110-acre manufacturing unit in neighbouring Greater Noida. Lava opened its first mobile manufacturing unit in Noidas Sector 58 in 2015 and also decided to set up another unit along Yamuna Expressway near Greater Noida. Chinas Vivo Mobile too is based in Greater Noida.Indias digital story is beginning to unfold. We aim to make 50 crore smartphones in the next two to three years. We are giving all the support that is required from the government, said Prasad.Uttar Pradesh industries minister Satish Mahana and minister of state (independent charge), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development Suresh Rana were also present at the event in Noida.Mahana said he will ensure that setting up of industrial units gets speedy clearances.The Samsung team came up to me in Lucknow and expressed their intention to leave UP and set up their unit in another state because the system was not supporting them. I took them to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and we expedited the clearances required. Earlier, they were investing Rs2,000 crore, but now Samsung is investing Rs4,915 crore in its Noida unit, said Mahana.We have directed Noida and Greater Noida to simplify the building layout map approval for industrial units so that interested industrialists can invest here. We want to encourage industries and create jobs for the youth, he added."
