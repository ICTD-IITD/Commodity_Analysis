''Terrorists, criminals who are into smuggling narcotics and FICN and human traffickers use this route to sneak into the country and over the years, this border has become extremely porous.Therefore, there is a need to have effective surveillance mechanisms,'' sources said. Last year, the BSF had installed operational ''laser walls'' or infrared fencing along the India-Pakistan International Border in Punjab to keep an effective vigil on terrorists and narcotics smugglers. Sources said the sensors would be monitored through a satellite-based signal command system that will also have night and fog operability tools besides other latest features. ''For any person to cross the Indo-Nepal border in Uttar Pradesh, all that is required is an ID proof.Over the years, smuggling has become rampant and so also the movement of intruders and terrorists who then travel to different parts of the country to execute their nefarious designs. We wanted non-obtrusive checking mechanisms as this border witnesses hectic activity involving genuine citizens of both countries,'' said a field official posted on the Indo-Nepal border. Recently, the SSB personnel had nabbed active Hizbul Mujahideen militant Naseer Ahmed at the Sonauli border checkpost when he sneaked in from Nepal. His handlers in Jammu and Kashmir had asked him to go to Gorakhpur and await further instructions. For all terror groups, the Indo-Nepal border has been the easiest way of sneaking into the country with explosives and there have been regular intelligence inputs about the terrorists, human traffickers and narcotic smugglers.MORE GADGETS FOR SSBBesides infrared fencing, the SSB officials are also introducing state-of-the-art explosive-cum-narcotic detectors, fibroscope (a flexible fiber-optic bundle with an eyepiece on one end and a lens on the other used to examine and inspect small, difficult-to-reach places such as the insides of machines, locks, and the human body to check smuggling of explosive material, narcotics, etc) and X-ray baggage scanners.TRAFFICKING ON THE RISEA steady increase in cases of human trafficking from across the Nepal border and Indian towns in the vicinity has prompted security agencies to undertake new measures to check the menace. As per data available with the SSB, a total of 33 victims, both Indian and Nepalese, were apprehended on the border by the force in 2014, while eight traffickers were nabbed. The figures rose to 336 in 2015 when more than 100 traffickers were nabbed. In 2016, the figures went up to an alarming 501 and 148. From the beginning of 2017 (first four months), close to 200 victims have been rescued by the SSB, while more than 50 traffickers have been arrested so far.FICN, ARMS AND NARCOTICSIn 2015, the SSB seized fake currency worth Rs 36,000, six arms along with ammunition and 2.55 kg potassium besides huge quantities of heroin, brown sugar, cocaine, charas and smack (worth Rs 20 crore) and arrested 51 people. In 2016, eight arms with ammunition besides large quantities of narcotics (worth over Rs 71 crore) were seized and 93 accused were arrested. Similarly, in the first couple of months of 2017, narcotics worth Rs 57 lakh was seized and three persons were apprehended. Besides narcotics, people have also been smuggling forest products, sand, beetul nuts, idols, gold and silver among other items.

Besides, this will encourage farmers to take up other crops.The BJP in the run up to 2014 Lok Sabha elections had promised to ensure 50 per cent profit to farmers on their input costs. While the Centre has failed keep its promise to the farmers, the State Government has passed a unanimous resolution during the Budget session of the Assembly urging the Centre to fix MSP at `2,930 per quintal of paddy.Responding to Deb, State BJP vice-president Samir Mohanty said this is one of many suggestions NITI Aayog has given to the Centre which is yet to take a call on the issue.Mohanty advised the State Government to follow the Chhattisgarh Government which has been providing a bonus of `300 per quintal of paddy to its farmers over and above the MSP.Dubbing this as an attempt to deflect the attention of people from the real issue, Mohanty said the State Government should take concrete measures to protect farmers from selling onion at distress price.The BJP leader advised the State Government to seek assistance of the Centre under the market intervention scheme (MIS) to save farmers from resorting to distress sale."
593ae0c47be9e07e719f2d24,Tax refunds under GST may hurt exports: FIEO,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/613575/tax-refunds-gst-may-hurt.html,2017-05-25,"Tax refunds under GST may hurt exports: FIEODH News Service, New Delhi, May 25 2017, 23:00 ISTExports by MSME sector will be affectedThe tax refund mechanism after GST rollout may reduce Indias export competitiveness to the tune of 2% per year if government does not bear the cost, premier exporters body Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said on Thursday.Exports by micro and small sectors will be hurt the most, it said. In the new indirect tax regime, exporters have to pay GST upfront for importing inputs for their exports as opposed to the current regime where exemption certificates issued by the state does the work.GST as its spin off effect would benefit both manufacturing and export sectors. The quick refund as against delayed refund of VAT will also help the export sector. However, we are worried with the liquidity issue as the refund mechanism would require payment of GST first and its refund later, apex export body FIEO President G K Gupta told reporters here.He said the additional cost of credit to manage the liquidity should be borne by the government, if present exemption is not brought forward in the GST. On the rough estimate, the export sector would be losing export competitiveness by about 2% and the same needs to be off-setted to the export sector, he said.He said while FIEO welcomed the refund rules envisaging issuance of acknowledgement within three days of filing of claim and issuance of 90% of the claim within seven days, unfortunately contrary to the general belief, the interest on delayed payment would be due only after 60 days.This will give jolt to exporters particularly in micro and small sectors. FIEO, therefore, requests the government to provide interest on delayed refund after 10 days instead of 60, Gupta said.Sugar, tea, coffee to be a lot more cheaper under GST regimeSugar, tea and coffee (other than instant coffee) and milk powder will be cheaper after GST rollout, the government said on Thursday. Proposed GST Tax rates would be much lesser than the prevailing incidence of taxes in case of sugar, tea and coffee (other than instant coffee) and milk powder, the finance ministry said.Sugar attracts specific central excise duty of Rs 71 per quintal plus sugar cess of Rs 124 per quintal, which translates to ad valorem rate of more than 6%.Including incidence on account of account of CST, octroi, and entry tax, the present total tax incidence would work out to more than 8%. As against this, the proposed GST rate on sugar is only 5%. This is 3% less than present incidence of taxes, the ministry clarified in a statement.Tea and coffee (other than instant coffee) attract nil central excise duty and VAT rate of 5%."

(Representational) Back in the 20th century, there was a credible reason for letting the pantheon of the freedom struggle beam down upon students, who were presumed to be preparing to join the project of nation-building. (Representational)Chhattisgarhs government schools have been directed to install a large mirror and keep nail clippers and a comb handy, so that students can check for themselves how tidy they are. Self-image is indeed important for young people preparing to go out into the world, and putting their grooming into their own hands also teaches responsibility towards oneself. But along with this very welcome self-image, three images which have nothing to do with learning will also be enshrined in school premises  portraits of the president, prime minister and chief minister  ostensibly because students are asked questions about these political luminaries. Logically and fruitfully, they could be replaced by images of Thiruvalluvar, Sugarloaf Mountain and a wombat, since students are also tested for their knowledge of literature, geography and the life sciences.Back in the 20th century, there was a credible reason for letting the pantheon of the freedom struggle beam down upon students, who were presumed to be preparing to join the project of nation-building. However, in a mature democracy, politics and the people who drive it should be kept out of the schoolroom. Now, pedagogy should be conducted in a culture of openness and enquiry, in which children are encouraged to explore possibilities, instead of restricting them to the narrow tunnel of politically mandated projects. No credible reason remains to overawe students with images of the ruling deities of the political firmament.The world of knowledge has enough heroes of its own. Are school students familiar with the faces of K.G. Subramanyan, M.N. Srinivas and Meghnad Saha? They should be. Images of pathbreakers like Marie Curie, Johannes Kepler and Rene Descartes grace the labs and libraries of European schools. Indian schools neglect to teach students very much about the Indian stars of the firmament of knowledge, such as Aryabhatta, Varahamihira, Sushruta and Kalidasa. By all means, let us have pictures of them put up in schools all over India, and not only in Chhattisgarh. Of the trinity that will preside over the states schools, only the president stands apart. On Teachers Day last year, he taught an excellent class on political and constitutional history in a school on the Presidents Estate in Delhi. But then, his picture will have to be replaced when he demits office in a couple of months, so even that doesnt count.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

They pointed to a pilot involving 14 children, of whom only two showed improvement.Under this scheme, a paste is given to all malnourished children.The food paste consists of peanut butter, sugar, vegetable oil and milk providing the kids 500 calories.Targeting the states women and child welfare department, activists involved in the malnutrition eradication programme expressed shock that despite the disastrous results of the pilot at Nandurbar, the department is adamant to go ahead with the RUTF scheme. In the pilot project, out of the 14 malnourished children, just two improved while the other 12 remained malnourished. As long as the food paste packets are served, children gained weight but after the paste was stopped, they started losing weight again, said Purnima Upadhyay, coordinator, Jan Arogya Abhiyaan.She alleged that several children became addicted to the sweet paste and refused to eat freshly cooked home food. Both the Supreme Court and Centre guidelines say Mahila Mandals and self help groups need to be roped in to provide local nutritious food to the malnourished children. But here we can see the whole scheme being tailor-made to suit the contractor, said Brian Lobo, an activist who works for malnourished children at Palghar.The state provides nutritious food to the malnourished children between the age of 6 months to 6 years. This is done through the Anganwadis and village child development centres (VCDC) at the village level. Here the fresh food meals were given to children under supervision and it cost it Rs18 crore annually. However two years ago, the state abolished the VCDC saying that they had no funds to finance this scheme.Minister of state for women and children welfare Vidya Thakur refused to comment. I am currently in a programme and cannot talk now, said Thakur."

One man should not be allowed to take the whole party down, he said.Another cabinet minister said: Rana will have to go. Its just a matter of time. The government cannot be seen as giving him a clean chit. However, senior cabinet minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa, said the CM has ordered a judicial probe and they should wait for the outcome.But the governments worry is not so much of losing face as the prospect of the issue derailing its preparedness for the budget session. Its much-hyped ammo of white paper on financial mismanagement during the 10-year rule of the Akaki-BJP government may go unnoticed, if not unused, if the Opposition AAP and the SAD-BJP stall the session demanding Ranas ouster, resulting in a washout.On the back foot, the government is also mulling to delay the session to mid-June expecting the storm to blow over.The MLAs, who have been meeting the CM in the last few days in batches with problems in their constituencies, have left it to state party chief Sunil Jakhar to convey their feelings to the CM that the issue should not be allowed to linger on.The minister should quit till his name is cleared. It is a huge embarrassment for us and our government as just nine ministers have been sworn in and one of them is already facing charges of benami stakes in sand mines. People have no faith in the judicial commissions set up by the government. The intent should show on part of the CM or the minister should resign on his own calling, a MLA said, wishing not to be named.But some wannabe ministers are not so forthcoming. It is too early to say anything. The government made sand mining a fair game by going for e-auction. Rana is an established industrialist and does not need to go for benami deals, All India Youth Congress chief and Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring said.Though Rana has said Amit Bahadur and Kulvinder Paul, who have bagged mining contracts, are his former employees and his friend Capt JS Randhawa has claimed they are working partners of his son Sanjit Randhawas firms, what may queer the pitch for Rana is the three other firms in which Bahadur is a director bear the same email id or address as his company, Rana Sugars. Even if the money trail for mining bids may lead to bank accounts of Randhawas firms, the ministers poll affidavit shows he owes Bahadurs firms loans running into crores of rupees.Justice Narang may have to recuseThough the Amarinder government seems to be in no mood to give into allegations of Opposition that justice JS Narang (retd) has links with Rana, sources in government said he would have to recuse himself if indeed a client-counsel relationship is proved. A judicial commission is formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act and the name of the judge is approved by the Chief Justice of India. Yet if a client-lawyer relation is proved, he will have to recuse himself, a senior government official said. AAP leader Sukhpal Khaira has alleged that Narangs son, Amitjeet Narang, has worked as counsel of ministers nephew, Rana Prabhdeep Singh.But upbeat minister in no mood to step downA white kurta-pyjama and colour-coded vest, pocket square and turban in pastel shades, Punjabs power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh is not known as much for his millions as his dressing style among Punjab MLAs.Even the dressing down in the media  over reports of his alleged benami sand mining bids  have not affected Ranas flourish to dress up.In his white kurta-pyjama, orange turban, vest and pocket square, the minister looked upbeat as he came to his office at the secretariat on Wednesday.Rana does not have many friends in the party and government to stand by him but he does not seem to need any. He has the confidence of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh himself and some of his close friends.A day in Ranas life remains quite the same. Accompanied by his confidant, Khadoor Sahib MLA Ramanjit Sikki, he went to meet CMs chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar for some work before heading to his room full of people waiting for him. He met a few in the back room in his office and also asked his staff to allow the media in, but not for a bite.I have nothing to say to the media till the judicial commission gives its report, is all that he told reporters.Not just Rana, even the CM may want to brazen it out as one wicket out of nine falling in two months is a bad start. But you cant fault him in his dressing sense, a Congress MLA quipped as Rana went past him in the corridors of the CMs office. Ranas confidence is sheer bravado or righteousness, only time will tell."

Sandeep Daundkar One of the 13 antennas in the centre square area of GMRT. Sandeep DaundkarAs if tuning the antenna ear to detect weak signals from extremely faint celestial objects was any easy task, engineers and astronomers at the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) have to also overcome other challenges  stay guarded from leopards, snakes and other creatures of the wild; ward off the interfering effects from mobile phone signals, high-tension power lines and windmills and now worry about a rail-line cutting through the heart of their research.Operational since 2002, the GMRT is located near Khodad village in Junnar taluka, which is about 80 km from Pune city. It is the worlds largest radio astronomy setup operating in low metrewave radio frequencies (from about 100 MHz to about 1500 MHz) and has astronomers from across the world in research in this field.For long, the locals here were completely unaware of the research activities going on inside the GMRT campus, but senior scientists say that their popularity has slowly grown with time. Asked what allows them to perform despite a string of challenges, both technological and otherwise, the dean of GMRT Observatory Yashwant Gupta said, We have a strong team of dedicated engineers and scientists, and we believe in trying to find the best solutions, including those which allow us to co-exist with the local population and society around us.Peacock, fox, scorpion, leopards, snakes are often spotted in the GMRT campus, given the vast expanse of natural vegetation that is available. It is indeed interesting to find inside a scientific institution housing antennas surrounded by shrubs as well as tall trees, the presence of a leopard trap.Known for being a sugarcane belt, Junnar taluka of late has become infamous for leopard attacks. Since a decade, locals note frequent sighting of leopards in this area.Some of the GMRT staff shared their experience of sighting leopards on numerous occasions, particularly during late evenings and night time. But they point out that no untoward incident has been reported so far.Asked if the trap was ever able to capture any leopard, one of the staff members said, The animals appear to be smart and may have learnt to avoid the cage, which the forest department had placed inside the campus a couple of years ago.Though the GMRT has a boundary with a wire fence, the area adjacent to antenna number 14 in the centre square (C14), is said to be a favourite spot inside the campus for a leopard family of five. This is because the location is not only adjacent to nearby sugarcane fields, considered as safe haven for the wild animal, but also has a good supply of water available round the year. As a part of taking precaution, astronomers refrain from venturing outdoors unnecessarily after dusk. If there is a need to check any system at the antennas after evening, we often postpone it till the next day morning, unless very urgent, said Gupta.Mobile phone towersIf mobile towers were thought to be menace just in cities, it is causing no fewer headaches to astronomers here. With rampant urbanisation and growing population in the otherwise secluded locality, mushrooming of mobile towers is yet another problem for the engineers here. The team of scientists is now working on developing systems with improved technology to counter and filter any kind of interference caused by unwanted signals picked-up from these mobile towers in the vicinity.At times, we encounter signals from nearby locations in adjacent frequency bands, which affect our data. However, we have managed to convince some mobile companies to operate in frequencies far away from the range in which we operate, said GMRTs head of analog receiver systems, Suresh Kumar.Setting example themselves, scientists diligently stay away from using mobile phones during their work hours at the campus. There is also a special system to track for any mobile phone users on campus and upon detecting; a loudspeaker immediately announces it to be turned off.TransportThe latest dilemma, likely to snowball in the near future, is the recently announced , but long-pending Pune-Nashik rail line, which if constructed, would cut across the heart of the array. According to the plan, the Ministry of Railways aims to connect Pune and Nashik by laying a 265-km rail line which would pass through Chakan, Manchar, Rajgurunagar, Narayangaon, Aalephata and Sinner.Though the future of this plan is still hazy at the moment, NCRA director S K Ghosh hinted at initiating discussions soon. We will be approaching our ministry, Department of Atomic Energy, with a request to look into the matter and ensure that the interests of the GMRT are protected so that it can continue to deliver world class results in the future, he said.Interference from aviation signals is also posing to be a major challenge to the observatory, be it from overflying aircraft or from the radars at the airports.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It is also the only irrigation firm, with the accused politicians have personal and business associations, claimed sources.NCP termed the development as mischievous and a bid to divert attention from the ongoingfarmers agitation by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The ED has not sent any notice to Pawar. The BJP-government should stop using investigative agencies to spread such reports and divert attention from real issues such as the farmers agitation, said NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik.HT had in 2015 reported on Pawars link with Raj Groups directors Jagdish Kadam and his maternal cousin, and an associate Ram Nimbalkar.Both the directors were linked to a web of nearly 60 companies associated with Pawar that had interests in realty, construction, infrastructure, wind and hydro power, sugar factories and distilleries.It is possible to register a case even if the investigative agency has not accused the suspects in the case, said a senior ED officer.It depends on the outcome of the investigation and we have sought details from the ACB on irrigation scam,he said."

While the scheme graded 23 industries in the state as the most polluting ones (one or two stars), it awarded the least polluting status (four and five stars) to 47 industries.Those industries that breached the prescribed limit for PM emissions from the smoke stacks, which is 150 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/Nm3), were given one, two and three-star rating. Those that did not fell under the four and five star categories.The rating scheme launched on Monday awarded three stars to just 9 industries. At present, the programme includes 79 industries across eight sectors  chemical, pharmaceutical, power, cement, sugar and distilleries, metal work, textile and paper  with at least four recent stack samples.The five-star rating programme is an initiative by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board with researchers from the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab, the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Yale University and Evidence for Policy Design at Harvard University.Maharashtra has more than 75,000 industries, with 12,500 emitting high pollution levels. The programme has the potential to reduce pollution by leveraging information already being collected by regulators and providing it to both industry and the public, said Anant Sudarshan, director, EPIC-India.The Maharashtra Star Rating Programme provides access to data from approximately 20,000 industrial stack samples. We think this will improve ease of doing business, as information on industry environmental performance will be easily accessible, said Satish Gavai, additional chief secretary, state environment department and MPCB chairman."

He is widely remembered for a show of temper during the previous assembly: he clashed with then Akali minister Bikram Singh Majithia on the floor of the house, an exchange that saw both using expletives.A a video clip of the exchange went viral in the state. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is said to have offered him the Kapurthala assembly seat in the 2002 polls, bringing him into public life for the first time. Amarinder has now ordered a judicial probe, to be headed by a retired high court judge, even as he rejected an offer by the minister, whose entry into politics he facilitated, to resign.Until he contested from Kapurthala, the matriculate, hailing from a family traditionally loyal to the Congress in Bazpur, Uttarakhand, was hardly known in Punjabs political circles. After winning in 2002, Rana Gurjit went on to serve as the Jalandhar MP  he defeated I K Gujrals son Naresh Gujral (SAD) in the 2004 elections  and lost the 2009 Lok Sabha battle in Khadoor Sahib.

Tamil Nadu minister for cooperatives Sellur Raju who inaugurated the unusual method to conserve water in the drought-hit state himself saw the attempt go awry as gusty winds blew the sheets in different directions in the river. The minister later held discussions with officials and staff of the state's public works department who had placed the thermocol sheets on the surface of the water on possible ways to overcome the problem posed by the winds, officials said. Water from the Vaigai dam flows through six water starved districts of south Tamil Nadu including Madurai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Theni and Dindigul districts. Two civil engineers in Maharashtra had two years ago proposed through a study that thermocol can save 32 per cent water on small farm ponds at a cost of about Rs 48 per square metre for material costs. Narhari Chaudhari, associate professor of civil engineering at the Karmveer Kakasaheb Wagh Institute of Engineering, Nashik, had analysed the efficiency of thermocol sheets to prevent evaporation on farm ponds in the region. ""A few farmers near Nashik are already using this technique to conserve water for their sugarcane and pomegranate crop,"" Chaudhari told The Telegraph over the phone today. A thunderstorm on March 15, 2015, had broken some of the thermocol sheets on the farm ponds, slightly reducing the efficacy of the technique, Chaudhari had reported at a conference on hydrology in Roorkee later that year. The Tamil Nadu effort was aimed at a river, in contrast to small farm ponds in Nashik. The thermocol material deployed wasn't enough to cover the water's surface. The minister, Raju, said such methods are used abroad to reduce evaporation. He said the state government has allocated Rs 10 lakh to try out different technologies to prevent water evaporation. Madurai collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said different methods would be adopted or experimented to save water which is in 10 to 12 hectares of waterspread area in the Vaigai dam. He said 1.2 million cubic feet of water is lost because of evaporation every day. On the use of thermocol, he said this was done as the material was non-polluting. But Rathnam, a scientist, differed, saying thermocol is non-biodegradable and can harm fish when they break into pieces."

The seeds were then grown at CAZRIs garden and in 2014 and 2015 the plants were reintroduced in the Machia Biological Park, where they are growing well.Dr Suresh Kumar, who steered the Ministry of environment and forest and climate control (MoEF&CC) programme at CAZRI, and has recently retired, said this year the theme for World Environment Day is Connecting people to nature.This encourages us to go out and see nature closely. To not just watch its beauty but also see how badly habitats are being destroyed making many a species threatened and vulnerable to extinction, said Kumar.Its normal for some species to become rare and threatened in the course of evolution, but what worries ecologists is the fast pace at which its taking place. We have been trying to understand such phenomena in the Thar desert and have studied why hedulo vanished from the earlier sites, said Kumar.According to CAZRI scientists, overexploitation of hedulo tubers  which is endemic to the Indian Desert  had led to its drastic decline in population and made it threatened.Hedulo seeds and plants that were regrown by Central Arid Zone Research Institute scientists. (HT Photo)As it grows in hilly areas, destruction of forests removes associated plant species and also bees and insects culminating in the failure of pollination and consequently no fruit and seed setting takes place, said Kumar said.When there are no new seeds, no new saplings are born while extracting bulbs of older plants kill them. Also due to the destruction of forests, rocky surfaces dont favour its regeneration. A complex interplay of all these factors made hedulo a rare species.Locals said that earlier the plant could be easily spotted in the wild, but not now. They also confirmed that its tubers are eaten by cowboys, cattlemen and even wild animals.Hedulo is not only of botanical importance but is also economically important as tubers are a source of sugar, gum, fats, crude fibres and medicines, Dr Kumar said.This study is an eye opener emphasising the need for awareness among general public for not uprooting its bulbs. That is possible only if we connect ourselves with nature, said Kumar.Simultaneously efforts for its conservation should also be a priority for both government and non-government organisations, the scientist added."

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has been generously sanctioning grants to constituencies represented by ruling party MLAs, he said. But he is least bothered about reviving the sugar factory which is the lifeline of thousands of sugar cane farmers, he charged.He also staged a dharna in the well of the House, urging the deputy speaker to either get an assurance from the government on his demand or accept his resignation. Other JD(S) MLAs joined the protest. The JD(S) members later withdrew the dharna when the deputy speaker assured them that he will get an appropriate reply from the chief minister."

With the maximum day temperature hovering around the 40C mark, people in the twin cities are doing just that to beat the heat. While the mercury touched 40.8C in Cuttack city today, the highest temperature in Bhubaneswar was 39.8C.A traditional method to keep the heat at bay is to use khus curtains (bena cheera). Water is sprinkled on it once in a while to keep it cool. The owner of a medicine shop at Nayapalli, who is using khus curtains at his shop, said: Its difficult to use the air-conditioner in an open shop. Besides maintaining a cool environment, the scent of the khus is soothing. G. Ganesh, 40, who has been in the khus business for 20 years, said: The demand for khus has gone up significantly in the city. We are now selling khus at Rs 30 a foot. A standard khus curtain to cover a window will cost around Rs 600. People enjoy watermelon in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Summer fruits Fruits also come handy in the heat as people often complain of dehydration. In this season, fruit such as watermelon and sugar palm are in high demand. Sanjay, a roadside vendor at Kalpana Square, said: Watermelons mostly come from west Odisha, particularly Balangir and Sonepur. The sales rise in direct proportion to the soaring mercury. Another fruit that has become extremely popular is the sugar palm or tala saja. Kuni Patra, 39, said: I am selling five to six tala saja at Rs 20. Since it is available for only two months, there is huge demand for it. It also makes you feel cool.Madhumita Pradhan, a private company employee, said: I buy the sugar palm fruit every day. I love it. Like fruits, the demand for fermented rice or water rice (pakhal) has gone up. Almost all eateries, including star hotels, are selling it."

Picture by Dinesh Kumar The neera (unfermented palm sap) project of the state government will achieve a milestone on Friday as two processing plants set up by the Bihar State Milk Cooperative Federation (Comfed) for the industries department will begin a trial run to produce jaggery and bottled neera. ""The trial run of neera processing plants at Biharsharif in Nalanda and Hajipur in Vaishali is beginning tomorrow (Friday). We needed at least 1,200 litres of neera at each plant to run them. It has been arranged as the palm sap season has started in Bihar,"" industries principal secretary S. Siddharth told The Telegraph. Among the two plants, the one in Biharsharif will produce bottled neera, while the one in Hajipur will process palm sap into jaggery. Comfed will market both the products. Comfed sells milk and milk products under the brand Sudha. If the trial runs at the two plants succeed, they would also be conducted at the two other neera processing plants at Barari in Bhagalpur and Khijarsarai in Gaya. Full-fledged commercial production will start at all the four plants after this. The industries department has tasked Jeevika women self-help groups constituted under Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project to procure and supply neera to the four plants. The neera project has been conceptualised by chief minister Nitish Kumar and his officials to ensure alternative employment to the pasis or the toddy (fermented palm sap) tapping community, which has around 40 lakh population in the state. It was needed after toddy, which is an intoxicating drink, was banned in the state after Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, came into effect. Toddy tappers who choose to tap neera, will have to get licence for free from the excise department. After getting the licence, they can also sell neera, which is rich in vitamins and minerals, in the open market or make jaggery and sugar from it. The licensing process is going on in full swing with over 12,000 applications already distributed among the pasis. Of these 7,000 people have filled and submitted them to the excise department. Instructions have been issued to process licences within 10 days, while Siddharth has written to all district magistrates to ensure that a three-day training on neera tapping and precautions that should be taken to keep it unfermented and in hygienic condition must be given to those who are granted the licences. According to a survey conducted by the agriculture department, there are around 1.3 crore palm trees, including dates and coconut trees, in the state and each tree can produce up to 10 litres of neera daily. Most of the forms have been distributed in Nalanda, East Champaran, Samastipur, Saharsa and Banka, which together comprise over 9,000 forms. The rest are spread across the remaining 33 districts."

Telegraph picture Hailakandi, April 26: Silchar MP Sushmita Dev and Lakhipur MLA Rajdeep Goala have expressed concern over detention of a ""genuine Indian"" at a detention camp in Silchar as a suspected foreigner. They visited the detention camp in Silchar's Central Jail and enquired about Kajal Bala Deb, a housewife who is in the camp as a foreigner. She was sent to the camp by the foreigners tribunal on April 20 this year when she mentioned that her husband was Anil Deb, which did not tally with the records. The mistake was committed at the recording level by mixing up the names of her father, Kali Kumar Namasudra, and that of her husband. The records say her husband's name is Kali Kumar Deb. Dev said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared before the Lok Sabha polls that there would be no detention camp here if the BJP came to power, but even after three years, genuine Indian citizens were being kept in the detention camp as ""suspected foreigners"". She said these people face extreme difficulty in proving their citizenship. After getting notice of a suspected foreigner, one has to prove his/her Indian citizenship in the foreigners tribunal. Dev said she was branded a foreigner only because her husband's name was wrongly written in the notice. . Goala said Kajal Bala is a resident of Lakhipur, his constituency, and he would bring all relevant documents to prove that she is an Indian. Similar is the case of two tea garden workers. One of them is from Gaglacherra tea garden in Hailakandi and the other is from Cachar's Kachudaram. They are now in the camp as suspected foreigners. They were declared ""foreigners"" by the tribunal on October 26, 2013 and sent to the camp on February 2, 2016. The women ""foreigners"" will be shifted to Kokrajhar detention camp as the Silchar camp is only for men. Dev said the D-voters are having sleepless night as they may get notices calling them suspected foreigners. Drug haul: Lhakhi Leima, 48, and Thangiam Uma Devi, 42, who hail from Manipur and claim to be sisters, were travelling on the Brahmaputra Mail from Dimapur, Nagaland, this afternoon. They were allegedly carrying opium in a duffle bag, the official said. The GRP also recovered cannabis from Lalmoni Bewa, a 41-year-old woman travelling from Dimapur to New Jalpaiguri junction on the Rajdhani Express. ""We recovered the cannabis from her suitcase. Lalmoni, however, claimed that the luggage does not belong to her,"" the official said. With today's seizures, the GRP has seized 28.5kg gold, five quintals of cannabis, 2.5kg of brown sugar, 13kg opium and a gecko lizard this month. ""Besides patrolling the platform, we have also started checking the train compartments from March 8. This has led to a sharp rise in the recovery of contraband."""

It is comparatively rare, found in tropical thorn forests and along the wayside as thickets in the drier parts of India. Slender to medium-sized, tendrillar climbers reach up to five meters tall vertically. Tubers are up to 30 cm tall and eight cm broad; shape of the tuber imitates the bird Kite, hence the name Akash Garuda. Stems grow zig-zag. Leaves span up to five cm across and have an almost circular outline, 3-5-lobed or angled, base heart-shaped.Flowers measure three mm diametrically and are greenish-yellow. Fruits are pepos and 2 x 0.8 cm, with a line of dehiscence near the base, bright red when ripe. Flowering and fruiting occur from April through September.The powdered tuber is an effective remedy in case of poisonous bites including few species of snakes. It can also treat syphilis, venereal complaints and expel intestinal worms. Tubers are used predominantly to bring down the sugar level in blood, to clean wounds, to reduce obesity and to cure skin eruptions. Akash Garuda is also known for its curative properties in case of diarrhoea, bronchial complaints, rheumatism, urinary problems and general debility.In English, it is popularlyknown as Indian Bryonia. The genus name Corallo (coral like) + carpus (fruit) is given in allusion to the red fruits."
593ae3e37be9e01228650ba9,5 reasons why the Maharashtra irrigation scam could spell trouble for Ajit Pawar,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-reasons-why-the-maharashtra-irrigation-scam-could-spell-trouble-for-ajit-pawar/story-RqKfPwPxio3gS54yc5N9vO.html,2017-06-05,"Two-and-a-half years after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis asked the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) to probe the multi-crore irrigation scam and what roles senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) politicians Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare played in it, there are reports that the Enforcement Directorate is on Pawars trail.While the ACB has filed two FIRs and one charge sheet in the scam, no politician has been indicted.The scam broke in 2012, after it was revealed that even after spending Rs42,500 crore over a decade, Maharashtra had brought only 0.1% of the targeted land under irrigation. A nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had milked thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects, revealed sources. NCP leaders who had controlled the department came under the scanner.Sources said the ED was looking into irrigation contracts that had been given to a Pune-based firm, Raj Group, during Pawars tenure as water resources minister. This is the only case in which Pawar can be accused of having directly benefited through his connection to the firm, which bagged irrigation contracts worth Rs803 to Rs1,000 crore.HT had broken the story of Pawars links to this firm through personal and business connections in July 2015.Here are five reasons why former deputy chief minister and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars nephew could land in trouble if ED pursues this case :1. Jagdish Kadam and Ram Nimbalkar are directors of the Pune-based Raj group. Kadam is Ajits cousin, while Nimbalkar is one of his close associates. The firm bagged irrigation contracts for at least 11 projects, collectively worth Rs1,000 crore. Two of these projects are in Vidarbha, one in Marathwada and ten in western Maharashtra. These contracts were allotted when Pawar was water resources minister.2. Kadam and Nimbalkar were also directors in a few of the 60 companies associated with Pawar that had interests in infrastructure, realty, wind and hydro power, sugar factories, distilleries and automobiles.The two were the joint directors of 15 such companies. Pawar was the director of five such companies until 2009. His wife, Sunetra, was the director of 20 of these companies until 2014. She and Kadam were joint directors in seven such firms. Nimbalkar and she were joint directors in one firm.3. Raj group bagged projects by floating different entities, including Raj Infrastructure Development Corporation, Raj Promoters and Civil Engineers Private Limited, Raj Construction. The firm violated the norm that a single company cannot win more than three contracts in any region. In the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC), the group got five projects under different names, including one joint venture.4. The costs of a majority of projects bagged by the group rose by 4.83% to 41%. All the cost escalations were cleared by Pawar as the then minister. These controversial projects include Kuntephal, Dhom Balkawadi canals, Umraodi and Karanjao project5. The Kuntephal lift irrigation project worth Rs209 crore, part of the larger Krishna-Marathwada project was seriously flawed. A special investigation team that probed the project had sought action against the officials who cleared it. Documents show that the work order for the project was given without getting an administrative order, violating the governors directives. Project officials did not seek the mandated green nod from the Union environment ministry either."

However, the average installed capacity of the state's sugar mills is a meagre 56,773 metric tonnes at present.Reeling out statistics of sugar production, the minister said production has been going down because of the closure of three mills.The state had produced 68,501 metric tonnes of sugar in 2011-12. It came down to 64,098 metric tonnes in 2012-13 and to 60,568 metric tonne in 2013-14. The production came down further to 42,624 metric tonnes in 2014-15.The production improved to 48,076 metric tonnes the next year.The state had six sugar mills in the 1990s. Now three have turned defunct, while three others are running. ""Efforts are on to revive the defunct mills,"" said Maharathy.The three working sugar mills are Aska Cooperative Sugar Mill, Bargarh Co-Operative Sugar Mill and Sakti Sugar Mills at Dhenkanal.Cutting across party lines, the legislators expressed concern over the declining sugar cane cultivation coverage area and yield due to lack of government support though sugar cane cultivation is a profit making profession.The minister admitted that sugar cane cultivation coverage area in Odisha had come down from 41,000 hectares in 2011-12 to 28,980 hectares in 2015-16.""But this year, a target has been fixed to take up cultivation on 40,000 hectares,"" he said.The minister listed out the measures to encourage sugar cane cultivation.Prominent measures included organising field demonstrations, establishment of farmer field training institutes for capacity building, providing high-yielding sugar cane seeds at concession rates, encouraging drip irrigation, conduct of familiarisation trips for farmers to different states and transport subsidy for bringing improved varieties of sugar cane seeds from other states.He said a target had been set to produce 29.6 lakh metric tonnes of sugar cane during 2017-18.Provisions had been made to provide advanced technology to the farmers under National Food Security Mission."

The terms of reference for the inquiry commission, formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, would be notified soon.Raj Bahadur, who until recently used to serve paranthas in the office of Rana Sugars owned by the power minister, had bagged one of the costliest sand quarries in the State at `26.51 crore at Saidpur Khurd village in Nawanshahar district in the e-auction.Another employee of Rana Sugars, Kulwinder Paul Singh, got the Mehadipur sand mine for `9.21 crore. He is the liaison man for the company in the designation of deputy general manager. Another employee Gurinder Singh has bagged a sand quarry at Rampur Kalan village in Mohali district for `4.11 crore.The minister has meanwhile offered to resign in order to ensure a free and fair investigation into the matter. The chief minister has however, asked Rana Gurjit to continue until the outcome of the judicial probe.Though Rana Gurjit has denied any links of his company, Rana Sugars Limited, with the auctions, and has categorically stated that his company has no stake, direct or indirect, in the sand mining business, the chief minister, in the interest of ethics and propriety, has decided to get the matter probed at the highest level to ensure complete transparency.There was no question of allowing any deviation from his governments avowed policy of providing clean governance, said Amarinder, adding that he would take all steps to ensure that there is no violation of trust reposed by the people of Punjab in his government and the Congress party.The two-day sand auctions, in which these bids were alleged to have been secured, related to 50 mines and they have already generated a revenue of nearly `300 crore, leading to the highest-ever earnings from the mining sector for the State government.Another 56 mines would be put to auction on June 11 and the government is expecting to generate another `300 crore from them.

President of the Association, S Venkatapathi said that all the stores will down their shutters on Tuesday. However, pharmacy stores attached to hospitals, some of the chain medical stores would be open which will be of relief to people who need medicines on emergency basis.One of the argument floated by the Chemists and Druggists association revolves around unregistered practitioners. As per the governments move, details of registered medical practitioner should be fed into the e-portal while dispensing drugs to a customer. In villages, practitioners of Ayurvedha, Unani and Siddha too prescribe allopathic drugs. Now, when a customer brings a prescription, how can details of the unregistered medical practitioners be fed into the e-portal?, Venkatapathi questioned.He also said that if dispensing of drugs is made online, there is every chance that drug addictis might use fake prescription to buy medicines.Hotel bandh likely to get mixed responseHyderabad: The proposed bandh by Telangana State Hotels Association (TSHA) on May 30 is looking to get a lukewarm response. In opposition to the proposed General Sales Tax by the central government, TSHA has called for a one-day bandh of hotels across the twin cities. While only few hotel owners were aware of this, others did not want toclose. My hotel is located in a public space where there are five movie screens around. How can I incur a whole day losses especially during this festive season, says Md Idris, owner of Pride of Hyderabad."

A while back, only the bride was enthusiastic about what she would wear on her big day. Over time, sisters, mothers and grandmothers from both the brides side and grooms side have joined the I want to look stunning bandwagon and aari work has become a favourite, says Arulselvi Sekar (47), a fashion designer who has been running a boutique in Kilpauk for six years.Priced from `700, aari work is in demand these days. According to Radhika Reddy, 29, who has been doing aari designs for movies, boutiques and others for four years, says, When I started, brides preferred aari work only for their wedding ensemble but nowadays women like to spice up their wardrobes even forcasual events like birthday parties, college farewells, etc.Radhika conducts regular aari classes at her boutique in Purasaiwakkam. Years ago, people only took to crafting aari designs when they could not go to school. Today, aari has become like a school syllabus in itself, she chuckles.Do foreigners come to her? Do they like heavy aari work? My foreign clients dont expect their garments to be heavily designed like my Indian clients do. They like butterflies, lines and varieties of leaves designed on their blouse, she says.Designing aari work is labour-intensive and time consuming. It begins with the designer drawing motifs on a tracing sheet and making holes along its outline. Chappa powder or chalk powder is mixed with kerosene, and used to rub it on the holes to trace the design on the cloth. Designers sit in front of the aari cot or frame of varied lengths such as five, seven and 10 inches according to their design. Aari needle goes in and out tuk tukkk... On an average, a designer takes three days to complete a design worth `4,000-`5,000.General traditional motifs that are still popular are elephant, peacock, parrot, lotus and mango. Demand has gone up for jewel designs, matching the jewellery that you wear for the occasion with antique balls of 0-10 sizes. You also have kundan work with multi-coloured stones. But the common colours are mostly maroon and green, especially for those who prefer traditional designs.Types of aari work ZardosiShiny and glittery spring called nakshi and normal spring called shadhi are two varieties of zardosi work.StoneSwarovski stones, zirconia stones, sticky stones made of plastic and mirror, rolling stone chain, kundan stone, crystal stones of various shapes such as eye, thilagam, diamond, round and square.BeadsTikki beads, mothi beads, khardhana beads, sugar beads, metal and plastic beads.EmbroideryAround 30 stitches such as chain stitch, herringbone and cross stitch to name a few."

(Sri Lanka Air Force via AP)The death toll in Sri Lankas floods has climbed to 202 with 94 people still missing in the countrys worst torrential rains since 2003 that displaced nearly half a million people. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said at least 629,742 people of 163,701 families have been affected by the bad weather. The DMC said 1,505 houses had been fully damaged while 7,617 houses were partially damaged due to the floods and landslides. Around DMC 77, 432 people have been displaced. There was a good news on the receding water levels in rivers during the past 24 hours due to the low rainfall that ended at 3.30 pm, the Irrigation Department said. Director (Hydrology) P Hettiarachchi said the water levels in the Kalu Ganga and the Gin Ganga was decreasing.Indian naval divers and medical teams have joined rescue efforts in Lankas flood-hit regions. The Indian contingent of more than 300 navy personnel was assisting in the relief, with divers searching the brackish waters and medical teams seeing patients in makeshift tents set up at shelters.INS Shardul has nearly 200 personnel on board, including specialised rescue, diving and medical teams, as well as a large amount of relief material and Gemini inflatable boats. INS Kirch was carrying 125 personnel. It had diving teams, relief supplies, inflatable gemini boats and a mobile medical teams. A third Indian naval ship arrived today, bringing relief supplies including rice, lentils, sugar, milk and blankets for the displaced.The weather has begun to clear, and many of the more than 100,000 people, evacuated over the weekend, had returned home to clear debris and mud from their waterlogged homes. More than 80,000 others remained in relief camps as their homes were either destroyed or wiped out. The two rivers overflowing was the main reason for severe flooding more particularly in the southern Galle and Kalutara districts.The government has initiated efforts to purify wells and other potable water sources which have been contaminated by the floods as tens of thousands of affected people are left without safe drinking water.Mudslides have become common during Sri Lankas summer monsoon season as forests across the tropical Indian Ocean island nation have been cleared for export crops such as tea and rubber. A massive landslide a year ago killed more than 100 people in central Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka had sought international assistance, with India sending three naval ships laden with supplies in the last a couple of days. Following Indias lead in sending out emergency relief to Sri Lanka, more countries started pledging assistance to provide relief to the flood victims. Australia has said it would provide 500,000 dollars. A Pakistani relief ship arrived in Sri Lanka yesterday. At least three Chinese ships will come a day after tomorrow.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Siddaramaiah wants to improve the partys show in JD(S) strongholds like Mandya, Hassan and Tumakuru districts.Though the state government gave more than `100 crore for modernisation of MySugar factory in the last couple of years, followed by release of substantial funds by previous Chief Ministers H D Kumaraswamy and B S Yeddyurappa, the farming community is blaming the Congress, particularly former ministers M H Ambareesh and H S Mahadeva Prasad, for doing little to revive the sugar factory.MySugar has been considered as the lifeline of regions sugarcane growers.

593ae5687be9e00e1ecd3d8c,Study nails 90dB effect on hearing,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170328/jsp/calcutta/story_143125.jsp,2017-03-28,"March 27: A study ordered by the National Green Tribunal has found ""confirmatory"" evidence of ""deterioration of hearing"" following exposure to more than 90 decibel of sound. The findings reinforce the need to reimpose the firecracker noise norm of 90 decibel at 5m from the source, which the tribunal has recently struck down on procedural grounds. The report warns that the actual risk posed by firecrackers could be worse than what the study has indicated because the exposure to sound in the laboratory experiments lasted less than two minutes, whereas the noise menace on festive occasions such as Diwali continues uninterrupted for hours. ""The results of the study has conclusively proved that exposure to more than 90 decibel of firecracker noise significantly affects hearing and other physiological parameters,"" said ENT specialist Dulal Bose, who led the expert committee that conducted the study between December 2015 and February 2016. The six-member committee was set up by the pollution control board following the green tribunal's order. The green tribunal, while scrapping the noise rule, allowed the board the liberty to re-impose the limit through a fresh order. The board is yet to issue the order. Noise experts feel the findings of the study provide one more proof, if any were at all needed, why the state badly needs the lapsed firecracker noise limit to be re-instated immediately. Bose pointed out that the noise limits were far stricter in developed countries and urged the Bengal government to tighten its rules on firecrackers. ""Unlike here, in developed countries firecrackers are burst away from residential areas and for a specific duration. Still, they enforce a stricter rule,"" Bose said. ""We must follow suit as here firecrackers are exploded within our earshot and almost throughout the day. In Calcutta and the rest of Bengal, there is a much higher chance of people developing hearing problems because of noise produced by firecrackers."" The committee - comprising scientists, audiologists and physicians - carried out the experiments with real-time exposure to firecracker noise at laboratories in the Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute (SRFTI). The committee has mentioned in its report - a copy of which is with Metro - that ""deterioration of hearing is confirmatory after stimulation of sound more than 90dB"". The experiment also found ""significant"" changes in the level of cortisol hormone because of the exposure, which might trigger a host of conditions such as immune disorder, rise in the blood sugar level and problems in bone formation. The report also quotes other studies which state that exposure to sound might cause sleep disorder and hypertension, and could also effect foetuses. The team detected ""mild to moderate deafness"" among those who had voluntered for the study after they were exposed to 90-105 decibel sound produced by firecrackers. ""If 105 decibel can cause such an impact, think of what would happen if you are exposed to 125 decibel (the fircracker norm across the country is 125 decibel at 4m from the source). It has long been established that every 10-decibel increase in sound doubles the impact on the eardrums,"" a member of the study team said. The volunteers were exposed to 90 seconds of firecracker sound with a pause between two consecutive exposures. ""On Kali Puja or Diwali, the actual exposure is much more,"" a team member said. The committee has mentioned in the report that rampant bursting of firecrackers on Kali Puja and Diwali creates an ambient noise level of 86 decibel, 10 decibel more than usual ambient noise level. ""Clearly, noise over 90 decibel can seriously impact people's health,"" said advocate Gitanath Ganguly, a former high court-appointed noise officer."

The village, a one-of-its-kind infrastructure platform, will anchor movement of goods by railways and roadways ultimately dovetailing with the waterways scheme of things, as per plans. The facility will come around the proposed multi-modal terminal adjacent to the city on the banks of the Ganga.Adityanath along with his top officials met IWAI brass in Varanasi on Saturday to understand the mammoth, World Bank-funded projects requirements in Uttar Pradesh. Following a presentation by the IWAI, the CM directed the UP chief secretary to set the process in motion for making the land acquisition process smoother with help from state agencies, sources said. The CM was keen that this unique central project gets a red-carpet treatment in the state and does not face any hurdles, a top UP government source present in the meeting told The Indian Express.The assurance of assistance from the UP government was something missing in the previous regime in the state, officials claimed. Location-wise, the village is proposed to be at a critical future freight-movement hub for north and eastern India. The authority has zeroed in on a location at a junction of National Highways 2 and National Highways 7. The villages distance from NH 7 will be just around 600 metres. The closest railway station, Jeonathpur, at a distance of around six kilometers on the main Kolkata-Delhi rail route and the future Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor.The NDA government is developing the 1,390-km National Waterways 1 on the Ganga under Jal Marg Vikas Project from Haldia in West Bengal to Varanasi with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs 5,369 crore. The rationale is that since rail and roadways for cargo movement on this route is already congested and bursting in seams, a waterway would provide another alternative, cheaper mode of moving goods. The NH-1 will cater to Allahabad, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Bhagalpur, Patna, Howrah, Haldia and Kolkata, and the industrial hinterland in the Ganga basin.The IWAI has also commissioned a study by MIT Infrastructure Architecture Lab to develop models for ferry services at six urban locations along NW-1, one of which is Varanasi. Petroleum products, chemicals and fertilizers, vegetables, sugarcane, cement, rice, cereal grains are some of the major products that are projected to be moved through Varanasi on NW-1 with a potential for 39 million tonnes worth of cargo, as per the government estimates.Under the project, there are going to be three multi-modal terminals  one each at Varanasi, Sahibganj in Jharkhand, and Haldia; two inter-modal terminals- at Kalughat and Ghazipur; a new Navigation Lock at Farakka, five Roll on-Roll off terminals, development of ferry services at Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Munger, Kolkata and Haldia and vessel repair and maintenance facilities.Indias waterways are largely overlooked today for freight movement due to the rise of other modes over the past decades. The move to revive them as an economically viable alternative takes its cue from other large economies like the US, which moves 615 million tonnes of freight on waterways representing an 8.3 per cent of modal share compared to rail and road. Similarly, China moves a massive 1,100 million tonnes of goods, as much as the entire Indian Railways, per year through its waterways, which make 8.7 per cent of total goods moved in all modes. India on the other hand moves only 0.5 per cent of its goods through waterways. The current thrust is to revive the waterways and make them viable options in the economy again.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The most amazing place in Gurgaon is soon going to be ready, the friend said. Thats the place we should live.Thirty years is a long time; a score and half, a quarter-of-a-century. My friends coaxing and my having finally relented, was one of the best decisions of my lifeThe early days were raw and hard. In a Maruti Gypsy (the only few seen now are the Gurgaon Police driving on their beat). it took 22 minutes from Hauz Khas to drive down to the border, and then no time to get to my condominium.Arriving late at night, we drove past a sea of mustard fields in the winter, their bright yellow flowers swaying to cold winds from Rajasthan. In the morning, which still remains the best part of the day, there would sometimes be camels and elephants on the narrow dusty road seemingly going everywhere. The road was soon aptly named the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road.Things have changed in Gurgaon. From a sleepy little farming village to an expanding metropolis, it strives to carve a slice of the pie in a new, emerging India.Traffic is getting out of control; road non-sense and road rage are on the rise. Stress to find a place to park. Stress to make it big. Stress to be the first to flash the newest smartphone.In the middle of all this, the buzz of Gurgaon is buzzing the world.Many years after I first got here, Gurgaon is the most sought-after place to be, to live in, to dream in.Despite many twists, turns and stumbles the VTM (Village Turned Mod) houses CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, all living in their state-of-the-art condos. The Gurgaon experiment is now the Gurgaon achievement.As for me, the vibe of Gurgaon gets me going. The cross -section of folks arriving from everywhere, some by choice, some by compulsion, all mingling and making new friends in new ways.There are theatrical groups where professionals quote Shakespeare at each other, places to chill, the best places to eat. There are parts of the new city that never sleep.Its true that the garbage can be obnoxiously rude to the nasal and visual senses, that potholed roads beyond the major arterials can be a nightmare to drive on.Yet, despite these irritants, communities work together, in tandem, to clean their act, to harvest rainwater, to make the city safer, to be proud Gurgaonans . Or should we say Gurgaonites?There is activity: the bio-diversity park where a million saplings have been planted, and the amphitheatre which hosts the best of Indias culture. There is nature: Gurgaon is where a million sparrows thrive, where parrots make a racket, where robin red breasts and nightingales shelter among lush, green trees .On board the Metro, watching the ever-changing face of Gurgaon, one can see how much more the city planners wish to achieve. I often think of how far we have come, and how much farther we are set to go.This is my Gurgaon, my Sugar Ville, embedded in todays challenging and changing world.(Capt Vivek C.

Since last week, Ranchi Sadar Hospital is reporting around 10 per cent increase in the number of OPD patients suffering from sore throat, running nose, fever and similar infections. Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), on the other hand, has recorded five per cent more patients during the same period of time. The average maximum temperature in Ranchi for the last few days has been hovering between 35C and 49C while the minimum is swinging between 20C and 25C. ""Our body regulates its temperature through sweating. In summer, we sweat more because it has a cooling effect. In winter, we sweat less because it helps us preserve heat. However, huge variations in maximum and minimum temperatures confuse our body,"" said Dr B.K. Singh, deputy superintendent of sadar hospital. The body is unable to regulate fluid intake when temperatures go yo-yo and that results in dehydration, muscle cramps and fatigue. ""Decreased fluid intake can also cause toxin build-up, leading to serious illnesses. Our immunity is decreased under these conditions, making us more prone to viral infections. On an average, 900 to 1,000 patients turn up at our OPD every day. Of late, there has been a five to 10 per cent increase in patient count and all of them are victims of viral infections,"" Dr Singh added. Deputy medical superintendent of RIMS Dr Gopal Srivastava said the usual OPD turnout was 1,500 to 2,000. ""But, for a week now, 1,600 to 2,100 patients are coming."" General physician at RIMS Dr J.K. Mitra said patients with chronic diseases such as asthma and bronchitis were particularly at risk. Viral infections can cause a spasm in their airways, necessitating hospitalisation. ""Frequent changes in temperature have an effect on humidity and dust in the air. Such conditions put people who are asthmatic or have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in trouble. The stress also has a bearing on the body's metabolism. It causes fluctuations in blood pressure and blood sugar levels. The elderly, diabetics and those with cardiac and renal ailments should be on alert,"" Dr Mitra said. Paediatricians are cautioning parents because young children have underdeveloped immunity and are also vulnerable to the maverick weather. They are advising improved oral hydration, particularly for infants. ""Taking an infant out during the daytime is a complete no-no. Oral hydration must be ensured at frequent intervals even at home. In case of high fever or convulsions, a doctor should be immediately consulted,"" said Dr Ajit Sahay, a child specialist. Weathermen called the capital's pendulous temperatures a common pre-monsoon phenomenon. ""The mercury goes berserk every year between April and June. Owing to extreme heating of land and westerly wind pattern, there are thunderstorms. But, as soon as the system dissipates and easterly winds take over, temperatures rise. The chain continues and temperatures fluctuate,"" said B.K. Mandal, director, Ranchi Meteorological Centre. How are you keeping your children safe in this weather? Tell [email protected]"
593ae6997be9e00e1ecd3faa,Sweet tooth? It's the liver,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170504/jsp/nation/story_149716.jsp,2017-05-04,"CRAVING FOR SWEETS New Delhi, May 3: A hormone made inside the liver may hold the key to the human sweet tooth. Scientists have gained what they believe are the first insights into the molecular mechanisms to help explain why some people like sweets more than others. The researchers at the University of Copenhagen have found that people with specific variants or versions of the gene that makes the hormone called FGF21 are 20 per cent more likely to enjoy feeding on sweets, such as ice cream or chocolates. Their study, published yesterday in the journal Cell Metabolism, also suggests for the first time that the liver, through the FGF21 hormone, may control human eating behaviour. Laboratory studies on rodents have already shown that the hormone acts on the brain's reward centre. ""We're now a step closer to understanding the molecular basis of the sweet tooth - something that has not been well understood,"" Matthew Gillum, assistant professor of biological sciences at the university, told The Telegraph. ""We think the liver sends messages to the brain and influences eating behaviour."" Gillum and his colleagues at the University of Iowa in the US had discovered the role of the FGF21 hormone in regulating the ingestion of sweets in rodents in 2015 and in non-human primates last year. Their current study was aimed at exploring whether the hormone also influences the consumption of sweets by humans. The scientists examined the eating habits of several thousand people across Denmark and found that people with either one or two variants of the FGF21 hormone were likely to consume larger amounts of sweets than people who lacked those specific variants of the gene. How exactly the genetic differences translate into behaviour is still unclear, Gillum said. ""It is possible that these variants perturb the normal regulatory pathway that restrains the appetite for sugar after a little bit has been consumed, but we still need to understand the precise mechanisms."" As part of their study, the researchers focused on people who either shunned sweets or were extremely fond of sweets and found differences in FGF21 levels between the two sets of people after fasting. Those who disliked sweets had fasting FGF21 levels higher than those who liked sweets. But when the volunteers drank sugar-laced water containing about twice as much sugar as a soft drink can, the FGF21 blood levels rose to about the same levels in both sets of people - those who disliked sweets and those who liked sweets. These observations suggest FGF21 may be a ""negative regulator"" of sweet consumption because the hormone increased markedly after the oral sugar intake and because those who dislike sweets have higher FGF21 levels than those who like. The researchers also detected an association between FGF21 and smoking and alcohol intake and have said their findings warrant a clinical trial to confirm the connection between FGF21 and sweet intake, alcohol drinking and smoking."

However, the same items sold in unit containers and bearing a registered brand name have been brought under the five per cent category. We would reiterate that all food items, whether branded or not, should be nil rated. Atta, maida, besan and other flours may also be treated similarly.Jayakumar said water sold in refill cans (bubble top) and small plastic pouches should be distinguished from water sold in bottles as the former were consumed by the lower strata of society as an essential commodity.We strongly urge that the first two categories be exempted or taxed at a lower rate of five per cent, he added.Films are proposed to be levied with 28 per cent tax. Tamil Nadu has a policy of exempting levy of tax on films made in the local language. We would urge that the tax be reduced for local language films, the minister said.He said that as far as jewellery was concerned, a distinction should be made between handmade jewellery and machine-made jewellery as handmade jewellery was made by small artisan and the jewellery was consumed by common folk.The minister also pointed out that most of the match factories in the State were either semi-mechanised or fully mechanised units. Considering the input tax embedded in raw materials there on both semi-mechanised and fully mechanised safety matches, tax rate should be reduced to 12 per cent instead of the proposed rate of 18 per cent so that the MRP price per match box could be kept at less than one rupee.He said palmyra jaggery (gur) known as karupatti and palmyra sugar known as panangalkandu were traditional cottage industries and were also organic products. As they are not specifically mentioned in the schedule, they are likely to be charged at 18 per cent. We request that karupatti may be mentioned in the Schedule along with cane jaggery in chapter 17, item 1, Jayakumar added."

Irrigation and Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh.As Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, under pressure from the Opposition and even his own party, ordered a probe by a retired judge into allegations of impropriety against Irrigation and Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh in sand mining auctions conducted by the state government, the son of a businessman-friend of the minister claimed he was the investor in the mines that had been allotted to Rana Gurjits former employees. Sanjit Singh Randhawa, son of J S Randhawa, said three of his companies had invested Rs 30 crore in the auction. Asked why he had not made this claim earlier, Sanjit Singh said: No one contacted me.The three firms, Sanjit Singh claimed, were formed in 2015 but none had any experience in mining. He claimed that Amit Bahadur, a former employee of Rana Gurjit, was a working partner in his company Rajbir Enterprises. He said it was this company that had invested in the sand mine in Saidpur Khurd, Nawanshahr that was acquired in the name of Bahadur during the auction. He said it was not possible for investors to stand in the sun and supervise mining operations and truckers, so an employee of the company had been made a working partner, and that he would be sharing a percentage of the profits.In a statement emailed to media organisations, Sanjit Singh also claimed that another of his companies, Rajbir Enterprises Mohali, put in money for a second sand mine in Mehadipur in Nawanshahr, acquired by one Kulwinder Singh for Rs 9.2 crore. Kulwinder had also been linked to Rana Gurjit, but Sanjit Singh said he was an employee of Rajbir Enterprises Mohali, who had been made a working partner. A third company called New Rajbir Enterprises, Sanjit Singh said, was behind the successful bid of Ajitpal Singh Gill, who made a successful bid of Rs 23.41 crore for Behloor Khurd in Nawanshahr. Gill was also described as a working partner.Sanjit Singh said the money had been arranged by his father J S Randhawa and Sahil Singla, a partner in the three firms. He said neither Amit Bahadur nor Kulvinder Paul Singh had invested their own money. His statement said that Amit Bahadur never served or worked as a cook anywhere  Bahadur was said to have been a cook with Rana Gurjits firm Rana Sugars. The statement said Bahadur was a labour contractor and his annual income was to the tune of about Rs 9 lakh. Sanjit Singh made these claims as Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ordered an inquiry into the allegations.The inquiry has been handed to Justice (retd) J S Narang who has to submit his report within a month. The terms of reference for the inquiry commission, formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, will be notified soon, according to a press release. Rana Gurjit, the release stated, had offered to resign to ensure free and fair investigation, but the Chief Minister asked him to continue till the outcome of the judicial probe. The announcement of the inquiry came hours before the AAPs planned dharna outside the Chief Ministers residence on Tuesday.The release stated that that the Chief Minister had taken suo motu cognizance of media reports charging the minister with acquiring certain mines in the names of his companys staff. It also said though Rana Gurjit had denied any links of his company, Rana Sugars Limited, to the auctions, and had stated that his company had no stake, direct or indirect, in the sand mining business, the Chief Minister decided in the interest of ethics and propriety to get the matter probed at the highest level. There was no question of allowing any deviation from the governments avowed policy of providing clean governance, said Captain Amarinder, adding that he would take all steps to ensure that there is no violation of the trust reposed by the people of Punjab in his government and the Congress.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Renu Phulia, and Smt. Sumedha Kataria, the then Additional Deputy Commissioners, Ambala at par with what has been initiated against the forest officials and therefore a senior competent police officer, having an impeccable reputation and integrity, be deputed to investigate the matter, the Lokayukta said in the order.The Lokayukta also said that an action taken report on the recommendations be sent to it within three months. Justice Agarwal has sent his recommendations to state Chief Secretary DS Dhesi. Haryanas Health Minister and Ambala Cantt MLA Anil Vij has hailed the Lokayuktas decision.Earlier, a Vigilance probe in 2012 into the alleged scam had not only indicted senior forest officers, but had also recommended action against the IAS officers.Months after taking over, the BJP government in 2015 had ordered an FIR against nine forest officers, including the then Ambala Divisional Forest Officer Jagmohan Sharma.

Does orange juice accompany your office lunch box almost every day, but the idea of grabbing that whole orange, peeling it off and consuming it gives you cold feet? If your answers are positive, its about time that you should rethink your choices. Nutritionists are of the opinion that while juices are good to quench summer thirst, they are not enough to provide the needed vitamins and minerals for your body.During the preparation of fruit juices, the fruit is pressed or squeezed and the skin is removed. This often leads to loss of important nutrients, vitamins and fibres like Pectin present in apple, guava and oranges, that are essential for your body. Many fruit juices are also devoid of water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C, vitamin B complex vitamins as well as anti-oxidants which can be important to meet body requirements.Fruits such as water melon, musk melon, sweet lemon and pineapple are high in water content and keeps the body hydrated. Mangoes, lychees and papayas are also beneficial during the summer season as they are rich in ascorbic acid, vitamin A and dietary fibres that not only provides natural UV protection but also boosts up body immunity levels. It is important to consume at least two whole fruits every day. Every category of fruit has different health benefits and a person can choose these fruits accordingly.Pome fruits: They have anti-oxidant, anti-viral and anti-tumor properties and are good sources of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E as well as folic acid. It is important that at least one apple is consumed everyday as it provides all the essential vitamins and minerals, that is required by body to function properly. Example of pome fruits are apple and pear.Citrus fruits: They are high sources of ascorbic acid which is essential to treat low levels of vitamin C that can otherwise lead to scurvy. It also acts as an antioxidant. Examples of citrus fruits are oranges, lime and watermelon.Tropical fruits: They are calorie dense and hence are important for body. Examples are bananas, mangoes and pineapples.Stone fruits: They are rich in potassium and promotes healthy nerves and muscles. They also have antioxidant properties and help in boosting immunity. Examples are apricot, grapes, cherries and plums.The edible skins of many fruits have high nutrition value and should not be avoided. The fruit pulp is another important source of fibre and other vital nutrients.For instance, the white pulpy part in orange which is a source of flavonoids is often removed in the process of converting it into juice. Also, a lot of fruit juices provide empty calories which shoot up blood sugar faster than the whole fruit. Therefore, it is important to include whole fruits in your diet to meet body requirements.The author is a dietician executive, Columbia Asia Hospital, YeshwanthpurMangoCut a mango into slices and relish it as an evening snack or with salads.

(File photo) Rana Gurjit Singh. (File photo)Four days before the e-auction of sand mines in Punjab, in which a former employee of Minister for Power and Irrigation Rana Gurjit Singh bagged a Rs 26 crore contract, the government changed the rules of the auction to keep the names of the bidders secret. The sand mine contract to Amit Bahadur, who was a cook with Rana Gurjits firm Rana Sugars, has triggered demands by opposition parties for the ministers resignation. Rana Gurjit has sought to distance himself from Bahadur saying that he left his employment in February this year.The e-auction for the sand mines, which saw aggressive bidding, took place on May 19 and 20. While introducing the e-auctioning system, the Congress government had said it would ensure total transparency in issue of contracts and end the reign of sand mafia as well as other illegalities. On May 3, in the first announcement of the auction  notice number GLG/Pb/G-1/Auction 1085/Auction 2017/734-B  Para 8 stated that the list of prospective bidders would be posted on the website of the Department of Industries, http://www.investpunjab.gov.in, after scrutiny of their documents and payment of earnest money.But on May 15, the department issued a corrigendum stating that para 8 of the earlier notice stood deleted and the list of prospective bidders would be kept secret. No reasons were given. The corrigendum was signed by Director, Mining, Amit Dhaka. Speaking to The Indian Express, Dhaka said the names were kept secret to avoid cartelisation during the auction process. Para 8 was deleted to prevent cartelisation as it was a progressive bidding system, he said.Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, who is the Minister for Industries and Commerce, under which the Department of Mining falls, has not made any public comment on the controversy so far. However, Congress sources told The Indian Express the party high command has conveyed to the CM that he must ensure that the state government maintains a clean image. Within the Punjab Congress too, there is unease over the governments silence on the allegations against a senior Cabinet minister.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

593ae7e67be9e00e1ecd41ac,Jute feels plastic pinch,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170504/jsp/business/story_149618.jsp,2017-05-04,"Calcutta, May 3: The jute industry fears there will be a further dilution of the Centre's mandatory packing rules for foodgrain and sugar that will severely hurt the sector and benefit the plastic players. The department of food and public distribution has recommended compulsory use of jute for packaging 75 per cent of grains down from 90 per cent under the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packaging Commodities) Act 1987. The standing advisory committee that recommends norms for use of jute bags for jute year (July-June) is set to take up this recommendation soon. The department has also recommended full exemption for sugar from mandatory packaging norms. So far, 20 per cent of sugar had to be packed in jute bags. The Centre's logic behind this dilution stems from the inadequate supply of jute bags from mills. Textile ministry officials said the orders of jute bags are required to be placed in advance and if the supply is not according to the demand packaging is affected. Jute industry representatives, however, said this year production was adequate for smooth supply unlike last year when there were shortages. ""Any dilution will hit the industry hard, especially in Bengal. Close to 80 per cent of raw jute produced and 90 per cent of jute mills are located in the state,"" a jute mill owner said. The proposed dilutions are in line with the recommendation of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) as well. ""There has been demand for 100 per cent mandatory packing of foodgrains and sugar in bags but production of jute has not kept pace with increase in demand for sacking and other value-added products,"" the CACP said in its report on price policy. ""If 100 per cent packaging for both foodgrains and sugar is made mandatory as proposed by Indian Jute Mills Association and farmers, the supply will fall short of the demand. It would also not encourage jute industry to develop and diversify into high-value products,"" it added. CACP had also recommended dilution in compulsory packaging in a time bound manner so that some raw jute can be used for value-added products."

593ae7eb7be9e00e1ecd41b7,Finding home,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170505/jsp/opinion/story_149790.jsp,2017-05-05,"SHARING THE DREAM: THE REMARKABLE WOMEN OF SANTINIKETAN Edited by Tapati Mukhopadhayay and Amrit Sen, Visva-Bharati, Rs 300 Around 10 years ago I was gifted a set of postcards visually documenting Indian women from 1875 to 1947, published by the Centre for Women's Development Studies, Delhi. The set included a photograph, from Santiniketan of the 1930s, of the well-known Hindi writer, Shivani (Gaura Pant, whose writer-daughter, Mrinal Pande, we are more familiar with), chewing sugarcane sitting on a bullock cart with a fellow student. That unusual image sparked some curiosity in me and I found out that the young girl from Kumaon had spent more than a decade in Santiniketan with her brother and sister, graduating from Visva-Bharati and going back to the hills in 1943. Shivani's biography mentions Santiniketan having had a profound influence on her life and writings. The joyful and hilarious account of her days there in a book called Amader Santiniketan delighted me. Thereafter, Shivani got buried under a heap of sundry things in my mind until suddenly I found myself thinking of her again while leafing through a volume on the women of Santiniketan. The editors of this volume have put together a collection of essays with the intention of documenting the role of ""several remarkable women who shared Rabindranath Tagore's dream of creating an ecologically conscious and culturally enriched cosmopolitan community"". As histories of Santiniketan have generally foregrounded men around the poet, they say, it is time to recall the contributions of women who richly contributed to the ethos of Santiniketan. Thus it is evident that this history writing/documentation is in an additive mode, highlighting women's participation without problematizing their roles and questioning the fields of power. For example, had it been otherwise, the piece on the ""Rhapsodic Amita Sen (Khuku)"" - who Rabindranath trusted most after his nephew, Dinendranath Tagore, to remember his songs and pass them on to others - would not have been so obsessed with trying to analyse her music recordings and place her as ""the best artiste of the oral tradition of Santiniketan gharana"" while maintaining a deafening silence about the difficult relationship that later developed between Amita and her world-renowned mentor. There is a set of essays here on women of the Tagore household of which Supriya Roy's beautiful piece on Protima Debi and the creative collaboration between the poet and his daughter-in-law needs special mention, another set on wives and daughters of some of the earliest and leading architects of Santiniketan and Sriniketan, and a few pieces on some of the women students of Santiniketan who went on to become famous. There are also a couple of pieces that cannot be grouped easily which includes Amrit Sen's important essay on Gretchen Green. This American nurse-midwife not only acted as a bridge between women of the neighbouring villages and Santiniketan in the early 1920s but also made the first documentary film for the ashram's publicity in 1923. Her autobiography, called The Whole World and Company, suggests how she had imbibed the spirit of cosmopolitanism from her brief stint in Santiniketan. The book ends with short bio-notes on some of the ""powerful women"" of Santiniketan without any clarification as to why they should be considered ""powerful"" and included specially. Citing the paucity of memoirs by women whose roles have been documented, the editors clarify that they have chosen ""two sets of methodologies, personal reminiscence and critical analysis"". While there is nothing wrong in bringing together a set of personal reminiscences with a set of critical essays, there is an overflowing of memory pieces here from the descendants of some of the women, without leaving any room for reflection and critical distance. A notable exception is the reflective piece by Santanu Mitra on his mother, Sujata Mitra, which draws interesting links between Sujata's life and Rabindranath's vision of and Kalimohon Ghosh's work in rural reconstruction, anecdotally recording significant mutations all the way. If reminiscences were to be the backbone of the book, would it not have been worthwhile to translate scattered written fragments (quite a few exist) and transcriptions of oral narratives of some of the women portrayed and tie them up imaginatively with a critical introduction? It is also intriguing to see precious photographs that could have egged the reader on to visualize the lives that women in Santiniketan lived then occupy marginal space and get shabby placement in a book preoccupied with recollections. Aware of some ""glaring omissions"", which the editors hope to correct in forthcoming volumes, they say nothing about the organizing principle of this one, and indeed of their selection of some of the pieces here. What, for instance, is the point of including a longish obituary piece on Mahasweta Devi without discussing her relationship with Santiniketan? I was looking for Mahasweta, a former student of Visva-Bharati. She used to say that at Santiniketan she learnt to feel joy simply by seeing flowers on the trees or gathering flowers that had fallen off instead of plucking them. What were her exchanges with Santiniketan? I would have liked to know. Since the editors allude to the cosmopolitan community that Santiniketan once was, embracing and learning from people who came from elsewhere, believing that this is where the world makes its home in a nest, I was also hoping that a few women who came from other communities and other parts of the country to make Santiniketan their own would figure in this volume. I was thinking of the writer Shivani no doubt, also of the artist Jaya Appaswamy, of the musician Rajeshwari Vasudev and of many others whose names I do not know but who carried Santiniketan in their hearts and through their work all their lives. I believe a more variegated story would have emerged if women's contribution to the ""ethos of Santiniketan"" had been measured in different ways and the selection not largely confined to women from a particular social constituency."

Recently they have introduced another menu which have dishes you may have never heard of before and in a new avatar, dishes that seem familiar yet exotic and dishes that are modern in approach but draw from traditional recipes.All that was served was outstanding, but here is my pick of what you should not miss.Whats Good?Tikki Choley: This is right from the streets of Punjab or even better than that. The velvety fritters on a bed of spiced chickpeas, finished with a trio of finger-licking chutneys is the best I have ever had. Somewhere in the process of growing up, I had lost interest in chaats but this bowl of Tikki Choley at Punjab Grill won me over.Mutton Champa: These mutton cutlets are panco crusted and shallow fried in desi ghee. Undoubtedly, one of the best, delectable, sophisticated mutton cutlets I have ever had. That crunch, that balanced mutton taste and to top it all, the fine aroma of desi ghee, thats all you need for a fine evening.Gurh Ka Halwa: For people with sweet tooth, this is a googly you would like to take on. Well, if you think what can be fascinating in a halwa, you need to get a spoonful of this sweet surprise. This home-style halwa of semolina and wheat flour is sweetened with not sugar but organic jaggery and is topped with cashew nuts. That soulful aroma and taste produced by jaggery is what makes this halwa standout.The limited new menu will be available till June end, post which Punjab Grill is planning to combine the signature dishes of the old menu and the current menu.Gulab Jamun (soft centered with either of Pistachio, Nutella or white chocolate) with Rum on Fire: This is from the old menu, but I cannot help but mention it. What makes this a theatrical dish and the one which raises the bar is when the rum is set on fire and then poured on the Gulab Jamun. Trust me when I say, you wouldnt have tasted anything so wonderful ever like this before. This is a must have before you exit the doors of Punjab Grill. I am sure this will be included in their upcoming menu.Other important mentions from the select series menu are Keema Karela and Makhhan Wali Lassi.Whats bad?NoneWhats Ugly?NoneRating: 5/5Cost for two: B1,500"

Alarmingly, smoking accounts for one in five deaths among men and one in 20 deaths among women.Additional Commissioner-cum-Member, Enforcement (BDA) Bhabani Shankar Chayani said the special awareness drive on evils of tobacco and cancer will be a real eye opener for many citizens at the event."
593ae8277be9e00e1ecd421d,Study to track tea pattern,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170503/jsp/northeast/story_149427.jsp,2017-05-03,"A tea garden in Mariani Guwahati, May 2: The Tea Board of India will carry out a study to determine domestic consumption of tea to draw a specific strategy to promote sales in the segment. Though the Indian tea industry is the second largest producer in the world, more than 80 per cent of the tea is consumed domestically. The board says the consumption of tea varies from state to state and Union Territories in terms of quantity, preference of tea and others. The pattern also differs from urban to rural areas. The consumption is also attributable to lifestyle changes, disposable income, health benefits of consumption and others. The board is looking for organisations to conduct the study and they should have experience and understanding of the Indian tea sector, designing promotion strategy and market assessment. Tea consumption per capita in India is 800gm whereas the highest is Turkey (3.14kg) followed by Afghanistan with 2.44kg. ""A survey on domestic consumption of tea is necessary in order to formulate the future production plans to align with the domestic demand and boost consumption,"" the board said. The board in its 2015-16 annual report said though per capita consumption in the country is lower here as compared to other countries, because of its population, tea consumption in the country accounts for 19 per cent of global consumption. This distinct position is in sharp contrast to other tea-producing countries, particularly Kenya and Sri Lanka, which hardly have any strong demand and hence they are able to export most of their production. The study will capture through questionnaires key consumption patterns like penetration level at household (male/female, age, education, income, time of drinking, intake (specifying size) per day, preferred habits (hot/cold, liquor, flavour, masala-spices, with/without milk, sugar) and intake/preference of other beverages, including health drinks vis--vis tea. Besides, it will also find out what kind of tea is being consumed (black/green, orthodox/CTC dust), price share of tea in total household budget, frequency and quantity of purchase (da-ily/weekly/monthly). It also intends to find out the factors (including health benefits) influencing tea drinking, institutional consumption and source of purchase (local market or direct seller). The study will also carry out research to benchmark tea consumption patterns of India with major tea consuming countries and understand the interplay of different factors affecting the tea-price movement. It will suggest key interventions required by the Tea Board to ensure demand-supply match with increase in domestic demand for tea."

593ae8397be9e009ad91c451,Latur: Lucky but not safe,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jun/07/latur-lucky-but-not-safe-1613979.html,2017-06-07,"LATUR: Driving in Latur at dawn in the last week of May, you see women splashing water on their front yards, and you know that the frightening drought of the year before has been forgotten. Last summer, an aeon ago, this was a town of water queues kept in order by the instrument of Section 144.As water scarcities go, it had been an extraordinary one. An entire train had been commandeered to ply water to these parts, 108 trips by what came to be called the Latur Water Special, each time carrying 25.95 lakh litres to three lakh people in the parched district. The train had opened up possibilities: yes indeed why cant water be carried to deserts?At dawn this summer, the town had gone back to being sleepy. The 360 water tankers that had rumbled about then have now been whittled down to six, operating only to uphill villages where the basalt bedrock allows no percolation to the water table beneath.It could even be claimed as some sort of an achievement, as I was later to be told by the new collector and municipal commissioner of Latur, Sreekanth Sajjan. This year we started using water tankers only in the third week of May, he said.The miracle occurred over a week in mid September last year. A downpour not seen in all of the monsoon months ensured that the annual precipitation figure soared to a record 1110.92 mm, against the 10-year average of 802.13 mm. It had dipped to 413.48 mm in the year of the Latur Water Special. It was some manna from heaven. The Manjara dam filled up and remains substantially turgid today. Ground water levels recorded an average of 1 m rise.Predicatly, Latur was a happy place this summer, the opposite of what they had been in 2016  all for the grace of one burst of the clouds. Anasuya Podare remembers the torrid months last year. She and her husband had moved to Latur after a tiff with their children and took up a servitors jobs at the local Mahalakshmi temple. The 65-year-old woman used to spent three to four hours in queues for one pot of water last year. Now she walks a few metres to the tap and fills up as much as she needs.""I have no count of the money I spent last season to buy water, she says.But here in Marathwada, water shortage is an unforgettable mistress. It indulges you for no more than one season. Even in this summer of unanticipated surplus, there are localities in Latur that are served water once in eight days, plausibly because one of the nine water tanks in the city has gone on the blink.But even in those localities, this years privations are leavened by the experience of last year. Anita Patil, a resident of water-short Revenue Colony, told me she still has to buy water. But its not as bad as last year, whe she had had to spend Rs 3000 per month all of 2016.New to the job, collector Sajjan has to wrestle with the detritus of last years disaster, mainly illegal bore wells that had sprouted in the frenzy of near-famine conditions. ""Illegal bore wells and lack of awareness among people are some of the reasons why we are unable to check water wastage, he said.During the high fever of 2016, bore wells had been dug by the hundreds. While no one kept count of the exact number of illegal ones, at least 2000 bore wells were dug in the town, some as deep as 700-800 feet. The groundwater departments rules prescribe a dainty five per square km.As anyone familiar with the hydrography of Marathwada knows, drought is never far away in Latur. Even in this frolicsome summer, you only have to step out of town to meet it. About 11 km east of Latur, in Bhatkeda village, a habitation of 600 families where one branch of the Manjara flows by, there is not a drop of water to drink.After the downpour of September, water had to be released from the Manjara dam and it flooded the village. By January, barely four months later, the Manjara had dried up as always. Marginal farmer Baba Shiekh said, Theres water in this stream for four months a year. The rest of the year, its dry.A 60-year-old farmer, Madhukar Gurame said hes not fooled by the surplus of September 2016. He had never been able to fully irrigate his 14 acres for 15 years. He dug 15 bore wells during that time, some as deep as 650 ft.A SUGARCANE ADDICTIONLatur knows its been lucky. Knowing droughts frequent visitations, the state government launched what it called the Jalyukt-Shivar Abhiyaan (JYS) in 2014 with the bold aim of making the district drought-free by 2019. Some 13 different water conservation schemes were announced, involving broadening and deepening of river beds, afforestation, watershed management, rain water harvesting mechanisms, the works.However, local conservaton experts Pradeep Purandare, a retired prof at the Water and Land Management Institute in Aurangabad, are sure they are missing the point as usual. They are digging up river beds, he complained. A river is a discharge zone, not a recharge zone. They need to check the hydrography of the place and study the aquifer status, where it allows filtration and penetration of ground water. All thats not being done.Typical of the thrashing about that a disaster always produces in India, none of the water conservation schemes is being implemented in a scientific manner, Prof Purandare said. There is too much of widening and deepening of nalas and then are no watershed development systems in place either.And then there is the local farmers obsession with water-guzzling sugarcane. Take Kendriya Veerendra Sambhaji Rao, a 49-year-old farmer who owns 20 acres in a village called Patoda, 80 km from Latur. After three years of drought had parched his land and drained his pockets, he still stuck with sugarcane. After that copious September, he sowed 10 acres of sugarcane and 10 acres of soya bean and toor dal. I earn a minimum of Rs 9 lakh from sugarcane, and less than Rs 2 lakh from any of the other crops. There are three sugarcane factories in this taluka and it is a lucrative option for me, he said. So why not?But Prof Purandare has a quarrel with that. Sugarcane is the main reason for the water scarcity endemic in Latur -- bar the odd lucky year. Of the 10 river basins that fall in Marathwada, seven are in deficit with available water less than 3000 cubic metres per hectare. The forest area is only 4 per cent. There are 11 major irrigation projects and all of them have water in a good year. But sugarcane plantations guzzle it all up, he says.In fact, when the Manjara project was designed, it had been mandated that only 3 per cent of the water should be used for sugarcane. Now the actual usage is more like 77 per cent.The government does not want to address this issue. Instead, it comes up with ideas like JYS which would only make it worse, he said.STILL SLOW TO ADOPT RWHLatur is no stranger to the idea of rain water harvesting (RWH). Activist Amol Ravindra Gowande has been advocating it for 15 years. In all of that time, only about 5000 people set up systems on their rooftops. But after last year's drought, 5000 chastened households rushed to sign up. So today, only 10,000 of the one lakh properties in Latur have RWH in place.For a drought-prone city, theres no good reason why the number should be so low. Oil merchant Mohan Pardesi is one of the few converts to RWH. His rooftop mechanism protected him from the Big Dry of 2016, generating 3000 litres of water per day even in the dreadful summer.""We set this up in 2003 with an investment of Rs 6000. I harvest one lakh litres from the 2000 sq feet terrace every year. My bore well has not gone dry for 15 years,"" he said. It takes care of his household and the small-scale oil extraction industry he runs.And his 200 ft bore well yielded enough to let him be charitable last summer. He shared 4000 litres of water with his neighbours.Prof Purandare is skeptical that latur has come to its senses. It is hard to believe that after years of slacking, the people of Latur have woken up to reality, he says."

The city has presently around 13,000 registered and 5,000 unregistered street vendors.Under the drive, the officials have asked vendors to cover their food products and use containers like stainless steel to ensure hygienic preservation of food products. The drive will continue till June, before the onset of monsoon season.The drive will encourage unregistered vendors to get registered or face enforcement action. We aim to educate vendors to keep food stalls and surroundings clean. They will be asked to procure dustbins to collect leftovers, paper plates and used glasses etc, said Ajay Jaiswal, designated officer of the department.In Ghaziabad, the instances of substandard, fake brands of food products and violation of regulations are common. During the last financial year ( 2016-17), 152 of nearly 568 samples taken from different vendors and establishments failed the required tests. Officials said that majority of samples were either related to food products found substandard or misbranded. A total of 27 of these were found unsafe for consumption.The instances of unsafe category cases are sent to the judicial court where the violators can also get life imprisonment. The cases of misbranded and substandard products are put on trial before executive courts and carry a penalty up to Rs 5 lakh.Vendors and establishments often cheat consumers when it comes to food. In this context, we have also decided to hold awareness camps at 15 schools where students will be trained to check regular items of consumption which they can also test at home without any special reagents, Jaiswal said.The items for which testing training will be provided include milk, oils and fats, spices, sugar confectionery and food grains. During the drive on Wednesday, the department provided free head masks and gloves to vendors and also showed them how to offer food to customers in a hygienic manner ."

The new tax regime will unify Asias third largest economy into a common market, eliminating a string of central and state levies, and is expected to shore up state and federal tax revenues, cool inflation and accelerate economic growth by 1-2 percentage points in the medium term.While manufactured goods will attract 18% GST, other household items such as sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will attract 5% levy, senior officials said after a meeting of the powerful GST Council in Srinagar.Luxury cars will be taxed at 28% GST plus a cess of 15%, while small petrol cars will be taxed at 28% GST plus a 1% cess and small diesel cars at 28% plus 3% cess.The council fixed the rates for more than 1,200 items and will discuss on Friday the rates on some other items and services.It might meet one more time if tax rates for all items are not decided by then, finance minister Arun Jaitley said after the first days discussions.There is no increase in overall tax in any of the items, while there is a reduction of tax on many of the items, Jaitley said. On several commodities, we consciously brought down the tax rate.Capital goods, a key asset for the manufacturing sector, will be taxed at 28%.Several daily-use items such as hair oil, toothpaste, and soap have been kept in the 18%-slab instead of at 28%. Aerated drinks too have been put in the 28 per cent bracket.The present tax incidence in excess of 28% on luxury items will be treated as cess after the GST rollout and will go to the corpus for compensating states for any revenue loss.Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said 81% of the items will attract tax of 18% or below. Only 19% of items will be taxed at the highest rate of 28%, he said.The biggest take away from the decision is that food items will become cheaper, Adhia added.The cost of energy generation is likely to come down as the tax incidence on coal will come down to 5% from about 11% now.Jammu and Kashmir, which has a special Constitutional status, will pass separate laws regarding central, state and inter-state GST so that the Himalayan state can roll out the tax reform from July 1, said a senior state official.We cannot delay the implementation of GST as it could affect movement of goods into and out of the state, the official said on the condition of anonymity.Read more | GST Council finalises tax rates on 80-90% goods, services"

The market value of the contraband is estimated at Rs 1.5 crore.The accused Sainara Bibi, a 45-year-old woman professional peddler, has been arrested in at least three such cases between 2009 and 2012.After her release from jail in 2012, Sainara had maintained a low profile. However, with a strong network in Balasore, Bhadrak and suburbs on West Bengal-Odisha border, her business thrived. At least a dozen attempts by the police to nab her with drugs proved futile in the last one year.We had set up a network of informers to tip us off about Sainaras activities. On Wednesday she was nabbed during an early morning operation when she was on her way back from the railway Station, said Sahadevkhunta IIC Pragyan Mohanty, who led the team that nabbed Sainara.An old hand in the trade, Sainara always ensured that the contraband was not kept at home. Police said she used to dispose of the drug to her clients within an hour of receiving the consignment most of which came from West Bengal.

St. James' School, Calcutta Girls' High School and the two Apeejay schools have altered their timings so that students can get home before the daytime temperature peaks. All classes at St. James' are giving over by noon since last week while Calcutta Girls has advanced its dispersal time to 10.30am for the junior classes and 12.20pm for the rest. The Apeejay schools are giving over at 11.30am for classes 1 to IX and XI since Tuesday, which was also the last working day for the kindergarten section before the summer vacation. Classes X and XII will give over at 1.30pm till their summer recess starts later this month. ""Our plus-two students are staying in school longer than the rest because the syllabus has to be completed. But since some of our classrooms are air-conditioned, classes can be held in those. For the rest, we have split a day's timetable into two,"" said Rita Chatterjee, principal of Apeejay. Three students at Apeejay School Park Street had complained of dizziness and one threw up in the classroom last week. They were all taken to a nearby hospital, where the doctor who examined them said the heat was to blame for their condition. At Calcutta Girls, the decision to curtail classes was taken based on feedback from teachers and parents. Scanty rainfall this summer has ensured that conditions are unbearable even at noon, which is the earliest that schools can let off students without compromising on classroom time. The advice from doctors to students is to stay hydrated and not engage in prolonged outdoor activities, especially when the sun is blazing. ""Children should not be playing in the open from 10am till 4pm and schools should avoid holding their morning assembly in the sun. Too much of aerated drinks is also a no-no because the sugar content draws water from the intestines, which can lead to dehydration,"" said paediatrician B.K. Manocha. Apurba Ghosh, director of the Institute of Child Health, said half of the young patients he had seen over the past week had taken ill because of the weather. ""In the last seven days, 50 per cent of the children who came to us had fever. Our advice to all children is to carry an umbrella when out in the sun and not drink water immediately after coming indoors from any kind of activity in the sun."" Some schools like Calcutta Boys have reported a drop in attendance. ""We have had a 7 to 10 per cent decline in attendance across all classes,"" said Raja McGee, principal of Calcutta Boys."

""The fair aims to boost flow of goods, enhance people-to-people ties and bolster knowledge exchange among the nations for a better economic engagement. ""We have certain sectors where Bengal can invest. These include tourism, agro-based industries, bio-medicines, sugar, flour, tobacco, minerals, infrastructure - particularly high speed railways,"" said Li Xiuling, senior adviser to the Peoples' government of Yunnan Province, said. He was speaking at an interactive session on Yunnan-Bengal economic growth organised by ICC in Calcutta on Tuesday. ""Bengal with a value-added growth rate higher than the national average reflects significant opportunities, where China can invest and there could be strong economic ties between the two,"" said Subrata Mukherjee, Bengal's minister of panchayat and public health engineering, at the same event. Mukherjee feels Bengal has various sectors where it can successfully collaborate with the Yunnan province of China.<> Being particularly impressed by the infrastructure and construction industries in China he mentioned that both Bengal and Yunnan can associate in the upcoming period and reap benefits from the cooperation which will help in fortifying their economic ties and foster respective growth going ahead. ""Owing to its geographic location, Bengal is imperative to the Act East Policy of the government of India. Thus the cooperation with Yunnan will help in channelizing each other's comparative advantages and open up new avenues of engagement for India with the South Asian nations through Bengal,"" he said adding that Bengal boasts a value added growth of nearly 12.5 per cent, which is highest among all states in India and thus felt that it is the most opportune moment for Yunnan to invest in the state and both the regions to optimize their trade ties."

He was sentenced on Thursday to 15 years in prison by US district judge Darrin Gayles in Miami.The first scheme involved nearly 100 investors who purchased $30 million worth of promissory notes purported secured by interests in iron ore mining in Chile.The second scheme involved unlawfully obtaining $1.2 million in economic development funds as well as valuable industrial property from the state of South Carolina.Xavier was convicted by guilty plea in January on two counts of wire fraud. One wire fraud count related to the investment fraud scheme and the other count to the South Carolina economic development scheme.According to documents filed in court, from September 2010 through May 2014, Xavier operated Essex Holdings from an office in Miami and raised more than $30 million from nearly 100 investors for supposed investments in sugar transportation and shipping, as well as iron ore mining in Chile.He used false financial statements, forged documents and false promises of fixed rates of return, to induce people to invest in company. Most of the money was used for purposes other than what was promised, including to support lavish spending by Xavier and his wife for expensive jewellery, luxury vehicles, wedding expenses, and cosmetic surgery.Eventually, Xavier used new investor money to pay old investors in a Ponzi-like fashion before the scheme collapsed.Evidence filed in court showed that the actual investor losses from the scheme exceeded $29 million.The second scheme involved Xavier using Essex Holdings to obtain $1.2 million in payments and approximately $1.5 million worth of commercial real estate from the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Economic Development (SCCCED), a division of the South Carolina state government, that was supposed to be used to develop a dilapidated industrial property into a diaper plant and rice packaging facility.According to documents filed in the court, he provided false financial documentation to SCCCED in order to obtain the contract, and later provided fake contractor invoices and fake bank statements in order to get paid under the contract. As with the investment fraud scheme, Xavier spent a significant portion of the development money for his personal expenses, and wired some of it to the same overseas accounts used in the investment fraud."
593ae8d97be9e00e1ecd4341,Competitive hunger strike in AAP,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170514/jsp/nation/story_151540.jsp,2017-05-14,"New Delhi, May 13: An Aam Aadmi Party lawmaker began a hunger strike this morning after offering prayers at Mahatma Gandhi's memorial, making him the second party MLA to go on a fast in less than a week. Sanjeev Jha's fast, however, is a hunger strike against a hunger strike. The competitive abstention from food unfolded as Jha, an AAP MLA from north Delhi, demanded that sacked Delhi minister Kapil Mishra provide details of his corruption allegation against party boss and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Mishra - who too is on hunger strike - had claimed that he saw Kejriwal accept Rs 2 crore in cash from a cabinet colleague who is being probed for alleged graft. The suspended MLA, dropped as water minister earlier this month after he spoke out against Kejriwal's criticism of EVMs, has been on hunger strike at his Civil Lines residence for four days now, demanding expenditure details of foreign trips by five senior leaders. Mishra, who the government says was dropped because of complaints of water problems, has even approached the CBI and the Anti-Corruption Branch, alleging corruption by party leaders. Jha today tweeted a letter to Mishra asking him to specify when he visited Kejriwal's house to witness the alleged handover of cash, or say sorry. He also retweeted a letter from an unnamed AAP worker's mother to Mishra's mother Annapurna Mishra, a former BJP mayor of East Delhi, asking her how she could hand over her son to Kejriwal whom her party considered corrupt and anti-national. Jha was detained by police when he tried to sit in hunger strike opposite Mishra's bungalow and taken along with more than 50 party workers and two other MLAs to Sarai Rohilla police station in north Delhi. That prompted a tweet from party spokesperson Preeti Menon: ""@Sanjeev_aap arrested by @DelhiPolice for sitting on a dharna! Need any more evidence that Kapil Mishra's dharna is Centre sponsored."" Jha, who has said he would continue his hunger strike at Jantar Mantar, was later released. He also got some advice from Mishra. ""You are mesmerized by Arvind Kejriwal, like I was.... Drink a lot of water. Take care,"" the former minister said in a letter tweeted to Jha. Mishra also tweeted that police were trying to detain him, saying state government doctors had deliberately reported that his sugar levels were too low and intended to forcefully end his hunger strike. Earlier in the day, Mishra had tweeted an image of Lord Krishna attempting to hurl a chariot-wheel at Bhishma Pitamah in the Mahabharat. He wrote: ""Sir Arvind Kejriwal, I front of our chakravyuh of deceit and lies, I only submit this image."" In the Mahabharat, Krishna breaks his vow of not taking up arms to protect his devotee Arjun from Bhishma. He is stopped by Arjun, whose son Abhimanyu is killed in the chakravyuh formation of rival Kaurava forces. A source close to Mishra said he saw himself as Abhimanyu, being sacrificed in the war against corruption. Letter threat Ashish Khetan, one of the leaders whose travel details Mishra has asked for, has claimed that he received a threat letter allegedly sent by the Sanatan Sanstha - a Goa- and Maharashtra-based outfit being investigated for the murder of rationalists M.M. Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar.# Khetan had received a similar letter last year. Yesterday's letter says: ""Because of journalists like you saints like Sadhvi Pragya Singh (recently acquitted in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case) rotted for years in jail... Bad Hindus like you deserve to be executed, and god willing this will be fulfilled soon."" Khetan was a journalist before he joined the AAP. Khetan today wrote to Union home minister Rajnath Singh, saying: ""The letter sent to me is a chilling reminder of the growing confidence of anti-national and fascist forces who want to exterminate all dissenting voices with violence. The language used in the letter is seemingly similar to many threats that Dabholkar had received immediately before he was brutally killed."" He added: ""I would like to urge you not to treat this as an individual matter. I am writing this on behalf of scores of journalists, activists, artists, writers and ordinary citizens across the country who have been threatened or attacked by the right wing forces. In the ardent hope that the present government will carry out its constitutional duty of protecting liberty and democracy, I am writing you this letter."""
593ae8da7be9e00e1ecd4344,What's in a can,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170514/jsp/opinion/story_151437.jsp,2017-05-14,"Run Pat run. Pat can run. Ann can run. Can Ann run? Learning English in school till the mid-1960s meant, for a large segment of unsuspecting toddlers throughout the world, having to spell out the various exertions that Pat and Ann engaged in. But running is about all that Ann did to match Pat - which was a 'boy name' and not a diminutive of Patricia. Or Cleopatra. Ann, like Jane a bit later - when the infants are being taught four-letter words - and maybe Jenny, even later, usually helps Mother in the kitchen, making buns perhaps - Jane has to make a cake - or getting the tea, or laying out the cups: that is, training to become the sugar-and-spice-and-all-things-nice being that Mother and Father can both love. Ann can get the hat, but Father puts it on, and even Pat can. Put it on. Pat, generally, is helping Father with the car, or in mowing the grass. Boy jobs and girl jobs are as old as reading, if a child went to school for an English-medium education in the 1960s. Why blame Theresa May? The prime minister of the United Kingdom was just being open about her early training when she appeared with her husband on The One Show, and claimed that there are boys' jobs and girls' jobs. Both husband and wife were in tender agreement that taking out the trash was traditionally a boy job. The problem is that Ms May is now in 2017, not making buns with Ann in Mother's kitchen, but actually leading one of the most important countries - still - in the Western world. That lends all her public statements immeasurable weight. Perhaps Ms May was feeling relaxed - exceptional for her - or being charming - even more exceptional - or just telling the world, with coy indirection, what a lovely marriage she has. It may be that she knows that the ideal-family-life image will go down thunderously well with her electorate, and that would require 'traditional' gender roles. Or, much worse, she meant it. Either way, her remarks reveal a dippy confusion in thinking that, it can be hoped, has nothing to do with her party ideology. Humankind may not have been able to transcend gender-stereotyped activities yet - and these are different in different cultures - but to project these as part of a model conjugal existence suggests that Ms May is rather out of touch with the fact that the world has changed. No one who wishes to appear respectable will support a theory of boy jobs and girl jobs; they will be strident in their derision whatever happens at home. But Ms May's remarks have raised an irresistible question. What is it that the West finds so virile - sexy? husbandly? - about taking out the trash? Why the reverse glamour? Women taking out the trash are not half as talked about, although they do it in large parts of the world. Can Ann put out the bin? Yes, Ann can."
593ae8e27be9e00e1ecd4353,Two-rate GST plan for services,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170515/jsp/business/story_151632.jsp,2017-05-15,"New Delhi, May 14: The GST council's fitment committee has tentatively decided to have two tax slabs - 12 per cent and 16 per cent - for services, while continuing with five slabs for goods. Members of the fitment committee said they decided on the two rates for services after there were several representations on how an 18 per cent rate, which was being considered at one point, would lead to business loss. The fitment committee is responsible for fixing the rates for various products under GST. ""Services which are taxed at 15 per cent will be mostly taxed at 16 per cent. However, some services which are price-sensitive or which are commonly used by the masses will be taxed at 12 per cent,"" officials said. The all-India goods & services tax (GST) seeks to snuff out a host of central and state levies - including excise duties, VAT, service tax and octroi - and replace them with a single tax. Restaurants will continue to get an abatement of 60 per cent on service taxes. This has been a contentious issue with hoteliers demanding relief as higher levels of tax will hurt their business. Goods will be taxed at 5 slabs - 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent, 28 per cent and 28 per cent plus cess. A cess or surcharge has been imposed on certain goods for five years to compensate states for their loss in revenue because of abolition of VAT and octroi The surcharge will be imposed on items such as luxury cars, soft drinks and tobacco products and will be capped at 15 per cent. A special rate for gems and jewellery will be fixed at 2- 4 per cent. Officials said the committee wanted to ensure that goods and services are fitted into slabs that are closer to their current rates. ""The whole idea is that consumers do not pay more taxes. In some cases, the incidence of tax will be slightly lower and in a few, very few, taxes will go up marginally,"" they said. Around 73 items have till now been identified for total exemption from taxes. These include agricultural implements, aides and instruments used by the handicapped, charcoal, handloom and handicraft, condoms and contraceptives and foodgrains. Fish net, fish seed, fresh and pastuerised milk, fresh vegetables, kirpan, kumkum, bindi, alta, religious pictures, salt, sugar and vaccines of all kinds are also on this list. ""The number of items exempt have been reduced from 99. The aim is to bring in more and more goods and services but exemptions for goods by the cottage industry or for truly mass goods such as salt will continue,"" said officials. The median rate of 12 per cent will include most products such as white goods, plastic products, diapers, bakery products, cement, shoes, instant coffee, most machinery and office equipment and paints. Official said the lists would be placed before the GST council at its meeting in Srinagar on May 18. The four laws to facilitate the introduction of GST were passed by Parliament in March. The laws are being gradually passed by each state Assembly, while work is underway on the nitty-gritties such as the exact taxation structure. The government hopes to impose the new taxes from July. But some analysts said the date was too optimistic as many companies and states were still not ready for the new system. Excise impact Excise collections may take a hit as dealers are refraining from purchasing goods from manufacturers as they are not sure about the tax credits and rates under GST, according to PTI. In view of this uncertainty and the transitory mechanism for getting credit on tax paid before the GST kickoff, dealers are choosing to wait and watch rather than buy and hold on to inventories. This state of flux will have a direct bearing on excise collections during April-June, said experts. PwC national leader (indirect tax) Pratik Jain said given the apprehension about the loss of credit for transition stocks, there is an attempt to reduce the inventory level, which is impacting the sales of most consumer products in the current quarter."

Members of Uncommon Club and residents of Kukhudihi village in Suri, who had formed a team to protest the peddling of brown sugar, used sticks and brickbats to chase the attackers out of the area. A group of 10 men carrying plastic containers of crude bombs carried out the attack around 6.30am. Homes of three others who had taken part in a march against the drug peddling on May 3 were also ransacked. Later, a large contingent of police reached the spot and arrested seven persons, including five alleged drug peddlers. The villagers also handed over to the police a white Scorpio with a ""police"" sticker which they alleged belonged to the alleged leader of the drug peddlers, Sheikh Milan, a resident of Kukhudihi. Milan who fled the village today said over the phone that he had nothing to do with the drug business. A police officer said the car belonged to Milan and it had been hired for a few months last year. The local people also alleged a nexus between drug peddlers and a section of ruling party members. ""Hundreds of youths are now addicted to brown sugar and their families are suffering. So, we have started campaigning to make the area free from drug peddlers.

There are many visitors today, Mohammed Sajid Khan, a 56-year-old mahout at Mumbais Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan popularly known as the Byculla zoo, told HT. The veterinary officer in the zoo calls Khan the father and mother to elephants Laxmi and Anarkali, who are the oldest in the zoo.Mohammed Sajid Khan with elephants Laxmi and Anarkali inside Byculla zoo in Mumbai on Friday. (Pratik Chorge/HT)Khan gets worried like a parent if he is not around the two for a long time. He has been working in the zoo for the last three decades taking after his father Mohammad Shakir Khan who in-turn took the job from his father Mohammad Yusuf Khan. At the fag end of his career with just two more years before he retires, senior civic officials say that it is most likely that Sajid Khans 16-year-old son, Saif would take up the job after him.Zoo elephants listen to their mahouts only and doctors say they get so attached to them that they like to be bathed, fed and taken care of only by the mahout.Of the two, Laxmi, 56, is also infamous for her temperament as she keeps most of the staff, except Khan, at bay. Dr Devanand Shirshat, veterinary officer at the zoo, said, Even when I go near her to treat her, Sajid needs to be with me owing to her temperament. With Sajids family staying in the zoo and being familiar with the surroundings, it is only natural that his son will take up the job.Bath time for the elephants at Byculla zoo is fun, thanks to Sajid. (Pratik Chorge/HT Photo)Like Khan, 50% of the employees working in the zoo have been there since generations. Zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi has also put up a proposal in the corporation to consider the family members as the first option when a staff-member retires. Tripathi said, Today, be it the hyena, the birds, the deer or the elephants, they are being taken care of people who have always been around them.Remembering his fathers work at the zoo, Khan said, When I was working as a labourer at the zoo, my father used to be ruthless with me if I didnt do my work properly. I still remember when he got Laxmi from Bihar in 1990. I never went near the elephant enclosure, but had to take up the job after he retired.Khans day starts with visiting the elephants. He touches at the base of their ears every day to check for fever. He also senses their mood, before bathing or feeding them. They are like us. They can be happy, sad or angry on any day, Khan said.The elephants affection for their mahout is clear. (Pratik Chorge/HT Photo)Their breakfast after a nice bath includes 20 kilos of soaked grains with flour for each of them. In the afternoon, they feast on half a kilo of sugarcane as visitors throng to click pictures. The popularity of the newly-opened Humboldt penguin enclosure has also increased the number of visitors to the British-era zoo.Officials say that Khan does not frequently take leaves, fearing for the elephants well being. I dont want their routine to get disturbed. They are everything to me, says Khan while adding, My family will always be grateful to these animals as they are the means to our survival. If the corporation gives the job to my son, I will be more than happy."

Mittal. India is experiencing a growing burden of non-communicable illnesses, including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Research suggests that cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases had accounted for 30 lakh premature deaths in 2013. A study by the Harvard School of Public Health has suggested that cardiovascular diseases alone could cost India over $2 trillion (Rs 130 lakh crore) between 2012 and 2030. Mishra said indirect, surrogate, or illegal advertisements of alcohol, tobacco products and other unhealthy food products that can increase the risk of non-communicable diseases is a matter of concern. ""Any move to promote products that have negative health externalities will be counter-productive and will scuttle ongoing efforts to reduce and regulate the consumption of alcohol, tobacco, food containing high fats, sugar, salt, and sugar-sweetened beverages,"" he wrote in the letter. ""It is requested that the assets of Indian Railways are not used to advertise products which have negative health impacts,"" he added. The railways ministry has already agreed to a health ministry proposal to use train tickets, stations, wagons, and coaches to promote health messages and help increase public awareness about the dietary and lifestyle risks factors for non-communicable diseases. Public health activists say they are concerned that the industry may use railways to promote its brands through surrogate advertisements. ""We've seen a huge rise in surrogate ads over the past decade,"" said Binoy Mathews of the Voluntary Health Association of India. Mathews said the emergence of surrogate advertisements on coaches would be ""hugely worrying"" because the railways carry over 20 million passengers each day. Marketing specialists have noted that manufacturers of tobacco and alcohol have in recent years resorted to surrogate advertisements through myriad products or even events ranging from music CDs and fruit juices to calendars and textiles to award functions and sports. Public health specialists have long emphasised the need for the government to step up ""counter-advertising"" campaigns to counter misleading messages from the firms that promote unhealthy products such as foods containing high fat, sugar, salt and sugar-sweetened beverages."

Following the demonetisation, thousands of migrant workers from Bengal had lost their jobs in other parts of the country. They returned home with little or no savings and had to face economic hardship in the past four-five months. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced the ""samarthan"" scheme to help the migrant workers who had lost jobs so that they could make earnings while sitting at homes. The government announced a one-time financial assistance of Rs 50,000 to around 50,000 workers. ""I was a construction labourer in Kerala. After demonetisation, I lost my job. I had some savings in old notes. The situation became so worse that I had to exchange the old Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes at a lesser price with new currencies. From Kerala, I somehow managed to reach Noida where my brother used to work. Upon reaching there, I learnt that he, too, had lost his job,"" Kapirul Islam, a resident of Suktabari village under Cooch Behar block 1, said today. From Delhi, Kapirul and his brother managed to buy train tickets and reached home. But none of them found jobs. ""I cannot explain how I have spent the past four months. Today, I got a cheque for Rs 50,000 and want to buy a sugarcane crushing machine to run my family,"" he said. Among others, Nasima Bibi, who is from Kapirul's village and used to work as a housemaid at a businessman's house in Delhi, had to return empty-handed in December last year. ""I didn't know what to do and had been scouting for odd jobs in the past few months. It is good that I got the assistance from the government today. My plan is to open a small poultry at home,"" she said."

Refineries will have to apply with the DGFT for imports.""The cap on import quantity has been kept so that there is no adverse impact on next sugar marketing year and there is check on speculation during the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year ending September,"" the official noted.Falling sugar prices globally at 16.2 cents per pound have made imports feasible.Production in India, the world's second largest producer and biggest consumer, is estimated to be much lower than the requirement of 25 million tonnes. The imports will harden global prices as the country was an exporter of sugar until last year, analysts said.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma), which represents the private industry, has brought down its estimates to 20.3 million tonnes from 23.4 million tonnes in September.Data from the price monitoring cell of the consumer affairs ministry show retail prices in Delhi have risen to Rs 42 per kg from Rs 37 per kg over the past year."

(Pranab Debnath) Majhdia (Nadia), April 7: Residents of a cluster of villages in Nadia district have written to the Prime Minister to save a river and its branch that originate in Bangladesh and are polluted with industrial effluents allegedly in the neighbouring country. The request by the villagers of Krishnaganj, Hanskhali and Ranaghat blocks comes amid diplomatic parleys to clear the logjam over the sharing of Teesta waters between India and Bangladesh. The villagers are mostly farmers and fishermen whose livelihood is linked to the Mathabhanga and Churni rivers. ""There is a sugar manufacturing unit on the Bangladeshi side and some other industries. They discharge effluents into the Mathabhanga,"" said Ganesh Halder, a fisherman in Majhdia. The Mathabhanga enters India at Gede and divides into the Ichamati and the Churni after flowing for 19km. Churni meets the river Bhagirathi after flowing 56km through Hanskhali and Ranaghat. Sources referred to a state pollution control board report that describes the Churni river as ""highly polluted"" and having bio-chemical oxygen content as high as 12 mg/L (against a normal of 4-5 mg/L). ""In such a condition, the chance of survival of fish and plants is very low,"" said environmental activist Bibartan Bhattacharjee. The villagers have formed the ""Mathabhanga and Churni River Rescue Committee"", which has written to Narendra Modi. Nadia district magistrate Sumit Gupta said: ""It is a serious problem. A solution to this is pending for long."" The secretary of the committee, Swapan Bhowmik, said: ""The waste discharged in the Bangladeshi side has been causing enormous damage to fish cultivation. People fear taking a bath in the river. We want our PM to take up the issue with Sheikh Hasina so that a waste-water treatment plant is set up on the Bangladeshi side soon."" The committee members referred to a National Green Tribunal ruling that had on September 30 last year directed the Centre to talk to the Bangladeshi government. ""Over six months have passed, but it appears the Centre is yet to act as per the order of the tribunal,"" Bhowmik said.#"

(HT)Open wells in villages near forests are a hazard to wildlife. Around 1,500 animals, including leopards, jackals, civets, jungle cats, wolves and hyenas, have reportedly died after accidentally falling into open wells across the state over the last decade.Forest officers said that the well was located on a private property bordering a sugarcane field. We dispatched a team of officers to assess the situation. It is clear that the leopard was hiding in the sugarcane field and was looking for food. She was pregnant, said Sachin Ragatwan, range forest officer of the forest division.The trap cage used to rescue the animal. (Wildlife SOS)A three member rescue team led by Wildlife SOS senior veterinarian Dr Ajay Deshmukh from the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre and forest department officials rushed to the location soon after the distress call. The team tried to rescue the animal using a motor pump pipe and a trap cage.The motor pump pipe was lowered into the well to help the leopard stay afloat and while a trap cage was lowered so that she could safely climb into it, said Deshmukh adding, We managed to rescue her from the situation. However, we did not expect what happened next.A veterinary examination conducted by the team revealed that the leopard was pregnant but was under severe trauma due to the incident. The leopard had injured herself while trying to stay afloat, which led to extensive internal bleeding. Despite our best efforts, she passed away, said Deshmukh.Why so many cases?Buffer areas around forests, which mark the transition between forest areas and human habitation, are dotted with uncovered wells. Animals competing over the decreasing prey base, territory and water sources, are forced to venture out into human settlements, which puts them at risk of falling into uncovered wells.Several instances of leopards falling into wells have been reported over the last few years in Maharashtra and several others in states like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam. Such cases have been increasing in the recent years and the main reason behind this appears to be the lack of proper covers and fencing around these wells, said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder, Wildlife SOS.Some cases of leopards falling into wellsAugust 4, 2016  A seven-year-old leopard was rescued from 60-foot deep well at Pimpalgaon Siddhanath village located in Junnar division. Locals heard loud, panicking noises from the well and informed forest officers that rescued the big cat.March 10, 2016  Forest officers and local NGOs rescued five-year old female leopard from a 30-foot-deep well at Savidhane village, Junnar. The leopard fell when she saw her reflection in the water. In a five hour long rescue operation, forest officials used a trap cage to pull the leopard out.October 28, 2015 - A two-and-a-half-year-old female leopard was rescued in a three-and-a-half hour operation from within a 50-feet deep well in Parner Taluka, Ahmednagar district. The leopard had fallen into two separate wells while being rescued by forest officers."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170408/jsp/nation/story_145250.jsp,2017-04-08,"Vultures at Ramadevara Betta in Ramanagaram. Picture by Tharangini B Bangalore, April 7: A proposed Sholay-themed village near Bangalore has come under scrutiny because the area falls inside a vulture sanctuary. Forest officials said the area in Ramanagaram, which was Gabbar Singh's den Ramgarh in Sholay, was protected forest land where a vulture sanctuary had been set up and so it could not be used for commercial purposes. The district administration has chalked out a plan in consultation with the Karnataka government to build a three-dimensional ""virtual reality village"" to recreate the magic of Sholay through 3D printing of the characters from the 70s blockbuster and computer-generated simulation of 3D images. The Rs 7.5-crore project is supposed to come up at Ramadevara Betta (Ramadeva's Hill), the exact spot where scenes involving Gabbar were shot and where a part of the vulture sanctuary is now located. State forest department officials said the project was unlikely to get sanction if it affected wild life conservation. ""We haven't received the formal proposal for the project, which would anyway fall right inside the sanctuary,"" principal chief conservator of forests Kishan Singh Sugara told The Telegraph today. He said technically, it would not be possible to allow any commercial project in the protected zone. ""We will make our observations according to the rule book once the project is sent to us,"" Sugara said. Vijay Kumar, the deputy conservator of forests of Ramanagaram, 50km from Bangalore, said the area being considered for the 3D village was ecologically sensitive. ""It is a vulture sanctuary and thus protected forest land with a buffer of 10km radius that cannot be used for commercial or residential projects,"" he said. According to the Wildlife Protection Act, a protected area and its buffer zone have to be safeguarded. ""No projects can come up in this area,"" said Kumar, whose jurisdiction covers the patch recommended for the project. The sanctuary is home to more than 30 Egyptian and Indian long-billed vultures. The Indian vultures are a critically endangered species that has recorded a decline of 97 per cent in the country. ""The only area inside the sanctuary where people are allowed to enter is the road that leads to the Ramadevara temple,"" Kumar said. People are allowed to visit the ancient shrine on a hillock during the day. Earlier, trekking was allowed Ramadevara Betta. A tiny hamlet inhabited by the Iruliga tribe is now the only settlement near the sanctuary. Karnataka tourism minister Priyank Kharge told news agency PTI that the state government would evaluate the proposal. He said some Sholay locales that fall inside the vulture sanctuary, such as Gabbar's den, Thakur's haveli and the rocky terrain where Basanti dances, would have to be recreated outside the prohibited area, if the project is implemented. The Ramanagaram district commissioner did not respond to repeated calls. Padma Ashok, a Bangalore-based wildlife activist who recently finished a one-year study on the sanctuary, said the project would pose a threat to the birds. ""Such a project will certainly upset the equilibrium of the place. Even the current flow of occasional visitors and bikers has been a worry. Anything bigger will certainly damage the sanctuary,"" she said. Audio-visual equipment, multiple screens and laser disc-based projection apparatus are some of the gadgets that will be part of the planned 3D village. Vijay Nishant, a wildlife and environment activist, said activists would protest if such a project was allowed inside the sanctuary. ""We don't want the government to mess up nature like it did with our cities,"" he said, referring to alleged unplanned urban development."

593ba7ba7be9e0066b6f5e36,Maya plays divide and woo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170214/jsp/nation/story_135703.jsp,2017-02-14,"Lucknow, Feb. 13: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati today claimed that Mulayam Singh Yadav had insulted his younger brother Shivpal Yadav, playing on the differences within the ruling family as she appealed to people not to waste their votes on a divided party. If the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister's apparent show of sympathy came as a surprise, her choice of location stood out too. Mayawati was speaking at a rally in Etawah, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam's home district. ""Mulayam has been insulting Shivpal to establish his son and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the Samajwadi Party,"" Mayawati said. Earlier, Mayawati had often said she would put in jail wrongdoers in the Samajwadi, including Shivpal, when she came to power. Akhilesh and Shivpal had been locked in a power tussle last year before the younger man eventually wrested control of the party at a convention on January 1, where he took over as Samajwadi national chief from his father and removed his uncle as the head of the state unit. But there are many who believe that Mulayam secretly stood by his son during the power struggle. Although he has spoken out against his son and in favour of his brother, most of his actions suggest he supports Akhilesh. Mayawati's comments came days after some Shivpal loyalists - including Ambika Chaudhay and Narad Rai who were removed from Akhilesh's cabinet in September -joined the BSP. Asked recently whether she would also welcome Shivpal into her party, the BSP boss had said: ""I can think about it if he approaches me."" Shivpal has denied any such possibility. Shivpal is contesting as a Samajwadi candidate from Jaswant Nagar in Etawah district. A star campaigner for the party till the 2014 parliamentary elections, he has been confined to one Assembly seat now. ""The traditional vote of the SP will be divided between the uncle and the nephew as both are working against each other. I appeal to the people not to spoil their votes,"" Mayawati said. She was referring to the Yadavs who account for over 12 per cent of the votes in the three dozen Assembly constituencies in and around Etawah, where polling would be held on February 19, the third leg of the seven-phase elections in the state. ""I also appeal to minority voters not to waste their votes on the SP because the communal BJP can win in that case,"" Mayawati added. Mayawati also responded to Akhilesh's claim at election rallies that the BJP and the BSP together could try to form the government if the Samajwadi didn't have the numbers. ""The SP has forged a pre-poll alliance with the Congress on the direction of the BJP. The SP... and Prime Minister Narendra Modi... have been hatching a conspiracy to silence me,"" she said. Later, in Lucknow, the BSP boss said Modi's politics was unbecoming of a Prime Minister. ""The way the PM makes false allegations of corruption against the BSP doesn't suit his position. He stoops to this level for political mileage,"" she said. At a rally today in Lakhimpur Kheri, Modi had said there was a scam behind the divestment of several sugar mills in the state between 2007 and 2012, when Mayawati was in power. ""The Samajwadi had promised during the 2012 Assembly election campaign that an inquiry would be conducted against Mayawati if they came to power. But no probe was done after Akhilesh took over as CM,"" Modi said."

COCOA * July London cocoa on ICE Futures surged 87 pounds, or 5.82 percent, to finish at 1,582 pounds per tonne, rising throughout the session and settling near the highs of a late-day buying flurry. * That marked the largest one-day gain for the benchmark front-month since August 2012. * July New York cocoa settled up $126, or 6.59 percent, at $2,037 per tonne in the largest one-day rally since January 2012. * Expectations that producers in Ivory Coast had sold forward a large chunk of their upcoming production and news of broader political unrest spooked short sellers and sparked new buying, traders said. * ""That means there would be less selling in the market in the future,"" said Nick Gentile, managing partner of commodity trading adviser NickJen Capital. ""This is not a time to get married to any short position."" * Ivory Coast rebels have found ammunition to hold their ground against President Alassane Ouattara's forces. * Prices have rebounded after a rout last week that saw prices posting their biggest one-day fall since 2011, under pressure from excess supplies linked to a large crop in Ivory Coast and bearish chart signals. * Funds have begun scaling back their bearish bets in both London and New York markets. * The day's rally was also fuelled by data from Ivory Coast that the country's grinding - a measure of demand - is up 10 percent so far this season and as abundant rainfall stoked fears of flooding. SUGAR * ICE July raw sugar eased 0.03 cent, or 0.20 percent, to close at 15.02 cents per lb. * Prices hit 14.73 cents, the lowest since April 2016, under pressure from favorable crop weather, a recent cut in gasoline prices in top grower Brazil and an improving crop outlook for in India, the world's No 2 producer, due to monsoon rains. * August white sugar settled down 80 cents, or 0.18 percent, at $438.40 per tonne after hitting $433, the lowest since April 2016. COFFEE * July robusta coffee finished up $19, or 0.95 percent, at $2,010 per tonne after hitting a three-week high of $2,025. * July arabica settled up 0.9 cent, or 0.69 percent, at $1.321 per lb.

He said that each community should get reservation in proportion of their population share in the country.Recalling the lawlessness situation erupted during 2016 February violence in state, he mocked that if reservation could be achieved by holding sticks and blocking roads then purpose of constitutional institutions would get defeated in democracy.Meanwhile, police detained a person in possession of a weapon roaming near media gallery in suspicious manner."
593ba7df7be9e0066b6f5e72,Litchi scientists scoff at study alarm,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170204/jsp/bihar/story_133849.jsp,2017-02-04,"Feb. 3: A national crop institution in Bihar has questioned suggestions by Indian and US government scientists that consumption of litchi on an empty stomach may have contributed to child deaths from encephalitis in Muzaffarpur among other sites. Senior scientists at the National Research Centre on Litchi (NRCL), Muzaffarpur, have challenged the findings of the Indo-US study that corroborated three-year old suspicions that the sweet litchi fruit contains certain compounds that may cause blood sugar to fall to dangerously low levels. They have described the Indo-US study as ""academic"" and said that it has relied on too small a sample of patients for general conclusions. They claimed the NRCL has also examined encephalitis deaths and not found any link to litchis. The study by the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and India's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), seeking to investigate the causes of recurrent and unexplained outbreaks of encephalitis in young children, had confirmed that the illness is associated with the consumption of litchi toxins. The CDC-NCDC scientists found that naturally occurring toxins in litchis caused blood sugar levels to fall, leading to the symptoms of encephalitis. It prompted them to recommend that children and other vulnerable individuals should avoid consuming litchi on an empty stomach. NRCL director Vishal Nath questioned the study. ""We do not believe these findings, they are academic in nature and far from reality,"" he said. ""We do not know how they arrived at their findings; the NRCL was never taken into cognisance at any time during the investigation."" The CDC-NCDC scientists questioned the family members of 390 patients with encephalitis, all below the age of 15 years, about litchi consumption and detected the presence of hypoglycin-A and another compound called MCPG - natural substances that can cause drops in blood sugar. Nath claimed the NRCL had itself carried out investigations on the deaths of children and could not establish any connection with litchis. ""Cases of encephalitis have also been reported from other districts, including Gaya, and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, where litchi is not produced. The deaths include young children - one year and one-and-half years old; how much litchi can a year-old baby consume?"" Nath asked. He said the study may bring a ""bad name"" to a fruit high in nutritive value, adding that the findings appear to have been compiled ""in haste"" as the term of the team investigating the cause and risk factors was coming to an end. Bihar makes up 70 per cent of India's litchi produce and accounts for 54 per cent of the country's area under litchi plantation. Litchi is mainly cultivated in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, West and East Champaran, Darbhanga and Samastipur. A senior diabetes specialist not associated with the Indo-US study has described it as significant enough to justify a public health advisory. ""This is a solid study; young children and adults on treatment for diabetes with insulin or multiple drugs should take care when consuming litchi,"" said Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis diabetes centre in New Delhi, and director of the National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation. Misra said the findings support recommendations that such vulnerable populations should avoid eating litchis on an empty stomach or after fasting. Consuming the fruit on a full stomach would compensate for the sugar-lowering risk of the toxins, he said. Indian public health authorities have for over five years been struggling to understand the cause of unexplained encephalitis - also labelled as acute encephalitis syndrome - in eastern Indian states. While some say encephalitis is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus, doctors have been trying to determine the cause of the mystery encephalitis. In 2012, a local doctor had suggested that the disease may be caused by excessive heat and low blood sugar in children. In 2013, Indian virologist T. Jacob John and others had suggested the low blood glucose linked to litchi consumption may be causing the encephalitis."

The App will rely on the Indian Food Composition Tables-2017 released today by the Hyderabad-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) and listing values of various nutrients in 528 foods, including cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables, condiments and spices, fish, meat and poultry products, among others. The health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, inaugurating a symposium here called to discuss potential applications of the food composition tables, said he has directed the NIN to develop an App that could be used by consumers. ""We want to simplify this heavy-weight 2kg book into an App which (consumers) could understand and use to (maintain) healthy food practices,"" Nadda said. The App, which will provide values of calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, sugar, key vitamins among other nutrition-linked parameters for various foods, is expected to be ready for release in about two months, senior NIN scientists said. Similar nutrient-tracking Apps are already available for use on mobile phones but, the NIN scientists said, their App may be tailored to provide some additional information not available through most existing Apps. ""The 2017 food composition tables will be the backbone for this App,"" said Soumya Swaminathan, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, NIN's parent institution. The tables contain information not documented earlier, she said. The tables for example list the values of several key nutrients, such as bone-friendly vitamin-D2 in plant products or immunity-boosting phytochemicals in common Indian foods for the first time, NIN scientists said. The scientists said the App would allow consumers to determine values of these nutrients, among others, in whatever food they plan to consume - whether a samosa from the street, a pizza ordered in a restaurant, or home-cooked dal and chappatis. ""We expect the food composition tables to have many applications,"" Swaminathan said. Doctors could use the tables to prescribe the most appropriate diets to patients, food processing companies may use them to determine labels on their products, and policy-makers could use them to guide nutrition policies, she said. The tables, revised by the NIN after 46 years, list the values of dietery fibre, vitamins, carotenoids, minerals, starch and sugar, fatty acids, amino acids, among several other nutrients in various foods commonly used across India. The tables display how values of some nutrients may change in certain foods when cooked in different ways - for instance when an egg is consumed boiled or as an omelette."

The traders wife was robbed of her gold ornaments and cash and sexually assaulted in front of her husband.This incident happened around 11pm, when the Jewar-Bulandshahr Link Road was deserted.Police said the road passes through fields on both sides and is near the Yamuna Expressway, giving criminals enough leeway to quickly escape.During elections, there was regular patrolling by police control room vans and security personnel would remain vigilant, because of which no such accident took place for the first few months of the year.In 2015, criminals opened fire on a 28-year-old man. He was travelling in Swift Dzire but did not stop and sped away. The windows of the car were damaged but he survived, said a senior police officer.Locals said police know very well that the areas is crime-prone but take little action to deter criminals.An investigation officer suspected the Bawaria gang could be behind Thursdays crime. The gang fixes nails on layers of discarded tyres to puncture tyres of coming vehicles.They place these along the bumpy stretch, because of which it becomes difficult for drivers to judge them.Bawarias are said to be nomads from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.Recalling a previous incident, Brahm Dev Sharma, a Sabota resident, said, On May 31, 2016, the results of panchayat elections were declared. In the evening I went to my sugarcane field and saw three people sitting on a cot. They told me to stop and raise my hands. They said they were police officers searching criminals in the area.When I lifted my hands, one of them came and robbed me of cash and mobile phone and escaped, he said. Locals say incidents like these are quite common."

(PTI) Patna, April 3: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today picked up the Supreme Court's highway liquor-shop ban to push for what has almost become his pet project, nationwide prohibition. People in many states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are strongly opposing the shifting of liquor shops away from highways into residential areas in accordance with the apex court order delivered in December last year banning liquor shops within 500 metres of national and state highways in an effort to curb drink-driving and road accidents that claim thousands of lives every year. ""Shifting liquor shops 500 metres away from national and state highways due to the Supreme Court directive is no solution to the problem,"" Nitish said when he was asked his opinion on the on the issue on the sidelines of his special Lok Samvad (public dialogue) programme held in the state capital today. ""Complete ban on liquor is the only way out,"" he added. ""Prohibition is the answer as it is attached to public aspiration across the country."" He demanded that the BJP-led government at the Centre should take a lead on this front. ""It's the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha and I would request the central government to show its commitment (to the ideals of the Mahatma) by banning liquor in the country. It could be started with BJP-ruled states,"" Nitish said. He pointed out that neither does any religion support drinking, nor does the Constitution say that the right to drink alcohol a fundamental right, and asked why the Centre was not implementing nationwide prohibition. The chief minister said he has visited several states and noticed that the public sentiment was in favour of prohibition. Bihar, he said, had shown the way and ""people (in other states) were welcoming the step taken by Bihar"". Since clamping total prohibition in Bihar on April 5 last year, Nitish has addressed pro-liquor-ban events in states like Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. ""I have been requesting chief ministers of other states to ban liquor,"" the chief minister said. ""I will do so to Uttar Pradesh CM (Yogi Adityanath). I had suggested this to (former Uttar Pradesh chief minister) Akhilesh Yadav and had requested Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee while attending her oath-taking ceremony."" A few states were avoiding liquor ban on excuses that it will hurt their sugar industry because molasses are used to make alcohol, Nitish said, and declared that no sugar mill had suffered in Bihar as they switched over to produce ethanol, which he called good for the country's economy and environment. The central government has directed that 10 per cent ethanol be mixed in petrol. Nitish also pooh-poohed suggestions that prohibition leads to drop in a state's revenue and declared that Bihar's loss of Rs 5,000 crore excise and value added tax (VAT) in 2015-16 due to the ban on liquor has been almost compensated in 2016-17. ""In the beginning revenue falls,"" he said. but money saved from not spending on liquor leads to growth on expenditure of other items like garments, electrical appliances, milk products, furniture. It expands the economy and leads to revenue growth."""

But the peoples awareness on tooth care can bring about a lot of difference in unnecessary, costly treatments.While it is known that the acidic nature of sugar erodes the enamel of the teeth, it is also important to note that the sugary substance becomes a problem mostly when it remains on the teeth.There are a few habits that the people can include in their daily routines, says Endodontist Dr. C. Rajkrishnan.While rinsing with plain water is effective, it helps to have a salt water wash at frequent intervals. However, it does become a debatable point in cases of people having hypertension, he added.While the quantity of sugar intake is a concern, in case of dental care it is also the time period sugar remains in the mouth that makes it susceptible to develop a cavity, said Dr. Rajkrishnan. The same logic goes for carbonated drinks because of the acidic nature, he adds.Keeping oral hygiene helps to keep gum diseases away. If food remains between the teeth and gets caught in cavities, it becomes fertile ground for bacteria to grow.Decalcification and plaque deposits invite gum diseases which can result in tooth loss.It is now well established that gum diseases and diabetes are connected. Those with gum diseases should check up for diabetes and vice-versa. Osteoporosis is another condition that is most likely to affect the teeth.Dieticians are in favour of vegetables with high fibre and water content, like carrots and celery. Besides being healthy food for the body, they help clean tooth, say the dental doctors.Young parents are always wondering when to start brushing the kids teeth. According to Dr. Rajkrishnan, brushing can start the moment they get teeth.The teeth can be wiped with a guaze too after rinsing with water.It is also important that the young children have their milk teeth intact till it sheds on its own. Many a times if there had been a tooth loss because of decay or other reasons, it is left unattended.In such cases, a shift in the tooth structure may happen, with the molars migrating more towards the gap leaving no space for the new tooth to replace the milk tooth. Advances in dentistry do have solutions to manage these situations now.Brushing is an important aspect of hygiene to remove food particles and bring down the bacteria. It is equally important how the brushes are kept after use. Usually the whole family keeps their brushes in a single holder, which is rather unhygienic.Many are also found to continue with the same brush for a year or even two before considering to changing them.For good cleansing, bristles need to be good. It depends on individual manner of brushing how the bristles get worn out. It is important to get a new brush when they loose their firmness. For some it may last six to eight months too, for some it may last only a month.Contributed byShyama Rajagopal"

Picture by UB Photos April 3: Hailstorm and heavy rain lashed the Namami Brahmaputra festival venue in Guwahati this evening, forcing yoga guru Baba Ramdev, Union minister Babul Supriyo and Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to beat a hasty retreat. Anticipating bad weather, the state government had earlier shifted the venue of Ramdev's programme to ITA Cultural Complex in Machkhowa. But Ramdev was firm in his conviction that there would be no rain as the blessing of the Brahmaputra was with the people. Respecting Ramdev's wish, his programme was shifted to Kasomari ghat at the last minute. The rain god did allow Ramdev to complete his show, where he made Supriyo perform yoga on the stage, triggering peals of laughter among the audience, but the skies opened soon after. No longer had Supriyo started his address than a hailstorm and heavy rain pummelled the venue, forcing everyone to make a dash to safety. Among the dignitaries on the stage were state cabinet ministers Chandra Mohan Patowary and Keshab Mahanta. The cultural programmes were shifted to ITA Cultural Complex where singers Mayukh Hazarika and Zubeen Garg performed. Ramdev's participation in the festival this evening was part of the government's plan to showcase the ease of doing business in the state. The Patanjali group, which is headed by Ramdev, has started production in the state in record time. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is one of the major investors in the state after the BJP-led government came to power. Sonowal had laid the foundation stone of the Rs 1,300-crore Patanjali Food and Herbal Park at Balipara in Sonitpur district on November 6 last year. In just four months, it started commercial production. The production facility, spread across 450 bighas, is expected to create direct employment opportunities for over 5,000 people. In the morning, the department of industries and commerce, in association with Assam Industrial Development Corporation and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, had organised a seminar on the prospects of plastic and polymer industries at the festival venue. Speaking at the seminar, additional chief secretary, industries and commerce, Ravi Capoor, said in the past 10 months Rs 6,000 crore was invested in Assam by major industrial players generating employment for over 40,000 youths. He gave an in-depth insight into the prospects of jute, polymer, sugar, bamboo and food processing industries in Assam. He also underlined the viability of pink granite industry, which is available in the state. Ashutosh Agnihotri, commissioner and secretary, industries and commerce, said the Namami Brahmaputra festival has been organised to explore the potentialities and probabilities of this region and put brand Assam as the centre of the vast Southeast Asian markets. He hoped that jute and plastic sectors would be a giver of employment rather than seeker of employment. K.K. Dwivedi, commissioner, industries and commerce, said Ease of Doing Business (EODB) and Land Banks have made it possible to set up industries in Assam within a week's time. Namami Brahmaputra, touted to be the biggest river festival of the country, will conclude tomorrow with the signing of an MoU between Dispur and Delhi to dredge the mighty river to harness its true potential. One of the objectives of the festival is to draw the attention of investors towards the business opportunities in the state."

(PTI Photo)India received a normal rainfall in 2016  three per cent less than the 100-year average  after reeling under severe drought for two successive years. In addition, the country registered record food grain production in the same year, as per the official figures of the Ministry of Agriculture and farmers welfare. This was 6.37 per cent higher than last five years average production and 8.6 per cent more as compared to 2015-16. The government also boasted of having allocated more budget to agriculture than the previous UPA regime with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself promising to double the income of farmers by 2022. However, all these seemed to have had a little impact on farmers in terms of easing their problems.Now, farmers in two of the largest states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, which are presently ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, have resorted to agitation over a wide-range of issues concerning their livelihood. So, what has happened since then that the farmers have been forced to protest despite brief spell of relief?Ongoing stir and farmers demands in Madhya PradeshAccording to latest reports, protests turned violent as three farmers were killed by police in Mandsaur, the epicentre of the agitation which lies 325 kms from the Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal. Subsequently, curfew was imposed in the area and prohibitory orders were issued in other parts of the district. They have been protesting since June 1 demanding minimum support price for their farm produce, among other things. On Monday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tried to assuage frayed nerves, insisting that his government was taking all the necessary steps to address the issues of the agitating farmers. He said a price stabilisation fund of Rs 1,000 crore would be established to procure the farm produce at the minimum support price (MSP).Bhopal : Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during their nation-wide strike and agitation over various demands, in Bhopal on Sunday.

Moreover, pandemonium prevailed in different parts of the state as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, an organistaion affiliated to the RSS, suspended the agitation while others refused to budge. Calling off the agitation, the BKS said that the government had accepted most of its demands like buying onions at Rs 8 a kg and paying farmers half their dues at mandis in cash and the remaining via electronic transfer to their bank accounts. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that is believed to be behind the stir, said the agitation will go on.Maharashtra farmers stira result of UP farm loan waiver and plunging crop pricesIn early April, the newly-elected BJP government under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath took a bold step by waiving off farm loan worth Rs 36,359 crore. The move was appreciated by many cutting across various political spectrum. Similar demands were raised by farmers in Maharashtra, which witnessed the highest number of farmer suicides between 2014 and 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, the state saw an 18 per cent jump  from 2,568 to 3,030. Marathwada region of the state also faced drought in both years. The reliance of farmers in Marathwada on water-guzzling cash crops such as sugarcane has been cited as one of the reasons for the distress. The dwindling crop prices is also being viewed as the other reason behind the uprising.Farmers spilling out milk on a road during their state-wide protest over various demands at Pingli Village in Parbhani, Maharashtra.

Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis.

The power minister is in the eye of a storm after four men, who had till recently worked in his firms, had won mining contracts worth Rs 50 crore despite their annual incomes not exceeding Rs 6 lakh.A company called Flawless Traders Private Limited had appointed Bahadur as its director on August 17, 2015. Apart from the Rs 16 crore investment, Bahadur, on the same day of his appointment, had given an unsecured loan of Rs 2 crore to Rana Polycot. This loan, sanctioned by Bahadur for Gurjeet's firm, was interest-free and unsecured.Moreover, Flawless Traders itself had been showing zero income since 2013-14. Even with zero income, Flawless Traders had an interest-free inter-corporate loan of Rs 51 crore. The records don't reveal from where Bahadur's firm had received Rs 51 crore.The balance sheets also reveal that Gurjeet's firm Rana Sugars Limited and Bahadur's firm Flawless Traders Private Limited, in fact share the office building also. While Rana Sugars Limited has its registered address as SCO, 49-50, Sector 8-C, Chandigarh, the firm that was being headed by Bahadur is registered at SCO 51-52, Sector 8-C.Bahadur's signatures are visible throughout the audit report of Flawless Traders Private Limited. With a turnover of more than Rs 100-crore, Rana Polycot Limited is run by Gurjeet's son Rana Inder Singh as its director.A senior I-T official told TOI that the department will find out if Flawless Traders was only a shell company to route money and pass on to other companies when a complaint is received to begin investigation into the Punjab mining scam.TOI has accessed the balance sheets and annual profit and loss statements of three companies that Bahadur headed as director. The documents reveal that Bahadur ceased to be the director of Flawless Traders Private Limited on March 21, 2017, a week after the Congress came to power and Gurjeet became a minister in Captain Amarinder Singh 's government.Bahadur, who has shown annual income for 2015-16 as Rs 92,679 and had Rs 4,840 as balance in his State Bank of India account, had sparked a row after he won Rs 26-crore mining contract in auction and also submitted Rs 13.5 crore as the fee.Gurjeet has so far rejected the charges of hawala and benami transactions. He had offered to resign on Monday but it was rejected by Amarinder. A judicial inquiry has now been set up by the Punjab government to probe the charges of benami transactions."

Since the temperature is very high, doctors advise people to take special care to avoid any health hazard. Endocrinologist Dr Ved Prakash of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) said hypoglycaemia is a major risk during Ramzan. ""Diabetes medicines that have high power and consumed before breakfast should be taken before iftar time and medicines with minor power should be taken before sehri (meal before sunrise). We go a little lenient on sugar as there is a higher risk of hypoglycaemia than hyperglycaemia. People should avoid strenuous activities and drink more water than sherbets,"" he advised. A doctor should be consulted before making any alterations in the medicines.Nephrologist Dr Gopal Prasad says people suffering from kidney diseases should avoid fasting as remaining without water for a long duration will cause dehydration, which is not good for them.Dr Amresh Krishna, assistant professor of nephrology at IGIMS, advises kidney patients not to observe fast as they take medicines for blood pressure at regular intervals and the timing of the medicine cannot be altered. ""As this Ramzan, people will be fasting for nearly 14 hours. Patients suffering from kidney diseases cannot take the risk of dehydration. They also cannot eat juicy fruits or dates as these are rich in potassium which they should avoid,"" he said.Physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said, ""Iftar (meal eaten after sunset) should necessarily have juicy fruits such as watermelon that have high water content. Coconut water and date palms should also be consumed. Spicy and fried foods should be avoided, as these may cause acidity and make one feel thirsty. Diabetics and patients with blood pressure should consult their doctors about change in medicine and timing of its consumption,"" he said."

Bahadur and Kulvinder successfully bid for the mines, despite their annual incomes in the last three years not crossing Rs 1lakh and Rs 6 lakh, respectively. Balraj Singh has listed his profession as an agriculturalist in the application for certificate of approval submitted on April 11 before the Punjab industries department. Balraj, in his affidavit, has clearly mentioned that he is a resident of Rana Sugar Limited Colony in Amritsar. The paper reads, ""I Balraj Singh, son of Swaran Singh , a resident of Rana Sugar Ltd, Colony, Buttar Sivaiya, Amritsar, have the honour to request that a certificate of approval under the Punjab Minor Mineral Rules, 2013, be granted to enable me to acquire mining leases under the said rules.""Gurjit has denied the allegations of using his ""employees"" to enter the mining business levelled by the Opposition, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).Like the two, Balraj has also shown his income to be not more than Rs 4-5 lakh in the CA form. Balraj has won the bid in Nawanshahr district. His mining site, Bairsal is at a strategic location and 12,015 metric tonne of sand is to be mined from there.While both Bahadur and Kulvinder have already deposited Rs 13.34 crore and Rs 9.21 crore as first installments a week back, Balraj, despite winning the bid, did not deposit the first instalment of Rs 4.34 crore. But, it is unclear if he has not done so following the controversy. The mining and industries department is now trying to ascertain the money trail. The department is also trying to find out who funded all the three for winning these contracts, adding up to more than Rs 50 crore.Balraj did not answer several phone calls made to him.Punjab irrigation and power minister Rana Gurjit Singh has consistently denied any links with the sand mining business. He had issued a statement on May 25, immediately after first reports of Bahadur's role in the mining business had come out, saying that neither he nor his company Rana Sugars Limited has any direct or indirect stake, financial or otherwise, in the business. The minister also denied that any links of his family members or employees with the sand mining business."

The usual fireworks against his bete noire Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao were missing. Other TDP leaders also did not choose to launch a scathing attack on the TRS government at the party's annual meet, Mahanadu Naidu was measured in his words. He said Mahanadu will support the fight taken up by the Telangana TDP to protect the interests of farmers. In all eight resolutions were prepared on Telangana at the Mahanadu. During the discussion on resolutions like ""Crisis in agriculture sector and farmers suicides,"" and ""Social justice in Telangana"", Naidu's restraint was visible right from the beginning.A few TTDP (Telangana Telugu Desam Party) leaders like Vanteru Pratap Reddy, who are staunch critics of Chandrasekhar Rao, did not try to play to the gallery by resorting to bitter criticism. Pratap Reddy challenged that TRS regime cannot make Nizam sugar factory function again. ""KCR is not sympathetic towards farmers, but the TDP despite being the opposition came to the rescue of families of a few farmers. KCR did not respond in the same manner. The TRS is even trying to forcibly acquire land from farmers. We will oppose it,"" he said.Another leader Aravind Kumar Goud said it was TDP, which worked for the upliftment of the poor and marginalised sections. KCR gave false slogan that he will make a Dalit leader as the chief minister after Telangana state is formed. Boda Janarthan was highly optimistic that TDP will come back to power in Telangana in 2019 elections.However, TDP leaders, who were present in the Mahanadu, said that the party chief's comments are not really a soft stance on TRS. He wants the TTDP leaders to take the lead as the opposition leaders. ""In the mini Mahanadu conducted in Hyderabad recently, TTDP leaders went all out to criticise the TRS regime. We want to tell people what we have done to the people of Telangana and what is being done in AP,"" said a top leader.The usual enthusiasm of TDP leaders of AP to lambaste the opposition leader YS Jaganmohan Reddy was lacking. Except for a few remarks against Jagan, many leaders including Naidu focused more on the developmental works undertaken by TDP regime. ""The top brass of the party is of the view that though the government has done so much, it is not properly campaigned at the grassroots level. Mahanadu is the right venue to motivate the cadre towards that direction,"" they said."

While Samajwadi leaders were not keen on the RLD at all, the Congress had wanted a grand alliance with smaller parties and offered Ajit 18 Uttar Pradesh seats from its quota. Both Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav were in touch with Ajit's son Jayant Chowdhary but changed their mind after the veteran insisted on 30-32 seats. The dominant view in the Samajwadi was that any alliance with the Jats could send the wrong message to Muslims in the aftermath of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. The Congress initially wanted Jat support to bolster its chances in western Uttar Pradesh. But in refusing to part with 30 seats, it later anticipated a major dent in the BJP support base if the RLD contests aggressively in the region. The Jats had overwhelmingly supported the BJP in the 2014 general elections and the Haryana polls later that year. But a senior RLD leader said today: ""The 2014 election was unusual; the Modi wave swept away all traditional logic. But things are normal now and the results will be reflected in this election."" The RLD leader added: ""Jat means kisan (farmer). Narendra Modi had promised MSP (minimum support price) at least 50% above the average production cost. He also promised adequate and timely payment for sugarcane, the lifeline of western UP. He did nothing. The Jats have vowed to support Ajit Singh."" The RLD, angry at being left out of the Samajwadi-Congress tie-up, has decided to rope in rebels, mainly from the Samajwadi, to slice away huge chunks of votes. Speculation has also swirled an RLD alignment with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM. The aim: to cut into Muslim votes, the Samajwadi-Congress alliance's mainstay."

The company is also cutting salt in other Maggi branded products such as soups and seasonings.The new fortified Maggi masala noodles, as the company calls them, will be available across the 3.5 million retail outlets in India where the companys products reach over the next few weeks and the non-fortified versions will be phased out. There will not be any change in pricing.The plan to cut down salt content in Maggi noodles is part of Nestles global strategy to reduce sodium, saturated fat and sugar. By 2020, Nestle wants to reduce 10% average salt across all products sold under Maggi brand. Besides, the company plans to add more vegetables and other nutrient-rich ingredients in Maggi products. It has, in the past 10 years, brought down the sodium level in its Maggi products by 32.7%, the company claimed.It is a step where we want to introduce products which offer healthier choices to our consumers as we simplify our ingredients and encourage home cooking. At the forefront of this drive is the commitment to reshape Maggi brands products to emphasize the use of familiar and common ingredients that people know and use for home cooking, from their own kitchen cupboard, Suresh Narayanan, chairman & managing director, Nestle India, said in a statement.In India, Nestle is starting with adding iron to Maggi masala noodles aiming to provide about 15% of the recommended dietary allowance for consumers of the product. The company claims to sell about 2.5 billion portions of Maggi masala noodles, its single-largest revenue-earner in the country every year. Given the scale and popularity, Maggi masala noodles offer a powerful platform to address iron deficiency through the iron fortified variant, it said in a statement.Nestles move comes within four months of the countrys food regulator Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) setting up a scientific panel on food fortification and nutrition. The aim of the panel was to come up with guidelines to fight malnutrition in the country by making supply of fortified food mandatory for government-supported schemes such as mid-day meal at schools, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Public Distribution System (PDS). FSSAI will implement these in collaboration with the Union ministry of women and child development.While Nestle is probably the first company to commercially launch fortified noodles, a bunch of multinationals such as chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc., beverages maker Coca-Cola Co., food and beverages company PepsiCo Inc. and packaged goods company Unilever Plc. have announced plans to rev up portfolios with healthier products globally. Some governments have already initiated implementation of sugar taxes and putting a cap on sodium levels in food items.Besides, consumers have been opting for more of healthier options, including organic food products lately.In 2016, food companies refurnished about 180,000 products globally, according to a joint survey by consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited and industry body The Consumer Goods Forum. The number was just about 23,000 in 2014.Last week, Nestle India and eight other companies including Horlicks maker GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd, PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd, joined hands with The Akshaya Patra Foundation and the Ministry of Women and Child Development aiming to serve 5 billion meals to children across India by 2020. The initiative is part of the governments agenda to fight malnutrition.(Published in arrangement with Livemint)"

Till 8.30am on Monday, the state had recorded 70mm of pre-monsoon rain (recorded in March, April, May and first week of June). For Bihar, the normal pre-monsoon rain is 73.5 mm.""With more rainfall in store this week, Bihar is likely to receive normal or above normal pre-monsoon rainfall this year,"" Shankar said.The monsoon, he said, was likely to hit the state on time - June 10 - or even earlier. The monsoon has already reached the Nicobar Islands and is proceeding towards the Bay of Bengal.Agriculture department deputy director Anil Jha said Calling the good pre-monsoon rainfall was a boon for farmers.""The state government is promoting cultivation of green-manuring crop in the pre-monsoon season, as it increases soil fertility for the kharif crop. Pre-monsoon rain would save cost of irrigation which farmers otherwise have to incur,"" he said.Jha said good rainfall would reduce input cost for standing crop of maize, sugarcane and jute, and the pre-monsoon rain would benefit vegetable growers too.Mangoes and litchis will suffer, as pre-monsoon rain is generally accompanied by gusty winds.""While moisture would help the quality of fruits, strong winds lead to damages as well,"" Jha said."

The remaining eight have defaulted.Now consider this: All three mines started with modest first bids in lakhs that went for crores, literally turning sand into gold. The tonnage of the mines raises a bigger question. At what price will these firms sell the sand?The bid for Saidpur started from Rs 29.9 lakh and Bahadur bagged it at Rs 26.5 crore. The capacity of the mine is 31,320 tonnes, which means each tonne will cost Rs 8,301. A truck or tipper (of 800 cubic feet) carries 40 tonnes. So, the firm will have to sell the tipper full of sand at Rs 3.32 lakh to recover its bidding cost. Not to forget that the firm will have to pay land owners, labour, fuel and other incidentals.A tipper of sand used to cost anything between Rs 8,000 and Rs 11,000 in January this year. According to reports, the price of sand tipper has already doubled in some districts.In case of Mehadipur, the first bid started at Rs 25.3 lakh and Kulvinder Paul bagged it for Rs 9.2 crore. The capacity of the mine is 29,241 tonnes. A sand tipper here has to be sold for Rs 1.23 lakh for the bidder to break even. In case of Behloor Khurd, the first and last bid scored a perfect 10-fold jump, from Rs 23 lakh to Rs 23 crore. This when the capacity of the mine is just 26,568 tonnes. A tonne will cost Rs 8,657 and a tipper over Rs 2 lakh to recover just the bid cost. And this is not all. During monsoon, there can be no mining, which leaves the bidders just nine months of business.Requesting anonymity, one of the bidders told HT that the high bidding will lead to illegal mining to recover the cost.On the unrealistic bids, Sanjit said he has not looked into the tonnage of the mines. In every business, there can be profit or loss. We have just paid 50% of the amount. We have to pay the remaining after six months. By then, we will know whether we make profit or loss and all partners will bear the same, he said.While the Opposition Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the SAD-BJP have rubbished the judicial probe and are demanding that the two central agencies, income tax department and Enforcement Directorate investigate the money trail, Sanjit says all the three bids were made by his firms through its account in HDFC Bank, Chandigarh. On how someone like Bahadur who has filed income tax return of Rs 9 lakh could bag a contact running into crores, he said Bahadur never paid the bid money.It is a normal practice in liquor and sand mining business to give labour contractors a share to ensure loyalty and integrity. Mining is a labour-intensive job and the investors cannot take care of daily signing of slips for trucks and labour, Sanjit said.."

More than 80,000 others remained in relief camps as their homes were either destroyed or wiped out.The Indian contingent of more than 300 navy personnel was assisting in the relief, with divers searching the brackish waters and medical teams seeing patients in makeshift tents set up at shelters.INS Shardul has nearly 200 personnel on board, including specialised rescue, diving and medical teams, as well as a large amount of relief material and Gemini inflatable boats.INS Kirch was carrying 125 personnel. It had diving teams, relief supplies, inflatable gemini boats and a mobile medical teams.A third Indian naval ship arrived today, bringing relief supplies including rice, lentils, sugar, milk and blankets for the displaced.Secy to President of SL and SL Navy chief receiving symbolically the relief material on board the 3rd relief and rescue ship INS Jalashwa, the High Commission of India in Colombo tweeted.Indias Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Gopal Bagley tweeted SL Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and High Commissioner encouraging India n SL Navy jt medical and rescue teams from the 3rd Indian Ship.Lankan army trucks transported drinking water and food to affected areas. Helicopters ferried medicine, relief supplies and inflatable boats to remote areas, while small vessels plied the floodwaters in search of people.Lankan Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said foreign assistance is continuing to flow in with India, China and Pakistan among the countries sending ship loads of humanitarian aid.The rebuilding effort was well underway with the government approving Rs 2.5 million for every damaged house. Over 900 hosues in 15 districts have been completely destroyed, the spokesman said.The disaster is described as one of the worst-ever calamities since the 2003 floods.The official death toll was at 194, with 94 others listed as missing, the Colombo Gazette reported.The MeT department in its weather forecast said the cyclonic storm MORA is expected to get weakened when it enters Bangladesh and the possibility for heavy rain and strong winds will be reduced by tomorrow.However, under its influence cloudy skies, windy and showery conditions are expected over the country.The MeT department warned that the sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Kankasanthurai and sea area off the coast extending from Galle to Batticaloa via Hambantota can be very rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 70-80 kmph.There were scattered showers in many parts of Sri Lanka in the past 24 hours but flood waters were rapidly receding, officials said.State television broadcast called for public assistance to clean drinking wells contaminated by the monsoon floods.Lankas water supply minister Rauf Hakeem said 40 per cent of those affected did not have access to piped drinking water, and there was an urgent need to clean contaminated wells in flood-affected areas.Our workers have volunteered to join a major clean up, the minister said, adding that water distribution stations were flooded, disrupting the piped supply.In total, 545,243 people of 142,811 families were affected by the weather calamity. The South-West monsoon unleashed torrential rains, which ravaged fourteen districts in the western and southern parts on Friday and Thursday.The DMC had issued an urgent evacuation warning last evening instructing residents living along the Kelani river and within the Divisional Secretariats of Kollonnawa, Kaduwela, Wellampitiya, Kelaniya, Biyagama, Sedawatte, Dompe, Hanwella, Padukka and Avissawella to move to safer areas.It said water levels in the Kelani river were rising rapidly as indicted by the water gauges at Nagalagam Street, Hanwella and Glencourse and warned residents to move away from the vulnerable area as it was under an imminent flood threat.Those living along the banks of Nilwala Ganga, The Gin Ganga and Kalu Ganga were also asked to move to safer areas because of the rising water levels.Meanwhile, the DMC requested the people to be vigilant on rising water levels.Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western provinces. Heavy falls (about 150 mm) can be expected at some places, it said.Charities have warned on Monday that thousands of people affected by the floods and landslides are at the risk of potential fatal diseases such as dengue fever, as the death toll from the disaster continued to rise.On Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes orders, Rs two billion have been set aside to help the small and medium scale businesses destroyed by the floods, Senaratne said.Senaratne has rejected criticism that the goverment was not prepared to face the disaster.The government came under immense criticism over the absence of Minister of Disaster Management Anura Yapa who has not returned from a disaster management conference in Mexico.Wickremesinghe left the country yesterday for medical treatment after postponing the visit over the last 18 months, Senaratne said.Sri Lanka had sought international assistance, with India sending three naval ships laden with supplies in the last a couple of days.Following Indias lead in sending out emergency relief to Sri Lanka, more countries started pledging assistance to provide relief to the flood victims.Australia has said it would provide 500,000 dollars.A Pakistani relief ship was also expected to arrive later on Tuesday. At least three Chinese ships will come a day after Wednesday.Japan had promised portable generators and a team of experts to help with relief work."

Hindustan Times tracked him down at the Chandigarh office of one of the companies in which he is a director. In an interview, he strongly contradicted his description as a cook in media reports. Wearing formal trousers and a flashy shirt with three high-end mobile phones in hand, Bahadur repeatedly asserted that he never worked as a cook and denied that he is being used for Ranas benami operations.Q: Being a cook, how did you manage to get Punjabs richest mine?A: Let me tell you, I am not a cook and I dont know cooking. If I have Bahadur surname, it doesnt mean I am a cook. Nobody in the last four generations in my family has ever worked as a cook. My forefathers were Nepalis but our family had settled in Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. I am Delhi-born and my daughter is studying in Delhi Public School, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. Anybody can go and check. Calling me a cook is wrong and defamatory. Every Punjabi with a Singh surname is not a truck driver. I challenge anybody to prove that I was a cook ever.Q: But have you not worked in Ranas firms?A: I have and I am not denying it. Before leaving Rana Sugars to join the mining business, I was working as liaisoning officer in the firms Moradabad unit. There are many IAS officers in UP who still know me as Rana Sugars liaisoning officer. I am giving you the mobile numbers of those officers. You can check with them. I was originally working in Captain JS Randhawas firm and left it in 2011 to join Ranas firm. But when Randhawa Sir told me to join him in mining business, I left Ranas firm.Q: It seems a miracle for a liaisoning officer of a sugar company to become director of the company that has bagged the biggest mining contract of the state? You seem to be lying to save Rana?A: Before joining Randhawas firm, I had been working in Balwinder Paper Mill situated on Gill Road in Ludhiana since 2001. The mill is not there now, but the company records can prove that. Before moving to Ludhiana, I worked with a construction firm of Sultanpur (UP) as well. Thereafter, I joined Randhawas firm as my father-in-law was already employed with this firm for over 35 years. I am a matriculate and have earned my position by loyalty and hard work.Q: But your salary is just Rs 11,000 and your income tax returns show an annual income of Rs 9 lakh only. And you are a director in more than three firms having links with Rana. Unbelievable!A: Since I have looked after many construction projects for Ranas and Randhawas, they found me fit for the job. There are additional perks with my salary as well. My social status in Moradabad will show you my position. As far as mining is concerned, I am not raising any fund for the firm. We formed this company on February 12 this year and I am one of the directors, who would get 5% of the profit from mining. As per the agreement, I would oversee the operations of the mine, including loading of truck,s and would get Rs 60,000 as monthly salary from the firm. I was first made director of another firm in 2015 as well.Q: Isnt it a fact that Rana and Randhawa are partners and your company is doing benami operations for Rana?A: I know that Rana and Randhawa Sirs are good friends. As an employee, I dont know more than that. But how can anybody believe that Rana would give our company Rs 26 crore secretly and we would submit it with mining department without mentioning the source. After demonetisation, you have to reveal your financial source for every transaction of Rs one lakh."

(Source: Reuters) Shakur Stevenson said that he trained his whole life for that one moment. (Source: Reuters)Shakur Stevenson believes he is destined for greatness after barely missing out on Olympic gold in Rio.So does Irelands Michael Conlan, and theres already chatter about the two of them meeting in a big money fight one day.The Olympic boxing graduate class of 2016 is taking shape, and while theres not much to talk about in the heavier weights, professional promoters are hoping boxing fans will warm up to smaller scrappers like they once did for Olympic gold medallists Sugar Ray Leonard and Oscar De La Hoya.Stevenson signed last week with Bob Arums Top Rank, and is eager to get his pro career going. Conlan is with the same company and will make his pro debut at Madison Square Gardens theater on St. Patricks Day.And then there is Claressa Shields, who is a step ahead of both. The two-time Olympic middleweight champion opened her career in November with a win on the undercard of the Andre Ward-Sergey Kovalev fight in Las Vegas. She will become the first woman to headline a fight card on premium cable when she fights in Detroit March 10 on Showtime.The 21-year-old Shields has plans just as big as Stevenson and Conlan, even though womens boxing has largely been ignored by most boxing fans in recent years.I believe 150 percent in my boxing ability, she told The Associated Press before her first pro fight, a four-round decision over Franchon Crews. I know Im a great fighter. I fight better than 90 percent of the men who box now. I just know that, and Im not at my best yet.Shields is the only American fighter male or female to win a gold medal since Ward captured one in Athens in 2004. Her story of fighting out of poverty in Flint, Michigan, resonates with many, and she is not afraid to speak her mind about her abilities or the state of the sport of boxing.She also showed another side in Rio, when she gathered Stevenson in her arms after his gold medal split decision loss to Cubas Robeisy Ramirez. Shields, who was to fight for her second gold the next day, spent several minutes consoling her teammate and telling him there would be better things in his future.I trained my whole life for that one moment, Stevenson said of his gold medal fight. I failed and it hurt. I didnt get to realise how far I had really come.Stevenson was sought in Rio by promoters who saw a lot of Leonard and De La Hoya in a fighter with slick moves and a dazzling smile. Floyd Mayweather Jr. spent time with him in Rio and talked about signing the fighter for his promotion company, but never gave him an offer.Stevenson said he took less guaranteed money from Top Rank because of the companys success in building up Olympic fighters such as Mayweather, De La Hoya and Miguel Cotto.I like the fact that they build superstars. They have the best track record around, said Stevenson, who got his first name from the late rapper Tupac Shakur. Its going to take a few years, but I think I can be a star, too.Stevenson, the oldest of nine children who began boxing at the age of 7 in the Newark, New Jersey gym run by his grandfather, Walli Moses, does not yet have a date or an opponent for his debut. He will begin his pro career in the 126-pound featherweight division.Conlan will fight as a super batamweight in his first bout, a scheduled six-rounder against Colorados Tim Ibarra, who is 4-4. Hes expecting to be the big favourite of a heavily Irish crowd in his debut at 122 pounds.I truly believe in my ability. Im a fighter who speaks with complete confidence at all times, he said. No matter whos in front of me, no matter what day it is, no ones going to beat me.Conlan didnt win a medal in Rio, but he did make some news. After losing a controversial decision to Russias Vladimir Nikitin he flashed obscene gestures at the judges, then sent a tweet to Vladimir Putin suggesting the Russian president helped fix the fight.Hey Vlad, he tweeted. How much did they charge you bro??Stevenson sees a possible big fight with Conlan once they both make names for themselves as a pro.I cant wait for me and Michael Conlan to meet up in a big fight down the line, he said.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

New labelling methods will help a consumer in knowing the exact percentage of the recommended dietary allowance of say sugar, fat, salt or other micro nutrients thats met by consuming a serving of that product, said Agarwal.Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) provides a reference range to assess daily nutrient intake in a healthy person that tends to vary by age and gender.Currently, the food packets broadly mention total calories contained and also the quantity of fat, sugar, salt, carbohydrates and a few other nutrients.The label hardly says anything about how much of a healthy persons daily needs are met after consuming a serving and how much of it is left. The labels are quite convoluted for a common man to understand, said Agarwal.The panel that has been working on labelling guidelines is the same panel that worked on formulating countrys food fortification guidelines. The panel is also focusing on defining junk food.We broadly term high-fat, high-sugar items as junk that lead to obesity and other complications but this panel is getting into the details and coming up with a standard definition, said Agarwal.The food regulator, however, isnt sure about deadline for implementation of the regulations.It will be difficult for us at this level to say when the regulations will be implemented, as the process requires several layers of consultations and approval. We are trying our best to be as fast as possible, said Agarwal."

The incessant rains experienced since Thursday night have driven nearly half a million people out of their inundated homes in the southern and western regions.Police said a Sri Lankan Airforce helicopter (SLAF) MI-17 carrying relief aid for flood victims crashed in the southern Galle district, the worst hit of the 14 districts by flash floods and earth slips in the ongoing monsoon rains, while carrying out relief operations in the flood-stricken areas.There were no casualties and Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena telephoned the Squadron Leader Bhanuka Delgoda, the pilot of the MI-17 to congratulate him for his bravery.The pilot lost control of the helicopter due to bad weather and crashed into woods, police said.On Saturday, a Lanka Air Force airman, Y M S Yaparatne, 37, died while carrying out relief operations in the Galle district as he fell off from the helicopter.More rains are expected in the next two days as the depression in the east central Bay of Bengal intensified into a cyclonic storm MORA and is now moving away from the island, it said.Flood waters were receding in the worst-affected districts of Ratnapura and Kalutara but the authorities said cleaning up operations could take weeks.Some 412 houses were fully damaged with over 4,200 houses suffering partial damage. Some 471,000 people remain displaced while over 75,000 people are currently being housed in over 330 temporary relief accommodation.Following Indias lead in sending out emergency relief to Sri Lanka, more countries have started pledging assistance to provide relief to the flood victims.China will donate relief items worth $2.2 million.The relief goods, to be dispatched to Colombo by a chartered flight soon, include tents, blankets, sheets, rain boots and life jackets.The second Indian relief ship, INS Shardul arrived at Colombo Port on Sunday. It has nearly 200 personnel on board, including specialised rescue, diving and medical teams, as well as a large amount of relief material and Gemini inflatable boats.The first ship, INS Kirch reached Colombo on May 27. The 40 tonnes of relief materials on board INS Shardul included rice, atta (flour), dal, sugar, bed sheets, blankets, durries, rain coats, milk, biscuits, etc.The rescue, diving and medical teams on board will work in coordination with the Sri Lankan Navy and other authorities, and are now being deployed in the worst affected areas, particularly Ratnapura and Horana.A third Indian naval Ship, INS Jalashwa, with additional relief materials, is expected to reach Colombo soon.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang sent condolence messages to President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe respectively on the loss of the lives and property in floods and landslides caused by heavy rain.The flooding was the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful Southwest monsoon, officials had said.Sri Lanka, which has been heavily deforested for cash crops, often witnesses landslides during the monsoon season."
593bad787be9e04aac897cfb,NGT asks CPCB to test ground water in 8 west UP districts,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/ngt-asks-cpcb-to-test-ground-water-in-8-west-up-districts/articleshow/58874545.cms,2017-05-28,"MEERUT: National Green Tribunal 's order to test the ground water along the course of East Kali river has given hope to thousands of villagers in eight west UP districts. For years, the villagers were forced to drink contaminated water of hand-pumps, which drew water from the river.Once a pristine tributary to the mighty Ganga, the East Kali river is now reduced to a dark shadow of its former self. The river, which criss-crosses hundreds of villages in eight districts of western Uttar Pradesh, once used to replenish the ground water of the region, through which hand-pumps draw water.Locals said that instead of water, the river now carries ""industrial effluent and municipal waste"".They said that the hand-pumps ""spew venom"" instead of fresh water, leading to spread of cancer and various other life-threatening diseases. According to a recent report, at least 20 people died of cancer in just three villages of neighbouring Bijnor due to contaminated water and over a dozen people were suffering from the deadly disease.However, last week's NGT order, asking the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to inspect the hand pumps releasing contaminated ground water in the eight districts has come as a breather for thousands of villagers living along the river.A bench, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar , has directed the apex pollution monitoring body to test the samples of the ground water in these areas through which East Kali River flows. The CPCB has been asked by the green panel to test the water samples and seal the hand-pumps if they find the water to be polluted.Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Kasganj, Aligarh, Kannauj and Farrukhabad are the eight districts through which the river passes.Locals allege that several pleas to the government to treat the contaminated river elicited no response. Some of the villages even purchased RO system with the help of local NGOs to get clean drinking water.The NGT order came on a plea filed by Meerut resident Raman Kant Tyagi seeking directions for preparation of a comprehensive action plan for cleaning East Kali River and sealing of the hand pumps whose water is not fit for consumption.East Kali originates from Antwada village in Muzaffarnagar district and flows through the west UP districts before its confluence into Ganga near Kannauj.The petition, filed through advocate Rahul Khurana, has made Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Water Resources, Uttar Pradesh government and CPCB as parties.According to the plea, sugar processing units and their associated alcohol manufacture distilleries, paper mills and tanneries, located adjacent to the river, were extracting large volumes of water and contaminating the river by discharging their effluents into it.""It is a positive step. We have been drinking poison for long and nobody from the government ever bothered to check. We even had to spend money and install RO machines. But, the water is so dirty that even ROs are not helping. There are several cases of cancer in our village because of the dirty water,"" said Dewendar Sharma, a resident of Panwari village in Sardhana, Meerut.After an inspection in November 2016, UP Jal Nigam, the UP Pollution Control Board, National Mission for Clean Ganga and CPCB had stated in their report that 14 drains were releasing effluents into the river."

If Bahadur made a successful bid of Rs 26 crore, Kulvinder won a Rs 9.21 crore mining contract in Mehadipur in Nawanshahr.According to his IndusInd Bank account statements which Kulvinder submitted on April 11this year before the mining department in his application for certificate of approval (CA), he was drawing a salary of varying amounts between Rs 30,000 and Rs 50,000 every month from Gurjit's firm. His registered address in the bank account is Ms Rana Sugars Limited, SCO, 49-50, Sector 8-C, Chandigarh.Gurjit has rubbished allegations of hawala and benami transactions for getting into mining business through his ex-employees.

Had they not done so, we wouldn't have realised the severity of the situation,"" said Rajendra Kumar , at a presentation on 'Making Tamil Nadu drought-free'. ""But protests alone are not the answer. The farmers must now take it upon themselves to create community-driven, decentralised water management options, which many others like them in the state can also follow,"" he added.At an event organised by Goethe Institut as an extension of its 'Chennai Water Forum ' initiative, Kumar, also known as the 'Water Man of India', proposed changing crop patterns according to an area's water availability. ""At Rajasthan's villages, we shifted to growing coriander a crop that uses less water, harvests in 40 days, sells for 40 a kilo, and is so fragrant, our animals never came close to it,"" he said.Talking about the drought-hit delta regions, Kumar pointed out that a mechanism to ""increase recharge"" of groundwater and ""disciplining discharge"", was the solution.""The next time you get rain, make a river parliament and ensure you do not grow water-intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane. This is the way to control your discharge, and sustain groundwater,"" he said.At the event that also saw prominent environmentalists, researchers and activists participate, he dismissed political promises of interlinking of rivers as being mere political answers to a problem that needed sustainable solutions.""Stop rainwater and build your own reserve bank of water with it. If Tamil Nadu has to become a water surplus state, it must stop looking at other states for water and instead look within itself,"" he said."

Health experts suggest that the exercise regimen during Ramzan should be restricted to pre-Sahar (pre-dawn meal) and post-Iftar (breaking of fast) period to avoid exhaustion, exertion and dehydration. A few light exercises may, however, be carried out immediately after Sahar in an air-conditioned setting.Any exercise that involves physical exertion should not be carried out during the fasting hours as there will be loss of water leading to dehydration. Continuing the exercise in dehydrated condition will damage muscles. There are no international or national guidelines on the do's and don'ts with regard to physical exercises during fasting. However, many experts agree that it is not safe to exert oneself while fasting.Physical trainers recommend short exercises of about 30 minutes before beginning the fast in the early morning and after breaking it after sunset. In no case the workout should be for more than an hour.""Burning calories during Ramzan will add to the health benefits of fasting. But one should plan the gym activity during the month in such a way that there is no pressure on the body . One can perform cardiovascular or aerobic exercises like slow cycling or walking. Brisk or anaerobic exercises should be avoided,"" said physical trainer MB Sat tar. Apart from light exercises, one should ensure that there is a good electrolyte balance by taking oral rehydration salts.Experts also warn against strenuous exercises like weight lifting and running immediately after Iftar. This is to avoid low blood pressure and low blood sugar level.Those on fast should limit themselves to light exercises and strenuous ones only once a week before Sahar. ""Exercising during fasting hours will lead to increase in a hormone called cortisol. This is not good for health. One should remember that at no stage there should be loss of water (dehydration) from the body . One of the best physical and spiritual exercises during Ramzan is to offer Taraweeh prayers in the night that will last for at least an hour. The physical movements will keep the body healthy,"" said senior physician Dr S Ahmad."

Hotels, and homestays in Kasol, Malana, Rasol, Tosh, Manikaran, and many other villages of the valley are almost fully occupied. Foreigners from Israel , France, UK, US, and other countries are camping here. Domestic tourists from all states of the country  especially from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and Mumbai  have thronged the valley. While a few tourists come here for sight-seeing and trekking, others come to enjoy parties and drugs.Kullu police have laid several nakas in the valley and are frequently checking vehicles and pedestrians. Recently this week, three foreigners from Switzerland, Turkey, and Sri Lanka, were arrested by the police on charges of possession of contraband LSD and methedrine . Sources said some people were organizing late night parties. Drug peddlers have also become active in the region.Sources said the peddlers sell small quantity of local charas to tourists at high prices. Also, non-native drugs like LSD, heroin, cocaine, and brown sugar are available here. As late night parties in open spaces where drugs and alcohol are served with loud music are completely banned here, some people are taking a risk to organize parties in forest areas for the sake of good profit. One such illegal party was busted by the police a few days ago, and its organizers  a Swiss national and a tourist from Delhi  were arrested by the police.According to Kullu superintendent of police Padam Chand, additional police force has been deployed in all tourist destinations of the district. ""Nakas are being laid. Traffic patrolling has increased. We have arrested three foreigners under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act in two days. We are handling the drug carriers strictly,"" he said."

From here, it traverses 1,312 kilometres through three states  MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat  before finally emptying into the Gulf of Cambay. Tashi Tobgyal The Narmada, the fifth longest river in the country, rises near the Amarkantak range of mountains in Madhya Pradesh. From here, it traverses 1,312 kilometres through three states  MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat  before finally emptying into the Gulf of Cambay. Tashi TobgyalAt Chikalda village in Madhya Pradesh, the Narmada flows quietly. Its hard to gauge the river here  only the locals who dive in to collect coins thrown by devotees from the bridge nearby know its exact depth. This stretch of the river, said to be one of the spots where Mahatma Gandhis ashes were immersed, has witnessed many an agitation over a dam, the Sardar Sarovar, over 150 km away, in Kevadia colony of Gujarat. On February 8, the countrys apex court scripted what may well be the final chapter in a decades-old legal battle over the river and its waters.The Supreme Court directed the Centre and the Madhya Pradesh government to pay the final compensation of Rs 60 lakh to each of the 681 project-affected families which had refused the aid offered by the government. While giving the government two months to make the payment, the court set a deadline of July 31 for the families to vacate the area, failing which, the bench said, they would be evicted.Watch what else is making news:The court order paves the way for the Sardar Sarovar dam, among the most ambitious multi-purpose projects in the country, to be operated at full capacity. The Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA), had, among other things, wanted the court to stop the government from using the dam to full capacity until all the project-affected were rehabilitated. While the Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal had in 1979 ruled that people affected by the project should be given land in return for what they stood to lose, the Madhya Pradesh government soon ran out of agricultural land it could offer. So far, only 239 people have got land in the state. More than a decade ago, the government drew up a financial package, the Special Rehabilitation Package (SRP), with the compensation to be paid in two installments.While 3,366 families accepted the second and final installment  they are now out of the purview of the apex court ruling  1,358 families accepted only the first installment but turned down the second. These families will now get Rs 15 lakh as ordered by the court.Rukadiya Dhangar, 47, Chikalda village, Badwani districtDhangars is among 681 families who sought land in exchange for land acquired and rejected all compensation packages offered by government.

Tashi Tobgyal Dhangars is among 681 families who sought land in exchange for land acquired and rejected all compensation packages offered by government. With SC order, he now stands to get Rs 60 lakh, the only one in his village to get the amount. Tashi TobgyalIt wasnt easy to hold on, but Rukadiya Dhangar did  for over 30 years. The 47-year-old from Chikalda village in Badwani district and his family are among 681 in Madhya Pradesh who steadfastly refused any compensation in lieu of the land they stood to lose if the Narmada rose and swallowed their fields. Dhangar says he only wanted land in exchange for his four acres, where he grows wheat and maize; not the cash the government offered him.One by one, people in Chikalda and those in neighbouring villages accepted, willingly or unwillingly, what the state government had to offer. Across the state, 3,366 people accepted the governments financial compensation. For, what was certain was that some day, the river would rise and their fields would submerge. While some people got land and moved out of their homes, others took the money they got and bought land elsewhere.A few kilometres before Chikalda, a village of 700-odd families on the banks of the Narmada, villagers talk about Dhangar, of how lucky he is. He is the only one in the village eligible for the Rs 60 lakh compensation; 15 others took the first installment but turned down the second  they now stand to get Rs 15 lakh.Dhangar is glad he held on. People in the village are jealous. They say I am lucky; it was no luck. Hamne himmat rakhke patak rakha (I showed courage and refused to give up the land), Dhangar says. It was not easy for me all this while. My family suffered because we had no money for my sons treatment: he met with an accident and I had to spend Rs 4.5 lakh. There were times I wondered if I was doing the right thing what if everyone accepted what was given to them and I would be left alone with my worries, he says.Women on their way to fetch water from the Narmada.

Tashi TobgyalThrough all these 30-odd years, as Dhangar travelled to Delhi and Bhopal, among other places, to take part in NBA-led agitations, he married, fathered four children  one son and three daughters  but didnt give up the fight.Though his fight was for alternative land  Medhaji (NBA leader Medha Patkar) had said we should not settle for anything else  the compensation of Rs 60 lakh was something he hadnt expected. Though he is still waiting for details of the apex court judgment, he believes each of the five members of his family will get Rs 60 lakh. Wont we, he asks.His hut, which is off the main road, does not fall in the government-notified area that will be eventually submerged but his four-acre agriculture land in Gelgaon, a couple of kilometres away, will go under when the gates atop the dam in Gujarat are complete.Anyway, I am glad I waited. Now I will decide what to do once I get the money. Until then, I am not moving out of here, he says.Ramesh Solanki, 40, Chikalda village, Badwani districtPolice arrested Kalabais husband, Ramesh Solanki, because he allegedly produced fake registration papers for land he never bought.

So far, police say, nearly 3,000 fake registries have been detected in Badwani, Khargone and Dhar districts. Tashi TobgyalSitting inside her house in Chikalda village, Kalabai, 35, breaks down at the mention of her husband. They came and took him away as if he was some criminal. They took away some papers from here and did not explain anything. I have no idea how my two children and I will survive this, she says.As villagers try to calm her, she says, You wont understand. Only a woman who has gone through something like this will knowOver 45 days ago, her husband, Ramesh Solanki, 40, was arrested by the Badwani police for his alleged involvement in a fake registry scandal. The scandal, which first came to light in 2007, had farmers in Badwani, Khargone and Dhar districts allegedly colluding with brokers and government officials to strike land deals that existed only on paper. In order to get the second installment of the Special Rehabilitation Package, farmers had to buy land and produce registration papers as proof. But many allegedly produced fake documents and claimed the money.Ramesh had taken the first installment of a little over Rs 2.80 lakh. The family of three brothers owned 7 acres in all and each adult male member was eligible to claim compensation. While his brothers bought nine acres, Ramesh didnt. He claimed the second installment of around 2.79 lakh after allegedly producing fake registering papers for a plot of land he bought in Bagli, Dewas district.Over six years ago, the government instituted a judicial inquiry into the scandal. The final report of the Justice S S Jha Commission is yet to become public.Kalabai and her relatives claim brokers and government official cheated poor, illiterate farmers by getting them to put their thumb impressions on papers. Ramesh is now in Bagli jail in the states Dewas district. I have not met him since they took him away. I dont even have money to go there, she says. She has one other regret. He was hungry when the police came but they did not even let him have food.Tulsiram Yadav, 51, Chikalda/Nanakbedi village, Badwani districtTulsirams family got Rs 13 lakh as compensation for their 13 acres. They used that money to buy land in another village and now cultivate both these plots. They are among 2,033 project-affected families in MP who bought alternative land. Tashi Tobgyal Tulsirams family got Rs 13 lakh as compensation for their 13 acres. They used that money to buy land in another village and now cultivate both these plots. They are among 2,033 project-affected families in MP who bought alternative land. Tashi TobgyalI was in school when I first heard of the dam in Gujarat and how we could lose our land some day. But it was only some decades later, in 2001, when we received a notice saying that our land would be acquired, that it hit home, says Tulsiram Yadav, standing in his field in Chikalda village.The land he stands on 13 acres of the family-owned 16 acres  was acquired by the government in 2004. Back then, the two brothers got a little over Rs 13 lakh as compensation, which they used to buy 16 acres in Nanakbedi, a few kilometres away. We put in some money of our own, Yadav says. They also returned the residential plot they were given by the Narmada Valley Development Authority (NVDA) and invested the Rs 50,000 they received for it to buy more land.He says he is glad he took the compensation. I now grow crops on both my plots  the one in Chikalda and in Nanakbedi, he says, adding that the family lives in Chikalda. Rules allow land owners to cultivate their original land until it is submerged. In some cases, land gets submerged only during the monsoon and farmers often go back to cultivate once the water recedes. While the family grows wheat on the Chikalda land, in Nanakbedi, they now grow sugarcane after a new sugar factory came up nearby a couple of years ago.I keep shuttling between the two plots because both require attention, says Tulsiram, adding that one of his two sons helps him in the field; the other works for the state electricity board. He thinks he can do this for another five years, maybe even more. I think it will take another five years before the dam reaches its full height. Until then, I will get to keep both my plots, he says.Jahriya Mania Solanki, 58, Khalbujarg village, Dhar districtJahriya and family moved out of their submerged village to land offered by government.

Of the 4,621 families entitled for land compensation, 239 got land. Tashi TobgayalSPORTING a big headgear and a bigger smile, Jahriya Mania Solanki says he doesnt know how far he is from what had been his home for generations but now, he says, this is home. Five years ago, Jahriya, his wife and 10 children, along with the families of his four brothers, moved from their village Bhadal, in Badwani district, to Khalbujarg in the states Dhar district, where they got adjacent plots spread over 5 acres and where they now grow cotton.We dont how how far we have travelled because we are all illiterate. All we know is that its a long way from here. We have to change three buses to reach the Narmada and then cross the river to go to the other side, says Jahriyas nephew Devji.It was in 1998 that the government acquired the familys 17-acre agricultural land in Bhadal village. Dekhte dekhte hi dub gaya (the land submerged before our eyes), says Jahriyas younger brother Ohariya, talking of how they had been hearing for at least 30 years of how the river would one day consume their fields. While they waited for alternative land to be allocated, the family lived in a village nearby, till they got the land of their choice.He says they were also offered land near Maheshwar in Khargone district. But when we went with police and government officials, the villagers there attacked us. We later found out that some people had encroached on the plot that was meant for us. They started fighting and asked us to return, recalls Jahriya, adding that it was only four years ago that they got this land in Khalbujarg, 90 km from Indore and 140 km from their home.Talking of the SC order, Jahriya says, We thank our stars that we got this land. An acre here costs around Rs 25 lakh. Our family wouldnt have been able to buy 5 acres for Rs 60 lakh. Our next generations will do well in life. He says though they are happy here, the family is yet to get the residential plots they are entitled to as part of the rehabilitation package.They did give us land to build homes, but that is five km from here and we turned it down. We have now asked for plots closer to our fields, he says. The family  the four brothers and their families  now live in a makeshift house near their field. Whatever it is, this is now home. We dont get time to miss our old home. We are busy here, says Devji, adding that they have bought a tractor, which they take turns to use.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

GOVARTHANM.GOVARTHAN ;M.GOVARTHAN - M_GOVARTHANFarmers in Erode were told on Friday by the district administration that removal of topsoil from Bhavani Sagar reservoir has been put on hold.The district administration instructed Public Works Department to halt the process on Thursday after the Forest Department in Coimbatore district expressed reservations over removal of the soil citing disturbance to wildlife on the Sirumugai side.Addressing farmers at the monthly grievances day meeting, District Collector S.Prabakar said a decision on resumption of soil sourcing from the dam will be based on an inspection he would be undertaking on Saturday.The Collector said this when a participant wanted to know why farmers were refused permission to source soil from the dam. The soil in specified quantities is provided free of cost, the Collector reiterated when another farmer sought to draw the attention of the officials to the charges levied at the dam.Subi Thalapathy, representative of Thadapally-Arakankottai Channels Ayacut Farmers Association sought sole regulation of soil supply by the PWD in waterbodies where the Forest Department also has control.Responding to a point raised on drought relief, the Collector said of the Rs. 83 crore sanctioned for distribution in the form of subsidy on agricultural inputs, the disbursal to the tune of Rs. 60 crore has been completed.District Revenue Officer R. Sathish instructed farmers who had not applied so far to submit the required documents at the respective taluk offices on Saturday (May 27).When sugarcane cultivators complained about what they described as persisting delay by Sakthi Sugar Mill in settling accumulating dues, the Collector informed that a second notice would be sent under Revenue Recovery Act, before deciding on distraint proceedings.The Collector urged farmers to avail themselves of the utility of drip irrigation scheme, saying Rs. 54 crore has been sanctioned for the district. The farmers were free to choose the inputs of any of the 32 government-approved manufacturers.Periyasamy of Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam suggested dovetailing of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme with the ongoing works for deepening water bodies.

593bc9d77be9e04956d7893b,Cane growers want better price for sugarcane,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cane-growers-want-better-price-for-sugarcane/article18587612.ece,2017-05-27,"Expressing disappointment over the Fair and Remunerative Price for sugarcane, farmers have demanded a further increase.The Central Government after a gap of one year has raised the Fair and Remunerative Price for sugarcane from Rs. 2,300 per tone to Rs. 2,550 per tonne for 2017-18. Even with the State Advised Price incentive of Rs. 550 per tone, the cane growers will get only Rs. 3,100 per tonne which is wholly underpriced, say farmers. Farmers are demanding that the cane purchase price must at least be fixed at Rs. 4,000 per tonne or better still based on cost of cultivation.Usually the Centre revises the FRP every year based on recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. But it did not happen last year and that added to the burden of the cane growers. Now the FRP has been raised by Rs. 250 a tonne. Adding the State Government incentive through its State Advised Price mechanism, the sugarcane growers would get only Rs. 3,100 per tonne. This is absolutely not enough as the cost of cultivation has gone up due to factors such as higher input costs, drought-induced irrigation woes, increased labour costs. Also, the private sugar mills were not dispensing with the SAP incentive for more than two seasons. So, the Central and the State governments must find a way out for the cane growers, observes S. Vimalnathan of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Protection Association.Last year speaking at a farmers convention at Bareilly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to take concrete steps to double the income of farmers. This announcement of the Centre is not in tune with his promise and we expect Mr. Modi to intervene and set things right, Mr. Vimalnathan pleaded.Cane purchase price must not be based on sugar price but must be factored in by the cost of cultivation, insists senior consultant to Confederation of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), and long time sugarcane grower K. Kothandaraman. It is surprising why the State Government was not taking action against the private sugar mills that did not honour payments under the SAP and have run up huge arrears against the cane supplied to the mills by the farmers, he said.The only solution for the sugarcane growers woes was the implementation of the MS Swaminathan Committee Report that would while making cane cultivation profitable ensures that a critical balance was struck among all stakeholders, Mr. Kothandaraman said."

But fortunately, the need did not arise so far, Dr. Zaheer Ahmed said on Sunday.DWCRA stallsMeanwhile, DWCRA group women from all the 13 districts of the State displayed their products at the exhibition-cum-sale organised on the occasion. Though the members did not seem to be happy with the sales, they were grateful to the organisers for giving them an opportunity to display their products at the stalls free of cost, and help them in reaching out to a cross-section of the people. Though many were attracted towards the stall, the sales were not very encouraging.Colourful tops made of lace material, Kalamkari saris, Etikoppaka toys, herbal products from Rajakoduru in Visakhapatnam district, Ponduru khadi products, batik prints, agarbathis (incense sticks), honey, photo frames and banzara bags were some of the items of display. The expo has provided us a platform to showcase our products, said Kota Devaki Devi of Pedapativarigudem village in Krishna district, who was selling traditional home made sweets like sunnundalu, pickles and a host of other home-made products.S. Naushad of Madanapalle in Chittoor district displayed colourful Banjara bags, block print saris from Telangana and photo frames of colourful paintings.

Nallasamy. secretary of TNTM said.The State Governments acceptance for tapping of neera has come after several years of campaign by the TNTM. The decision is a welcome development, though the scope for large-scale tapping of neera is at present diminished due to the drought conditions. Neera cannot be tapped from drying trees. The palm and coconut trees need to be healthy to derive the sap, Mr. Nallasamy said, adding that a beginning will be made for neera extraction shortly.During one of its campaign earlier this year, the TNTM explained that neera had enormous nutritive properties, and that the sap that was rich in lauric acid was vital for human body.According to the Government, tapping and marketing of neera will increase the income of over 1.5 lakh coconut farmers across the State.The value added product has been envisaged for marketing through Coconut Development Board (CDB), coconut farmers associations, coconut producers federation, and through cooperative societies. The government intends to provide licences to these associations, societies, and federations to produce neera and other by-products, including syrup, honey, jaggery, chocolates, and sugar.According to farmers here, Tamil Nadu has a definite advantage over Kerala in deriving economic benefit from neera. Supporting the farmers cause, the CDB prevailed upon the Government to make an amendment to Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act 1937 to exclude neera in order that it is taken out of the definition of toddy.The CDB is understandable keen to disseminate among farmers modern technologies for preservation of neera up to one year without fermentation."

In addition, the juice content has been affected and this reflects on the quality of jaggery. Traditionally produced Marayur jaggery is known for its quality and and fetches a fair price for the farmers. As per official estimates, over 700 ha of land here is under sugarcane cultivation.The northeast monsoon is the main rainy season here and a fall in rainfall could impact the total production, extending to a year. According to Arumugham, who has taken land on lease close to Kanthallur, the drop in rainfall has affected the crop in different stages of growth and this will have a long-term effect on the jaggery production. It is estimated that there has been a drop of 40% to 45% in the rainfall. The most drought-hit areas are Karshanadu, Pius Nagar, Mashivayal, Kottakalam and areas near Kanthallur.Mr Arumugham said the yield per acre was different in each farm. Though the farmers get 80 sacks (60 kg per sack) per acre of land, there are farms that provide over 100 sacks of jaggery. Almost all the farms have been affected by the change in climatic conditions, he said, adding those who used to get 80 sacks of jaggery now get only 55 to 52 sacks per acre. Though the price is at a high of Rs. 3,300 a sack, the production drop has badly affected the farmers, he said.In view of the high quality of Marayur jaggery and its traditional way of production, the State government recently took the initiative to get geographical indication (GI) tag for Marayur jaggery.According to farmer Sojan, there was conversion of lands from sugarcane cultivation to other crops owing to the high fluctuation in prices and labour costs. The jaggery production is done manually in the units attached to the farms. With fake produce being marketed as Mrayur jaggery flooding the State, visitors to the farms and direct purchase by firms constituted the main buyers."
