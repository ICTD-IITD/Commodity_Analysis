In an attempt to improve the quality of healthcare, the upcoming Maharashtra Paramedical Council Act makes it mandatory for the paramedics to be qualified.15,000 laboratoriesThere are over 15,000 laboratories across the state. Some of them are run by doctors, while many are even run by quacks. Due to this, erroneous medical reports have become very common. Often, doctors have to re-send blood or urine samples for tests. Eventually, the pressure comes on patients, said Dr. Pravin Shingare, head of Directorate of Medical Education and Research.According to Dr. Shingare, the Act is in the final stage and a gazette notification will be issued within next month.Once in place, the Act will require an eight-member council to be formed. Every laboratory will be registered under the council. Also, all technicians will have to be registered under the council after they fulfil the qualification criteria as well.Existing techniciansHowever, a question mark remains over the large number of existing technicians, many of whom are not even graduates. We are devising ways to accommodate all the existing technicians. They will get experience-based licence. For example, an under-qualified lab technician, who is only a Standard X or XI pass may be asked only to assist in testing blood sugar or an X-ray technician will be allowed only to carry out X-rays of certain body and they will be granted licence. We will also offer short-term courses so that some technicians can acquire additional skills, said Dr. Shingare, adding that the new ones will, however, require the three-year bachelors degree to get the licence.The State aims that in the first two years of the council, at least 10,000 paramedics will be registered. Later on, the council will be formed through election. Also, those who do not register their laboratories and paramedics who do not get registered will stand to face three years imprisonment and fine. We will issue timely advertisements about the same, he said.Welcome moveBut many pathologists feel that the government is simply trying to pave the way for technicians to start their own laboratories under the garb of the paramedical Bill. It is a welcome move by the government to regularise paramedical staff. But we feel that the government is simply trying to make way for the technicians to start their own outlets, said Dr. Prasad Kulkarni, executive member of Maharashtra Association of Practising Pathologists and Microbiologists. There are already existing illegal laboratories run by such technicians. How would the government deal with these bogus laboratories? Dr. Shingare, however, allayed the concerns. The paramedical staff are always to assist. They cant ever take the place of a doctor. I dont know what is the fear all about.Who are they?A paramedic is a person trained in providing services ancillary to, or required as assistance in the teaching or practice of modern scientific medicine, ayurvedic system, unani system, and homoeopathic system of medicine.There are 21 paramedic professions identified under the Act including laboratory technicians, radiographic technicians, radiotherapy, cardiology, neurology, blood transfusion, optometry, plaster, anaesthesia, perfusionist, and operation theatre technicians."

With drought taking its toll, the water flow is down to a trickle and at the lowest in the history.The river, originating from the Anamudi hills, flows through the rain shadow areas of Marayur and joins the Chinnar river, supplying water to a large stretch of farmlands in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Both the monsoons have an impact on the river. The southwest monsoon swells the river when it rains in the Anamudi hills. The river course downstream is through rain shadow areas, where the northeast monsoon showers its bounty on the river.Peak summer season coupled with a poor northeast monsoon is the reasons for the plight of the river, said Krishnadas, a farmer at Marayur. He said the Pambar was a perennial river as it benefited from both the monsoons.The river is the lifeline of Anchunadu as it supplies drinking and irrigation water to a vast stretch of rain shadow areas. It also gives life to the farmlands of Tamil Nadu, where it is the Amaravati river, before joining the Cauvery. There is a direct link between the water flow in the Pambar and the agriculture activities in the Anchunadu valley, says Mr. Krishnadas, adding that if the former dries up, the latter too will.It irrigates sugarcane and paddy fields and vegetable farms in addition to areca nut and coconut plantations. The many channels from the river that irrigate farmlands had dried up.The alluring beauty of the river had fascinated visitors. The Thoovanam waterfall on its course in the forest is a major attraction for tourists on the peak of the monsoon season.The tribespeople too preferred settlement on its course in the forest and the Champakadu colony of the Hill Pulayas in the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary is considered one of the earliest ones.The river has been reduced to a trickle, which too will disappear if the summer continues, said Geetha, a resident of the colony.Farmers in two districts of Tamil Nadu and the Anchunadu Valley are hoping for a copious southwest monsoon to rejuvenate farm activities."

Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

Health experts, who have studied a number of people suffering from diabetes, recommend Yoga postures like `Balasana' and `Sarvangasana' to keep the body and mind healthy.These special postures not only help relieve stress, but also help keep vital systems like digestive, nervous, respiratory and reproduction in good condition.With an increasing number of Indians falling prey to the dreaded lifestyle disease, Yoga experts point out that high blood sugar can be brought down to optimum level by spending less than an hour daily doing specific Yogasanas.Dr Ashwini Rakhame , chief medical officer of LifeInControl, recommends Yoga for non-medical management of diabetes as it does not involve any medication and is just based on physical exercise and meditation. Dr Ashwini, who recently conducted a Yoga camp in the city, told TOI that daily practice of Yoga as a way of life rather than just to manage a condition will yield better results.""Even doing a 45-minute session five times a week could have a huge impact in maintaining the health of a person. There are also specific yoga postures that help manage a patient's glucose level, if practiced daily along with other measures to manage the disease,"" she added.Since diabetes affects almost every part of the body, the better way to manage the disease is to practice Yoga, which is holistic, said herbo-meditation expert Swami Satyaveer of Suvigna Ashramam.He said experiments conducted by him revealed that certain Yoga postures also help keep blood pressure under control. It also helps maintain a healthy body mass index by reducing obesity and the waist circumference. ""Yoga reduces the severity of diabetes symptoms, slows down disease progression, and reduces the chances of complications. Then, of course, there is stress, which increases the secretion of glucagon, a hormone responsible for increasing blood glucose levels. Consistent practice of Yoga and Pranayam , along with a few minutes of meditation every day, can effectively bust stress,"" said Dr Ashwini.She said a sustained lifestyle change can go a long way in keeping diabetes and other chronic health diseases under check. ""An app has been developed for constant monitoring of diabetes and better compliance,"" she added."

The restrictive regime invoked through such acts and rules has also discouraged private investment in large scale storage and marketing, it was felt during the confabulation Mishra had with other stakeholders from ministries of finance and agriculture.The centre believes that the government should exit and leave it to private players to operate and manage this side of the agri sector. At best, the government may formulate rules of the game for market players, sources said.Among the long term reforms the government intends to initiate is removal of restriction on future trading in agri commodities. And short term goals are liberalising contract farming, allowing direct sale by producers to wholesale buyers, industries and exporters, take fruits and vegetables out of the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) act and adopt model land lease law."

It has roped in commercial and nationalised banks in 16 districts where the co-operative banks are less likely to give loans.In a review meeting held by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday, the government identified five commercial, private and nationalised banks for disbursing crop loans. Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra and IDBI are three of the five banks the state has roped in.Crop loans needs to be extended to farmers in 16 districts, including Nandurbar, Nashik, Yavatmal, Wardha, Beed and Jalna. It is about Rs 540 crore. Since cooperative banks in these districts are financially weak, we decided to take help of commercial banks. Funds provided by them will bridge the gap between the requirement and the capacity of the district cooperative banks, said an officer from the cooperative department.Fadnavis has also directed officials from agriculture and cooperative departments to organise farmers meet to facilitate crop loans for the upcoming kharif season. He also reviewed schemes for cold storage and marketing chains for the effective marketing of farm products.He also took stock of the policy under consideration to acquire sugar factories that have been liquidated instead of selling them in the open market. The state is considering acquisition of such sugar factories and then allotting them to cooperative societies on lease."

It was also reported that plastic rice was sold under the government sponsored Anna Bhagya scheme.The poor are scared to purchase rice. There could be serious health hazards if plastic edible items are being sold and consumed. The government must investigate into these incidents and explain the factual position, the BJP leader said.Joining the issue, his party colleague C T Ravi said it was reported that a ration shop in Sriramapura in Gangavati had sold plastic rice.Is the government itself supplying the adulterated food items? Is there any truth in such reports or are they just rumours? he asked.Replying to them, Ramesh Kumar said, I wonder why would anyone come out with plastic egg or rice as manufacturing them would be a costly affair. Is it possible to adulterate the items as reported in the media? We have to find out scientifically about it. I wanted to pay surprise visits to certain shops but could not. We will hold an enquiry and then make a statement by Monday.However, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader argued that there is no adulteration as reported.It is the Food Corporation of India which is supplying rice under the Anna Bhagya scheme. Let us not confuse people and create psychological fear, he said. BJP members countered him by asking whether he was making the statement based on laboratory test reports. The minister did not offer any reply."

Last summer, an aeon ago, this was a town of water queues kept in order by the instrument of Section 144.As water scarcities go, it had been an extraordinary one. An entire train had been commandeered to ply water to these parts, 108 trips by what came to be called the Latur Water Special, each time carrying 25.95 lakh litres to three lakh people in the parched district. The train had opened up possibilities: yes indeed why cant water be carried to deserts?At dawn this summer, the town had gone back to being sleepy. The 360 water tankers that had rumbled about then have now been whittled down to six, operating only to uphill villages where the basalt bedrock allows no percolation to the water table beneath.It could even be claimed as some sort of an achievement, as I was later to be told by the new collector and municipal commissioner of Latur, Sreekanth Sajjan. This year we started using water tankers only in the third week of May, he said.The miracle occurred over a week in mid September last year. A downpour not seen in all of the monsoon months ensured that the annual precipitation figure soared to a record 1110.92 mm, against the 10-year average of 802.13 mm. It had dipped to 413.48 mm in the year of the Latur Water Special. It was some manna from heaven. The Manjara dam filled up and remains substantially turgid today. Ground water levels recorded an average of 1 m rise.Predicatly, Latur was a happy place this summer, the opposite of what they had been in 2016  all for the grace of one burst of the clouds. Anasuya Podare remembers the torrid months last year. She and her husband had moved to Latur after a tiff with their children and took up a servitors jobs at the local Mahalakshmi temple. The 65-year-old woman used to spent three to four hours in queues for one pot of water last year. Now she walks a few metres to the tap and fills up as much as she needs.""I have no count of the money I spent last season to buy water, she says.But here in Marathwada, water shortage is an unforgettable mistress. It indulges you for no more than one season. Even in this summer of unanticipated surplus, there are localities in Latur that are served water once in eight days, plausibly because one of the nine water tanks in the city has gone on the blink.But even in those localities, this years privations are leavened by the experience of last year. Anita Patil, a resident of water-short Revenue Colony, told me she still has to buy water. But its not as bad as last year, whe she had had to spend Rs 3000 per month all of 2016.New to the job, collector Sajjan has to wrestle with the detritus of last years disaster, mainly illegal bore wells that had sprouted in the frenzy of near-famine conditions. ""Illegal bore wells and lack of awareness among people are some of the reasons why we are unable to check water wastage, he said.During the high fever of 2016, bore wells had been dug by the hundreds. While no one kept count of the exact number of illegal ones, at least 2000 bore wells were dug in the town, some as deep as 700-800 feet. The groundwater departments rules prescribe a dainty five per square km.As anyone familiar with the hydrography of Marathwada knows, drought is never far away in Latur. Even in this frolicsome summer, you only have to step out of town to meet it. About 11 km east of Latur, in Bhatkeda village, a habitation of 600 families where one branch of the Manjara flows by, there is not a drop of water to drink.After the downpour of September, water had to be released from the Manjara dam and it flooded the village. By January, barely four months later, the Manjara had dried up as always. Marginal farmer Baba Shiekh said, Theres water in this stream for four months a year. The rest of the year, its dry.A 60-year-old farmer, Madhukar Gurame said hes not fooled by the surplus of September 2016. He had never been able to fully irrigate his 14 acres for 15 years. He dug 15 bore wells during that time, some as deep as 650 ft.A SUGARCANE ADDICTIONLatur knows its been lucky. Knowing droughts frequent visitations, the state government launched what it called the Jalyukt-Shivar Abhiyaan (JYS) in 2014 with the bold aim of making the district drought-free by 2019. Some 13 different water conservation schemes were announced, involving broadening and deepening of river beds, afforestation, watershed management, rain water harvesting mechanisms, the works.However, local conservaton experts Pradeep Purandare, a retired prof at the Water and Land Management Institute in Aurangabad, are sure they are missing the point as usual. They are digging up river beds, he complained. A river is a discharge zone, not a recharge zone. They need to check the hydrography of the place and study the aquifer status, where it allows filtration and penetration of ground water. All thats not being done.Typical of the thrashing about that a disaster always produces in India, none of the water conservation schemes is being implemented in a scientific manner, Prof Purandare said. There is too much of widening and deepening of nalas and then are no watershed development systems in place either.And then there is the local farmers obsession with water-guzzling sugarcane. Take Kendriya Veerendra Sambhaji Rao, a 49-year-old farmer who owns 20 acres in a village called Patoda, 80 km from Latur. After three years of drought had parched his land and drained his pockets, he still stuck with sugarcane. After that copious September, he sowed 10 acres of sugarcane and 10 acres of soya bean and toor dal. I earn a minimum of Rs 9 lakh from sugarcane, and less than Rs 2 lakh from any of the other crops. There are three sugarcane factories in this taluka and it is a lucrative option for me, he said. So why not?But Prof Purandare has a quarrel with that. Sugarcane is the main reason for the water scarcity endemic in Latur -- bar the odd lucky year. Of the 10 river basins that fall in Marathwada, seven are in deficit with available water less than 3000 cubic metres per hectare. The forest area is only 4 per cent. There are 11 major irrigation projects and all of them have water in a good year. But sugarcane plantations guzzle it all up, he says.In fact, when the Manjara project was designed, it had been mandated that only 3 per cent of the water should be used for sugarcane. Now the actual usage is more like 77 per cent.The government does not want to address this issue. Instead, it comes up with ideas like JYS which would only make it worse, he said.STILL SLOW TO ADOPT RWHLatur is no stranger to the idea of rain water harvesting (RWH). Activist Amol Ravindra Gowande has been advocating it for 15 years. In all of that time, only about 5000 people set up systems on their rooftops. But after last year's drought, 5000 chastened households rushed to sign up. So today, only 10,000 of the one lakh properties in Latur have RWH in place.For a drought-prone city, theres no good reason why the number should be so low. Oil merchant Mohan Pardesi is one of the few converts to RWH. His rooftop mechanism protected him from the Big Dry of 2016, generating 3000 litres of water per day even in the dreadful summer.""We set this up in 2003 with an investment of Rs 6000. I harvest one lakh litres from the 2000 sq feet terrace every year. My bore well has not gone dry for 15 years,"" he said. It takes care of his household and the small-scale oil extraction industry he runs.And his 200 ft bore well yielded enough to let him be charitable last summer. He shared 4000 litres of water with his neighbours.Prof Purandare is skeptical that latur has come to its senses. It is hard to believe that after years of slacking, the people of Latur have woken up to reality, he says."

There is no end to the problems we face. We will also join the fight,"" said Rakesh Tikait, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.His views have been echoed by leaders of other farmers' groups.Another faction of the BKU submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister to the Lucknow district magistrate on Wednesday, demanding an FIR against officers responsible for the ""unfortunate police firing"" in Mandasur and a CBI probe.They have threatened to stop supply of milk and vegetables from their villages to cities from Sunday if their demands were not met, BKU spokesman Alok Verma told PTI.The national president of the Rashtriya Kisaan Manch, Shekhar Dixit, said the Yogi Adityanath government must address the basic problems of farmers at the earliest or prepare to face a ""Mandsaur-like situation"" in the state.Taking a dig at the crop loan waiver scheme announced by Adityanath at his first cabinet meeting, he said the basic issue is of minimum support price that most farmers are unable to get.""If the Uttar Pradesh government is really serious about addressing the problems and plight of the farmers, then it must start resolving their problems lest a Mandsaur-like situation grips the state and unrest fans out,"" he told PTI.During the 2017 election campaign, the BJP had promised that if it came to power in UP, sugarcane dues to farmers owed by mills would be paid quickly. But, farmers say they are yet to get back their dues.Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said that till date Rs 22,190 crore payment has been made and Rs 3,196 crore were yet to be cleared.""In future, payment will be made to farmers within 14 days of the commencement of the crushing season,"" UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.Cane farmers have often complained about how mills harass them.""The mills have subsidiary businesses like distilleries. They divert profits from mills to other subsidiaries and claim losses. Sometimes we are paid in sugar, not cash,"" said Sheeshpal Rathi, a Muzaffarnagar cane farmer.Potato farmers have had to dump their produce on the streets because of the losses they faced due to bumper crops and low prices.The UP government announced on April 11 that it would buy one lakh tonnes of potatoes at Rs 487 per 100 kg.""The price did not cover cost of production. Then they bought only 1,000 tonnes. There were not enough procurement centres and too many criteria like size and shape,"" said Raj Kumar Sangwan, organising secretary of the Rashtriya Lok Dal.Low farm income is the common issue troubling farmers across the country.The MSP of wheat in 2014-15 was Rs 1,400 per quintal, and increased to Rs 1,525 for 2016-17.""There has been negligible increase in income of farmers. While all products have a maximum retail price, for farmers the government is always discussing only a minimum price,"" said Pushpendra Singh, president of the Kisan Shakti Sangh.The already dismal scenario has been worsened by the impact of cow protection vigilantes. A farmer would use cattle so long as they provided milk, and then sell them at markets to traders who would further give them for slaughter. Now, with cow protection vigilantes, the crackdown on abattoirs and the new law banning sale of cattle for slaughter, farmers are facing a severe crisis.""Earlier, a buffalo could be sold after its milching life to slaughter houses for anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 45,000, depending on the weight. Now, people are scared and many farmers are not taking the risk. Due to the new law, the price of cattle has fallen, while the cost of feeding them keeps rising,"" rued Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh have been protesting since June 1 demanding higher minimum support prices (MSP) for their produce including onions, arhar and moong.Their protest in Mandsaur district of western Madhya Pradesh turned violent, where five farmers were killed in police firing.The protests which began in Mandsaur spread to adjoining districts in no time and soon the issue acquired a political hue with opposition Congress calling a state-wide bandh in the BJP-ruled state.Samajwadi Party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav announced financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh for the kin of the deceased farmers in Mandsaur incident.Yadav took to Twitter saying, ""SP will offer financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to kin of deceased farmers.""Expressing grief over the death of ""innocent and unarmed"" farmers in Mandsaur, BSP chief Mayawati accused governments in various BJP-ruled states of adopting an oppressive attitude against the poor, labourers, farmers and other sections of the society.""The BSP, especially its Madhya Pradesh unit, supports the demands of the farmers.

The work began on Monday after repeated petitions and requests by farmers and residents of Tirupur, Pollachi, Karur and Coimbatore to desilt the dams as they were filled with slush, bringing down their water storage capacity.Engineers attached to the public works department (PWD) are handling the work. The water storage capacity of the both the dams is around 90ft each and 15ft has been now lost to slush, they said and added that they have been able to remove around 4,000 cubic metres of silt per day since Monday.""At the Thirumurthy dam site we have deployed nine earth movers and four mud movers,"" said the PWD engineer incharge at the site, Krishnan M. "" So, we are able to remove around 4,000 cubic metres of slush a day,"" he added.A source said the desilting of the dam would take place in three phases and only phase one has been sanctioned for now. ""In Thirumurthy dam, we have to remove 33,000 cubic metres of silt in the first phase. ""Given the pace at which the work is progressing now, the target will be achieved in a fortnight,"" Krishnan said. The second phase of the desilting would be taken up soon if the south-west monsoon gets delayed, he added.Farmers had in their petitions pointed out that almost 3.77 lakh hectares of farmland spread across the four neighbouring districts was dependent on the Amaravathy and Thirumurthy dams for irrigation. Farmers said they used to enjoy three cultivation cycles a year.""Many farmers used to cultivate long term crops such as sugarcane, paddy and coconut. The dams also supply to at least 15 joint water supply schemes in various villages and blocks,"" said a Tirupur collectorate official.""After water levels in the reservoirs dropped, we have been finding it difficult to take up cultivation even once a year. Some villages also faced potable water crisis,"" the farmers had said in their petition.Asked about the reason for such huge quantity of slush in the dams, officials said the reservoirs get water from streams originating from the mountains during the monsoon. The water brings with it soil, wood and stones. The slush has over a period of time reduced the water storage capacity of the dams, they added.Pollachi MP Mahendran would inspect the desilting works at the dams on Friday."

It means the total revenue expenditure is less than the total revenue receipts for the current financial year, according to an official note.The estimated revenue receipt for the year 2017-18 is 31,593 crore while the estimated tax revenue is 20893.76 crore. The total expenditure is expected to be around 39,957.79 crore.Zero tolerance towards corruption is the stated objective of our government and all the policies will be implemented with regards to that only, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on his governments first budget.Highlighting key points of the budget document, CM said, We shall be implementing an e-file tracking (system) to expedite the work and (a) CM Dashboard (will be set up) to coordinate the work of all the government departments.The CM Dashboard would be set up so that the Chief Ministers Office (CMO) has the gist of all important information pertaining to all departments from time to time, which would help in monitoring the latters functioning.Rawat, who has already started a campaign to promote reverse migration, said that new hostel-based schools will be set up in hills to check migration. Power for all, road to every village, and housing for all will be thrust areas, he added.We shall also promote industries working in the field of 3Ts i.e. Science Technology, Bio Technology and Information Technology, the chief minister tweeted. The government will also promote run of the river power projects and will also try to revive all stalled power project in the state.A budgetary provision has been made to ensure that residents of all villages could be trained by the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) so that they can tackle disasters of any kind.Ex-CM sits on token fastCongress veteran and former chief minister Harish Rawat along with his supporters observed a token fast about one kilometre from the Vidhan Sabha to protest against the BJP governments decision not to hold its budget session at Gairsain. Rawat couldnt observe his token fast outside the assembly building due to the massive security arrangements in place.The erstwhile Congress government had passed a resolution at Gairsain last year that the budget session would be held in the hill town.The opposition party alleged that the BJP government failed to address the needs for employment and that there was no provision or plan to check migration from the hills.In a statement,senior Congress leaders Pritam Singh and Indira Hridayesh said the budget was disappointing for the common man.The states urgent needs are employment and means to check migration from hill areas, but the state governments first budget doesnt have any provision for the same. Farmers and workers are completely neglected in this budget. The government has not taken any step to arrest unemployment among the youth, Singh said.The Congress state president said the BJP had promised to pay the dues of sugarcane farmers within 15 days of coming to power but it failed to keep its promise.This budget is a disappointment for the people of Uttarakhand. The government has not given any thing to the poor and downtrodden section. Social welfare schemes are neglected while the youth is left high and dry. They talk about start ups but their budgets doesnt speak about it. The government has betrayed the people despite the landslide victory they gave it, Hridayesh said."

But as soon as the sun sets, and the food is served, everyone is smiling and chatty. Eyes suddenly light up with gratitude and glee. You can hear some banter on one table and a child screaming with joy on the other.However, even if you arent fasting, rest assured that the lip-smacking food found in the hidden pockets of this area, abuzz with restaurants dishing out their signature preparations, will make your mouth water. Heres a glimpse of what to expect on your Iftar trail.Shami Kebab and Chicken HakimiNoor Mohammadi, Bhendi BazaarBhendi Bazaar is a busy nightspot through the year. Its especially busy during Ramzan. And the largest crowd is usually gathered at Noor Mohammadi, waiting to break their fast with falooda, fruits and some lip-smacking Shami Kebab (Rs 20). Made with minced chicken, chana dal and spices, the kebab is hand-pound to a texture so soft that it is hard to lift them without having them fall apart. Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies. While each of the gravies can be had by itself, a dish called the Bhel (Rs 150), which combines all the different gravies, is also served here. The ensuing gravy is a union of mutton, dal and garam masalas.Aab GoshtCafe Nizari, Bhendi BazarDunk some pillowy and slightly sour pav (Rs 7) into a bowlful of rich fiery mutton stew (Rs 70) primarily prepared with gram lentil, tomatoes and onions.Baida RotiMastan Talao, Nagdevi StreetA meal in itself, the Baida Roti (Rs 100) found at Nagdevi Street, is an Iftar must-have. A thick layer of minced keema or chicken is sandwiched between two hot and fluffy flour-based rotis that are coated with egg.Chicken TandooriTawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Nagdevi StreetThe Chicken Tandoori (Rs 110) served at the buzzy stall located on Nagpada Street is another local legend. Juicy and tender pieces are coated with a marination of your choice. The three varieties of tandoori are chicken malai (marinated in creamy yoghurt, ginger, garlic and chilli), hariyali (coated with a paste of coriander, mint leaves, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) and the regular chicken tikka masala.Reshmi Special MalpuaBadri Mithai, Nagdevi StreetWatching Reshmi Special Malpua (Rs160) being made is almost hypnotic. Batches of dough, prepared with maida, sugar, saffron, milk, cardamom, semolina, etc., are dipped in a vessel of hot oil and fried till the outsides of the dough turn golden brown and crisp. The resultant is a steaming hot pancake that leaves you with a saccharine aftertaste the entire night.

We will seek legal opinion on how the cases can be withdrawn and we will get it approved in the Cabinet and issue an order, he said.The last two years itself have seen several agitations by farmers, whether for sugar factories not having paid dues, or against a Supreme Court judgment over Cauvery water sharing. Several cases were also filed during the riots during protests on the sharing of Mahadayi waters, with protests in Nargund and Navalgund in Dharwad district being particularly severe.As monsoons have shown a promising note by arriving on the expected date, a bountiful year along with dropped cases against the farmers is expected to put them in a more forgiving mood towards the Congress.Recently, Parameshwara in reply to a query raised by Nagamangala MLA Cheluvarayaswamy N in the Assembly, replied that 61 cases had been registered against farmers in Mandya district for protests and road blocks put up between June 6 and 24, 2016. While seven cases had been closed, 54 complaints were still being pursued with cases filed against 1,026 people.Parameshwara had also announced that the government was taking steps to withdraw these cases and had sought a legal opinion on how to go about it. The previous legislative sessions had been marked with demands by the Opposition demanding that the cases be withdrawn.Siddu takes legislators to taskChief Minister Siddaramaiah has directed all Congress legislators to go back to their constituencies after the Assembly sessions are completed and focus on shoring up support from people.Addressing the Congress Legislature Party meeting here on Friday morning, Siddaramaiah said that with ten months remaining for the assembly elections, legislators must try to address the problems in their constituencies. He reiterated that the state would waive farm loans taken from state cooperative banks, if the Centre waived loans from nationalised banks. He said that 22 per cent of the loans had been taken from state cooperative banks, while the rest were from nationalised banks.Over poor attendance in both the Assembly and Council, he said, The Opposition is constantly berating us saying our front row is empty. If the Ministers cannot answer the queries, then how can other legislators do it?, he warned."

Shettar said the government should test these items at the earliest and allay peoples fears, if it reports on it being plastic were not true.Ramesh Kumar said, I can understand about adulteration. But I am hearing about plastic for the first time. It is too costly to do such a thing, so I dont know why anyone would do it, he said.

This recently launched eatery is the equivalent of your friendly neighbourhood caf, and food here is just simple, but full of flavour.With a bar on the roof overlooking Ulsoor Lake, this also makes for the perfect setting to grab a few drinks with your friends on a rainy evening in Bengaluru.Just like any other caf, the pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and pastas are your best bet here. We especially loved the Goan Sausage Pizza, which comes with a thin, crunchy base and is loaded with meat. The Pork Belly Panini and the Grilled Tenderloin Burger are sure to get your hands messy, but are packed and will fill you up in no time.If burgers and pizzas are not your speed, try the Spaghetti with Prawns, Sundried Tomatoes and Fennel - it comes with a light parmesan broth, and the prawns are large, juicy and cooked just right. For the die-hard meat lovers, the Tenderloin Medallions with Mashed Potatoes is an excellent option - big on both size and taste. Handed to you with a rich pepper sauce, this dish goes perfectly with their Baby Spinach and Watermelon Salad or the Quinoa Salad which are light and refreshing.For desserts, do make sure to check out the counter to see what theyre offering that day. Their Lemon Meringue Pie and Eton Musk Sundae are great ways to end your meal.For those with an inkling towards all things chocolate, the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Pie and Cookie Dough Skillet are good options. We particularly enjoyed the Coconut Tres Leches, a light, fluffy dessert that isnt too high on sugar content.While the cocktails are mainly your run-of-the-mill sangrias and mojitos, there were two on the menu that really stood out for us. The Smooth Talker, with whiskey and cinnamon as the main ingredients, tastes like a comforting, alcoholic apple pie that your mom bakes for you when youre feeling low. The Mr Felix is another cocktail worth trying if youre in the mood for something fresh and citrus-y, as its bursting with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf flavours.However, with crowd-pullers like Tao Terraces and Yauatcha on the same floor, its hard to tell if Caf Felix will be able to match their popularity in the months to come."

The number one position held by the NCP has gone to BJP, which rose from the fourth rank taking its numbers from 165 seats to 400 seats.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has made huge electoral losses across 25 zilla parishads with its overall tally showing a decline from 511 to 346 seats. The number one position held by the NCP has gone to BJP, which rose from the fourth rank taking its numbers from 165 seats to 400 seats. Even in western Maharashtra, the NCPs bastion, it may have retained its lead in zilla parishad, but its seats declined from 195 to 154 across the sugar belt of Ahmednagar, Sangli, Satara, Pune, Kolhapur and Solapur. The biggest gain in the sugar belt has been recorded by the BJP, which increased its number of seats seven times from 10 to 75.In 2012, the total seats of the BJP in these six zilla parishads was only 10. In Sangli, Satara and Solapur it had not won any in the last elections. The state senior NCP leadership told The Indian Express that it will review the poll results to ascertain where it went wrong and what were the factors that worked against the party.However, several leaders spoken to argued that despite a decline in the overall number of seats, at least in 10 to 12 zilla parishads the NCP along with Congress will be in a position to take reins of the zilla parishad to keep the BJP and Shiv Sena out of power. The NCP has established a clear lead in Parbhani, Beed, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur. But the biggest setback was in Sangli where it gave way to BJP as the leading party.Watch What Else Is Making NewsWhile taking the loss for the party in stride, NCP (MP) and leader Supriya Sule said, We humbly accept the verdict of the people. We will surely introspect and rebuild our base.The critical factors which appear to have worked against the NCP, which is grappling with its image makeover since the 2014 assembly elections, include the partys failure to tackle the in-house unrest and political aspirations of the sugar barons, who are ready to switch sides for assured political future. In the recent elections, powerful local NCP leaders in several districts in western Maharashtra switched from the parent party and formed independent outfits under the banner of Vikas Aghadi (Development Alliance), uniting local groups including the BJP to challenge the Pawars.In Pandharpur, former NCP leader Prashant Paricharak formed the Pandharpur-Mangalvedha Vikas Aghadi, giving the BJP an edge. In Barsi taluka, former NCP (MLA) Rajendra Raut along with the partys district general secretary Arun Kapase crossed over to the BJP to make a dent in the NCPs power. At Madha, former NCP leader Sanjay (Mama) Shinde joined hands with the BJP to forge an alliance  Vikas Aghadi  to fight the NCP. His brother Baban Shinde is the sitting NCP (MLA).At Satara, NCP (MP) Udayan Raje Bhosale had challenged parent party through Satara Vikas Aghadi. Although the dissidents worked in varying measures, it did dent the NCP. In the 2012 elections, the BJP tally across Pune, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur was as low as 10 seats out of 416 in western Maharashtra. The NCP with 195 seats took the lead followed by Congress with 132 seats, Shiv Sena with 24 seats, MNS with nine seats and others at 41 seats.The BJPs hold had always remained weak in western Maharashtra compared to Vidarbha, North Maharashtra and parts of Marathwada.

But till now, we havent got any clear answers on our demands. So we are restarting the protests, and are hopeful that our chief minister will not let us down this time, said Ayyakannu.The protest attracted many youngsters who claimed to have taken part in jallikattu protests on the Marina Beach, and minor outfits who reached Chepauk to extend support.Though they were given permission for only an hour in the morning, the farmers, mostly from the Cauvery delta, continued till late evening.They refused to heed the police demand to move to a nearby building. Finally, a police team, led by Joint Commissioner (East Zone) S Manoharan, left the place while the farmers continued their protest.Farmers have been demanding the formation of the Cauvery Management Board for sharing the Cauvery river water impartially. They have also sought farm loan waiver and drought relief package in addition to compensation for crop failures and clearance of arrears in minimum support prices of sugarcane yield for about Rs 8,450 crore.Other demands include investigations into the misuse of authority in regulation markets in delta districts and dropping plans to extract hydrocarbon at Neduvasal village in Pudukkottai.The agitation that took place in Delhi in March and April saw these farmers eating snake and rat meat, running naked on the road near the Prime Ministers office, tonsuring their heads and even drinking urine. Such unorthodox protests managed to grab attention, including that of political leaders across the country.They finally withdrew their protests after a gruelling 40 days, as Palaniswami requested them to withdraw it and assured to convey their concerns and demands to Prime Minister Narendra Modi."

But what if you get to know that by avoiding some kinds of food, you could reduce the chances of getting the disease? We often tend to ignore the nutritional aspects of the food, but for a healthy body, this practice is inevitable.According to the World Health Organization, the biggest epidemic of our time is the product of, not a virus that has run amok, but our changing lifestyles.According to the American Cancer Society, up to 35 percent of all cancers may be caused due to inappropriate diet, and risk of developing certain types of cancer can be reduced by changing eating habits.By 2030, we will have globally 26.4 million patients with cancer every year. Lifestyle habits like occupation, habits, diet, genetic, hygiene, stress are the ones leading to cancer.There are various chemical components added to foods that are carcinogenic. Some of these harmful processes, adding of chemicals and alteration of genetics, are done in the growing stage of crops, fruits and vegetables.A lifestyle change is keyHaving a balanced and healthy diet helps a person stay healthy and prevent cancer. Exercise regularly and keep fit.No single food or food component can protect you against cancer by itself. But strong evidence does show that a diet filled with a variety of plant foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans helps lower risk for many cancers.Laboratory studies, many individual minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals demonstrate anti-cancer effects. Yet evidence suggests it is the synergy of compounds working together in the overall diet that offers the strongest cancer protection.AICR research finds that excess body fat increases the risk of 11 cancers. Vegetables and fruits are relatively low in calories. Whole grains and beans are rich in fiber, which also can help with weight management. That is one reason AICR recommends filling at least 2/3 of your plate with plant foods. Research on foods that fight cancer  and that may also aid cancer survival  is ongoing and active.The various lifestyle changes that we are adopting that includes decreased physical activity ,unhealthy food  leading to obesity, tobacco use, excess of carbonated drinks, alcohol excess all contribute to increasing a persons chance of being prone to cancer. The lifestyle changes can also produce mental stress which is known to depress the immune system and make the body vulnerable to various diseases including cancer.So make a wise choice and lead a healhy life.Some foods that can cause cancerGenetically modified organisms (GMOs)These foods have been modified and grown using chemicals. Consuming this food can lead to damaged immune systems, pre-cancerous cell growths, along with shrinking brains and livers.Canned GoodsA buyer must ensure that the cans they pick in the supermarket is labelled BPA free. Its likely to contain bisphenol-A (BPA). Laboratory studies in cells of animals have linked BPA to cancer, infertility, diabetes, and obesity.Microwave PopcornThe bags used to pack microwave popcorn are creased with perfluoroalkyls, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluoro octane sulfonate (PFOS). This is done to prevent the bag from soaking the oil. According to research, it has been observed that PFOA has been associated with tumours in animal organs (liver, pancreas, testicles and mammary glands in rats). Increased number of prostate cancer has been observed in PFOA plant workers.Refined SugarCancer cells thrive on sugar. Researchers have found relations between sugar and health issues such as unhealthy levels of blood fats, low HDL levels, heart disease, higher blood triglyceride levels, obesity, weak immune, arthritis, cancer, etc.Farmed FishFarmed fish contain higher levels of chemical pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls, as compared to wild fish.Tobacco usageSmoking/chewing tobacco can cause cancer. Annually, there are 6,30,000 premature deaths due to tobacco use. Tobacco usage can cause lip, oral cavity, pharynx,larynx, trachea, bronchus and lung cancer.AlcoholWorld Health Organization concluded that excessive alcohol use is the main cause of heart diseases and various types of cancers.Soda and Carbonated BeveragesSoft drinks contain high fructose corn syrup, sugar, dyes, brominated vegetable oil (a flame retardant), and aspartame, which has been linked to an increased risk of cancer.Processed meatsCured meats tend to be high in nitrites and nitrates, preservatives which, if consumed in large amounts, can potentially increase risk of stomach and other cancers. Some foods preserved with high concentrations of salt also are carcinogenic. Improperly stored food grains can get infected with fungus that produce toxins that can cause cancer.Associate professor, medical oncology, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru"

Global wheat production is expected to decline 2.2 percent after a record harvest last year."

(Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav) CM Yogi Adityanath arrives at Lucknows Lok Bhawan to chair the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)THE STATE Cabinet on Tuesday decided to allow central audit agencies such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to audit development authorities in the state, which included the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). The previous Akhilesh government had denied permission to the CAG to audit GDA.In the second Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the government decided that if the CAG seeks permission to audit any development authority in UP, the government will not object, Minister Sidharth Nath Singh said.Additional Chief secretary (Housing and Urban Planning) Sadakant said that in all, 29 authorities had been set up under the UP Urban Planning and Development Act, which provides for the audit of these authorities. A state government agency, Sthaniya Nidhi Lekha Pariksha in Allahabad, also audits these development authorities and its report is presented in the state Assembly, he told mediapersons.The CAG had requested the state government to audit some authorities Their communication was especially regarding Ghaziabad but then the (previous) state government had the view not to grant permission because UP has its own system of audit. The Governor too had intervened and had written letters in this connection. Last year, Governor Ram Naik had written to the PM and the President about denial of permission to CAG by the UP government for conducting audit of Ghaziabad Development Authority, said Sadakant.The Cabinet on Tuesday decided that if CAG requests for audit, the state government should not have any objection. I have issued the order that like Ghaziabad, CAG can audit anywhere it wants to, he added.The Cabinet, meanwhile, also decided that consumers will have to pay only the principal amount of their electricity bills, as surcharge would be waived for domestic and commercial consumers belonging to lower and middle classes. Small scale industries, both in urban and rural areas, would also be able to avail the same benefit.Moreover, farmers could now pay electricity bills in four installments in a year, if the amount is above Rs 10,000, Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma said.He added that during summer, the government will ensure that villages get power for 18 hours, tehsil headquarters and Bundelkhand area for 20 hours each and district headquarters for 24 hours. An official said power supply during evenings will be ensured in villages from April 6 and the state was purchasing electricity worth several crores every day.The previous governments too had decided to roster power supply for villages, tehsil and district headquarters but the decisions were not implemented at ground level Poor villagers are VIPs for the current government thus, the state government has decided that any laxity in implementation of the roster at the ground level will not be tolerated and action would be taken against officials responsible, said Sharma.Admitting that rural areas were not getting power at night, Sharma said the government was working to ensure 24-hour power supply in villages by October, 2018. He added that defective or burnt transformers of tubewells will be replaced within 48 hours in rural areas.Other Decisions* To sign a pact with the Centre under Power for All mission. The pact, to be signed on April 14, will help in supplying power to every village before 2019.* Purchase one lakh metric tonnes of potato from farmers in the current crop season to ensure that they at least recover their production cost.

A name that 42-year-old Raju practically worships everyday. For it was late Bejan Fisher who, 30 years ago, had seen a spark in Raju even as he swept hotel floors and slept in the staff room at a Camp-based restaurant.My mother passed away and my father had remarried. He did not pay attention to me and my sister. She was packed off to my grandmothers home and I started working at a camp-based hotel at the age of six. I studied till Class VI at St. Vincents night school, but it became difficult to continue and hence I started working full time at several hotels. It was during this time that Sir Bejan Fisher, who had just launched the first gym at Camp, felt that I had the potential to become a body builder, recalled Sherigara.Between 1993 and 1997, Fisher trained Sherigara, who was 14 years old at the time. Soon, this young man bagged the Pune Shree body-building title three times in a row. Fishers death in 1997 came as a big blow for Sherigara, who then worked as a chef at various hotels. It was in 2005 that I decided to go back to the sport Sir Fisher had trained me for. He soon won the Pune Shree title at the age of 30 and then started working as a body-building coach at various gyms.At least five of his protgs have won several titles in body-building, including Pune Shree and Mr India (Junior).One of his students, Zubair Shaikh, recently won the Pune Shree title at a body-building event organised by the Pune district at Karvenagar.Raju Sir has immense experience and training, which helped me greatly, he said.Among other students, who had won titles just a month ago include, Krishna Kadam (Mr India Junior: fourth place), Manish Ahir in 75 kg category also bagged fourth place in Mr India- Junior, while Sachin Chopde got the fourth rank in Mr India Senior.Even as Sherigara preps his students for further events, this chef-turned-bodybuilder is now aiming for the Satish Sugar All-India Classic competition  a much-awaited and tough competition for bodybuilders  to be held in December, Karnataka.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Right) Express report on the advisory on March 22, 2017. Express Photo: Abhinav SahaTwo days after The Indian Express reported about the advisory issued by the AAP government, bringing in changes to the guidelines related to free medical treatment for economically weaker sections (EWS), the government has issued a new advisory asking hospitals to follow the old guidelines. Private hospitals have been asked to accept income certificates and to link eligibility of treatment to the prevailing minimum wages.In the advisory issued on March 22, the Directorate General of the Health Services (DGHS) directed private hospitals to avoid accepting income certificates furnished by EWS patients to avail of free medical treatment, as directed by the Delhi High Court in 2007. The government has now told hospitals to stick to the guidelines issued in 2011 and accept all categories of NFS cards to admit patients on free beds as per the Delhi High Court order.According to sources, a senior official of the health ministry has told private hospitals that even if the EWS patient does not have a BPL (presently NFSC) or an income certificate, the patient can avail free treatment on the basis of an undertaking. The official, sources said, has also directed hospitals to verify the genuineness of poverty of such patient within 48 hours of admission.However, the identified private hospital concerned must continue providing treatment to the patient during the interim period. Any default by the hospital is to be viewed seriously, the senior official said.In the old advisory, the government had told hospitals to avoid accepting income certificate as far as possible as they are based on an affidavit filed by the individual and not on inquiry conducted by an SDM.The Indian Express had reported that as per the old advisory, only PR-S category (those who are entitled to 1kg of rice/member ; 6 kg sugar/card and 4 kg wheat/member) and those who have Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) (the poorest of poor) are the EWS families eligible for free treatment. The earlier order also did not mention linking eligibility of treatment to minimum wages, as mandated by the court. However, the fresh advisory clearly mentions that eligibility for free treatment under EWS category is linked to the minimum wages of an unskilled worker, and not just restricted to those living below poverty line.With the revised advisory, the PR category, who were earlier left out, can also avail the free treatment. PR category are those who are entitled to 1 kg of rice/member and 4 kg of wheat/member. All families, whose monthly income is Rs 9,568 (minimum wages in Delhi), will also be directly eligible for free treatment.The old advisory had created confusion, with complaints pouring in of patients being sent back for not having the NFS card.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Express Archive An EWS patient at a private hospital in Delhi. Express ArchiveTHE AAP government has issued an advisory to private hospitals to avoid accepting income certificates furnished by the economically weaker section (EWS) to avail of free medical treatment as directed by the Delhi High Court in 2007.The move comes even as the Delhi government recently announced free medical tests for low income group residents of the city at 21 private laboratories and 30 surgeries free of cost at 41 private hospitals for patients referred by government hospitals.The Directorate General of the Health Services, in its advisory, has asked the nodal officers of private hospitals to avoid accepting income certificates, sources said. Under the rules framed by the Delhi government for free treatment for EWS patients  those patients who do not have proof of income such as BPL cards or income certificates can give undertaking regarding their income status and that is more than sufficient. However, a communication dated February 22 by the Directorate of Health Services, states that private hospitals should avoid accepting income certificate as far as possible since these are based on affidavit filed by the individual and not based on inquiry conducted by SDM on his side.In its defence, the department has said that complaints are pouring in that rich people have got free treatment based on income certificates. Under the EWS scheme, the Delhi High Court has directed to provide free treatment that is  10 per cent of total in-patient department beds and 25 per cent of out-patient department services. Incidentally, it was on February 22 that Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain had announced that residents of Delhi will be able to undergo medical tests such as MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography) and CT scan free of cost at 21 private laboratories across the city.Sources said the advisory issued by the government is in non-compliance with the Delhi High Court guidelines. The EWS patients fill the performa provided by the hospital, which is an income affidavit as prescribed by the court. If false details are furnished, it is contempt of court and recovery can be made. But one cannot avoid accepting income certificates, said Advocate Ashok Aggarwal, a member of monitoring committee for EWS treatment in Delhi.When EWS patients are rushed to emergency, in such situations, not every patient will have an income certificate. If hospitals cannot accept the affidavit, where will the poor patients go in cases of emergency? Aggarwal asked.Under the existing rules, the income levels are linked with minimum wages of unskilled labour. At present the minimum wage for unskilled labour stands at Rs 9,568 and the number will be revised to Rs 13,350 from April 1.However, the advisory states that only PR-S category (those who are entitled to 1kg of rice/member ; 6 kg sugar/card and 4 kg wheat/member) and those who have Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) (the poorest of poor) are the EWS families eligible for free treatment. The order, however, does not mention, the minimum wages as mandated by the court.The order is creating confusion. It has mentioned only two categories of people who are entitled under the food security act. While it does not exclude the eligibility under the minimum wages, its absence in the order, has led to private hospitals not accepting those patients who dont have national food security (NFS) cards, sources said.Aggarwal said, Yes, the order has created confusion and there is an increase in the number of complaints from private hospitals. It is unfortunate that many private hospitals are sending back patients because the advisory does not mention that free treatment is linked to minimum wages. As per existing norms, the eligibility is linked with minimum wages of unskilled labour.The ChangesWhat the old order states: EWS patients who do not have proof of income can give undertaking regarding their income status and that it is more than sufficient.What the new order states: Avoid accepting income certificates as far as possible, since they are not based on inquiry by SDM or DM.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/File) President Donald Trump, flanked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan. (AP Photo/File)President Donald Trump suffered a stunning political setback on Friday in a Congress controlled by his own party when Republican leaders pulled legislation to overhaul the US healthcare system, a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies. House of Representatives leaders yanked the bill after a rebellion by Republican moderates and the partys most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes, ensuring that Trumps first major legislative initiative since taking office on Jan. 20 ended in failure. Democrats were unified against it. House Republicans had planned a vote on the measure after Trump late on Thursday cut off negotiations with Republicans who had balked at the plan and issued an ultimatum to vote on Friday, win or lose. But desperate lobbying by the White House and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was unable to round up the 216 votes needed for passage.We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process, Trump told reporters at the White House, although he sought to shift the blame to the Democrats even though his party controls the White House, the House and the Senate. With Fridays legislative collapse, Democratic former President Barack Obamas signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act  known as Obamacare  remains in place despite seven years of Republican promises to dismantle it.The healthcare failure called into question not only Trumps ability to get other key parts of his agenda, including tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending, through Congress, but the Republican Partys capacity to govern effectively. Neither Trump nor Ryan indicated any plans to try to tackle healthcare legislation again anytime soon. Trump said he would turn his attention to getting big tax cuts through Congress, another tricky proposition.Republican supporters said the legislation would achieve their goal of rolling back the governments nanny state role in healthcare. The White House made undoing Obamacare its top priority when Trump took office two months ago. But the White House and House leaders were unable to come up with a plan that satisfied the clashing interests of moderates and conservatives, despite Trumps vaunted image as a deal maker.Amid a chaotic scramble for votes, Ryan, who championed the bill, met with Trump at the White House. Ryan said he recommended that it be withdrawn from the House floor because he did not have the votes to pass it, and Trump agreed.We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short, Trump said. With no Democrat support we couldnt quite get there.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the bill failed because of two traits that have plagued the Trump presidency since he took office: incompetence and broken promises. Democrats said the bill would take away medical insurance from millions of Americans and leave the more-than-$3 trillion U.S. healthcare system in disarray. And some moderate Republicans opposed the bill because of worries that millions of America would be hurt.There were things in this bill that I didnt particularly like, Trump added, without specifying what those were, but expressed confidence in Ryans leadership.Perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because well end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes, said Trump, who had posted multiple tweets throughout March proclaiming that Obamacare is imploding and repeatedly saying that Republicans were coming together to pass the bill.Fridays events cast doubt on whether Ryan can get major legislation approved by fractious Republican lawmakers.I will not sugarcoat this. This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard, Ryan said at a news conference, adding that his fellow Republicans are experiencing what he called growing pains transitioning from an opposition party to a governing party.Obamacares the law of the land, Ryan added. Were going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.A Little SurprisedMembers of the Freedom Caucus, the Houses most conservative members, were instrumental in the bills failure, opposing it among other reasons because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare. Trump said he was disappointed and a little surprised with the Freedom Caucus opposition. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the Republican legislation 14 million people would lose medical coverage by next year and more than 24 million would be uninsured in 2026.News that the bill had been pulled before a final vote was greeted initially with a small sigh of relief by U.S. equity investors, who earlier in the week had been fretful that an outright defeat would damage Trumps other priorities, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending.Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes ended the session mixed after rallying back from session lows following the news. The S&P 500 Index ended fractionally lower, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped about 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose about 0.2 percent.Shares of hospital operators finished sharply higher, with the S&P healthcare facilities index up 2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 healthcare sector edged down 0.03 percent. The dollar strengthened modestly on the news, and U.S. Treasury bond yields edged up from session lows.Trump said he would be totally open to working with Democrats on healthcare when they all become civilized. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said working to lower prescription drug prices was one area of possible cooperation with Republicans. Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher said before the bill was pulled that voting it down would be neutering Trump while empowering his opponents.You dont cut the balls off a bull and then expect that he can go out and get the job done, Rohrabacher told Reuters. This will emasculate Trump and we cant do that.  If we bring this down now, Trump will have lost all of his leverage to pass whatever bill it is, whether its the tax bill or whatever reforms that he wants.Representative Joe Barton of Texas, when asked why his fellow Republicans were so united over the past seven years to dump Obamacare only to fall apart when they actually do something about it, said, Sometimes youre playing fantasy football and sometimes youre in the real game.Obamacare boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law. The House plan would have rescinded a range of taxes created by Obamacare, ended a penalty on people who refuse to obtain health insurance, and ended Obamacares income-based subsidies to help people buy insurance while creating less-generous age-based tax creditsIt also would have ended Obamacares expansion of the Medicaid state-federal insurance program for the poor, cut future federal Medicaid funding and let states impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients. House leaders agreed to a series of last-minute changes to try to win over disgruntled conservatives, including ending the Obamacare requirement that insurers cover certain essential benefits such as maternity care, mental health services and prescription drug coverage.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI) Smith and Kohli had a few on-field confrontations in this series. (Source: PTI)In A backslapping chat with Glenn Maxwell recorded last year, Virat Kohli opens up about his friendly banters with Aussie players. Flashing a huge smile, Kohli uses sugary adjectives such as sweet and a wonderful human being for a few of them while Maxwell the interviewer grins. The chemistry between the two is striking. Maxwell proceeds to extol the virtues of the IPL in that it brings players from different countries together. It helps us to do what we are doing now (bonding), Kohli gives his two cents. You form perceptions without knowing people, and the IPL helps you lift those boundaries and you can be friends with people whom you play against as well. It makes people more fond of each other, and helps create strong bonds. (But) still people are competitive against each other.Maxwell chimes in: Correct. And thats the white line feveras soon as you cross that white line, you are still going hard at each other, but there is still that respect off the field as well. Revisiting that video on Tuesday left one with a strange feeling. It was like watching the mushy, romantic bits of a movie you know doesnt have a happy ending. For at the press conference after the Indian team won the bitterly fought series 2-1 on Tuesday, Virat Kohli made clear that his friendship with the Australian players, as a result of the bickering that marred the contests, was over. For good.No, it has changed, he replied curtly when an Australian journalist asked him if his pre-series statement that he was good friends with all these guys was still valid. I thought that was the case, but it has changed for sure. As I said, in the heat of the battle you want to be competitive but Ive been proven wrong.The thing I said before the first Test, that has certainly changed and you wont hear me say that ever again, Kohli added matter-of-factly. It had been that kind of a series. Intense. Too intense, perhaps. Words flew, as did abuses. Accusations were hurled and counter-accusations hurled back. The white line fever didnt remain confined to the white line and spilled over into the press conference room. In Bangalore, Kohli stopped short of calling Steve Smith a cheat. In Dharamsala, Smith was seen calling Murali Vijay a f**king cheat. The broadcaster fanned the shoulder controversy. The boards also jumped in. Something had to snap. While it has been good television, the mutual off-field bonhomie appeared to have been the victim.For some, Kohlis reaction seemed a bit over the top. Why does Virat Kohli always take it personally was the question on the lips of journalists from both sides [and there are, indeed, sides in the supposedly neutral press box]. It seemed even more not-statesmanlike as minutes before, in the previous press conference, Smith seemed to bury the hatchet with an apology. I have sort of been very intense in my own little bubble and at times I have let my emotions and actions just falter a little bit throughout this series and I apologise for that, said Smith. To be fair to Kohli, he wasnt aware of Smiths public statement. However, it doesnt mean Kohli wouldve accepted it and changed his stance. So why does he take it personally? Because thats Kohlis style: its never business for him and always personal.Perhaps that is why he is where he is. It was heartening to see Smith apologise, but because of that moral judgments shouldnt be passed on Kohli. The White Line Fever that Maxwell talks about is an Australian phrase. It essentially means be aggressive against your opponents on the field, but calm down and have a beer with them off it. But why should Kohli be judged by those Australian standards? Even the much-talked about Australian way is a stereotype. In the Dharamsala Test, a Maxwell shot hit Cheteshwar Pujara at short-leg. He profusely apologised to Pujara, his former Kings XI Punjab mate, and hugged him. There is no reason to believe that Kohlis approach, despite the air of permanence he sought to give at the presser, wont change. India and Australia fought an even more rancorous battle in 2008. They gradually made up. And, yes, IPL did help heal the scars.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
593c8de07be9e00e964d2e6d,"Direct transfer, 2 lakh sale points: Big fertiliser subsidy reform rollout in June",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/direct-transfer-2-lakh-sale-points-big-fertiliser-subsidy-reform-rollout-in-june-4581320/,2017-03-22,"The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593cb36f7be9e00e964d349a,One-year experiment from March: Nutritionist to bring Mumbai cops into shape,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/one-year-experiment-from-march-nutritionist-to-bring-mumbai-cops-into-shape-4545299/,2017-02-26,"Celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar Celebrity nutritionist Rujuta DiwekarCome March, the Mumbai police will begin a one-year experiment with celebrity nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar in a bid to whip the force into shape. The plan, which was started as a pilot in the western suburbs last October, focuses on helping the police cut down on obesity, acidity and insomnia.The state of the Mumbai Polices health came into the spotlight after commentator Shobha De tweeted a picture of Daulatram Jogawat, a police inspector in Madhya Pradesh, and captioned it heavy bandobast, in an attempted barb at the Mumbai Police. Jogawat, who suffers an insulin imbalance, has been offered medical help by doctors in Mumbai.Watch What Else Is making NewsBetween October and January 2017, Diwekar had personnel at eight police station located between Bandra and Andheri West in the polices Zone 9 fill out forms detailing their daily lives  the hours they spent commuting to and from work, the number of hours they work and sleep, and most crucially, the number of cups of tea they consume.The answers, not surprisingly, only underscored the stressful conditions that the police functions in. Policemen and women wrote back saying that their commute averages three hours, their sleep six hours, and work 14 hours.Diwekars team then attended morning parades at police stations to dispense one simple tip every day. The first month, we gave four tips on food, the month after four tips on exercise and last month, four tips on sleeping, said Diwekar, adding that she had to ensure that the tips were doable and impactful.The first month, Diwekar said, was spent dispelling myths and misinformation among the police about food. Bananas make for a great breakfast, but a lot of them believed that they are fattening. In fact, they are the best thing to eat during bandobast duty, she said.The oral tips were followed by a series of posters stuck to the walls in each police station, the first of which advised the police to switch to bananas for breakfast to get rid of headaches and improve stamina, while others advised a short break after lunch. The most important one though, advised the police to cut down on their tea consumption. There are so many better alternatives easily available. Sugarcane juice is very rejuvenating, she said. The police was advised to consume lemonade, kokum sharbat and coconut water instead.Overdoing tea and irregular meals, Diwekar said, was at the heart of police officers being racked with acidity. Diwekars food plan involves small meals spaced through the day, Id like them to eat two rotis in the morning and two for lunch. But with the unpredictable, what happens is that they skip lunch. By that time they are hungry and acidic. Then they eat a heavy dinner which results in the felling acidic and less sleep. By the time they wake up, they do not feel fresh. It was a cycle of eating one junk food after another, fasting and feasting, she said.Apart from advocating rotis, ghee and jaggery, Diwekar also recommended munching on peanuts in the evening to satiate hunger.Diwekars tips on food, exercise and sleep have been collected into a Marathi booklet which will be launched by Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar on March 8. A senior IPS official said that it is imperative that a culture of healthy food habits be introduced in the force.Where other initiatives by previous heads of the police force in the past decade have withered, Diwekar said that this time, it is simply a matter of persisting long enough to bring changes into practice.It is not that they dont want to bring changes in fitness and health, they just dont have the right information, she said.At the end of January, Diwekar had the police in zone 9 fill out exit surveys to gauge what impact the short programme made. Every police officer in zone 9 has started implementing at least one of the twelve tips. They look leaner, acidity levels are low and sleep is better and their energy levels are up, she said.However, a middle-aged police constable posted in Andheri said that it isnt always practically possible to implement Diwekars tips and not suited to changes in the routine work. This plan does not address the real issue, which is a shortage of manpower. The current food plan is well intentioned but cannot be successful unless the strength of the police force is increased and an eight-hour work day is introduced, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Britta Campion/Pool Photo via AP)Indonesian and Australian leaders on Sunday committed to free trade and closer naval cooperation as they urged countries in the Asia Pacific region with competing territorial claims to obey international law. Indonesian President Joko Jokowi Widodo arrived in Sydney on Saturday on his first visit to Australia as his nations leader. He and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said they had agreed to finalize a free trade agreement this year.Jokowi said the first issue for Indonesia was the removal of all Australian barriers to the import of Indonesian palm oil and paper. But before the deal is finalized, Turnbull announced that Indonesia has agreed to reduce tariffs on Australian sugar and ease restrictions on Australian cattle imports.Australia in return will remove all tariffs from Indonesian pesticides and herbicides, he said. The two leaders also witnessed the signing of an agreement on maritime cooperation that include strengthening maritime security and border protection as well as combating crime and improving efficiency of shipping. We have vested interests in the peace and stability in our regions seas and oceans, so we both strongly encourage the countries in our region to resolve disputes in accordance with international law which is the foundation for stability and prosperity, Turnbull said.Indonesia does not have a territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, but there have been tensions because Chinas so-called nine-dash line representing its claim to most of the sea appears to overlap with Indonesias exclusive economic zone extending from the Natuna Islands.Beijing has described the area as a traditional Chinese fishing ground, although it is nearly 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) from the Chinese mainland. There were three known incidents between Chinese fishing vessels and Indonesian government ships last year. Jokowi is not regarded as pro-Australia as his predecessor, Susilo Bambag Yudhoyono. Turnbull took the unusual step of inviting Jokowi to a private dinner at his Sydney Harbor-side mansion on Saturday as a gesture of the close ties between Indonesias 250 million people and Australias population of 24 million.The relationship has been fractious in the past. Military cooperation on language training was suspended last month after an Indonesian officer saw as derogatory references to Indonesias state ideology Pancasila in training materials used at a special forces base in the west Australian city of Perth. Turnbull said Sunday that he and Jokowi had agreed to fully restore defense cooperation.Another irritant in the relationship is the Australian navys tactic of turning asylum seekers boats back to Indonesia. Indonesians regard forcing Australia-bound boats carrying foreigners to Indonesias shores as an affront to Indonesian sovereignty. The leaders also announced that an Australian consulate will open in the Indonesian city of Surabaya and Indonesian language teaching centers in the Australian cities of Sydney, Brisbane and Darwin.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The party failed to retain its hold over either the Pune Municipal Corporation or the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, as a powerful BJP went all out to capture these centres of power.In 2014, the NCP was voted out of power in the state and the Lok Sabha elections sharply slashed the number of MPs the party had. Supriya Sule, the daughter of Sharad Pawar, barely managed to win from Baramati.According to Pawar, the current decline in the NCPs fortunes is due to the failure of the party to sell itself properly. We believe in working and letting our work speak for itself. Unfortunately, we failed to tell our own story, and thats the main reason behind the electoral debacle, he said.As a party, NCP believed in cadre-based organisation, but it had failed to capitalise on the power of social media, said Pawar. In some cases, we were not able to effectively defend ourselves on those platforms, he said.Like his illustrious great-uncle, Pawar enters into politics was with quite a bang. He managed to garner the second-highest number of votes in Maharashtra in his maiden election.During our election campaign, we walked for over 230 kms and ensured we reached at least 98 per cent of voters homes.

The arrests were made on May 19. A magistrate court in Nashiks Satana has remanded them to police custody till May 26. Further investigations are being carried out in the matter, said a senior Excise department official.According to Sunil Chavan, Director, Enforcement and Vigilance, Excise department, an enforcement team had intercepted a Gujarat-bound tanker (MH 26 H 5967) containing 8,000 bulk litres of duty-evaded rectified spirit from Satana in the early hours of May 19. Chavan said the spirit, which was being smuggled in 32 barrels, had been declared as hydroxide by the transporter, who has also been booked in the matter. The tankers driver, one Sanjay Koli, who is now under arrest, told investigators that the consignment, which was being taken to Surat, had originated from the distillery owned by the Manganga cooperative factory.Acting on this information, a raid was conducted at the distillery on May 19. Chavan said that this revealed the presence of about 20,000 litres of unaccounted for spirit. The entire 28,000 litres spirit found in the matter has been confiscated. Alcohol worth Rs 1.41 crore could be brewed using the confiscated spirit, said department sources. The distillerys in-charge, one Udaysinh Deshmukh, was also arrested.A subsequent raid at the sugar mill found 768 metric tonnes of unaccounted for molasses. The departments FIR has used this as evidence to contend that the mills intention was to divert this stock for the manufacture of illicit alcohol. Despite several attempts to contact Deshmukh, he remained unavailable for comment.Maharashtras Excise Commissioner Ashwini Joshi, when contacted, said, This is a serious matter. Further investigation is being carried out in the matter. We will take strict action against those responsible.The sugar mills vice chairman Bhagwanrao More has denied that the firm was involved in the alleged racket. We have done nothing wrong. The molasses found in the mill had been gained in surplus during the previous years cane production. Since the crushing season got done two months ago, the distillery is shut for operations at the moment.In a similar case last October, the Excise department had revoked the professional licence of a Marathwada-based distillery, owned by sugar baron Ratnakar Gutte, also considered close to the BJP, though this licence was later reinstated in February this year. The Marathwada-based distillery was similarly accused of being involved in an illegal liquor ring. The matter is still pending in the court.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This despite the agrarian village, with a population of 5,000, witnessing successive droughts over the last three years. More than 90 per cent of the 450 landholding farmers in the village have adopted multi-cropping system to make sure that one or the other crop save them from crisis.The village has agricultural land of about 1,500 hectares of which 50 per cent is irrigated, 40 percent are pumpsets and 10 percent dry land where paddy, sugarcane, ragi, maize and vegetables are mainly grown. Almost all the farmers grow short term vegetables crop while many have grown long-term timber as a subsidiary along with agricultural crops.Sugarcane factories not making payments to farmers on time is not at all an issue here as majority of the crop goes to jaggery units that are aplenty in neighbouring Dasegowdanakoppal and Kempegowdanakoppal.Yathiraj, a farmer, said they have not suffered any losses in agriculture since many years because they do not use the crop loan for any other purpose other than agriculture. Besides, hard work and adoption of technology has paid off.The credit for the villages success mainly goes to Yachenahalli Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Society established in 2009. The society with an annual turnover of Rs 13 crore lends crop loan of more than Rs 4 crore. Since the inception of the Society, there has not been even one loan defaulter while loan recovery has been 100 per cent.There are 250 primary agricultural credit co-op societies in Mysuru district out of which 4-5 have been classified as A grade depending on loan recovery and other parameters and one among it is Yachenahalli society.The secret of this, according to its founder-president Y N Shankaregowda, is honesty of all three stake-holders  people who take loan, Societys Executive Committee members and its staff. He said they have cultivated a sense of honesty among and made farmers realise that if they are honest in their work, then agriculture will not disappoint them.Hence, complacency has not crept into these farmers and do not get carried away by promises of loan waivers.Marisiddegowda, who grows paddy, sugarcane and vegetables said it is the co-ordinated efforts of the Society, College of Agriculture (VC Farm), IFFCO which has adopted the village and gram panchayat that has led to the success of the village.While the Society gives loan, the college and IFFCO assist and advise us best agricultural practice and gram panchayat provides the necessary support system, says the farmer.In the coming days, the farmers are planning to slowly switch over to organic farming eyeing more profit."

As most hands went up in support of the move, the farmers dispersed.He also listed demands that the Chief Minister agreed to consider. He will reconsider the governments decision to appeal against the Supreme Court verdict that said loans of farmers with over five acres must also be waived, he said.He said the officials had explained the financial crisis the state government is undergoing and it a couple of months to meet the demands. The arrears of about Rs 8,540 crore in minimum support prices of sugarcane would be cleared within two months.The Chief Minister has also agreed to the plea of providing pension to farmers over 60 years of age, irrespective of the size of land owned by them. Among the other demands he said the chief minister promised to fulfil are directing the banks not to auction the gold pledged by farmers. The Chief Minister also promised that the State would not give no-objection certificates to the hydrocarbon projects in delta regions.The protest site erupted in happiness as Ayyakannu listed the promises made by the Chief Minister. Only the previous night there was much tension at Chepauk as the police surrounded the protesters and putting pressure to vacate the venue. Ayyakannu had warned that he along with the other farmers will run naked if they were forcefully ejected from their protesting site.On Saturday afternoon, arrangements were made for the farmers to return to their villages after Ayyakannu finished briefing the press. The farmers were escorted around 1.45 pm in a police van to Egmore railway station where most of them boarded Pallavan Express around 3.30 pm which was bound for Karaikkudi. Few of them left like the farmer leader Ayyakannu left in an SUV."

He is scheduled to do so on Saturday as the campaign for UP enters its last lap. Congressmen in this city of temples make both the above statements in the manner of accusations.The people of Kashi are saying it is wrong (that Modi hasnt paid his respects at the temple), says Rajesh Misra, Congress candidate from Varanasi South. It is believed that the deity at the Kaal Bhairav Mandir, one of the oldest Shiva temples in Varanasi, is the Shahar Kotwal or guardian of the city. I directly accuse Modiji of failing to understand what Kashi is about, says Anil Srivastava Annu, Congress campaign chief, Varanasi district.It (Kaal Bhairav temple) is the first stop for every IAS-IPS officer who takes charge in Varanasi. If someone does not go to that temple first (before visiting other temples in the city), the belief is that things go awry (uthal puthal ho jaata hai), says Anil Srivastava, Congress candidate from Varanasi Cantt. And Modi is going there now to create religious polarisation in these elections, he says.If there is irony in the secular party expressing indignation over both the impending prime ministerial visit to the temple and its omission from his itinerary so far, Congressmen in Varanasi arent pausing over it.They point to the belated temple visit and to the fact that the PM is scheduled to address as many as four meetings here over the next three days as a sign of BJP nervousness about its electoral prospects in Varanasi. Who goes to Baba Bhairav? Those who have lost hope, says Annu, who has come to the citys famous Assi Ghat for a morning party programme. In the Congress media centre deeper in the city, Satish Rai, state Congress spokesperson asks: Has any PM done this, spent three days to campaign in his own constituency?The Varanasi Congress may appear to be clutching at straws, but by all accounts, it is better placed than its party in most places in UP.Travel through the states eastern belt and it is when you reach Varanasi that the Congress suddenly swims into visibility. Here, in the district and particularly in the city, the Congress is in the reckoning  both in Varanasi South and in Varanasi Cantt, Congress candidates came second to the BJP in 2012, which, in a role reversal, helps it to act as the senior partner to the SP. This time, the Congress is also helped by the fact that the BJP has rebellion on its hands because of its choice of candidates in the city.Yet, even in Varanasi, Congressmen cannot be blind to the difficulties for their party elsewhere in UP. Its leaders admit that what the grand old party brings to the Congress-SP alliance is not so much seats and votes but a less tangible contribution in creating a conducive dharana (notion) and vatavaran (atmosphere), especially where there is a close contest, and particularly among Muslims.The playing field is not level, the Congress also alleges bitterly. A leader currently camping in Varanasi, who asks not to be named, complains about the BJPs massive media-spend, which, he says, may help it win the argument on demonetisation and paper over other broken promises and uncomfortable realities  the closing of 28 sugar mills in UPs Aurai-Dewaria region alone, many of them in the last three years, for instance, or the raising of MSP by only Rs 10 per quintal in 33 months of the NDA regime.The Congresss jan vedna sammelans to highlight the distress caused by demonetisation, he says, were hardly covered live on TV. The Congress, he admits, took time to hit the streets with its critique of demonetisation because it first needed to send the politically correct message that it supported the fight against black money.In the last instance, the election in UP will boil down to jaati sameekaran or caste math, says Anil Srivastava hopefully, and there, we (SP-Congress alliance) are ahead. As the election heads to an end, both Srivastava and Rajesh Misra are looking forward to the meetings Lalu Prasad is scheduled to address in support of the alliance on March 6.The one sabha he has held here was very well attended, 30-35,000 people came, says Srivastava. Laluji knows how to speak back to Modi, says Misra.If Congress candidates are modest about their own star campaigner, Rahul Gandhi, they have reason to be.In the joint Akhilesh-Rahul rally a few days ago at Gorakhpurs Champa Devi Park, for instance, the milling crowd of mostly young, mostly aggressive men began leaving the moment Akhilesh, who spoke before Rahul, finished speaking. By the time Rahul ended his speech, rows of red plastic chairs were conspicuously empty.In the journey from Gorakhpur to Azamgarh to Varanasi, it is abundantly evident that those voting for the SP-Congress alliance are doing so in the name of Akhilesh, not Rahuls Congress, which, many point out, has no feet on the ground. Any mention of Rahul evokes an underwhelming response, except in Muslim pockets.Here, too, as among a group of students in Azamgarhs Shibli college, who talk about Modis jumla (propaganda), react angrily to his remarks about slaughterhouses, ask about JNUs missing student Najeeb, and swear by Akhilesh, the praise for Rahul is fairly damning.People dont understand Rahul, says Mohammad Maaz, Because people like a different kind of rhetoric. Rahul is good, but we are confused about him says Zarrin, about what he can and cannot do.One thing is clear: Comparisons between the Nitish-Lalu gathbandhan in Bihar and the Akhilesh-Rahul alliance in UP, are misplaced. In Bihar, Lalu negotiated from a position of equality and strength and, as it turned out, won more seats than his partner even though he conceded chief ministership. In UP, if the slogan UP ko yeh saath pasand hai (UP likes this partnership) has a tinny ring to it, it has mostly to do with the Congress not being seen to hold up its end in the state.For the SP, this is an election it can afford to lose  its leader, Akhilesh, has stamped his control over his party and emerged as a long-distance player to watch. For the Congress, however, a defeat would be a big blow to its already pared down ambitions  from being the party to counter the Modi-BJP to holding up the umbrella for anti-Modi parties.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

The march will end at Mumbai on May 30, following which Mr. Shetti will meet the Governor and present his demand seeking complete waiver of farmers loans.Mr. Khot, second only to Mr. Shetti in the Swabhimani Paksha, is his partys only representative in the Devendra Fadnavis-led cabinet.Relations between Mr. Shetti and Mr. Khot had become severely strained following the recent Kolhapur Zilla Parishad elections. Mr. Khot was said to be disgruntled after Mr. Shetti, who heads the party, objected to giving his son, Sagar Khot, a nomination to contest the polls. Mentored by the late stalwart agrarian activist Sharad Joshi, Mr. Shetti broke off from the Shetkari Sanghatna to found the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, whose political wing, the Swabhimani Paksha, was formed in 2004.

Rajiv Gandhi, said he had shifted to casuarina from paddy due to shortage of water for irrigation. He said that he had raised the crop about two years ago, pinning hopes on adequate harvest.Long-term benefitsThough raising casuarina involved intensive labour during the initial period, he preferred to switch over as he was confident of long-term benefits.He said that casuarina had not registered adequate growth as expected.By this time, the trees should have grown to about six feet tall but due for want of water, the growth had been seriously affected. Further, the trees have been withering, as our endeavour to save it using the borewell has proved to be futile, he said.1000 hectaresAccording to the Agricultural Department officials, an estimated 1,000 hectares under sugarcane cultivation had been converted into casuarina fields in the past three years.One of the main reasons was inadequate irrigation facility.Another farmer of Narthamalai, S.M. Pannerselvam, said he had converted four acres of his sugarcane field into casuarina grove about one-and-a-half years ago.Although he could irrigate the fields for up to seven months, it was too difficult to supply water after his borewell had dried up.Assured market is one of the reasons for switching over to casuarina.

This staple drink of the Patel community is de rigueur in sweltering weather before and after meals  day or night. ""It would be impossible for any Gujarati to imagine life without chaas, whether it is homemade or ordered from the local dairy,"" said Sonal Sojitra, a fashion stylist from Rajkot. ""Buttermilk doubles up as an appetizer and a digestive drink after a full-fledged meal.""Traditionally made from curd that has been stabilized from full-fat milk, Gujarat's chaas is often spiked with a dash of dry roasted cumin powder along with sea salt. Masala versions in Katargaam, Surat, have a mixture of uniformly chopped garlic and sprigs of fresh coriander. So loved is this lactose drink in the state that even upscale restaurants have it on their menu. ""I may order fancy continental cuisine, and yet I love to top it up with masala chaas with a dollop of frothy white butter,"" said Vieha Kapadia , an interior designer.For those with a sweet tooth, creamy lassis infused with flavours and enriched with dried fruit play the cocktail replica served in fancy glasses and beer mugs. The texture of such drinks is concentrated and the ingredients certainly make a meal in themselves. In Ahemedabad, khas flavoured lassi and royal rose faloodas are among the favourite thirst-quenchers. Gulab, rajwadi, and kesar versions of the Gujarati lassi  which are sweeter than their cousins of Punjab  are also popular.The down-to-earth nimbu pani has now gained a fashionable aperitif avatar. Sold on street carts all over the dry state, it is made in various versions and with different permutations and combinations. A Surat variety sells from pre-noon to dusk, offering respite from heat and providing peace to agonized intestines. It is made of mineral water, homemade masala, fresh lemon juice and sugar. It is topped with takmarias (pre-soaked sweet basil seeds) for a cooling effect.

From Surat to Rajkot, bottles are popped nineteen to the dozen with snacky meals as well as spicy dinners. Masala sodas add zing to spicy Gujarati food and help wash down farsan like bhusu, khaman dhoklas; street food such as pau-bhaji, dabeli, and bhel-puri; as well as heavy meals with eggs and meat.Cold cocoa is a coveted post-dinner drink in Surat. Chilled and creamy, it has luscious cocoa content. The drink is equally popular during Ramzan and Navratri among people who fast.

It was 2 am. Everyone thought it was 2 pm. But no one had courage to ask him directly.There was am amiable South Indian gentleman and he approached Gill to correct the time for the meeting but faced a wall of silence. When the meeting started on time and he asked his staff whether all had come, he surprised everyone while asking them to go back to their locations. That was the beginning of the operation domination and tables were turned. Needless to say, that was the most peaceful night. KPS Sir, rest in peace.""It was Gill who first brought the concept of bullet-proof tractors in Punjab, a rare strategy by a police to counter hiding terrorists in the sugarcane fields. The popularity of these BP tractors to counter terrorists saw their order being placed for the first time in Punjab in 30 years before they made a return in 2016.There were officers who recollected how a Willys jeep was modified to adjust to Gill's tall, wiry frame of six feet and three inches. ""When someone asked him, how tall are you, he replied, it depends on situation,"" said one senior cop."

The guidelines are primarily meant for diabetics and cover all types of religious fasts, including the intermittent model of fasting observed during Ramzan.Though there are exclusive guidelines on Ramzan fast at international and SAARC level, it is for the first time Indian Muslims have got their own health tips on fasting. The API has divided fasting into three categories depending on the duration of the fast. Ramzan fast falls in the ""long fast"" category . The guidelines for healthy fasting were published in a special supplement to the March 2017 issue of the Journal of The Association of Physicians of India . The consensus guidelines preceded a meeting of experts from different parts of India in Delhi on August 20, 2016. The guidelines are named ""Insulin dose modification during fasting in type 2 diabetes''.The six-point guidelines are: diet and exercise during fast, risk categorization for patients who fast, breaking fast, and dose modification of basal insulins, premix insulins, and prandial insulins. ""Safe religious fasting in patients with type 2 diabetes is possible with vigilant planning,"" the guidelines said, adding that diabetics on fast should ""keep themselves hydrated, consume foods with low glycaemic index and high fibre content and avoid sugary , caffeinated drinks and fried foods."" The guidelines state that the key factor for insulin therapy during Ramzan is to provide adequate insulin to prevent the post meal hyperglycaemia and also prevent hypoglycaemia during the fast. ""Individual risk factors should be identified and patients at high risk are recommended to avoid fasting.The key recommendation is to maintain the same evening post-fast dose of insulin and reduce the morning pre-fast dose of insulin,"" they said.According to the API publication, the strength of the guidelines consensus is that ""it has been developed with due considerations to national context based on experience and common therapy practices in India while drawing on recommendations from globally acceptable guidelines and relevant clinically published evidence."" The guidelines divide fasting into three types.Infrequent short fast, frequent short duration fast, and annual or semi-annual long duration fast that includes Navarathri, Paryushan, Ramzan, Buddhist lent, Parsi fast, and Christian lent."

V Antonisamy, a 74-year-old farmer in Puliyangudi in southern Tamil Nadu, has disproved this by carrying out organic farming in more than 200 acres for more than three decades.With a strong dislike for studies, he cut his teeth on agricultural and horticultural activities on a four acre ancestral property at the age of 14.Like all farmers, he made money using chemical fertilizers that made their entry to the country in the 1950s. But by 1972, yield started to drop. In 1983, Antonisamy had a 150acre farm, but business was unsustainable. ""Crop would grow, but yield was low. Organic carbon content in the soil dropped to 0.8%. Worse, I fell sick and was bedridden for two years and my right hand was paralysed,"" said Antonisamy. To make up for the losses, he shifted to goat farming, but debts kept mounting. In 1988, banks put his 150 acres under the hammer to recover Rs 15 lakh loan with interest, which they claimed had scaled to Rs 53 lakh.A legal battle ensued. The crisis made him think about where he had gone wrong. In 1987, following Subhash Palekar 's method, he gave up chemical fertilizers and pesticides and shifted to 100% organic farming.The results were encouraging. It emboldened him and reassured the banks and the tribunal that he was on the way to recovery. ""My land became fertile and spring returned to my life by 1992. With the increase in the yield, my health too improved. The tribunal waived the penal interest and I repaid Rs 28 lakh and became debt-free in 1996,"" he said.On the field, Antonisamy continued challenging set practices. Usually, farmers replant sugarcane every two to three years to prevent drop in yield, but Antonisamy has not replanted the crop in the past 25 years, yet his field churns out 60 tonnes of cane per acre, against the national average of 30 tonnes.Sustaining organic farming during initial hiccups was the key to success, he said. ""Organic farmers should not bother about pests. When one pest strikes, another will emerge to prey on it. It also increases immunity of plants,"" he said. He maintains 150 cows of indigenous breed to make organic manure, but does not sell milk. Rainwater harvesting has helped him manage drought.Except for paddy, he practises drip irrigation and fertigation to make optimum use of water. In India, the average water requirement for producing one kg of sugar is 28,000 litres, but his farm consumes only 1,800 litres per kg of sugar. By 2000, the feisty farmer had 300 acres, cultivating lemon on 100 acres, sugarcane covering 15 acres, mango on 40 acres, and paddy and coconut on 30 acres each. Antonisamy would also qualify for high level of car bon credit for growing trees on about 85 acres.He spends only on die sel, power, labour and le guminous plant seeds, for nitrogen fixation. Annually, he buys Rs 2 lakh worth of leguminous plant seeds.""We grow everything we require on the land. No MNC has been able to extract a penny from me in the past 30 years.Back in 1982-83, I spent `33 lakh on fertilizer and pesticides. An average Indian consumes 300ppm pesticides, but my farm is 100% pesticide free (pulls out lab reports to substantiate the claim). My family does not buy any medicine,"" he said.Lemon is his mainstay, fetching him a clear profit of Rs 2 crore a year. When other lemon farmers get 1,000-2,000 fruits per plant per year, his farm yields 5,000-6,000 fruits per plant. His plants bear fruits in clusters of three to four. Being organic, they have a longer shelf life and yield more juice.Value addition is key to his success. He does not sell cane to sugar mills. Instead, he converts it into jaggery and sells it under Anto's brand. Rice is beaten rice flakes. India can turn a super power just through agricultural and horticultural farming. ""But to achieve it, we need to go organic and convert every produce into branded product,"" he said."

These were submitted with the certificate of approval (CA) Bahadur provided to the mining officials on May 10.His statement shows a pattern suggesting that the account didn't have more than Rs 18,000 to Rs 22,000 at any stage in the last one year.His main source of income was his salary of Rs 11,706, the last of which he received on March 8.Surprisingly, on May 21, Bahadur deposited the first instalment, Rs 13.34 crore, of the annual Rs 26.51 crore fee he is supposed to pay to mine at the Saidpur Khurd site in Nawanshahr, Punjab.Bahadur, a resident of Bilari in Moradabad, has kept his phone switched off ever since the controversy hit the headlines.Gurjit, who owns a sugar distillery in Tarn Taran, is the richest MLA of Punjab's current assembly, with a declared wealth of Rs 169 crore.The Amarinder Singh government had auctioned rights to 102 mining sites through progressive bidding and earned Rs 1,026 crore.Gurjit has so far maintained that he does not directly or indirectly have a stake in the mining business and that Bahadur had quit the company when he sought mining rights.""There are thousands of employees who have worked with me and left from time to time and I cannot be held accountable for what they do after leaving my companies,"" Gurjit said.The opposition, however, is saying that Bahadur is only a front for Gurjit to enter into the mining business. ""Gurjit must have asked Bahadur to quit a month before the mining sites were auctioned. How can a man with a salary of Rs 11,000 deposit Rs 13 crore and win rights for mining worth Rs 26 crore?"" asked AAP's H S Phoolka, who is also leader of the opposition in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha."

While Pipraich sugarmill in Gorakhpur and Munderwa in Basti are owned by UP Sugar Corporation , the one at Rasra in Ballia is owned by UP Cooperative Mills Federation A delegation of the sugarcane department had earlier visited closed mills of the UP Sugar Corporation and UP Cooperative Mills and had submitted an action plan for their modernization and expansion. It also looked into the ways some of the closed mills could be revived.Sources said that while Pipraich and Munderwa sugarmills' reopening would cost around Rs 600 crore, Rs 650 crore to be spent on Rasra would in all likelihood be based on public-private partnership (PPP) programme.

If the city-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR) has its way , the Indian market will soon be flooded with genetically modified or transgenic jowar.Four years after launching research on transgenic sorghum, the IIMR has successfully developed genetically modified jowar with Bt genes for better grain size and resistance to pests. The IIMR's admission that it has created genetically modified (GM) jowar has taken farm and health rights activists by surprise. They demand that the Central government stop the release of GM jowar for human or animal consumption.Jowar, long considered as a poor man's food, is now in high demand with the rich and the middle classes preferring to savour Jonna Roti to fight high blood sugar levels. Only recently the transgenic variety of mustard, an essential ingredient in Indian kitchens, received the Centre's nod for release in the market. The harm the GM jowar would cause to humans and animals will be far more than the GM mustard as sorghum is consumed in large quantities all over the country , rights activists warn.The IIMR's official site takes pride in stem borer-resistant transgenic sorghum plants through Bt technology . It has also developed "" genetic transformation technology to suit the needs of Indian sorghum genotypes"".Expressing shock at the development of transgenic sorghum, the Southern Action on Genetic Engineering (SAGE) on Friday demanded a ""firm and unequivocal"" stand against GM sorghum by the Centre. It has asked the Centre to clearly state that it will not approve GM jowar.SAGE, a coalition of farmers, scientists, environmental activists and civil society groups from South India, dashed off a letter to the Union minister of environment and forests. It said jowar offers complete food and nutritional security to people in dry lands across the country . It also provides rich fodder for cattle. It accused the IIMR of ""succumbing"" to international temptations by the GM lobby . The recent development of GM mustard by Delhi University and the development of GM Sorghum of IIMR are results of the Global Food Security Act, it alleged.It pointed out that sorghum plants are fascinating tapestry of biodiversity warning that introduction of GM genes into jowar fields would result in the death of the grand biodiversity .""The case of Mexico, the origin of maize biodiversity where an accidental introduction of GM maize killed the maize diversity, must offer a clear lesson for India, warns SAGE convener PV Satheesh."

Network television. Boxing can always use an event that makes folks take notice. And this welterweight unification bout figures to be quite a show Saturday night when WBA champion Keith Thurman fights WBC titleholder Danny Garcia.Both can punch. Both can box. Neither backs up. Thurman is 27-0 with 22 KOs. Garcia is 33-0 with 19 knockouts.This fight has been brewing and thats the reason why this is happening, said Thurman, who then proved he knows the ways of the ring by referring to himself in the third person. Im really happy to be in this moment. Keith Thurmans had a dream since he was a little boy, to be not just your average champion, but a great champion.Beating Garcia might put him at that level. Even though Garcia has more bouts and some very impressive victories, hes considered something of an underdog. But hes as good as anyone Thurman has faced, including Shawn Porter, who lost a unanimous decision in a terrific fight in Brooklyn last June.Thurman has held some version of the WBA crown since 2013. Garcias been the WBA champion since outpointing Robert Guerrero 13 months ago. Hes also held a variety of lightweight belts.He promises he is ready for what could be a career-defining night.Ive been the underdog before, Garcia said. All underdog means is that there are a whole bunch of people who dont know what I can do. I rise to the occasion every time. I win because Im better. On Saturday night, Im going to prove it again.I fight to win. I fight to secure my familys future and thats what its all about. Thats what we train so hard for. Im going to give the fans something to watch on Saturday.Legacy is very important to me. I have more milestones than Thurman. This is his biggest fight. Ive been in big fights before. Every championship fight is a part of history.Ah, history. Way back in 1981, Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns fought for the same titles, an instant classic bout that solidified both of their credentials as Hall of Famers. No one is claiming Thurman-Garcia will be the stuff of legend, but its rare in boxing nowadays to get clearly the top two guys in a weight class together in the ring. Thats particularly true when both fighters are in their primes _ each is 28 _ and are big-time knockout artists.Its also rare to see such a fight not on pay-per-view television; CBS has this one, using Showtimes crews.The fact that this fight is on broadcast television on CBS is a huge plus for our business and anyone who loves boxing, promoter Lou DiBella said. For a fight of this magnitude to be available to so many people is a tremendous thing for boxing.The undercard has some intriguing fighters, too.Erickson Lubin carries the nickname Hammer and has stopped 12 of his 17 opponents in a spotless three-plus year career. At 20, he recognized he has an excellent opportunity to establish himself as a super welterweight force against Jorge Cota of Mexico.If you dont know me now, you will after Saturday night, he said. Come Saturday night, Im going to make my mark in the division. I will become the youngest champion this year. Mark my words.Cota is no slouch, though, with a 25-1 mark and 22 knockouts. Until an August decision over Yudel Johnson in Florida, Cota had never fought outside Mexico.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The ruling Left Democratic Front as well as opposition United Democratic Front legislators backed the resolution while te lone BJP legislator O Rajagopal opposed it during a special session convened to debate the issue.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan moved the resolution saying that the notification should be immediately withdrawn. He added that it threatens to destroy the states agricultural economy, jeopardise its food security and prevents free cattle trade. This Assembly is requesting the Union government that it should accept the right of the state legislative Assembly to formulate rules and pieces of legislation in state issues.He accused the Centre of trying to implement the the Sangh Parivars political agenda. The Union government, in its three-year rule, could not keep the promises made during the elections. Hence, now the government is trying to divide the people by introducing a ban on cattle trade. He said the notification should be withdrawn in the larger interest of the people. The notification is impractical in Kerala, where 95 per cent of the population is non-vegetarian. It is clearly an intrusion into the citizens choice of food.The resolution said the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Market) Rules, 2017, infringes upon the fundamental rights guaranteed to the people involved in the cattle trade.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said the notification of the Centre was introduced with a malafide intention.He called it Prime Minister Narendra Modis surgical strike. Chennithala said the move marked the arrival of fascism in the country. Modi has transformed himself into a neo-Hitler. The notification is a sugar-coated poison.Rajagopal said the Assemblys special session to debate the issue was a cheap political tactic aimed at triggering peoples sentiments against the Union government which has already indicated it is ready to make changes in the notification.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The strike at Presidency Jail, Dum Dum Jail, Jalpaiguri Jail and Alipore Womens Jail began at 6 am and end at the same time Sunday.Ranjit Sur, a member of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, a city-based human rights organisation, said he was in touch with the prisoners and that the organisation had received a written complaint from Maity detailing the torture.She gave us the written complaint at her last court appearance, which was on the 6th of this month. She was to approach the court as well but couldnt place her complaint in front of them in the last hearing. According to her complaint, Kalpana has started suffering from many illnesses since she was shifted to Alipore jail. She suffers from high blood sugar, arthritis and a number of other illnesses.She alleges that the jail warden has issued instructions to all other inmates in the prison that if she asks anyone for help, they are not to help her. The other inmates have been prohibited from talking to her, and she has been prohibited from talking to them. She has been instructed to clean her own cell and bathroom which the other inmates dont have to do. Other inmates are allowed on the prison grounds for walks or exercise. Kalpana has been denied this facility, said Sur.He added that despite Maity being an political prisoner, recognised by the court as such, she was not given due facilities. There are certain things that a political prisoner is to receive by law, such as a table, chair, books, newspapers and writing material. The prison authorities have not given her these facilities. She has been isolated completely, he alleged.According to Sur, Maity was arrested on December 4, 2010, with four other alleged Maoists, Sudip Chongdar, Barun Sur, Akhil Ghosh and Bimal Mallick, from Maidan in Kolkata. She was known to be close to Maoist Kishenji, often called his shadow. The political prisoners have decided that if this torture does not stop, then across all jails in West Bengal, they will go on an indefinite hunger strike, said Sur.In 2012, soon after coming to power, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had permitted the release of 51 political prisoners who had received life terms and had already served over 15 years in jail. The recommendations were made by a Review committee for the release of political prisoners, headed by retired Justice Maloy Sengupta. However, while the Sengupta committee had recommended the release of all political prisoners, this was not done.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, with construction activities on a downswing after demonetisation, these metros are not pulling the rural labourers like they used to.Rural labourers and small farmers who used to migrate every year during off-agricultural season are finding it better to work under the job guarantee scheme at a wage of Rs. 234 a day rather than migrating to distant urban centres for uncertain work.This apart, since most parts of the State are under the consecutive spells of drought, the demand for farm labourers has dwindled from sugarcane and coffee-growing districts.As a result, a considerable size of labourers from Hyderabad Karnataka region, who would seasonally migrate to these places, was forced to stay back at their villages finding alternative work."

He bravely got up once more, but referee David Fields waved it off soon after as he was unable to defend against a barrage of Joshua blows on the ropes.American boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard was among those who immediately hailed the contest as amazing. Such an amazing fight with 2 great fighters. Lot of heart by both fighters. A lot of questions answered by @anthonyfjoshua #JoshuaKlitchsko, he tweeted.Lennox Lewis paid tribute to Klitschko for getting up twice in the 11th from devastating Joshua punches.How much heart did @Klitschko show in this fight? Gotta respect it. Hold ur head high brother! #joshuaklitschko. tweeted the Briton, who was the last man to be the undisputed World heavyweight champion.The Ukrainian had also been sent crashing to the floor in the fifth round as the 27-year-old British fighter took his perfect record to 19 stoppage wins in 19 fights.What can I say? 19-0, three-and-a-half years in the game. As I said, Im not perfect but Im trying and if you dont take part youre going to fail, said Joshua.As boxing states, you leave your ego at the door and you respect your opponent. So a massive shout out to Wladimir Klitschko, said Joshua.A third defence of his IBF World heavyweight title also earned Joshua the vacant WBA belt as he became the first British heavyweight since Lewis in 2002 to hold two versions of the world title. It was Klitschkos first stoppage defeat since Lamon Brewster beat him in 2004 and leaves his record at 64 wins and five defeats."

What might be a challenge for them are the toilets. The issue isnt about flushes working or the availability of toilet paper, but the potential for Japans high-tech commodes to intimidate and confuse users.The Japanese toilet is a thing of wonder. An array of buttons along the side of a typical commode allows you to spray and dry your rear, or front. Others activate oscillation or pulsation, and raise or lower the intensity of the gush. Some models offer the possibility of a little deodorising puff of air freshener. The function that automatically puts the lids or seat covers down is referred to as the marriage saver. And then there is the heated toilet seat, which rivals Kyoto in full cherry blossom bloom as a highlight of a trip to Japan.The worry for the hundreds of thousands of Olympics visitors is that often toilet controls are not labelled in English. Moreover, both functions and icons vary by model. It can be nerve-racking trying to figure out which button to push. You might want to flush but end up pressing the emergency call, and be caught with your pants down by a Japanese SWAT team in crisis-control mode.There is a story about a hapless foreigner who wanted to adjust the bidet function and ended up with tickets to a six-hour long Kabuki (a classical Japanese dance drama) instead. The story is likely apocryphal but its a fact that there are things that can be done by a Japanese toilet that many governments would have difficulty accomplishing as efficiently.Manufacturer Matsushitas smart toilet takes a urine and stool analysis, and checks blood pressure, temperature, and blood sugar. A rival company, Inax, makes toilets that glow in the dark and whir up lids after an infrared sensor detects a human being. The toilet can play multiple soundtracks to disguise embarrassing noises, including chirping birds, tinkling wind chimes, and the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frhlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn.A place in cultureBut long before the commode became the kind of futuristic gadget that might be expected to talk to you, the toilet has enjoyed a special place in Japanese culture. Junichiro Tanazaki, one of 20th century Japans finest writers, called the traditional Japanese toilet a place of spiritual repose. It was the toilet, Tanazaki theorised, where haiku poets are likely to have come up with most of their ideas. Indeed, consider master Kobayashi Issas 1822 poem:Even the outhouseHas a guardian god...Plum blossomsIn Japanese folklore Kawaya-no-kami, or the toilet god, is a popular deity. Since the contents from outhouses were used as fertiliser, Kawaya-no-kami was associated with good harvests and fertility, and also invoked to protect people from falling into the toilet pit. For 2020, Tokyo is determined to ensure that Olympics enthusiasts have secured all necessary blessings from Kawaya-no-Kami. The brows of toilet-challenged tourists will soon be unfurrowed with Japanese manufacturers having agreed to standardise the iconography used on toilet controls to make them more foreigner-friendly. The Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association has agreed on a range of eight symbols that signify: raise the lid, raise the seat, big flush, small flush, rear bidet, front bidet, dry and stop. This new set of icons will be used on all toilets sold from this month on.For 2020, Tokyo is determined to ensure that Olympics enthusiasts have secured all necessary blessings from Kawaya-no-Kami, the Japanese toilet god"
593cfaab7be9e00dabcbb72e,Some way to go before the finish,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/some-way-to-go-before-the-finish/article18345005.ece,2017-05-01,"The Railway Ministrys plans to allow private companies to run freight trains from their own private terminals may lead to faster evacuation of cargo, but the proposed move faces multiple challenges, said analysts.The move may be widely seen as ushering of fundamental reforms in the stodgy behemoth but past experience does not exactly paint a positive picture, said Rohit Chaturvedi, managing partner Kitzo Management Advisory, a logistics strategy and operations consulting firm.Poor past experienceEven less ambitious initiatives like allowing Private Container Terminal Operators (CTOs), Multi Modal Logistics Parks or most recently Private Freight Terminals (PFTs) have not met with desired success, said Mr. Chaturvedi, formerly director of Crisil Risk & Infrastructure Advisory. To be fair, PFT has shown a glimpse of railways readiness to take necessary steps in the right direction, but not sufficiently, he added.As per plan, firms and manufacturers that transport bulk of their produce through the railway network would be allowed to set up their own private terminals from where their own trains would ply to delivery centres. The trains will run on Indian Railways tracks and the operation of the trains will remain with the railways. This is per the provisions of the Special Freight Train Operations Scheme of the Ministry of Railways.However, the problems being faced by Indian Railways such as creaky signalling infrastructure and tracks needing maintenance will largely remain the same. The problem is compounded on congested routes such as between Delhi and Mumbai, which already face pressure from both passenger and freight trains, analysts said.This is a good initiative and can help players with bulk movements such as coal, sugar, cement and fertilizers for faster movement of their cargo, said Ganesh Rewanwar, director & CEO, Saanvad Ventures Pvt. Ltd. which runs freightbazaar, an e-transportation marketplace catering to the trucking industry. It will also help in multi modal infrastructure development and speed up investment in infrastructure, he added.He said the impact may not be immediate since it would require more time to build up infrastructure. The major challenge will be land acquisition and terminal utilisation. It is not expected to affect long-haul road transport in a major way. However, it will be a boost for the first-mile and last-mile logistics sector, he said.The Railways, under Minister Suresh Prabhu, may be undergoing transformation, but scepticism persists.The move is seen [as] positive for large corporates with heavy volume of cargo as freight movement by railway is suitable for long distance over 500 kms, said Kamal Podar, managing director, Choice Group which is into financial services and management consulting in the infrastructure space.However, so far we have seen limited success in private container train operations since it was introduced in 2006, due to lack of conducive policies, he added. The railway traffic is caught between subsidised passenger traffic and premium tariff for cargo which is benefiting other modes of traffic like road and shipping, he added.Besides, the precedence given to passenger trains is expected to cause uncertainties in running freight trains in a scheduled manner. This may defeat the very purpose behind the partial opening up of the freight transport arm of the railways. Apart from the convenience of transporting cargo through own trains, the economic viability of any such operation would remain a major question for private operators.Going by past experience, most Container Terminal Operators have either burnt their fingers or not started operations in a meaningful manner. In fact, there have been instances of licence-holders operating only a few rakes merely to prevent their licences from being revoked.Charges, changesAnalysts said the main cause of unprofitable operations may be attributed to the charges by Railways and ad-hoc changes in tariffs for some of the profitable cargo (heavy cargo and long distance haulage). Also lack of guarantee of timely delivery of the consignment has repulsed the EXIM cargo, they added. For example, the railways command less than one third of total container volumes at JNPT, the largest container port in India located in Mumbai. JNPT attracts most of the cargo from long distances from the North and West of India. This situation is unheard of in any other country with advanced logistics systems, industry watchers said. Long distances must mean competitive advantages to railways over road.Analysts believe that the problems such as heavy detention charges, fixed haulage charges, whether the rake is full or empty, coupled with the lack of certainty on timely movement of rakes would affect the private rail operators in the same way as they affected the Container Terminal Operators.Another concern that bogs potential private operators is the lack of clarity on whether they would be allowed to run their rakes on the proposed Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs) being set up in the country.In addition, there is lack of clarity on the approval process for rakes and the design specifications. As per existing rules, the approval from the Research Designs & Standards Organisation (RDSO) of the Railways is required for running any non-standard rake. It is feared that the approval process could take a long time and bureaucratic hassles would jeopardise the genuine intent, said industry sources.The absence of a credible dispute resolution mechanism has also been red flagged by analysts. The Railways, being both the operator and regulator, meant that the dispute resolution system in place may not be adequately effective, they said. However, it is expected that the proposed Rail Development Authority may address the issues of effective and efficient regulation as well as dispute resolution.Finally, although the intent to allow private operators to run their own rakes is laudable, ambitious and bold, it has to be backed by proper implementation mechanism, according to consultants.If implemented properly, it can begin the virtuous circle by freeing up the resources of Indian Railways and providing focus on basic infrastructure such as modern signalling equipments and robust rail network, Mr. Chaturvedi said. The result will be more capacity augmentation from existing infrastructure and more cargo movement... [and] thus more resources for the railways, he added."
593d265e7be9e00dabcbd707,All hands on this beauty deck,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/all-hands-on-this-beauty-deck/article18367288.ece,2017-05-03,"Long before the glow on your face recedes, your hands will bear the brunt of ageing. The delicate skin has fewer oil glands compared to other areas and is constantly exposed to the suns harsh rays and other chemical concoctions like harsh soaps and detergents. Plus, our hyaluronic acid decreases with age, leading to pigmentation, prominent veins and thin skin. This process starts in your mid-20s but becomes evident in the early 40s.Care for your hands as you do your faceExposure to water, cleansers, hand sanitisers, dry weather, long hours in air conditioned environments affect your hands. But with a little care, you can remedy the situation. Firstly, moisturise as much as possible. Whether you are sitting in your car or in your office, always keep lotion handy. As for the men, while strong hands might be appealing, callused ones certainly arent. So use a hand cream too but just dont borrow one from your partner. Sonia Sharma, Spa Manager at Taj Salon, Vivanta by Taj - President, Mumbai, advises purchasing formulas meant for men as their skin tends to be thicker. While doing the dishes, use gloves to avoid contact with harsh detergents. Swap harsh soaps for gentle hand washes with pH levels between 5.5 to 5.7.Dr. Neena Chopra, director, Beauty and Technical, Just Herbs (an e-store for organic and ayurvedic luxury skincare) has simple advice. She urges you to use the same anti-ageing products meant for your face, on the backs of your hands. Massage it in to improve circulation and then slip on thin gloves before bed. Also, a hand mask once a week delivers an intensive dose of hydration to your skin. Dr. Renita Rajan, a consultant cosmetic dermatologist, offers a quick home-care facial for the hands. Lather up a gentle cleanser and add some brown sugar to the mix. Use the concoction to gently scrub the skin until the sugar dissolves. It will exfoliate your skin without being unduly harsh.Of course, never forget sunscreen, even for your hands. Dr. Neeraj Tulara, specialist internal medicine at Dr. L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai says, Just like the rest of your skin, your hands are vulnerable to damage from the sun, including dark spots that can make them look older. To protect them, Tulara says to regularly apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher reapply often. And if theyve gotten sunburnt, a paste of fresh tomato juice will reverse the damage.Pay attention to your potionsDr. Jamuna Pai, celebrity cosmetologist at Blush Clinic, Mumbai, advises being smart about your hand products. Whilst selecting your moisturiser, check the labels for key ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and dimethicone, besides urea, glycerine and shea butter as these will replenish the moisture that the environment takes out from your skin by pulling the water from the inner layers of your skin to the surface. Aloe vera, vitamin E oil, mango butters, also work well to soften and heal your hands. Dr.Chiranjiv Chhabra, director and consultant dermatologist at Skin Alive, recommends using a product with retinol at night since it has great anti-ageing benefits and stimulates collagen production.If you want to go beyond homecare, Dr. Apratim Goel, cosmetic dermatologist and laser surgeon, Cutis Skin Studio, Mumbai, suggests trying out the new Helios-II fractional laser, which works wonders on shrivelled hands and removes age spots and tanning. Filler injections containing hyaluronic acid like Juvederm, Restylane and Meso Infusion can also be given to moisturise the skin from within, she says.Give your hands, a handThe age-old offenders like smoking and drinking will sap your skin of any moisture. Load up on good ol H20 because dehydration can affect your hands badly. A good well-balanced diet rich in vegetables, zinc and fatty acids will contribute to soft skin. Dr. Maithili Kamat consultant dermatologist at Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, tells her patients to keep a stress ball handy as squeezing it not only helps release tension but also helps build the muscles of your wrists and hands."

On April 18, the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote to Congress  in the quarterly review Congress requires of the July 2015 international nuclear deal  that Iran continues to comply with the deal, but in the same letter he called Iran a leading state sponsor of terror. A day later, the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who has long been very hostile to Iran, accused it of attempting to destabilise yet another country, meaning Yemen. Two months earlier, on February 4, Mr. Mattis had responded to Irans late-January test of a ballistic missile by calling it the worlds single biggest state sponsor of terrorism. On April 12, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said in a Security Council briefing on Syria, Iran is [Bashar al-]Assads chief accomplice in the regimes horrific acts.Second, Washingtons major regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, have been no less hostile. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Irans aggression must not go unanswered. Following exchanges with Riyadh, the White House has said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have agreed to address what the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a statement imposing several sanctions on businesses and individuals for Iranian links, calls Irans destabilising activities in the region.Third, Mr. Trumps own statements that he could consider committing U.S. troops abroad have been accompanied by an unprecedented $54 billion increase in the defence budget, despite the Presidents frequent pre-election denunciations of what he called excessively high defence spending.Indias Iran relationshipAll this is highly significant for India. In October 2016, Iran was Indias largest supplier of crude oil, with its exports to India exceeding the overall largest supplier Saudi Arabias exports of 697,000 barrels per day (bpd) by over 10%. As the U.S. federal body Energy Information Administration notes, India is also funnelling Iranian oil into its expanding strategic petroleum reserves (SPR), with a view to holding 90 days supply against contingencies. Crucially, Tehran has consistently offered New Delhi very favourable terms, including non-dollar oil sales and other commercial attractions.Oil is of course only one commodity in a long-standing Indo-Iranian trade relationship; Iran buys basmati rice and sugar from India, as well as various agrochemicals and petroleum products. Substantial expansions in the volume of business are also likely, despite earlier tensions over delayed Indian payments for oil. The Indian government has, furthermore, taken steps to reassure Indian insurers in the public and private sectors, as well as banks, over the risks they might take in handling Iranian money while the U.S. sanctions regime remains in force.In addition, India and Iran have reached agreement on the expansion of several industrial facilities at the port of Chabahar; the work is to be undertaken mainly by Indian entities. Another substantial deal is the one under preparation for India to have operating rights in the Farzad B gas field, which lies within Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf.ConsequencesThe prospect of a more aggressive U.S. attitude on Iran, if not stronger sanctions against Tehran, will almost certainly make the Government of India very uncomfortable, with the attitudes taken by Israel and Saudi Arabia no doubt exacerbating New Delhis predicament. It may help India that within the U.S. and Israel, moderating factors  both commercial and military  obtain. In 2012, the then Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, stated that attacking Iran would only delay Irans development of a nuclear weapon and not stop it. At that time too, the former head of Israels intelligence service Mossad, Meir Dagan (now deceased), said that a pre-emptive attack on Iran was the stupidest idea he had ever heard.Among the commercial agreements which have followed the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the European Union), is a 10-year, $16.6-billion contract for the aerospace giant Boeing to supply Iran Air with 80 passenger aircraft. Quite apart from Boeings competition with the EU manufacturer Airbus, any attack on Iran could put about 1,00,000 U.S. jobs at risk.Perhaps as a result, the Trump administration, despite its bellicose rhetoric, is showing some signs of moderation in all this. For example, the sanctions announced since the recent Iranian missile test amount to no more than the implementation of measures already prepared by the Obama White House. It is, nevertheless, virtually certain that Tel Aviv and Riyadh will maintain what pressure they can on Washington by continuing to be vituperatively anti-Iranian, at least in public. Whether or not the U.S. allows the exchange of rhetoric to escalate may well depend on whose advice is decisive, even though on the evidence Iran is not a clear and present threat.For India, a further point is that while previous U.S. administrations exempted India from certain sanctions over Indias continuing oil deal with Iran, the Trump administration may see the matter differently. One saving grace may be that no matter what Mr. Trumps main regional allies tell him or want him to do, they cannot predict what he will actually do.Arvind Sivaramakrishnan is an Adjunct Professor, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras"

But now more people know about these products and we are able to sell them quickly. All the jaggery was sold out. I reduced my cost of growing sugarcane by using fewer seeds and avoiding inorganic inputs. I sold around 10 quintals of jaggery for 60 rupees a kilogram, he said.Under a promotion project funded by the Directorate of Cashewnut and Cocoa Development, members of the non-government organisation, Prawardha, convinced Narayan Rao of the possibilities of growing cashew on two-and-a-half acres of hard bed laterite rock farm that had remained uncultivated for decades. The board gave him technical inputs and provided monetary assistance.I started getting yields from the fourth year. From then on, each year, the yields have doubled and the price has steadily increased, he said. He was worried about the apples that were going waste. He visited the cashew research centre in Puttur and sought advice from scientists. They gave me valuable advice. They also organised a training session in cashew product processing in the College of Horticulture, Bidar.His wife Sayamma and her neighbours Chitramma Chidri and Sangeeta Hugar attended the training. They are now making juice, jam, candy, and pickle. By next year, we will produce cattle fodder and chicken feed from apple pulp, Narayan Rao said. He is slowly building up his client base for his cashew products by giving samples to those who had bought jaggery from him. I have sold one quintal of raw apples for two rupees apiece. All other value added products have brought me so much money that I have recovered the cost of labour, and inputs for this year, he said.Considering his entrepreneurial zeal, the zilla panchayat and the College of Horticulture have helped him set up a cashewnut processing centre. Three years ago, the then Deputy Commissioner P. C Jaffer and zilla panchayat Chief Executive Officer Ujjwal Ghosh approved of the colleges plans of setting up three fruit processing centres in Bidar district at a cost of Rs. 50 lakh.The first centre is already running on the college campus where students get hands-on experience and farmers can get their nuts processed on custom hire basis. The centre in Chitta is being put up near the gram panchayat. We are asking cashew growing farmers to bring their nuts to the centre for processing. We are now selling raw nuts at between Rs. 80 and Rs. 115 per kilogram. But if we process them, we can get between Rs. 800 and Rs. 1,000 per kg, he said.If we process 100 kilograms, we get 30 kilograms of cashew. The cashew grown in Bidar is classified as W-210, that is considered the second best in India. Processing will help us triple our incomes, if not double them, he said."

What does it mean? Jayant Patil, NCP Leader of the House in Legislative Assembly. The state government says it is not against loan waiver but will take a decision (on that) at an appropriate time. What does it mean? Jayant Patil, NCP Leader of the House in Legislative Assembly.Maharashtras Former finance minister Jayant Patil is of the opinion that no chief minister or finance minister will ever give consent to a crop loan waiver when the governments coffers are running empty. Patil, who is currently the leader of the NCP in the Legislative Assembly, had held the states finance portfolio for three consecutive terms in the Congress-NCP coalition government since 1999.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDiscussing the politics, economics and arithmetic of crop loan waiver both at the Centre and in Maharashtra, while speaking to The Indian Express, Patil put across the challenges for any government having to deal with financial constraints. The conservative estimate of crop loan waiver would work out to Rs 25,000 cr to Rs 30,000 cr approximately. Now, no wise chief minister or finance minister will give permission for the crop loan waiver. The task has become more challenging for the present government that has miserably failed in fiscal prudence, thus reflecting poor financial management, said Patil.He added: The overall budget spending shows 47 per cent, which means there is an undeclared cut in force. The series of mega-projects being pursued by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in multiple sectors, like infrastructure, also makes us wonder how they would mobilise the funds.Speaking about the socio-politics behind the Oppositions demand for a crop loan waiver during the ongoing budget session, Patil justified it. He said: Our decision is not politically driven. It is our concern to bring immediate relief to the farmers across rural Maharashtra. In the last three to four successive years, farmers suffered due to drought. Last year, we had a good monsoon. There was good crop production. However, farmers earnings were badly affected because of the demonetisation policy imposed from November 8, 2016.Patil added: Farmers were forced to sell their vegetables, fruits and crops at much lower prices. Except for cash crops like sugarcane, all other crops fetched lower prices causing revenue loss to farmers.Taking a strong objection to the governments argument that the loan waiver had helped district cooperative banks and not farmers in the past, he said: I am not asking money for banks. The government can always directly transfer the cash into farmers accounts.The NCP leader said: If Prime Minister Narendra Modi can promise loan waiver to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, what stops the government from taking the decision in Maharashtra? This is our basic question at a time they boast of a robust economy, which is not the case. Therefore, as I said in the beginning, unless any state has surplus money it would be a difficult task to waive the crop loans completely.Reminding of former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars 2008 decision after discussion with then prime minister Manmohan Singh on a crop loan waiver of Rs 71,000 crore for the entire country, Patil said, There were no immediate elections. But the UPA government still went ahead with the decision to bring relief to farmers.He added: Today, the state government says it is not against loan waiver but will take a decision (on that) at an appropriate time. What does it mean?Commenting on the Shiv Sena trying to take credit for the demand for crop loan waiver, Patil said: They are a confused party. On one hand they are enjoying power in the government, and on the other they are trying to show that they are an Opposition party.Taking a dig at the Sena, he said: Now, all Opposition parties had taken a decision to protest at the footsteps of Vidhan Bhawan on the crop loan waiver issue. But just to show that they are different, the Shiv Sena sat a few feet away at the footsteps of Chhatrapati Shivajis statue. A section was protesting against the government and the other half is participating in the government.

Sugar mills owned by Modi, Bajaj and Simbhawali group have a combined arrear of Rs. 3,100 crore. While the two factories of Modi group owe Rs. 417 crore to the farmers, 15 sugarcane factories owned by Bajaj group owe Rs. 2,310 crore and three factories of Simbhawali group owe Rs. 371 crore to the farmers, the Minister said.Till two weeks ago, over 116 mills bought sugarcane worth a total of Rs. 24,190.53 crore in 2016-17 but till April 12 they could pay back to the farmers Rs. 20,068.53 crore.Deepak Guptara of U.P.

While Modi group has cleared 14 % of the arrears, sugarcane factories owned by Bajaj and Simbhawali groups have managed to pay 42 % of the money they owe farmers.Cash crop of West UPMore than 55 lakh farmers spread across 40 districts of western Uttar Pradesh grow sugarcane, which is the cash crop of the region. The grim situation of payment to farmers exists even though the turnover of the UP sugar industry is the highest in the country this year."

Source: Shubhangi Khapre Satyawan Baburao Ghadge in Hingni village. Source: Shubhangi KhaprePadmasinha Ganpat Patil (31) gave up his senior salesmans job at Kotak Mahindra in Mumbai to return to his native village Manegaon in Mhada taluka in Western Maharashtra to do dairy farming. Six months later, Patil is on cloud nine. Milk prices have gone up from Rs 18-20 per litre to Rs 25-26 per litre, promising higher profits.In Mumbai, his last annual package was Rs 5.5 lakh.On a sprawling one acre of land in front of his home, five cows wander around. Every two hours they return to their designated spot for fodder which is 35 to 40 kg per cow.Watch What Else Is making NewsA diploma holder from the agriculture college at Akluj taluka, Patil said, The inspiration to return to dairy farming was from my maternal uncle Satyawan Baburao Ghadge (42), who wrote a success story with 25 high-grade jersey cows in a short span of 18 months in Hingni village of Mohol taluka.According to Patil, On an average each cow delivers 20 litres of milk. An average 70 litres of milk at Rs 26 per litre fetches Rs 1,820 daily. Other expenses include cost of transporting milk to collection centres and maintenance and fodder of the cows.The familys adjoining agriculture land spread over five to six acres helps to generate in-house fodder. Revealing that the glamour of Mumbais life does not hold any appeal to him compared to the rural roots, he said, In any job in the city we had to work almost 10 to 12 hours which was very stressful as targets had to be met. Moreover, office and house were located at two ends making travel cumbersome and expensive.Whereas, life in village with half the efforts and proper planning promises higher returns. It easily surpasses the annual package of Rs 5.5 lakh I used to earn. Moreover, unlike in the city, the cost of living is much lower providing both quality life and huge savings.In the last seven years in Mumbai, beginning with a BPO call centre, he hopped jobs as sales manager in Idea Cellular, Future India, General Life Insurance and Kotak Mahindra.I am planning to purchase six more cows. And then intend to put up a small chilling plant, which would be able to hold 2,500 litres of milk. It can be graduated to processing unit in coming years.At village Hingni, Satyawan Baburao Ghadge has a bigger success story. The seventh passed Satyawan (42), tired of crop failure for four successive years, decided to take to dairy development. Three years ago, he started with a couple of cows. Today, with a loan from Bank of India, he has 25 jersey cows in his huge shed pitched on his agriculture land adjoining the sugarcane fields.Satyawan and his younger brother Abhimanyu took Rs 8 lakh each loan from Bank of India to buy the cows. They are mostly brought from Sangola market at Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh depending on age and grade. Satyawan personally tends to each cow, almost with a set timetable of when and how much fodder and water should be provided.According to Satyawan, On an average, we generate 250 to 275 litres of milk. It is transported to Mohol dock where milk cooperative societies purchase it at Rs 26 to Rs 27 per litre. The farmers revealed, In the last six to eight months there have been stringent measures taken by the administration to streamline the corruption and adulteration. As a result, farmers are getting better price.Satyawan said, In the past, middle agents in nexus with milk cooperative owners (including private) exploited the dairy farmers. Citing surplus milk collection they would create a situation where we had to sell the milk at as low as Rs 15 to 17 per litre. In front of our eyes, agents would manipulate and resell the same milk in markets at Rs 40 per litre which would be then sent for distribution to other urban cities and towns. The milk quantity would be often increased by adding water and also chemical, which is detrimental to health.While advocating harsh punishment for those cheating people and farmers, he said, Even a small and marginal farmer with just two cows can survive drought and crop losses if those running the milk cooperatives stop exploiting and manipulating the farmers.According to a NABARD report, The per capita availability of milk is 210 grams for the state as a whole and offers vast scope for increasing milk production to reach the ideal level of 250 grams per person per day. The cooperative dairy infrastructure comprises 29 district milk unions, 77 taluka sanghs and 30714 primary dairy cooperative societies.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: AP) Keith Thurman has 22 knockouts in 28 fights, all wins. (Source: AP)Sometimes, even for a knockout artist, defense is the best option.Keith Thurman went that route Saturday night, building a big lead over Danny Garcia and holding on to add the WBC welterweight title to his WBA championship.Yes, Thurman has 22 knockouts in 28 fights, all wins. He won this unification bout, though, by getting tactical and going somewhat conservative.I was not giving the fight away, he said. I felt like we had a nice lead, we could cool down. I felt like we were controlling the 3-minute intervals in each and every round.Thurman handed Garcia his first loss in 34 bouts.I thought I pushed the fight like a true champion and did enough to get the victory, Garcia said.After five furious rounds to open things at Barclays Center, the pace slowed _ even bringing boos from the large crowd at times. But it ended with a flourish of exchanges in the 12th and final round. And with Thurman holding up two belts.I thought I outboxed him, I thought it was a clear victory, Thurman said. But Danny, he came to fight.Thurman won a split decision, getting scores of 116-112 and 115-113. Garcia, favored by a majority of the fans who loudly derided the announcement of the winner, won one card 115-113.The AP scored it 115-113 for Thurman.I knew with a wide spread it had to go to me when I heard, Thurman said about the decision.Using powerful rights, including straight leads that stopped Garcia in his tracks, Thurman dominated early. Garcia landed the occasional bomb, particularly one shot to the body that had Thurman grimacing at the end of the 10th.There might have been one left hook to the body that he landed that I felt, Thurman admitted. But we know how to endure these punches. This isnt just about outboxing an opponent, you have to take a punch, too.Garcia came on from there, but it was too late.It was a tough fight, he said. I thought I came back strong. I cant cry over anything, Ill come back strong like a true champion. I would love to have a rematch to get my titles back.Thurman won a terrific bout with Shawn Porter at Barclays last June. This one wasnt of such high quality throughout, but it had its moments.Both fighters opened up without reservation, each missing several haymakers, but also landing solid punches. Thurmans right leads were particularly effective, while Garcia, whose right eye was getting red by the fourth round, used his right hand to keep Thurman off-balance.With each fighter capable of landing the one punch to end it, the crowd of 16,533 roared with every shot _ until the sixth, when both guys got cautious. Despite all the previous action, the fans booed what clearly was the worst round of the bout.It was nearly impossible to live up to the fury of the first five rounds, anyway, and only occasionally the rest of the way did the fight do so.But Thurman strategically was being smart.We knew we had the fight won, trainer Dan Birmingham said. Keith was still scoring while he was backing up _ sticking and moving.Garcia, 146.5 pounds, of Philadelphia, actually landed a higher percentage of his punches, 30 percent to 26 percent for Thurman, 146.2 of Clearwater, Florida. But Thurman was far more active, attempting 570 punches, 136 more than Garcia.The bout wasnt very reminiscent of the classic 1981 welterweight unification fight between Sugar Ray Leonard, who announced this one from ringside for CBS, and Thomas Hearns. Leonard said this week he believed it could reach that level, but only early on and very late was that close to true.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/Tatan Syuflana)Australias prime minister said Monday that he was looking forward to discussing a free-trade deal with Indonesia while attending a regional forum in Jakarta. Malcom Turnbull on Tuesday will attend the first Indian Ocean Rim Association leaders summit in the 20-year history of the 21-nation organization. Turnbulls one-day visit to Jakarta comes nine days after Joko Jokowi Widodo ended his first Australian visit as Indonesias president.The leaders used that Sydney visit to commit to finalizing a bilateral free-trade agreement this year after 17 years of negotiations. Jokowi said the deal must remove all Australian barriers to the importation of Indonesian palm oil and paper. Turnbull has welcomed trade concessions that Indonesia has already made, including reduced tariffs on Australian sugar and fewer restrictions on Australian live cattle imports.Were making very good progress there and I look forward to discussing it further when Im in Jakarta tomorrow, Turnbull told reporters in the Australian city of Melbourne. Indonesian trade official Thomas Lembong, chairman of Indonesias Investment Coordinating Board, told Australias Fairfax Media that his government wanted to see concrete proof of unfettered and natural trade in Indonesia palm oil, paper and wood products.David Brewster, an Australian National University researcher on Indian Ocean security, said he expected Turnbull would be one of the few national leaders to attend the summit that will be chaired by Jokowi. His attendance at the meeting is probably primarily driven by the Jakarta relationship, wanting to show solidarity with Jokowi, Brewster said.Turnbull later said in a statement that Australia had a fundamental interest in ensuring economic development in the Indian Ocean region and enhancing dialogue on shared security challenges. The summit will agree to a statement on shared values and objectives, including a commitment to international law, and a declaration on countering violent extremism.Australian interest in the grouping of predominantly developing states on the Indian Ocean fringe has deepened in the past five years, with the economic growth of India and China and a relative decline in influence in the region of the United States, Australias most important strategic partner, Brewster said. India is a member of the group while China has observer status.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

NABARD, as per the latest instructions of the RBI, has submitted the verification report of accounts last week and the banks hope this would be the last inspection they would have to go through. The DCCBs that are stuck with large amount of withdrawn notes hope the RBI would now give them the green signal to exchange these notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSoon after demonetisation, the RBI had passed several orders that had crippled the functioning of the DCCBs. Not only were they not allowed to deposit old currency notes, but the deposits they had received during the first two days were not allowed to be exchanged. The DCCBs had moved the Supreme Court for relief and during the hearing the RBI had expressed doubts over the KYC compliance of the DCCBs. In its order the apex court had asked the remittance of the old currency notes, but had asked for 100 per cent KYC compliance of the accounts that had deposited the specified bank notes (SBNs). The 31 DCCBs in Maharashtra have Rs 4,311 crore in SBNs which they want to exchange.After the December verdict, the RBI had asked NABARD to undertake the inspection but procedural details were lacking. During the first phase, NABARD had physically inspected 25 branches of each DCCBs and submitted their report. Subsequently, the DCCBs were asked to submit KYC details of each and every account in triplicate. However, this exercise proved to be cumbersome and collection of documents for all the 370 DCCBs in the country would have been a tedious job. The RBI had there by instructed NABARD to physically inspect the KYC documents of accounts that had seen deposits over Rs 50,000. The inspections got over last week and now the DCCBs are hoping for an early end to their predicament.In Maharashtra the DCCBs have always been commended for their extensive rural outreach. At many remote places these are the only banks and suspension of banking services had affected the rural populace severely. Acting as bankers for cooperative institutions these banks depose of salaries of sugar mill workers, primary teachers, anganwadi workers, dairies, etc. Till January, the banks had seen outgoing RTGS of more than Rs 7,000 crore while incoming RTGS was just around Rs 4,000 crore.

Kamleshwar SinghFOR THESE elderly people, the Senior Citizens Home in Sector 43 is a home away from home. Gian Kaur, 70, was a government employee working under a Central government health scheme. I have worked all my life. Having fulfilled all my responsibilities, I just want to relax at this point of life. There is no better place than this. My daughter was working in Chandigarh earlier. So I came here. However, my daughter was transferred to New Delhi and I shifted here. Kaur has been residing in the home for the last 11 years now. Baldev Singh, 88, says, We just want to relax as we cannot run around at this point of time in our life. Its better to pay the administration for things like food and other basic needs as it is not possible for us to manage a home. Baldev retired from the Indian Forest Service many years ago and is residing with his wife Daljit Kaur at the home.My wife remains unwell and we cannot manage a house at this age. We have a daughter who is settled abroad. She comes once in a while to visit us. We do not have to worry about small things like the booking of an LPG cylinder, medical facilities and security.

(AP File Photo) In addition to Mosuls so-called right bank, IS still controls a handful of small pockets of Iraqi territory and a swath of Syrias north including the groups self-proclaimed capital, Raqqa. (AP File Photo)Iraqi troops have surrounded western Mosul and military leaders vow its only a matter of time until they crush the last major stand of the Islamic State group in Iraq. But the militants are positioning themselves to defend the remains of its so-called caliphate in Syria and wage an insurgent campaign in Iraq.The extremists are carrying out what looks like an organized, fighting withdrawal: a core of fighters is holding out in the city using hundreds of thousands of civilians as shields, tying down and bleeding the Iraqi military in urban combat.Meanwhile, the Pentagon and Iraqi officials say the senior IS leadership has escaped to regroup in Syria and the deserts along the border to prepare for the future.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThey know they will lose Mosul, but they want this to be a hard fight, said Maj. Saif Ali, a commander in the Iraqi special forces on the front lines.The civilian population is perhaps the main reason IS fighters have been able to hold out so long and turn Mosul into such a grueling battle. It took months for Iraqi forces to drive them out of eastern Mosul while trying to avoid high casualties among residents amid house-to-house battles. Now some 2,000 militants, by a coalition estimate, are holed up in western Mosul with 700,000 civilians. IS fighters are holding most of those civilians hostage as shields, while forcing some to flee as cover for their troops.Mosuls fall will be the biggest blow yet to IS, largely breaking its hold over territory in Iraq and ending its rule over half the caliphate, which at its height stretched from northern Syria through western Iraq. The largest city in IS territory, Mosul provided the group significant financing from taxing the population, factories to make weapons and space to gather freely.But the Islamic State groups durable organization ensures it can fall back to the next fight.The BattlefieldLast weekend, Iraqi forces completely encircled western Mosul by capturing the last road into the enclave of about 40 square kilometers (15 square miles), comprising some of the citys most densely built districts.Any of the fighters who are left in Mosul, theyre going to die there because they are trapped, Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy for U.S.-led coalition against IS, said Sunday.In the month since the assault on the west began, troops have retaken the citys airport, a sprawling military complex, the main government compound and a ribbon of neighborhoods on the southwest side of Mosul. The offensive is being waged from three directions with two divisions of special forces and a force of federal police advancing along the Tigris River, which divides the city into its western and eastern half.Use of artillery and airpower has been dramatically stepped up, mostly by the Iraqi air force. They are causing the real destruction, said federal police Cpl. Abbas Takleef, whose unit retook the government complex last week.Iraqi officers have frequently expressed impatience with extensive vetting of airstrikes required by the U.S.-led coalition to avoid civilian casualties. Recently, the coalition enabled more of its officers on the scene to approve strikes, speeding up procedures.But more intense bombardment could translate into deaths among residents. Airwars, an independent group that tracks casualties from the campaign, said several hundred civilians have been killed in March alone.The CiviliansResidents trapped in western Mosul face dwindling supplies of food and fuel. Limited provisions enter through smuggling routes still in use despite the siege, according to a senior humanitarian official who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.But prices have skyrocketed: the price of a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of sugar has leaped from $1 to more than $20.Bassam and his wife Asma, residents of a western neighborhood just recaptured by Iraqi forces, said they survived because they began stockpiling provisions back in October, before the Mosul assault began. Shops completely ran out of food more than two months ago, they said.The couple asked to only be identified by their first names, fearing for the safety of relatives still under IS rule.Around 50,000 civilians have fled in the past four weeks, according to the United Nations. Escape is incredibly dangerous: IS has threatened to kill anyone caught trying to get out, and residents have to cross dangerous front lines to reach safety.But at times, the militants allow large groups to leave, giving cover for their own fighters to move as well.Ali, the special forces major, said that one night more than 5,000 civilians crossed out through front lines near his position. Soon after, militants who had slipped into government-held territory struck his forces from the rear, hitting a house and nearby school being used by the Iraqi troops. A sniper with a night scope killed a young soldier on the roof of the house, and a rocket-propelled grenade wounded a soldier at the school.The attacks rattled the soldiers as they tried to regroup for the next push, said Lt. Col. Nour Sabah, who was stationed at the school.They are trying to exhaust us, he said.Whats Next For The Islamic State GroupThe well-organized IS counter-attacks point to how the militants are maintaining command and control even as their grip on Mosul falls apart.The Islamic State groups top leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his senior lieutenants escaped Mosul even before the assault on the city began in mid-October, Iraqi and coalition officials believe. They likely went to Raqqa in Syria, though some may have set up in desert hideouts along the border.Theyre not willing to share the risk that they demand of their fighters to fight to the death, U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who heads the U.S.-led coalition against IS, said at a Pentagon press briefing.Also escaping are many middle-rank IS fighters, the rough equivalent of a militarys captains and majors crucial to keeping structure. A lieutenant-colonel with Iraqi intelligence estimated hundreds of IS fighters have fled west Mosul among the civilians. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.Those fighters could form the backbone of an IS rebirth as an insurgent force.From the relative safety within the territory the Islamic State group still holds in Syria and the pockets remaining in Iraq, along with any sleeper cells the militant group has inside Iraqi government-controlled territory, IS can carry out insurgent operations in Iraq including suicide bombings, much as it did before 2014 in its incarnation as al-Qaida in Iraq.From Syria, the group can also plot attacks in the West.The Caliphate will not vanish, IS pledged in an internal publication found north of Mosul by Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a researcher with the Middle East Forum who studies the group.He said the document appeared to anticipate that urban areas like Mosul and Raqqa will be lost.It adopts the idea that the Caliphate does not end with loss of territory, and the West in particular should realize the next generation of the Caliphates soldiers are being nurtured within their borders, al-Tamimi said.Whats Next In The FightThe next likely target is Raqqa, in northern Syria. U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces are trying to cut off supply lines into the city, and U.S. officials have said an assault could begin with weeks. There too, however, the militants are dug in for long and potentially grueling fight.From there, the last stronghold of the militants could be the Deir el-Zour region in eastern Syria, near the border with Iraq.Iraqi forces will likely need weeks of rest and resupply after Mosul. But then the fight will also continue in Iraq to mop up the last pockets held by militants along the border. Also crucial to recapture are Iraqi border crossings still in the militants hands, a step that would crimp  though not completely stop  ISs ability to move supplies and fighters into Iraq.Senior military and intelligence officers warn that addressing Iraqs political divisions will be just as important.In the past, the militants have been able to rebound from defeat by exploiting anger among Iraqs Sunni Arab minority, which feels marginalized by Shiites. And Iraq will have to deal with the monumental task of rebuilding cities destroyed in the fight against IS. Slowness in doing that could fuel Sunni resentment.The U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Doug Silliman, said the next task will fall to the Iraqi government to return services to territory retaken from IS to deliver a lasting defeat to the group, at the Sulaimani Forum earlier this month.The military victories will not be enough, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Nirmal Harindran Radhika Shinde at work. Nirmal HarindranTHE first time she peered into the privates of a goat in Injbaon village, surrounded by the goats incredulous owners, all Sangita Tupe, 30, could see was the shock on the faces around her. Over two years later, she no longer needs to tell villagers that she is a trained entrepreneur working on artificial insemination of goats. Those who laughed at me, who said women shouldnt do such jobs now call me to come urgently when their goat is in heat.Sangita is one of seven women entrepreneurs trained by the Mann Deshi Foundation, based in Mhaswad in Maharashtras Satara district, to artificially inseminate goats. Trained in association with non-profit Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) in Phaltan, Satara, the seven women are now locally called goat doctors, though none studied past Class X. Back in 2013, the women learnt of Mann Deshis new training programme either when they opened accounts at the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank or when the Mann Deshi bus, a mobile training institute offering courses in tailoring, sewing, mehndi etc, stopped in their village.Radhika Shinde, 31, of Panwan village, 12 km from Mhaswad, was eight months pregnant when the big luxury bus showed up. I began to attend tailoring classes secretly, when everybody was at work in the fields. Then one day my father-in-law found out, she giggles. One of the seven sisters, Radhika was married off at the age of 14, in the summer holiday after she completed Class VII. Her parents-in-law were labour contractors for a sugar factory, and family members were all signed up to work as harvesters in the cane-cutting season. Her three childrens education stalled every time the family packed up and moved to the cane belt. She saw an opportunity in 2013 when, amid a severe drought, the goat-breeding class emerged as an option to bring some money home.Farm incomes are never enough now. My husband works as a driver. At first the family didnt want me going around filling semen into goats, but now everyone is proud, Radhika says.The seven women receive an average of 30 calls a month. They visit the goat, check if she is really in heat and carefully inject the semen-straws purchased from NARI for Rs 75 each. Every visit is charged at Rs 150, but if a goat doesnt get pregnant at the first attempt, a second visit is discounted by 50 per cent. The women also earn a monthly salary of Rs 4,000 from Mann Deshi. The semen straws are stored in a special canister of liquid nitrogen, also supplied by NARI. At weekly meetings in Mhaswad, the women update detailed records of every goat inseminated, its breed, the breed of the semen, the item number on the semen straw, the post-gestation results, etc.The seven have inseminated over 3,000 goats; 2,265 have delivered while 400 are currently pregnant. Government veterinarians conduct artificial insemination too, but these women have a higher strike rate, at nearly 85 per cent. We only inject the semen if the conditions are right, and we instruct the owners properly on after-care, including ensuring the goat is kept away from any male goat, says Nanda Jadhav, 30, of Goregaon village.Vanita Shinde of the Mann Deshi Foundation says the programme began with a pilot project in two villages, Jambhulni and Pulkoti, where the organisation selected 25 healthy goats for artificial insemination, conducted free sonographies and kept them in a separate enclosure. The results were excellent: Most bore three kids, yielded more milk and the offspring, at three months, were over twice the average weight of goats born without artificial intervention. In terms of productivity, both for milk and for mutton, artificial insemination brings larger profits to breeders, she says. That the majority of home-based livestock businesses are women-run is a happy coincidence, for their work thus eventually brings more financial autonomy to the village women.Apart from insemination, the women also offer poultry vaccination shots, at Rs 3 a shot. Nanda vaccinated 2,000 chicken last month, adding Rs 6000 to her income. The seven women all have stories of personal struggle, and triumph. Nanda, who has a 11-year-old son, was abandoned by her husband years ago. Sangitas husband works as a construction site painter in Mumbai, while she lives in Injbaon with three children. Rajshri Jadhav, 29, was married in 2003 when she was barely 16 years old, her groom selected at a government-run cattle camp where hundreds of families were camping to avail fodder and water amid a drought.Sangita and Radhika used to work as daily wage labourers under MGNREGA  hours of back-breaking toil. Radhika and Nanda worked as the us-tod kamgaar or sugarcane harvesters, a job that required being away from home for two months at a stretch. Sangitas husband would sometimes borrow a two-wheeler to drop her off. Two years ago, they bought their own Activa. Rajshris husband sold his one-year-old bike for a Scooty, so that his sari-clad wife could ride. He says maajhi bayko doctor aahe (my wife is a doctor), and hes learnt to milk a cow and get some work done at home instead of sleeping all day, she laughs.Villagers in neighbouring areas recognise the women in their lab-coats and badges, carrying their canisters. Those who mocked us now say come in, chaha ghya (have tea); they call us doctor madam, says Sangita. Her own three daughters now in school, Sangita says women who have daughters are still pegged lower in the villages complex social ladder. They scorned me, so I was doubly determined, she says.

593d4f287be9e00e964d57b0,"Animal cruelty cases donâ€™t compel offenders to even come to court, suggests BSPCAÂ data",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/animal-cruelty-cases-dont-compel-offenders-to-even-come-to-court-suggests-bspca-data-4535353/,2017-02-21,"(AP Photo/Andy Wong) (AP Photo/Andy Wong)Animal cruelty cases, which are both bailable and account for scanty fines, dont compel offenders to even come to court, data suggests. Between 2011 and 2016, the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA) has registered over 20,000 cases of animal cruelty at various police stations.However, in 13,089 of these cases, the accused did not appear in court, but still paid the fines. The fines for animal cruelty are too meager for a person to not hesitate to harm a domestic animal again, said Lt. Col (Dr) J C Khanna, BSPCA Secretary. BSPCA, is probably the largest complainant in animal cruelty cases in the city.Watch what else is in the newsThe Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals (PCA) Act 1960 covers all forms of physical torture or abuse against animals. Any such act is punishable for the first time with a fine of Rs 10 which may extend up to Rs 50. The fine for the second offence ranges between Rs 25 and Rs 100.Under the Widlife Act, cruelty to animals like peacocks, which is a non-cognisable and non-compoundable offence, the maximum punishment as per Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, is six years, or a fine of Rs 25,000, or both. In some case the offender is asked by the government to pay Rs 500 but that is the maximum. When we register these cases we try to add as many charges against the offender to increase the fines but the fines are still too little to have any impact, Khanna added.According to data, the number of animal cruelty cases under PCA rose for three years between 2011-13 before showing a decline in the next two years. Khanna attributed this dip to the decision of putting ban on sale or use of a number of animals like bullocks, which were used to transport ice and sugarcane in the city. In 2011, the court cases reported were 3,333, the subsequent years recorded 3,379 and 3,974 cases.In 2014, however, a slump in such cases was noticed and the number stood at 3,083 cases, a further dip to 2,966 was observed in 2015. Interestingly, the number of animal cruelty cases again rose in 2016 with 3,357 cases that went to court.In all of the 20,092 cases registered by BSCPA that went to any Metropolitan magistrate in Mumbai, only 7,003 cases saw convictions.The animal cruelty cases that go to trial only last a maximum of two hearing, depending if the offender doesnt come to court on the first hearing. These cases are very quickly dealt with, where the judge would only ask Gunaah kabool hai? (Do you admit the crime?) and the offender because he has appeared in court says kabool (admit) and pays the fine and the matter is over, Khanna said.The data further indicates that cattle  cows, bullocks, goats, etc  are most cruelly treated. A steady rise in cruelty cases against cattle was observed between 2011-13, with 1,842, 2,189 and 2,957 trials reported respectively.In 2014 and 2015, an average of 2,340 cases went to court. While, the previous year saw 2,862 cases registered for cruelty against cattle. Over Rs 40 lakh has been collected in fines, of which Rs 30 lakh was with BSPCA to pay their employees and treat the injured animals, while the remaining Rs 10 lakh went to the states treasury.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It was a meeting called by Yashpal Malik (of Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti). There are three big khaps in UP: Baliyan Khap led by Chaudhary Naresh Tikait, Desh Khap led by Chaudhary Surender Singh, and Gathwala Khap led by Harkishan Singh. The rest are small khaps of two to four villages. No one from the big khaps of UP came to the (Kharad) rally.Jat farmers and khap leaders seem to be angry with BJP in Shamli-Kairana-Muzaffarnagar belt.Khaps never dabble in politics; khap chaudharis have never entered politics. They never say vote for this party or that. Khap leaders can have personal political views but they never express it as khap leaders. Only once our leader  Mahendra Singh Tikait  had sought votes in the name of Ram. This (Kharad rally) is Yashpal Maliks personal initiative. Dont associate it with khaps.But most Jat leaders we met said the Central government has not taken care of farmers.I agree that farmers are facing problems, particularly sugarcane farmers, but the Centre does not have a direct control over it. We have done whatever we could. Agriculture is a state subject.Jat leaders also say demonetisation has adversely affected them in rabi season. They feel the push for a cashless economy will bring them under income tax net.It is possible (that the government failed to communicate the purpose of demonetisation properly). I am constantly visiting the region (western UP. Others are also going there. Whatever propaganda of this kind (against demonetisation) is there, we will try to do away with it.Jat leaders say that during Muzaffarnagar riots, you stood with them, but later left them to fend for themselves.I request you to go and speak to those who went to jail on whether I stood by them or not.

The situation is likely to lead to migration of more people from the district, which is known for exodus of workers to several parts of the country.The Amadalavalasa cooperative sugar factory has stopped operations long ago. Concost Ferro Industry in Dusi village of Amadalavalasa is reportedly in financial crisis, causing concern among the workers. The granite industry has been in crisis with the new policies of both the Union and the State governments.The East Coast Energy Private Limited (ECEPL) has halted construction activity, as the company is reportedly facing financial troubles due to lack of loan facility from bankers for its proposed thermal project at Kakarapalli of Santabommali mandal. About 5,000 employees used to work in the plant, but the company has retained only 50 persons for its important needs such as fire and security. The State government indicated that it would not allow new thermal projects till 2022. It has halted the proposed Sumitomo thermal power project in Polaki of Srikakulam district. Many jute factories in Rajam and Srikakulam have cut down production with the stiff competition from Bangladesh jute products.Migration of labourAITAM College Professor Chintada Ravikumar, who has done a study over the industrial unrest and migration in the district, urged the government to promote agro-based industries in the backward district. Many people will get jobs in rural areas if the government is willing to extend its support to agro-based industries. Coconut, cashew, sugar and other agricultural products can be encouraged for supply for raw material to the agro-based industries, he felt.Migration of labourers will lead to many socio-economic problems in the district. Children and elderly persons become victims when middle-aged couples leave villages in search of livelihood. It is better to provide incentives for small and medium industries. People will also welcome eco-friendly units, he added.Units need to follow labour lawsCITU State vice-president D. Govinda Rao said workers were always willing to extend their support for the growth of industries when the managements followed the labour laws with a humane approach.Participating in the May Day celebrations in Srikakulam, he said the government was encouraging only dangerous and polluting industries in the district instead of establishing eco-friendly units in rural areas.Migration is always a major concern for the district. More people will leave the district if the government does not take concrete steps to ensure employment in the district itself, Mr. Govinda Rao added."

Farmers have called off the strike.. Government agrees for loan waiver for farmers, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis tweeted.At the meeting of the six-member high-powered committee headed by Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil and farmers representatives including Raju Shetti, MP, of Swabhimani Shetkari Sagathana, Bacchu Kadu, MLA, and Ragunathdada Patil and members of the steering committee spearheading the farmers agitation, it was decided that a joint committee would be formed comprising representatives of the government and farmers, to oversee the implementation of the package.Shetti, however, made it clear that in case the 25 July deadline is not met, the agitation would start from 16 July and would be much severe than what was witnessed spread over last two weeks.Government agrees for loan waiver for farmers. Conditions and detailing will be finalised by a joint committee, said Fadnavis, adding: Farmers and their betterment was, is and will always be this government's top priority.One of the decisions that was taken was that Fadnavis would lead a delegation of farmers leaders and experts to Prime Minister to discuss the implementation of the MS Swaminathan committee recommendations.We have given an in-principle approval for loan waiver for all farmers with certain conditions..it was decided for the loan waiver by 31 October at the meeting presided over by the Chief Minister, Patil said.However, loans of small and marginal farmers have been written off with immediate effect and they shall be entitled to get fresh agricultural loans from Monday, he added.It is not immediately known of the extent of loan waiver in terms of its impact on the state exchequer.The government has agreed to hike the prices of milk and milk cooperatives will have to share profits in the ratio of 70:30 on the lines of the sugar cooperatives.A majority of cases filed against farmers during the past 11 days of strike shall also be withdrawn, said Kadu.

Mahesh Kumar G., who is also head of the Department of Dairy Engineering in the Dairy Science College in the Karnataka Veterinary and Animal and Fisheries Sciences University, has developed this device as part of his Ph.D. thesis submitted to the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal.The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has declared his work as the best Ph.D. thesis in the country for 2015-16, in the category of processing group.The 49-year-olds research goes beyond the multiple use of frying oil as it tackles various fundamental issues associated with it. Explaining the chemical reactions involved in the process of frying, he says the heating temperature should not cross 120 degrees centigrade while frying any of the dishes as that may result in degradation of oil and release of various unhealthy components such as acrylamide, which has carcinogenic and neurotoxic properties.What has caused concern among the scientific community is that frying temperatures in an average Indian kitchen and commercial kitchens generally cross 150C.In the conventional method, water can be removed through frying only at 100C. However, through this device, it is possible to remove water at 45C itself, Mr. Kumar notes.The idea of opting for vacuum is to prevent air during the process of frying, as oxidation needs air.The device has a tray at the bottom for placing the frying oil and another tray above it for keeping the food items to be fried. After placing them in their slots, the doors are closed so that the air is removed to create a vacuum, he explains. Later, the process of heating the oil and tilting the top tray to place the food items in the oil will take place automatically, Mr. Kumar says.The oxidation process that takes place when the frying temperatures exceed the limit also leads to creation of transfats which may affect the health of the heart, he says.Another benefit is that the device reduces the oil uptake (consumption of oil) by about 40% when compared with the conventional frying method. An experiment he conducted with frying of gulab jamuns using this device also showed that they soak up sugar solution in just around 10 minutes as against the conventional method which requires an optimum soaking time of a few hours.Experts believe that Mr. Kumars innovation can change the processing scenario due to the savings in terms of reuse of oil, and health benefits.Already, there are several enquiries for this device from various companies, including public laboratories and the corporate sector, says Mr. Kumar, who hails from an agricultural family in Tiptur of Tumakuru district.He has only developed a technology for manufacture of such a device, and companies or entrepreneurs can use the technology for mass production. The experimental development of the device, which is more suitable for industrial use due to the large capacity for frying, has cost him about Rs. 8.5 lakh. However, I am confident that it is possible to reduce the cost considerable through mass production, he says, adding that a smaller device can also be developed to suit domestic purposes.The industry too has warmed up to his innovation as the F1rst, a business associate of Swiss-based organisation GIRACT, has honoured him with the Best Ph.D. thesis award.As part of this award, Nestle Research and Tata Trusts have given him a total cash prize of Rs. 2.5 lakh."

Post an eight-hour surgery in which perforated ulcers and a tumour were removed along with her stomach five years ago, the 40-year-old feels that she has got a second shot at life.Three years ago, the then technologically-challenged Diddee got on Instagram, thanks to a friend who created an account for her and insisted that she post the dishes she was cooking up. Thats how @thegutlessfoodie began. Diddee started cooking and posting her creations online: they feature fancily plated foods cooked by her, accompanied by the recipe and an interesting narrative. Diddee created a Facebook group with the same name to get people to share age-old recipes that have slipped from the popular memory. I wanted to eat clean. I wanted to eat forgotten things, things made from scratch, she says. About 3,793 posts on IG and three years later, her page has over 35,500 followers.Food with purposeFrom East Indian bottle masala chicken to fried eggplant, dragons-breath baked chicken and even chutney yams, Diddee cooks (and eats) easy-to-make food. Most of the posts also have engrossing back-stories. Every recipe on this page can be prepared in under 30 minutes, Diddee says, despite each dish looking more delicious than the next. Every recipe serves a purpose. For instance, the Chettinad style chicken and egg curry has a low score on the glycaemic index, something that health-conscious people would appreciate, she says.Now a seasoned Instagrammer, Diddee begins with the pictures of the ingredients she is working with. These are photographed against a shocking white background, a professional effect thanks to her stark white kitchen counter. The cooking starts only once the perfect image is captured. One such striking image is that of the Malabar sambar in the making, in which the raw produce is artfully arranged.

Even though her condition ensures she eats about eight to 10 meals of tiny portions, the servings are professionally meant for two.Future plansNow, Diddee takes up assignments as a food stylist and recipe developer. For the former, brands ask her to style their shoots. For the latter, they invite her to use their product and create recipes with the same.She also reviews menus of new restaurants on invitation.

Patil, MLA from Aland, has opposed the State governments Patala Gange project aimed at drilling earth deeper into the magma layer for water to meet drinking water requirements in arid regions.Addressing a media conference here on Tuesday, Mr. Patil said that the initiative was completely unscientific and it would have an adverse impact on nature.He suggested that the government have a dialogue with environmentalists, activists involved in water conservation, scientists and other stakeholders before implementing the plan.We should live with nature in harmony. Antagonising nature for meeting our endless needs would definitely have an adverse impact. The government should involve premier institutes such as the Indian Institute of Science, experts involved in water conservation and nature and other stakeholders before implementing the plans, he said.Responding to Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister H.K. Patils comments on the project, Mr. B.R. Patil said that Aland was a semi-arid region where drinking water requirements could be met through projects utilising surface water.The Minister recently said that the government planned to implement the Patala Gange scheme in Aland and Indi taluks that dont receive rainfall. But, the reality is that Aland receives good rainfall.

Patil appealed to the Deputy Commissioner to intervene in the matter and ensure that the farmers received the money for the crop they had supplied to the factory.The locked-out factory may seek permission to sell sugar stocks in the factory for clearing the dues. The government should not heed any such demands as the factory is known for not keeping its promises, he said.To a question, Mr. B.R. Patil said that 12 MLAs, including himself, and seven from the Janata Dal (S), will shortly join the Congress.

The body, tasked by the Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI), which is a Union Health Ministry body, has also advocated a ban on advertisements promoting foods high in FSS (fat, salt, sugar) during TV shows and channels aimed at children. In fact, we should progress towards a total ban, as being done in a few other countries like Chile. Celebrity endorsements of such foods need to be discouraged, says the report on the FSSAI website.WHO guidelinesThe 11-member committee has compiled existing scientific literature on the consumption of fats, sodium and sugar in foods, across socio-economic groups in the country, and endorsed that the proportions of these food constituents not exceed guidelines by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).A salient finding was that Low Income Groups (LIG) reportedly consumed more fried snacks and sweets than High Income Groups (HIG) and, the highest consumption of bakery items was in slums, said a study on urban populations cited in the report.Detailed labels mustThe panel also recommended that all packaged food carry detailed labels specifying the energy value in kcal (kilo calories); the amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fat; and the amount of any other nutrient for which a nutrition or health claim is made. If relevant, the label should also specify the amount or type of fatty acids or the amount of cholesterol, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids in gram (g) and cholesterol in milligram (mg), the panel said. While many companies provide a breakdown on the nutritional constituents, they are not systematically enforced.Taxation is not within the remit of FSSAI, Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI, told The Hindu , but several of these recommendations are being put in place. The FSSAI is yet to enforce a long standing order that requires food companies to ensure no more than 5% of the daily calorie requirement of their products derives from fats."

From there, he moved to Delhi, and then eventually to Mumbai settling in Sion, in what came to be popularly known as Mini Punjab owing to the community re-settled there.Starting a businessIn 1955, his son Karnail, along with his brother, Surjit, started a small thela selling fish Koliwada. The popularity of the dish encouraged them to open a small eatery in 1970 that only offered 10-15 items.The familys third generation, the 30-year-old Harmeet, remembers running to the shop after school with his elder brother Parvinder (32) and cousins Jagjit and Gurcharan. My grandfather fed us jhinga pao, and my mouth waters thinking of the dish, recalls Harmeet, adding that by then, his father had started a catering business that led to the launch of their first Mini Punjab restaurant in Bandra in 1991. Till date, the Bandra outlet is a converging point for party-goers in the suburbs for its rolls and kebabs. Today Mini Punjab has outlets in Powai, Thane, Sion and Bhiwandi.The familys third generation that is Harmeet, along with his brother and cousin, have now launched Turban Tales, a small plates bar concept to keep up with the times.A new menuFor a family steeped in food, the only tough part about setting up Turban Tales was creating a cocktail menu as none of them drink. On our visit, we try out two cocktails. Since its a Punjabi eatery, we must have a sugarcane drink, so we order Amarsar to Thailand (Rs. 350), a white rum concoction with sugarcane juice, galangal, kaffir and mint leaves. Its not too sour, and the sugarcane compliments the stiffness of white rum and sourness from the lime. We also try thekke da bag (Rs. 400), a whisky, apricot liqueur, pineapple juice, hibiscus syrup and sour mix. It comes topped with a jasmine-vanilla foam. While the syrupy sweetness jars our palate, we love the apricot liqueur.Harmeet, who has worked on the menu, says hes included his favourite dish, the aforementioned jhinga pao. I am doing a mini pao, but I have kept the taste authentic with a besan coating with lots of ajwain, he says.A caterers children will always join him, as there is always shortage of hands. I remember helping my dad after college, where he would make me oversee operations. Koi kaam chota nahi hota, he would tell me. Till date, we step in as chefs, servers and waiters when there is a need, smiles Harmeet, It is our duty to ensure our customers are served fresh food, he says, offering us a portion of tikka supreme.While we chat, we dig into a DIY makke tartlets and sarson da saag (Rs. 239). Their take on the classic saag dish is delicious but wed prefer the roti any day over a floury tartlet.The tikka supreme (Rs. 235) is a charcoal crusted tandoori chicken, moist inside, its hollow oozing with mozzarella cheese. A simple dish, we stop only once the last tikka has been devoured. Vegetarians can enjoy the reshmi soy champ, a smoked chunky bite and tikka momos that come stuffed with cottage cheese and onions. We crave for some spice in the mixture, which is provided by the hand-ground chutney on the side, an old family recipe.All in the familyParvinder, who also runs a vegetarian health caf in Vile Parle East, Garde Manger, apart from running catering and manning the Bandra outlet of Mini Punjab, joins us. My grandfather spoke Pastho, which we didnt understand. So we learnt by watching him. In those days, my father used to sell one kilo of fish for four rupees, with a profit margin of at least one rupee. I burnt my hand in boiling water when I had accompanied my father to a catering event. I was in the sixth standard. My mother was furious, and kept me home for a few years then, he laughs, adding, My friends used to go out and chill, but I would be with dad helping him out. Harmeet adds, We hardly have many photographs of outings with dad. Now, it is our duty to take him out.The brothers Karnail Singh and Surjit Singh remember how difficult and challenging the food business was back then because of the increase in the catering business and dealing with a new restaurant launch at the same time. But they are happy today, It feels great to see how the younger generation has taken charge of things and are offering newer things to our patrons, says Karnail.Turban Tales, Powai; 25708633, 9321158688; 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m. daily."

It allows assignment of certain State taxes to local bodies.The reimbursement to the local bodies will be compounded by 8% every year. The compensation will be paid on or before 5th of every month. Special attention has been given to the BMC as the Bill has the provision of withdrawing the monthly amount with State credit from banks, if the State fails to deposit the fixed amount by 5th.Even as Finance Minister Sudhir Munguntiwar tries hard to please the Shiv Sena by promising timely reimbursement to the BMC after the GST, doubts have been raised since the State treasury is facing trouble.Additional burdenWith implementation of the seventh pay commission a necessity, the State will have an additional annual burden of Rs. 15,000 crore. Adding it to the money spent on salaries and pensions, the State will be spending around Rs. 1.25 lakh crore annually.As per this years budget, the loan amount against the State is already reaching Rs. 4 lakh crore. We have additional expenditures, which cannot be skipped. And once the GST is implemented, we will have to compensate the local body tax to over 26 municipal corporations, said an official from the finance department.Interestingly, the upcoming session will be only the second instance since independence when the Assembly will work on Sunday (May 21).

I am strict, but parents fight with me, asking why children should not be allowed to eat food from home, she says. We are not an affluent enough school to have a canteen, so there is a limit to how much we can control what children bring.Meera Isaacs, principal at Cathedral and John Connon School, says, As students get to higher classes, they do not want to eat healthy food. Fruits and milk have no takers; channa, kaathi rolls, pizza, chips and sandwiches have better appeal. We will have to change these eating patterns. I wonder how much luck we will have.Our canteen is good, said Ujwala Zare, principal of Gopalji Hemraj High School. It has no problem in terms of cleanliness, but it still depends on how much children will show interest in government-approved food.Destroy vitaminsBina Chheda, clinical dietician at Cumbala Hill Hospital, says, Colas bind together B-complex vitamins; ingredients added for colour or to make a dish cook faster also destroy B-complex vitamins. She says that ideal meals for children involve carbohydrates, fibre, vitamins and protein.Foods like biscuits are high on glucose and generate short-term energy spikes but do not give any sustenance says Krushmi Chheda, sports nutritionist. During puberty, bones and muscular growth are hampered. Lower attention spans and lethargy become common. She says a good example of a balanced meal is rajma chawal: proteins, carbohydrates, essential fats, and fibre.Limiting access to junk food is good, admits Pranav Vaidyanathan, a student at Dhirubai Ambani High School. Because given the choice of junk food and a healthy lunch, I dont know how many of us would be able to control ourselves."

He also claimed that his next expose will rattle the people of Delhi who trusted the AAP.The leader started his indefinite strike on Tuesday, demanding that the partys national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal reveal the details of the foreign trips made by five of his close aides.Dehydration strikesMr. Mishra is going into dehydration because of poor salt intake. His blood sugar level has dropped to 81mg/dL. His pulse and blood pressure levels also low. In such a situation, intravenous fluids need to be started immediately, said Dr. Javed Salam Khan from Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, the head of the team of doctors that examined the former Minister.Dr. Khan added that Mr. Mishra might also suffer from heat exhaustion.Though he has been drinking water, it is not enough to make up for the essential salts that he is losing. Further, he is surrounded by a lot of people radiating body heat, Dr. Khan said. Refusing to give up, Mr. Mishra said he would continue with the strike until the AAP gave answers to his questions.I did not start this strike thinking it would be a cakewalk. Especially for a person like me, who has never stayed hungry, this is definitely difficult. But the cause that I am fighting for is greater than any hunger or thirst. When I think of the outcome of this and how it will benefit my people and my country, I do not feel any discomfort, Mr. Mishra told The Hindu .Letter for KejriwalIn the evening, he visited the Mahatma Gandhi memorial in Rajghat, where he got emotional. I came here to seek answers from Bapu , Mr. Mishra said after meditating at the memorial for over 30 minutes with his wife.Earlier in the day, the former Minister released a letter written by his mother to Mr. Kejriwal.How many lies, Arvind [Kejriwal]? How many?... Lies will not help you. Be afraid of God, wrote Annapoorna Mishra, former Delhi Mayor.The letter continued, I never thought my son would ask you questions and you would avoid themwhenever I met you, you always talked about probity in public life.Mr. Mishras mother added that she was proud of her son and his protest against corruption."
593ded8f7be9e00dabcc6742,Areca nut scene bleak in Marayur,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/areca-nut-scene-bleak-in-marayur/article18381346.ece,2017-05-04,"It is now harvesting season for areca nut in Marayur, where the crop made a slow entry into the sugarcane field only to turn into a major crop.The high production, shortage of water, low initial investment, and labour cost attracted many sugarcane farmers to convert their land into areca nut farms. Now, it is being widely cultivated in Alackampetty, Chinnavara, Kuttanadu, Pattom Colony, Mashi, Kovilkadavu and Karshanadu.Severe winds during 18 days in a year in Marayur and uncongenial situations for cultivation certain crops were some of the reasons farmers largely shifted to areca nut cultivation. Also, when harvesting season in Kasargod and Malappuram ends, it starts in Marayur. This fetches a better market price for Marayur areca nut, which is also better in terms of size and colour.However, this year, the quality was affected owing to the drought situation. Farmers feared further drop in prices as the harvesting progressed in the coming weeks.Somasekharan, a farmer at Pattom Colony told The Hindu on Tuesday, that the price per kg last week was Rs. 55. The farmers fear that the prices would drop as the harvesting is extended to June/July.The usual practice in Marayur is that businessmen from Malappuram and Nedumangadu reach there with areca palm climbers and fix the price on farms. The farmers need not bother about the climbers or those who remove the fruit from the sheaths.The local women are employed to separate the fruit from the bunches. The price was fixed considering the labour cost of tree climbers and the women workers, said Mr Somasekharan and added that a price above Rs. 50 was considered profitable.However, the fluctuating prices are a concern for the farmers, he said and added that two years ago, the prices reached Rs. 110 per kilogram.The areca nut farmers were faced with shortage of water as a dry spell was prevailing in Marayur, a rainshadow area. The farmers shifted from sugarcane cultivation to areca nut mainly because of shortage of water. The ground water level considerably fell over the years in addition to the poor rainfall in northeast monsoon, the main rainfall season there.Change in rainfallThe farmers of Marayur shift to cultivation in accordance with the change in the rainfall trends, which has an impact on ground water level. Years ago, we had enough rainfall and the main crop was paddy. With the rainfall decline, farmers shifted to sugarcane and now to areaca nut, he added.The main crops varieties are Mangala, Kuzhimangala and Kasargoden. A single palm could fetch up to six bunches of areca nuts in Marayur. This all depended on the fertilser application and water availability, he said. The usual growth period of areca palm is four to six years. In comparison to sugar cane, there is no cost involved in terms of labour. Even if the prices are not attractive, it would not bring losses to the farmers, said Chandran, another farmer based at Kovilkadavu. He said while selecting the crop to be cultivated, one should be aware of the weather factors.India accounted for the largest production of areca nut with Kerala placed second after Karnataka."

So, it is literally women running the country, says celebrity chef Ranveer Brar sharing an interesting nugget about the tropical country comprising 115 islands.Starting this Thursday, Twitter India will launch the second season of #RanveerOntheRoad, capturing Seychelles culinary traditions and culture through the chefs travel and food experiences. When people talk of Seychelles, they talk about the beaches and beauty. Through #RanveerOnTheRoad, were trying to bring alive the culture of the place and intrigue potential travellers through video and conversation on the platform, says Brar. The series will feature 15 videos, with a duration of three minutes each  that will range from covering a restaurant Bonbon plume on Anse Lazio Beach named after its French chef to exploring Curieuse Island.Weve tried to cover various aspects of Seychelles through food, lifestyle and rituals, says Brar, adding that the concept of Seychellois Creole cuisine, is a combination of European French and native African cuisine, particularly famous in the archipelago of Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Madagascar.The first season of the short-form native Twitter video series, #RanveerOnTheRoad, featured Chef Ranveers journey through Australia. His follower base has grown nearly four times since the first series launch to over 1.3 million followers on Twitter since. Keya Madhvani, head of music and lifestyle partnerships, Twitter India, tells us over a phone call from the US, The success of #RanveerOnTheRoad Season 1 prompted the conversation around Seychelles. It created an opportunity for us to look at video along with food on Twitter, in a way that hadnt happened before. The real success was that it sparked a new kind of format, as a short and episodic, food and video travel series on Twitter, which was a first in India, To underscore this with numbers, there are more than five million mentions of travel on Twitter every month and more than 10 million mentions of food.To be aired at 11 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday, the three-minute video stories will follow Brar as he interacts with the oldest Indian family in Seychelles, watches a 380-year-old turtle lay eggs and comes across the biggest fruit in the world, coco de mer. It weighs 60 kilos and the Seychelles Tourism Board were kind enough help me carry the fruit back, Brar shares.Coco de mer is like a coconut, but you cant cook with it unlike a coconut. But we cooked some traditional breadfruit recipes. Usually, Indians use it to cook like a vegetable or fry it into chips. But, the Seychellois toss the entire fruit into the fire and roast it. Then, you scoop it out and eat it with coconut oil and sugar. Their version of coconut jaggery was a delicious addition to the food too, elaborates Brar, adding that he devoured the tropical countrys mouth-watering tropical fruits like mangoes, golden apples, and soursop often used in Seychellois food.Jock fish and octopus salad were on the list of dishes chef tried his hand at. The most amazing things we cooked was with the fruit dak, a fruit dak curry and a parfait. Interestingly, the spices are similar to India. They use a lot of cinnamon leaves, and even wrap butter in it. This was my [biggest] takeaway from my trip. [And] I have been using it in my cooking it since, says Brar, who is already planning the third season of his show. Come June, Brar will pack his bags for Turkey to shoot the third season of #ranveerontheroad."

Nandini (21), the boys mother, hailing from a humble background in Arantangi in Pudukottai district, the child was born two weeks before the expected date at a private hospital in Madurai in March this year and weighed just 1.2 kilograms at birth.The boy was also diagnosed with blood sugar level of around 500 milligram (mg) per decilitre (dL) as against the normal 60 to 70 mg per dL. The disease is quite rare. It occurs roughly to one child in every two to three lakh births, said N. Muthukumaran, Associate Professor, Department of Neonatology, GRH.Ms. Nandini said that though they were given treatment at the private hospital for nearly three weeks after birth, they later shifted to the GRH since they could not afford the treatment cost.Dr. Muthukumaran said that the child required continuous monitoring of blood sugar and administration of adequate units of insulin. The boy now weighs 1.34 kilograms and is doing relatively better. The same treatment regimen, however, will have to continue, he added.Stating that the probability was high for the disease to be caused by a genetic mutation, doctors at the GRH said the blood sample of the infant had already been sent by the private hospital to a laboratory in the United Kingdom for genetic testing since the test was not available in India at an advanced level.K. Mathiarasan, Director, Institute of Child Health and Research Centre, GRH, said the genetic testing was crucial to identify if the disease was due to some problem in the genes. If it is due to genes, then it will be a Permanent NDM, which means the child has to live with the disease throughout life. On the other hand, if it is not due to genes, then there are chances that problem might dissipate completely or become transient as the child grows up, he said. Stating that consanguineous marriage was a primary contributor for the disease, Dean M.R. Vairamuthu Raju said such marriages should be avoided for the well-being of the offsprings."

Of the 42 students, only one managed to pass the exam.Deteriorating resultsSarpanch Shiv Chand said anger over deteriorating results over the past few years finally drove the parents to lock-up the school premises.While the rich can send their children to private schools, the poor cannot afford it. They too want quality education for their children and government schools are their only hope. But the education system is in complete shambles in Nuh. The middle school in our village with a strength of over 400 students only has one teacher. Middle class students in the high school cant count. We had raised the matter with the school headmistress and teachers, but there has been no improvement, said Mr. Chand.The school remained locked for over two hours and the villagers relented only after Ferozepur Jhirka Block Education Officer Sugar Singh took responsibility for the poor results and assured the parents of corrective measures.Mr. Singh conceded that the headmistress and school teachers were to be blamed for the results. However, he added, students in the lower classes were promoted under social pressure, leading to poor results in the board exams.The education system is such that segregation of students is not done before Class X. Students are promoted from one class to another under social pressure and they fail to perform in the board exams, added Mr. Singh.Acute staff shortageThe Block Education Officer also blamed acute staff shortage for the dipping level of education in the district. Almost 70% vacancies for Trained Graduate Teachers for Classes VI to VIII have been lying vacant in Nuh for the past several years, while appointment of Junior Basic Training teachers remains stuck in a legal tangle for nearly three years now, he said.District Education Officer Dinesh Shastri said that 16 high schools in Nuh dont have a single teacher for classes beyond Class V, making it difficult to teach senior students.We have sought explanation of the teachers concerned in the present case. Action would be initiated against them, said Mr. Shastri."

The group has interests in sugar, fertilizers, cycles, engineering, financial services, general insurance, rubber and others.For fiscal 2016-17, the groups turnover rose 2.1% to Rs. 30,023 crore against Rs. 29,395 crore posted a year earlier.

An appreciating rupee also contributed to the growth.Normally, when we cross 90% of capacity utilisation level, we will start build up for the future, he said. Last year, some of the divisions achieved capacity utilisation of 75% and this year with reasonable monsoon, we might be doing 85-90%. Our investment plan gets triggered when our capacity utilisation goes above 80%. We will come out with investment plan during the second half of 2017-18, he said.On capital expenditure, Mr. Vellayan said: Last year we made an investment of Rs. 396 crore and this year it would be driven mostly by individual companies.Regarding silicon carbide unit in Russia, Mr. Vellayan said they were looking at expanding the capacity.

I belong to the mountain group, but I have increasingly been thinking that the sea has its special lures  mainly the food.There is something about the image of the fisherman going to the sea before the break of dawn  and returning with a haul of fresh fish. Just the thought of a fresh catch makes me want to make a quick trip to Goa or Cochin, for some prawns tossed in butter and coated with freshly ground pepper, or perhaps a grilled pomfret flavoured with garlic, red chillies and lemon juice.But if you cant go to the sea, let the sea come to you. A Delhi restaurant serving coastal food brings you an array of dishes that you would find in the western and southern coast. Sana-di-ge  which is the Tulu word for the brass lamp that you would find in many houses in the south  is in the Malcha Marg market.Friends and relatives who had eaten there had raved about it. And then last week, I went there for lunch  and found that the food was indeed as good as I had heard.The official Address of the restaurant is 22/48 Commercial Centre, Chanakyapuri (Phone numbers: 011-40507777 and 7042794546). But old-timers would call it the Malcha Marg market.Its a beautifully done up place, spread over three floors. Our server was a pleasant young man with a nice, warm baritone, who helped us navigate the vast menu.I had been invited there, so there was quite a spread. I turned down the offer for drumstick soup, and focused on the appetisers. The mushroom pepper fry  with fresh pepper and curry leaves (Rs. 395) was excellent, but I found the sauce in the baby corn butter pepper garlic (Rs. 275) a bit too thick.I enjoyed the anjal (seer fish) tawa fry (Rs. 875). The fish was firm, and had been coated with all kinds of spices and then grilled. The chicken ghee roast  marinated chicken chunks with freshly ground spices and roasted in ghee (Rs. 545)  had the unmistakable flavour of ghee and garlic. But what I enjoyed the most was mamsa pepper fry (Rs. 575)  boneless lamb pepper cooked with pepper and curry leaves. The meat was soft, the spices were sharp and fragrant, and the taste was outstanding.I thought I couldnt eat any more after all that, but gamely carried on  having a taste of their vegetable stew (Rs. 345) with appam (Rs. 125) and Goan fish curry (Rs. 845) with neer dosa (Rs. 125). We also tried out a Malabar style prawn (Rs. 745), which was spicy but not chilli hot. I enjoyed the Goan fish curry, too  for the sauce had a distinct tangy taste. I was told that most of the fish is flown in fresh every day.But I think the crown of the meal went to the sweet dish  eleneer payasum  sweetened coconut cream with the pulp of tender coconut (Rs. 345). It was an outstanding dish  deliciously cool and creamy, and with just the right amount of sugar in it.To Delhiites far from the sea, Sana-di-ge gives an alluring whiff of the sea and the treasure that it holds. I have eaten and enjoyed the food at Swagath and Dakshin in Saket, which also serve coastal food. Sana-di-ge, which is just about a year old, is the latest to join the small group of coastal food restaurants in Delhi. And it warms the cockles of my heart."

So, consumers in these two States will pay less once the 5% GST is introduced, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said.It also said it would not make a difference to consumers in other States."

Four tax slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% have been fixed for services including telecom, insurance, hotels and restaurants.Expressing disappointment, the hospitality sector said the rates are too complex, high and uncompetitive, and said they will be approaching Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely and Union Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma for a review of the rates. The GST Council announced that non-AC restaurants will charge 12% GST on food, AC restaurants and those with liquor licence 18% per cent, and five star hotels will charge a GST of 28%.Dilip Datwani, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association, Western India (HRAWI) told The Hindu , The government should realise that taxes in neighbouring countries like Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia range between 5% and 10%. We cannot afford to have this complex and high-rate GST. This is simply not viable. Tourists will simply skip India.Not done, say hoteliersA major hurdle for the hospitality and tourism sector in India is its uncompetitive tax structure, says former HRAWI president Bharat Malkani. A country as small as Singapore gets 10.9 million tourists, while India gets 6.31 million. Nations like Malaysia and Thailand attracted 24.7 million and 19.09 million tourists in 2014 and earned foreign exchange worth $18.3 billion and $26.26 billion respectively. In contrast, India managed only $94 million.Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, senior vice-president, HRAWI said hospitality is not only a high foreign exchange grosser, it is also among the largest tax generators. By the Prime Ministers own declarations, the growth of the nation will parallel the growth of tourism. Its perplexing that the industry is being taxed to death. If GST is not reconsidered, foreign exchange inflow will dry up sooner than later.Hotels and lodges charging per-day tariff of Rs. 1,000 will be exempt from GST, while those charging up to Rs. 2,000 per day will pay 12%. Hotels charging Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 5,000 will pay 18%, and those with per-day tariffs above Rs. 5,000 will be levied GST of 28%.Academicians for GSTGST is the biggest reform this year, says Prof. Neeraj Hatekar, who teaches Economics at the University of Mumbai. He predicts that GST will create a common market for goods and services, reduce the aggregate tax burden as tax on taxes is being done away with. We should not worry about the inflationary impact; its not going to be much. It will increase economic activity in the economy leading to more jobs, more activity and faster growth. Hence, in the long run it will positively affect the common man. All industries should be happy with this reform.Foodgrains and milk are exempt and essential items of mass consumption like edible oil, sugar, tea, life-saving drugs and electricity bills should cost less. However, its too early to predict GSTs overall effect on the common man; at least he will be spared the assault of multiple taxation. says Prof. Geeta Menezes, who teaches Economics at Mithibai College."
593df7327be9e00dabcc6fb5,The mane entrepreneurs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-mane-entrepreneurs/article18512333.ece,2017-05-20,"At 6 every morning the Narikuravars set out to collect human hair. The peripatetic gypsies, who liken themselves to Adivasis, live in Wagariyar Colony, near Kannamangalam gate outside Arcot town, about 120 km south-west of Chennai. The men and women leave on two-wheelers  mostly mopeds, and some motorcycles, many with loudspeakers fitted on the handlebars. Sometimes they head to a town as far as 50 km away. Once they reach their destination, they divide the streets among themselves, combing for hair, street by street. Some push their vehicles, switch on a taped message that blares out of the speaker:  Sikkumudi , sikkumudi , nooru gramme sikkumudi noor ruba , paththu gramme sikkumudi patthu ruba, sikku mudi ... (Comb waste hair, comb waste hair, we buy comb waste hair, hundred grams for hundred rupees, fifty grams for fifty rupees. We will weigh it and take it. Dont worry. Our weight is true. We buy even 10 grams of hair you dont need. We buy grey hair too.They collect hair from women in villages and towns who preserve strands that get tangled in the teeth of combs, or hair which falls in clumps, rolling it into small balls called  chutti . These they periodically exchange for money, aluminium vessels or fancy items  which could be anything from a hairband, hairpins, brooches, comb, small mirrors. When the hair collectors come, the women bring the chutti out for exchange. Fallen human hair keeps these collectors alive. When the pickings are poor, the Narikuravars find a tree under which they can sleep and try their luck elsewhere in the afternoon when the sun is less torrid.There is money in hair. Each year India exports Rs. 3,500 crore worth of human hair. Most of the worlds hair business, 70% of it, is in synthetic hair. The Indian exports are 80% of the worlds supply of two types of human hair. Remy hair, the longer hair, which is temple offerings made in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, especially in Tirupati by women who are part of the 18 million devotees who throng there every year and offer their hair to Lord Venkateswara. Women in south India maintain their hair well, use less henna than their counterparts elsewhere, oil their hair every day. Good hair also depends on good water and good food. Hair in Tirupati is auctioned every Thursday at 1 p.m. fetching revenue of about $10 million every year. Tirupati alone accounts for 40% of the Remy hair that is exported. Remy hair is only a fraction of the hair trade. The bulk of it is in non-Remy hair, which is collected by people like Devagopi in Wagariyar Colony.On the hair trailIt is a little after four on a Friday afternoon when we reach Wagariyar Colony, which has two streets and 65 houses, many with red crosses marked on the white walls. Right in the middle of the street, milling with activity, is spread a large, blue burlap mat on which people are sitting in a circle. A man in white shirt, vibhuti streaking his forehead, makes entries in a notebook, doing his maths on a blue calculator held together by rubber band. In front of him is a pair of weighing scales. By his side is a bag of human hair that he is about to assess and weigh. The weights, 10 grams upwards all the way to a kilo, crowd round his knees and ankles. This man is Palani, a hair collector one rung removed from the bottom of the chain of collectors. On Fridays and Tuesdays superstition prevents women from giving their fallen hair away, and today Palani has to make do with only two kilos. These Narikuravars give their hair mostly to Palani, nowadays for Rs. 3,400 per kilo. He collects 50 kilos of hair per month to supply up the chain.It is people like Devagopi who are at the bottom of the chain. He is philosophical about life. So long as we have noses, there will be snot. Nowadays, the pickings are poor. If each of us manages to collect even 200 grams of hair, it is a lot, he says. They have to cover as many as 10 villages, street by street, for a fistful of hair. Each village, by his count, has about a hundred houses. The bigger villages have more. The most Devagopi has collected in a single day is three kilos. But that is some years ago, in Red Hills outside Chennai.The collection chainThe bigger hair collectors sit in Gudiyatham, two hours away from Wagariyar Colony, at Puliar Koil Theru, Pandar Colony. There are 10 houses here, two stories tall, each building touching the other. Abutting the very first house is a 4 feet x 6 feet room with metal-slotted shelves along three walls on which sit vessels seven shelves high, all the way up almost to the ceiling. There are steel vessels, small bowls, airtight containers with lids, steel containers with long curving handles, plastic balls, mugs, cups. These Govindan Anandan, 54, exchanges for hair. His parents captured the poramboke land for which the late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran gave away pattas . Here, living in thatched huts, Anandan kept pigs. He began dealing with hair much later. It gave enough money to him and his brother, Kumar, who had sold chicken, to build a dream house for each, fifty-one feet deep so the other end of the house opened to the street in the back. It is here he parks the red Toyota Innova he bought second-hand for Rs. 5 lakh five years ago and has a driver who takes him around Tamil Nadu, collecting hair.Anandan travels to Thiruvannamalai, Arani, Arcot, down to the tip of the peninsula, Kanyakumari and to Pollachi, from where he brings hair from Kerala, prized for its lustre and good health. Today is Friday and he wont be using his weighing machine, which sits gleaming by the staircase, spotted reverentially with sandalwood and kunkumam (vermillion) marks. He is oblivious to the gurgling of his grandson, all of four months old, who watches wide-eyed over the shoulder of his mother Yogalakshmi. Up on the first floor, Anandan and his wife show us their collection, all packed in white burlap sacks, some 110 kilos of hair. At Rs. 3,400 per kilo they will get over Rs. 3,74,000 for it.Kamal, from Perambur in Chennai, who they regularly supply to, has paid an advance of Rs. 10 lakh to ensure the hair keeps coming in. The most Anandan has collected in a day is one tonne of human hair. His brother Kumars operation is much more modest. Kumars youngest son, Hari, has dropped out of school to help his father. Every day they set out in Haris motorcycle. The son drops the father off in a faraway town to forage for hair and ranges further afield, meeting up back at home, the father finding a bus to head back.There are smaller collectors: By the main road, east of Vellore, in Wallajahpettai, Ekambaram is drying hair on the road, his lungi hitched up almost to his chest, his shirt wet with sweat. Kamal examines the hair being dried, and then goes into the room where Ekambaram, 67, has lived alone since his wife died eight years ago, paying a rent of Rs. 500 per month. Ekambaram has been buying hair since 1965 when it sold for Rs. 7 a kilo, going around on a bicycle exchanging chikku mudi (ball of comb waste hair) with sticky sweets he made, heating a kilo or two of sugar till it became liquid, pouring it into a plate coated with oil, mixing it with colour, waiting for it to cool and shaping it into stick sweets to hand out to children and women in exchange for hair.Kamal has given an advance of Rs. 50,000 to keep Ekambaram incentivised. In the room he sleeps, there are calendars with pictures of gods and a heap of hair which he has brought from conservancy workers in Vellore. Kamal sorts through the hair separating them into two heaps and weighs them separately  two kilos and two hundred grams in all. They haggle good-naturedly over the price of the smaller pile of hair. Later he takes out some of the hair and asks if there is anything noticeably unusual about it. To touch it is like any other black chutti hair but to Kamals expert eyes this is grey hair that has been coloured black, hair which sells for far less, about Rs. 1,200 per kilo. He keeps rubbing some strands of hair between his thumb and index finger and shows us the fingers. They have faint traces of black now. Half the trick in this trade is to identify chutti hair that has been dyed just by a quick glance.Kamal remembers the most he has collected in a week: six tonnes. A couple of years ago, his stock was tight, and there was demand. Kamal removed the seats from the back of his Tata Sumo, and along with a helper, took off on a giant sweeping circle driving through small villages and then towns and cities, Rajampettah, Kadapa, Ongole, Vellore, Ranipet, Hosur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, sleeping in cheap rooms where they were available or on concrete by the Sumo parked in petrol pumps.Two ends of the spectrumThe smallest collectors live out in the open. At Officers Colony, Ayanavaram, west Chennai, at the curve of Barton Wright Road by a nondescript temple sit Vadivel, his wife Baika and their children, leaning against the concrete picket fence, sorting hair. Children, home for vacation from school near Salem where they study, are playing in the early afternoon sun, waiting for the meal to be cooked, across the road in an open fire. Mathi (sardine) and rice today. Here many families sleep under the blanket of stars, menfolk mostly sloshed. At 1.40 in the afternoon, Vadivel has alcohol on his breath. A bunch of corporation conservancy workers pass by. They sell Vadivel and others like him hair regularly, hair some 18,000 of them sweep up along the roads of 465 sq. km. of Chennai corporation area. Into the more crowded streets with a heavy population density women methodically roam, setting out early in the morning, and returning to cook late in the afternoon while the men do gas repair work and clean wells.A fancier name for hair collectors, sort of like a kabadiwallah , is hair aggregator. This is the term George Cherian, the CEO of Raj Hair International, uses. He is on top of the chain, one of the biggest hair exporters, one of about 50 who form the core of the business. At his plush office on Maloney Road, Chennai, he estimates the number of such aggregators in the country at roughly 80,000. Chennai and Eluru account for the biggest concentration of Remy hair exporters as well, about 150. The number of product manufacturers is way more.Benjamin Cherian, Georges father, who has been sending hair to 56 countries for 35 years now, has a couple of dreams that he wishes could be quickly fulfilled. He says only 20% of the villages of the country are covered by hair collection of the type that has been described here. Under the Swachh Bharat dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Benjamin feels if each village could set up a system to collect hair, not only would the villages be cleaner, it would effortlessly provide employment as well as export revenue to the country.If southern gods like hair, the West loves it. Once processed, the hair sells at an average of $400 a kilo, depending on the length of the hair; hair lengths of 8-11 inches cost $100 a kilo while 30 inches sells at $700 a kilo. Benjamin says former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obamas extensions are courtesy Remy hair sourced through his company. The same is the story of extensions worn by people such as singers Shakira and Queen Latifah and actress Sofia Vergara. Hair extensions that were made from hair he exports have also featured in, among other films, Hunger Games , The Chronicles of Narnia , Pirates of the Caribbean , X-Men , 50 First Dates , The Ring , and Planet of the Apes .Raj Hair International exports about 12 tonnes of finished hair products per year; to send this much they have to process twice the amount of hair, 24,000 kilos; 20,000 kilos of non-Remy hair is exported by him, for which 36,000 kilos have to be processed.Competition from ChinaChinese hair is thicker, twice that of Indian hair, better for wigs, bleaching. Their hair is not fine, lustrous. To make it that way they have to mix it with Indian hair. The problem is China does business worth $4 billion, over ten times the turnover of India, mostly because of their range of finished hair products such as wigs, extensions, wefts, weaves, root tips.Benjamin Cherians other cherished dream is to prevent the smuggling of chutti hair to Bangladesh and Myanmar and thence to China through Moreh border in Manipur, for which he has even made several representations to the government. The Chinese come and live here and they buy the chutti and ship it. They are in Gudiyatham, for instance, he says. They have been coming for seven years. Palani and his son supply to them. The Chinese pay Rs. 4,000 per kilo of chutti . Now, the Chinese live on the outskirts of Bengaluru where they have a godown, says Yogalakshmi.Whether Benjamin Cherians dreams come true or not, the future of dead hair looks secure. As he puts it, So long as men and women want to look beautiful, we are in business.The Chinese come and live here and they buy the chutti hair and ship it. They have been coming for several years.Benjamin CherianRaj Hair International"

Patil inside an earthmover during the foundation stone laying ceremony for the third phase of Mulawad Lift Irrigation Project at Babaleshwar on Thursday.rajendra singh hajeriWater Resources Minister M.B. Patil has said that his Ministry would present a revised estimates amounting to Rs. 55,000 crore before the State Cabinet for the Upper Krishna Project III for approval.He was addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone for the canal works under the third phase of Mulawad Lift Irrigation Project in his Babaleshwar constituency on Thursday.The Minister said that during the previous BJP government in the State, the estimates were put at Rs. 17,500 crore, but after the implementation of the land acquisition policy by the previous United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, the project estimates had to be revised.As the government has to offer higher compensation to farmers who lose land to irrigation projects, the cost of the project has escalated to over Rs. 55,000 crore. Our Ministry is presenting the new estimates before the Cabinet for approval, Mr. Patil said.With regard to Malaprabha canal modernisation work, he asserted that the government was committed to completing the project before the end of its tenure.He said that though the BJP leaders were opposing the project and were creating several hurdles, the government, is not going to shelve it.Mr. Patil said that the government has filled 1,400 tanks in the State, including 203 tanks in the district, at a cost of Rs. 4,000 crore.With regard to the Mulawad Lift Irrigation Project, he said that the project was scheduled to be completed by the end of December this year.It is an ambitious project which many people had felt would never get completed. But after I became Water Resources Minister, I took it as a challenge and decided to complete it within five years. The project would irrigate 50,000 acres of land, he said.The Minister said that the Congress government has completed a majority of irrigation projects in the State in less than five years.Meanwhile, he urged sugarcane farmers to adopt drip irrigation instead of traditional flood irrigation as it utilised a huge quantum of water.Drip irrigation would help save water which could be used by other farmers who are dependent on rain, he said.Zilla Panchayat member Umesh Kolkur and other elected representatives were present."
