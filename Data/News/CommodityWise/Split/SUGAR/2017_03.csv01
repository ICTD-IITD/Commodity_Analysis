It used to be a natural flood control system whenever the Pampa and the Manimala rivers were in spate, says N.K. Sukumaran Nair, head of the Pampa Parirakshana Samithy, an environmental organisation, which has been conducting several awareness campaigns on river protection and green living.The threat of annihilation of the Varattar portends danger to the Pampa as well, says Mr. Nair.The depth of the Pampa at the origin of the Varattar has increased by 5-7 metres owing to unscrupulous sand mining in the former, resulting in cessation of water flow into the latter. The ground level in the Varattar rose owing to accumulation of silt. The motionless river was encroached upon. Today, the river has become a skeleton, with pools of water remaining here and there.The severe drought perhaps was lending a new direction to the efforts to resuscitate the river, he added.Dried-up canalsSeveral canals linked to the river have dried up, resulting in cessation of irrigation facility to paddy fields in places such as Koipram, Idanadu and Othara. The river used to be the lifeline for country boats carrying cargo as well as palliyodams, the snake-boats taking part in the Aranmula boat race, till a few decades ago.The sugar factory at Pulikkeezhu thrived at a time when sugarcane used to be transported through the river. Pools of stagnated polluted water is all what remains of the river in most parts, says Praveen, a resident of the area, affected by scarcity of potable water.Pampa Action PlanThe Pampa Action Plan, aimed at abatement of pollution of river Pampa, formulated in 2003 as a Centre-State project, with an outlay of Rs. 18.45 crore under the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), has envisaged protection of tributaries as well. But the plan needs a detailed project report to be approved by the Centre. Major works under the plan remain non-executed.It is against this background that an initiative of local self-governments such as Thiruvanvandoor, Eraviperoor, and Kuttoor grama panchayats and Chengannur municipal authorities have joined hands to revive the river.Walk across riverA puzha nadatham, a walk across the course of the river, will be taken out by the people, led by three Ministers and scores of peoples representatives on May 29. K.K. Ramachandran Nair, Chengannur MLA, will take a pilot tour of the area on May 26, according to John M. Thomas, chairman of the Chengannur municipal council.Detailed plans will be chalked out after the mass campaign, Thiruvanvandoor panchayat president Jalaja says."

Chandrasekhar Rao for a debate in Parliament or State Assembly about the quantum of funds disbursed by the Central Government and demanded he stick to his vow of resigning if Rs. 1 lakh crore disbursal was proven.Continuing the war of words with KCR on Thursday following his verbal onslaught against the BJP national president Amit Shah, State chief K. Laxman, senior colleague G. Kishan Reddy and others, strongly objected to the tone and tenor of the Chief Minister and said it does not behove of his status to stoop to such a level.If anyone has to apologise it is the Chief Minister for sitting in the official chair after promising it to the Dalits. Even the Dalit Deputy CM was unceremoniously removed on corruption charges which were never made public, retorted Dr. Laxman at a press conference in the party office.Claiming that Mr. Shah had received a tremendous response from the villagers across Nalgonda, he said the villagers had informed about the lack of drinking water, toilets and other basic amenities when the former had explained about the Central Government welfare schemes which were not reaching the masses.Central fundsThe Centre was giving subsidy to all the State schemes and reeled out figures where grants were given under various heads as well as diversion.The CM had admitted Rs. 67,000 crore was given and another Rs. 40,000 crore for highways project, so there is no debate, he said.Feeling insecureMr. Shah had never taken KCRs name anywhere yet he seemed to totally rattled by the visit. It appeared as if the CM has become impatient, insecure and frustrated. People were fed up with the dictatorial and family rule of TRS Government for failures on several fronts and the BJP is ready to be a credible alternative with the aim of coming to power in 2019 elections.If KCR was so confident of support to his Government, he should at least make the 30-odd defectors from other parties resign and get elected through a byelection, he added.Apology in orderMr. Kishan Reddy said the CM owed apologies to women for no representation in the Cabinet, to youth for lack of jobs and fee reimbursement issues, to farmers for ongoing agrarian crises and putting them in jail and to contract staff for not regularising their services, among others.Grandstanding promises of two bedroom houses, land for Dalits, potable drinking water, reopening Nizam Sugar Factory and so on have not been fulfilled. We are ready for a probe by a retired judge into how much of funds was received from the Centre, he exclaimed."

If you want to die, die, one of the attackers told Salim when he pleaded, for the last time, that the women be spared.They pulled the trigger and silenced him, and us, said the relative.Held at gunpointThe family had pleaded for mercy all through the ordeal, but Salim was reportedly the most vocal. When they first held us at gunpoint, we had strict instructions to look down as they walked us into the fields. Once there, they made us kneel down before tying the hands of the men and misbehaving with the women, the relative added.Dont misbehaveSalim asked them not to misbehave with the women even as we were tied up. This angered the attackers who said  abhi dikhaate hain badtameezi kya hoti hai (We will show you what misbehaviour is) before taking one woman into the sugarcane fields nearby. We couldnt see anything because of the crop and darkness, he added.The four attackers, who returned after allegedly raping the woman, then proceeded to assault the other three women. Salim objected again, after which he was shot dead.They abused usTwo assailants, meanwhile, kicked and punched the men, even hitting them with rods. They abused and threatened us, said the relative.Earlier, the men had fired a few shots in the air to intimidate the victims. They took away Rs. 32,000 from the brother-in-law, Rs. 11, 000 from Salim and nearly Rs. 3,000 from two others. They also took away the silver and gold jewellery the women were wearing.Neighbour was on callAsked if he could describe the men, the relative said that they were forced to look down through most of the ordeal. However, he did catch a glimpse that suggested all of them were young men dressed in pants and shirts. One of them was wearing a vest, he added.A neighbour who Salim was reportedly speaking to at the time the assailants struck said that he suddenly heard the women screaming and unknown voices instructing them to park on the side.If you [Salim] want to die, dieJewar attackers"

A significant chunk of the information related to the matter has surfaced in the form of an RTI query recently.Repeated attempts made to contact Mr. Mishra over the development did not yield a response.Mishras open letter to CMIn an open letter to Mr. Kejriwal earlier in the day, Mr. Mishra pressed for divulging the details of foreign tours undertaken by five leaders of the party.How much drama will you [Mr. Kejriwal] create to hide one truth. You are trying all tactics to divert attention. You made a strategy to use MLAs as a shield. However, only one MLA came forward to be that shield, Mr. Mishra said while announcing that the next expose was scheduled for Sunday.Evidence against MishraParty sources, meanwhile, told The Hindu it had concrete evidence of water supply-related issues, which a senior party functionary claimed had surfaced multiple times and got more serious in the run-up to the Delhi municipal polls, coming up during Mr. Mishras tenure as Water Minister that ultimately led to his ouster.Meanwhile, Mr. Mishra alleged that doctors employed by Mr. [Satyendar] Jain were giving false information about his sugar levels to the police, which was preparing to forcibly end his hunger strike.Earlier, AAP legislator Sanjeev Jha announced a hunger strike to counter Mr. Mishra's ongoing fast but was detained and whisked away by the Delhi Police from the scene even as Mr. Jha demanded that the latter divulge details about the alleged meeting between Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Jain where Rs. 2 crore are alleged to have changed hands between the two leaders.On May 7, Mr. Mishra had said that Mr. Kejriwal had met Mr. Jain where he paid him Rs. 2 crore.

Shanmugam, State general secretary, TNFA, pointed out that it has been close to two years since the team led by Mr. Sagayam submitted its report. The hesitance of the government to release the report only shows that it is trying to cover up the scam and is not interested to initiate action against the offenders, he said.Alleging that the scam had the involvement of many politicians and officials, including IAS officers, he demanded that the investigation into the scam be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The investigations had already been delayed for long. Further delay will be denial of justice, he said.N. Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, who is also part of TNFA, said that farmers were coerced to give away thousands of acres of fertile land by the granite mafia for quarrying.It is not only the farm lands, but also ponds, tanks and canals that were destroyed, because of which farming has collapsed.

593dff457be9e00dabcc764a,Tips to stay cool in summer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/tips-to-stay-cool-in-summer/article18450812.ece,2017-05-14,"As temperature soars, venturing out in summer invariably turns out to be an energy-sapping exercise. With many opting for chilled treats to quench their parched throats, experts offer a few tips to stay cool and hydrated that help replenish lost fluids in the body.Water formulaOf all the precautionary measures, drinking plenty of water tops the list. But the quantity that one should gulp down still remains unclear for many. Clarifying the doubt, consultant nutritionist and dietician K. Suma Nandini says there is a formula to follow as to how many glasses of water that one has to drink a day. The total weight of your body divided by 10 and that value minus two gives the total litres of water that can be consumed per day. For example, if your body weight is 60, you are expected to drink four litres (60/10; 6-2=4) of water, she suggests.Those who guzzle down bottles of refrigerated water or fizzy or sugar-laced beverages or flavoured drinks, Ms. Nandini suggests replacing them with glasses of sabja (basil) seeds soaked water or diluted buttermilk with a dash of dry-ginger powder and salt or barley water or tender coconut water.According to the consultant nutritionist, water stored in cleaned and sun-dried earthen pots offer better respite than refrigerated water. This is because the normal human body temperature is approximately 98.6 degree Fahrenheit. When we drink chilled water, the bodys metabolism gets disturbed, says Ms. Nandini.Another significant aspect that experts emphasise on is making the right food choices during summer that consists of small and frequent servings. However, it does not mean that one should opt for flavourless meals or stick to some weird salads throughout the day. Balanced diet, including portions of seasonal fruits such as musk melon, watermelon and mangoes along with simple food dished out incorporating vegetables like ridge-gourd, bottle-gourd, cucumber and red pumpkin would help in keeping the body cool, says Anjali Dange, founder and chief nutrition consultant of Starlite clinic.In order to provide relief to skin related infections, Ms. Anjali recommends diet that includes magnesium-rich nuts. Ready-to-eat red pumpkin and sunflower seeds and tender cashew nuts contain substantial amount of magnesium which also help in fighting against skin and fungal infections that are common in summer, Ms. Anjali adds.The nutritionists also warn to limit the intake of meat and switch to small portions of grilled fish and chicken rather than deep fried ones."
593e00d07be9e00dabcc778a,A toast to the local and ordinary,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-toast-to-the-local-and-ordinary/article18663572.ece,2017-05-31,"The words, East Village Style sit directly below the Toast and Tonic logo. Drawing on New York Citys grungy, DIY localeMumbais first Toast and Tonic takes design inspiration and serves up food that is inspired by the Manhattan area that stretches from Houston to 14th Street, and counts, Alphabet City and Tompkins Square Park among its markers. The inspiration makes sense, after all Manu Chandra started his career living and working in New York at restaurants like Le Bernardin and Gramercy Tavern.In it philosophy and food, Toast and Tonic successfully marries its specific inspiration with Indian produce and local twists, as frequent visitors to Bengaluru already know. There, the restaurant has been pleasing palettes, with its local, everything made in-house philosophy.For its extensive alcohol menu, that means that the restaurant is making its shrubs (a fruit-flavoured vinegar that is sometimes sweetened with sugar) and tonics. Where the restaurant excels is in its selection of gin and tonics each subtle and refreshing especially in the summer heat. The shrubs take the edge of the quinines metallic tang, and bring new depth to a classic cocktail. Also on offer are twists to various cocktails (like the Bacon Old Fashioned and Royal Bengal Mojito) and new concoctions (for example the Betty Rose, which is made with vodka, fennel, pomegranate, rose petal and lime juice).Toast and Tonic works as a showcase of Chandras chops, marrying his technique and skill for a menu that successfully straddles American small plates with the current push to celebrating indigenous foods and local producers, with a menu that lists everything from gondhraj (as an ingredient in the dressing in the kodo, foxtail, pearl and sorghum in a guava gondhraj dressing), to ricotta (made in-house), and fresh Andouille sausage (made by the kitchen team in their spacious Bengaluru digs). The cheese plate lists variants from three different Indian states while the food does a great job of taking local millets and overlooked grains and updating them for todays eaters. Its all aimed at consumers who seek out global small plates in an often-minimalist setting.The interiors, for those who have travelled or lived in New York, bring together some of the citys beloved design shorthand in a space that is inviting yet raw. Taking inspiration from the tin ceiling tiles that create ornate, repetitive patterns on the ceilings of bars and restaurants across much of Manhattan below 14th street, Toast and Tonics white tiles do that same. The walls covered in pressed wood, give the eatery an unfinished feel, reminiscent of the many layers that one finds on peeling walls and graffiti-ed bathrooms in the Big Apples dives and bars.It must be said that the menu, which takes its inspiration from the melting pot of cuisines that has made New York into a city that serves up all kinds of foods, manages to be neither disjointed nor overwhelming. The food at Toast and Tonic sees soft shell crab in a Singapore style sauce sitting alongside spaghetti caccio e pepe and Naga chilli chicken wings.This melting pot approach though, could do with some editing, as the breadth of the menu sometimes overwhelms. The pressed wood interiors too, are unfortunately a design-led approximation of the layered, often uncared for interiors, in some ofNew Yorks East Village, or really, any dive.Ultimately, the restaurant is a great distillation that a chef can take his inspiration and successfully translate into a vision that satisfies customers, manages to encourage local artisanal and speciality food producers and serves up some mean cocktailsall without compromise. Well toast to that.The author was a guest at the restaurants preview dinnerToast and Tonic, Bandra Kurla Complex; 2653 4722"

J.S. Narang and the report would be submitted within a month.The terms of reference for the inquiry commission, formed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, would be notified soon.The Punjab government had nearly a week ago conducted e-auction of sand mines, which culminated in bids worth Rs. 1,026 crore after auctioning of 89 mines. Amit Bahadur, the Ministers former cook, bagged a mining contract worth Rs. 26 crore. According to the Opposition, his income tax returns for financial year 2014-15 show that his income was about Rs. 95,000 He was earning just Rs. 11,706 per month.The statement from the Chief Ministers Office added, Though Mr. Rana Gurjit has denied any links between his company, Rana Sugars Limited, and the auctions and has categorically stated that his company has no stake, direct or indirect, in sand mining business, Captain Singh decided, in the interest of ethics and propriety, to get the matter investigated at the highest level to ensure total transparency.The statement said the Minister had offered to resign in order to ensure a free and fair investigation into the matter but the Chief Minister asked him to continue till the outcome of the judicial probe.Reacting to the inquiry order, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira said, If Mr. Rana Gurjit continues to be a member of Cabinet, the inquiry can never be free, fair and impartial. The Minister must resign or he should be dismissed from the Cabinet pending inquiry.Mr. Khaira said the AAP would go ahead with its proposed dharna outside the Chief Ministers residence on Tuesday demanding Mr. Rana Gurjits sacking.Open letter to CMIn an open letter to Captain Singh on Monday, the AAP leader alleged that Mr. Rana Gurjit had taken undue advantage of his ministerial position and indulged in gross irregularities to hijack the trade of sand mining through his henchmen in the recently concluded e-auction of mines.By remaining quiet and trying to shield the Minister, you [Captain Singh] are not only doing big harm to Punjab and the Congress party, but immensely damaging your reputation as a statesman and a tall leader, Mr. Khaira wrote."

That is why Krishna extols the vision of a true bhakta who is endowed with the knowledge of the infinite greatness of the Lord and of His all-pervading presence that inheres in the entire creation, pointed out Sri B. Damodhara Dikshitar in a discourse.There are as many kinds of devotion as there are individuals. The average devotee is generally compassionate and affectionate to all beings, but feels a sense of differentiation between friends, enemies and so on.The beginner in the path of devotion worships the Lord in the form of a deity or some form, but fails to accept His presence in other beings. But a true bhakta sees the Lord in all beings and also sees all beings in His Self. This vision is the culmination of jnana and bhakti and a bhakta never slips from this awareness.It is said that once Eknath, when retuning from Kasi Yatra, was moved to see a donkey almost dying of thirst on the way.Without any hesitation, he opened a vial of Ganga water and poured it into the parched mouth of the donkey. He saw only the Lord in the soulful eyes and not the donkey.In the case of Saint Namadev, he once chased a dog that had taken away the bread given to him by his wife, only to offer it the sugar and ghee as well which it had left behind. The dog became the Lord in front of him.When Siva is said to have come in the form of a chandala to grace the yagna of Somasi Mara Nayanar, the Adiyar unhesitatingly offered the same hospitality he would offer others.The Lord wants to show that in the eyes of a true bhakta, where Truth alone is revealed, there is no need for Him to come disguised."

(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Have you heard of the Kota Hostel Associations plans?Yes, but I am not sure if such a plan will help reduce the suicides. We can only stop this by making students strong mentally. I have been in Kota for two years aur yahan bahut hyper environment hota hai (and the environment here is quite charged). If you dont score well in any test, your friends taunt you, and that leads to embarrassment and stress. A student should be able to deal with such things.2. Why do you think this plan wont help?The most important thing is to have a good environment in hostels, because that is where students spend most of their time. Whenever I am low, I try talking to some of my friends here. The pressures cant be denied, and I feel the association should focus on providing a family-like environment at the hostel, instead of tweaking fans, to help students cope.3. What are the pressures that you face in Kota?Financial pressures, performance pressures My father is a sugarcane farmer in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, and I am the third of four siblings. I am taking coaching at Aakash Institute, and it comes at a price. In fact, most students here are from middle-class families and the coaching costs are a big burden. Though my parents dont tell me anything, main hamesha koshish karti hoon ki mere marks achche aayen (I am always trying that I get good marks). I think in most cases, students end their lives because of pressure from parents.4. Has anyone you know ever thought of killing themselves?No, but in my two years here I have often heard of such deaths. I wouldnt say that they disturb me Once in a while we all get depressed, I get stressed too, but taking your life is not the solution. Life mein struggle karna hota hai, kuch bhi aasani se nahin milta (One needs to struggle in life, success doesnt come easy).5. Why did you come to Kota?I always dreamed of becoming a doctor, and I read about Kota in a newspaper. The atmosphere here is quite competitive and I thought that would help me in my preparation.

Most North Korean refugees begin their escape by crossing into China and then try to make it to third countries  often in Southeast Asia  where they seek asylum in the South.If caught and returned to the North they can face severe punishment.China regularly labels North Koreans as illegal economic migrants and repatriates them based on a border protocol adopted in 1986.By now, there are plenty of survivor accounts that reveal Kim Jong-Uns administration is routinely persecuting those who are forced back to North Korea, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch.The group it highlighted  which includes at least four women  was detained by Chinese officials in mid-March after they were stopped for a random check in Shenyang, in northeastern China.Human Rights Watch said that on the basis of information from sources it considers usually reliable, the group was still believed to be jailed in China. But it feared they may soon be returned to the North since most repatriations happen two months after detention.There is no way to sugar coat this: if this group is forced back to North Korea, their lives and safety will be at risk, Robertson said.More than 40 North Koreans, including children and pregnant women, have been held by China over the past nine months, Human Rights Watch said, and at least nine forcibly returned to the North.Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have escaped  most after a deadly famine in the mid-90s  and settled in the South.North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is believed to have tightened border controls since he came to power after the death of his father Kim Jong-Il in December 2011.The number of refugees arriving in South Korea plunged nearly 50 per cent to 1,417 last year.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: AP)Maria Sharapova returns after a 15-month doping ban Wednesday, desperate to rediscover the glory which brought her five Grand Slams, the worlds top ranking and a spectacular multi-million dollar lifestyle.The poster girl of womens tennis wont necessarily be welcomed back with open arms by rivals who were already suspicious of the towering Russians ice-cold detachment even before her fall from grace.However, Sharapova isnt losing any sleep as the 30-year-old prepares for her first match since being defeated by Serena Williams in the 2016 Australian Open quarter-finals.That is the least of my concerns. I know that I am respected in my field. I see it in how my opponents play against me, said Sharapova who was controversially handed a wild card into this weeks Stuttgart event, a clay court tournament sponsored by Porsche, one of her headline backers.She was even given a Wednesday start as thats the day her ban  imposed for testing positive for meldonium at last years Australian Open  comes to an end.Sharapova, who starts her Stuttgart campaign against Italian veteran Roberta Vinci, had been taking the over-the-counter cardiac supplement when it was within the rules, but was later reclassified as a prohibited drug.Far from being remorseful, Sharapova recently hit out at tennis authorities for failing to give her sufficient warning that meldonium had become a banned substance.The Russian will step onto centre court at 1830 (1630 GMT) on Wednesday and could not have picked a better tournament for her return, having won the Stuttgart title three times, and suffering just one defeat.If she gets through her opener, she could face Polands Agnieszka Radwanska, one of her fiercest critics, in the second round.Radwanska, the sixth-seed in Stuttgart, expects a fierce return from the Russian, but says Sharapova should have had to qualify on merit rather than being given a free pass on a wild card.This kind of entry into the tournament should apply to players who dropped in the ranking because of injury, illness or some other random event. Not for those suspended for doping, said Radwanska.Sharapovas agent Max Eisenbud believes his clients rivals are motivated solely by jealousy especially with Sharapova battling also for a French Open wild card.All those journeyman players like Radwanska and Caroline Wozniacki who have never won a slam and the next generation passing them. They are smart to try to keep Maria out of Paris, Eisenbud said.NO Serena, NO Maria, NO Vika, NO Petra, its their last chance to win a slam, he added, a nod to the absence of pregnant Serena Williams, Petra Kvitova and Victoria Azarenka, expected to return in July after having a baby.Sharapova can expect plenty of support from the Stuttgart organisers as her return is the highlight in the tournaments 40th anniversary celebrations.As an ambassador for Porsche, she is sure of a warm welcome. Her confectionary brand  Sugarpova  will have a stand in the tournaments retail village.Tournament director Markus Guenthardt knows her presence will boost ticket sales.Her return in the Porsche Arena is a fabulous present for our fantastic spectators and is certain to be one of the sporting and emotional highlights of our anniversary tournament, he said.As well as Radwanska, many of her other potential Stuttgart rivals have made it clear they disapprove of her getting a helping hand into the main draw.Germanys Angelique Kerber, this years top seed and the only player to have beaten Sharapova in Stuttgart, said her place should have gone to local talent.Its a German tournament, and we [have] so many good German players, so this is also a little bit strange, said Kerber.Its also strange for the players, that she can walk on site on Wednesday and she can play on Wednesday.Dominika Cibulkova, the third seed, claims Sharapova is benefiting from unfair treatment.Its not about her, but everyone who was doping should start from zero, said the Slovakian.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

After successful trials in 60 villages of Aurangabad district, the technology is set to be operationalised in various health posts of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, (BMC) in the slums of Govandi and Kurla, in suburban Mumbai.Called Care Mother, the mobile application helps detect pregnant women, categorised as high-risk cases, through health workers and link them with doctors for regular check-ups and ante-natal care. The health worker can create an account for each pregnant woman on the mobile application. Their basic information is then fed in, including blood pressure, diabetes status, weight, age, foetal heart rate, protein and sugar levels. The application identifies high-risk women by calculating a combination of parameters, said co-founder of the application, Shantanu Pathak.Pathak is attached with the bio-medical department of IIT Bombay where he developed the programme with IIT Madras alumni Aditya Kulkarni. Last year, the two conducted trials of the mobile app in the fringes of Mumbai, along with NGOs.In rural areas, owing to poor awareness, pregnant women do not attend regular check-ups at health camps. The health worker or ante-natal care (ANC) workers can use the portable kit to measure blood pressure, haemoglobin, urine and basic parameters on home-to-home visits and feed all information on the application. Local doctors will get an alert on high-risk women identified in the region through the same application loaded on their phones. The only glitch for health workers and doctors is that they should have a smartphone that can install the application.It empowers NGOs, hospitals and doctors to keep high-risk women, such as anaemic or hypertensive, on radar, Pathak said. In Maharashtra, pregnancy induced hypertension can lead to eclampsia, which is the most common cause of maternal deaths.While the mobile app does not replace sonography tests, it aids in tackling common causes of maternal deaths.Till now, 5,000 women have been registered. The software uses World Health Organisation guidelines to classify normal and high-risk women by using test results of foetal heart rate, previous clinical diagnosis and gestational period. If the weight gain is more than 2.27 kg a month, the mother may be at high risk because of change in amniotic fluid levels. The app can decipher such finer details, Pathak said. The app also plots a graph to show foetal heart rate by using a device attached to the mother. In its pilot programme, the appl was used on women in Palghar region. The BMC now plans to implement it in 15 health posts before scaling it up. The IITians claim at least 90 per cent of common pregnancy woes can be prevented. They are now working on adding more features.  In slums, where women do not come for regular screening, the application will be helpful as basic services will be delivered at the door step, said Dr Mangala Gomare, deputy executive health officer, BMC. The app has been bought by Nagaland government and NGOs from Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(File Photo) Ram Vilas Paswan. (File Photo)The government has created a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses and now it is grappling with the problem of distributing them, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said today. The buffer stock was created to manage price volatility through buying from local and overseas markets using the Price Stabilisation Fund.Right now, we have around 20 lakh tonnes of pulses in buffer stock. 16.27 lakh tonnes has been procured locally and 3.79 lakh tonnes imported. There is one problem, how do we distribute it, Paswan told reporters while briefing his ministrys achievements in last three years.Pulses production has gone up this year and farmers are not getting the right price. However, the higher output has helped retail prices cool down, he added.The problem, however, is distribution of the buffer pulses stock, he added. The ministry is in talks with various states and agencies for sale of pulses from the buffer stock. It is planning to sell some quantities to the Defence and para-military forces as also to give to states, a senior government official said.Pulses output is estimated to be a record 22.40 million tonnes in the 2016-17 crop year ending June, as against 16.35 MT previous year. This would reduce the countrys dependence on imports to some extent as demand-supply gap is 2-3 MT.On retail prices of 22 essential commodities tracked by the government, Paswan said they are stable and under control. With GST and implementation of e-national agri-market, both farmers and consumers will benefit, he added.With regard to cane arrears, Paswan said that dues owed by sugar mills to growers have come down to Rs 7,500 crore out of the outstanding Rs 54,000 crore during the 2016-17 season (October-September).Highlighting measures taken to protect consumers, he said the number of helplines have been increased from 14 to 60 in 2016 and will be increased to 120 shortly by setting up zonal consumer helpline (ZCH).The government has come out with guidelines on direct selling, national building code, two laws  BIS Act and Consumer Protection Act  have been replaced.

The study also reveals that hypertension, diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease were the most common co-existing conditions. At least 25.8 per cent of the patients tested positive for swine flu had hypertension, while 23 per cent had diabetes.Mortality was high among the elderly, those with high WBC count and those who had high liver enzyme levels.

The decision also means the state government will have to make financial provisions of more than Rs 15,000 crore for the local bodies.Following the draft GST bill, Shiv Sena gave its approval to the Goods and Services Tax, after the state government promised to credit the compensation amount in the BMC account before fifth of every month. This has paved the way for smooth passage of the GST bill in the state legislature at the three-day special session from May 20 to 22. The state cabinet on Tuesday adopted the draft legislation by incorporating the compensation clause to replace the financial loss that would be incurred by the BMC and local bodies due to abolition of octroi and local body tax respectively. Late Monday night, the state government had provided a copy of the draft GST bill to Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. The Sena president gave the nod after discussing the amendments with party leaders.Highly placed sources in the government said, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reassured Thackeray that every financial loss on account of octroi would be adequately compensated. As Mumbai was a very important economic capital, the government was equally concerned about the civic issues and responsibilities.It is mandatory for every state to ratify the GST after Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha gave their approval in the Budget session. The GST will be implemented from July 1. Following abolition of octroi in BMC and local body tax in municipal councils across Maharashtra, the state government made amendments in the draft GST to make allocation of funds as compensation to the BMC and other local bodies mandatory. The GST draft states, The state government will every month before fifth credit the amount in the accounts of BMC and local bodies.The total amount which the state will have to incur for local bodies is estimated at Rs 14,500 crore of which BMC will be provided Rs 7,200 crore as compensation for abolition of octroi. Every year, the amount will be increased by eight percent. The state government acknowledged that every local body and BMC would require consolidated funds for civic work in their respective cities. The implementation of GST mandating a unified tax regime makes their individual tax collections from purchase of sugarcane to entry tax on vehicles and octroi redundant.Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, For the last one year, we have urged the centre and the state to make provisions to compensate for the abolition of LBT and octroi.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

594045db7be9e024e45980f7,Bulk milk coolers: A cool way to chill for dairies and farmers,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bulk-milk-coolers-a-cool-way-to-chill-for-dairies-and-farmers-bmc-4538749/,2017-02-23,"Dairy farmers at a milk procurement centre with a rapid chiller facility in a Tamil Nadu village. Dairy farmers at a milk procurement centre with a rapid chiller facility in a Tamil Nadu village.The near-quadrupling of milk procurement by dairy cooperatives in Gujarat over the last 15 years  from an average of 45 lakh litres to about 170 lakh litres per day  has been attributed no less to a single factor: 24-hour power in rural areas, including guaranteed three-phase supply for eight hours, enabling village-level societies to install bulk milk coolers (BMC). These, with capacities ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 litres, chill the milk to around 4 degrees celsius at the primary collection point itself, inhibiting microbial growth that can lead to undesirable quality/taste changes and expedite spoilage.But maintaining the freshness of raw milk sourced from farmers isnt all that the BMCs have done.In the pre-BMC era, the milk collected by the society had to reach the dairy plant by 8:30 am or so, before day temperatures rose. It required procurement to start by 6 am and farmers undertaking milking at least an hour earlier, so as to not miss the tanker. The sheer need to hurry through the process, moreover, limited the number of animals that could be milked. With BMCs, the milk was chilled at source and remained fresh, which gave farmers the flexibility to deliver even at 9 am. They could now afford to expand their herd size and supply more milk. Today, an estimated 80 per cent of milk collected by Gujarats dairy unions comes through BMCs and it is not difficult to see the link between these and higher procurement volumes.Watch What Else Is making NewsNot every state, unfortunately though, is Gujarat  where farmers have assured electricity supply allowing milk to be chilled not very long after it has left the udders of cows or buffaloes. In much of rural India, power supply is irregular, which means even BMCs cannot do without the backup of diesel generators.This is where an innovation by Promethean Power Systems, a Pune-based company founded by two men from Boston has made a difference. In 2011, Sorin Grama and Sam White built the final prototype of a Rapid Milk Chiller (RMC) based on a proprietary Thermal Storage System (TSS) technology. At the heart of it lay a thermal battery, which drew and stored electricity from the grid as and when available. This stored energy it then released to rapidly chill the milk collected from farmers at ambient temperatures  say, 35 degrees  to 4 degrees Celsius.The duo initially sought to establish the feasibility of a solar-powered milk chilling solution. While the trials were successful, their prospective customers, however, wanted a system that was less bulky (solar panels take up too much space), more cost-effective (which was not the case with solar technology in 2010), and easier to operate. Further, solar-based chilling wasnt seen to be necessary in places where there was at least intermittent power supply, even if unreliable. The thermal battery could be charged whenever electricity was available; the trick was to decouple supply of power from chilling. From this emerged the alternative TSS technology, which was more economical and better-suited to general Indian rural conditions.Grama and White launched the TSS-based RMC as a pilot project six years ago near Goa. In 2013, Promethean Systems began commercial operations in India. We have so far sold over 500 units in the country and these have already chilled more than 150 million litres of milk supplied by 25,000-plus farmers, says Jiten Ghelani, CEO of the company.The systems main advantage is the flexibility it gives for chilling milk at village level, even without consistent grid power or diesel generator backup. Typically, BMCs run on gen-sets for 50 per cent of the time, resulting in both high operational costs and 25-30 per cent more carbon emissions, notes Jofi Joseph, Director of Sales & Marketing.Chilling at source is a win-win for both dairy plants and farmers. Milk is a good medium for growth of microorganisms. Chilling within about an hour of milking basically prevents the build-up of bacteria converting the lactose or sugar in the milk into lactic acid, which curdles the proteins and causes souring. Dairies, then, get access to milk with less microbial load and spoilage possibility, while farmers, too, benefit from flexibility with regard to delivery time and increased herd size. Besides, they can expect to fetch a quality premium in terms of price per litre.The buyers of our RMCs arent individual farmers. The processors sourcing milk from them are the ones investing in the equipment, costing Rs 5-6 lakh each, and installing these in their respective village-level collection centres, explains Ghelani, whose company claims to have developed a customer base across Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.Amul dairy currently has a collection centre at Pahad Dhara, a village in Punes outskirts, where it has put up an RMC. Earlier, we had a regular BMC that used to operate most of the time on diesel, entailing a monthly expense of Rs 35,000 a month. With the RMC, which was installed roughly a year ago, we are now spending only Rs 5,000 on electricity, notes Devadnya Dilip Wagh, a coordinator at the chilling centre that procures an average 600 litres per day of milk from 20 farmers in the village.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

CMO Maharashtra (@CMOMaharashtra) June 11, 2017The rise will be applicable to societies and unions collecting milk for government brands. But, with the government paying more for milk, even private brands will be forced to do the same, leading to a spike in prices. We have decided upon a 70:30 formula, under which the farmers get 70%, while the milk -collecting societies and unions get 30% of the cost. If this is implemented, the difference between the procurement rate and retail price will reduce and there will be no need to increase the retail price, said an official from the dairy development department.At the same time, the milk societies will have to agree with 70:30 formula of profit sharing on the lines of sugar industry .  CMO Maharashtra (@CMOMaharashtra) June 11, 2017Private brands always pay more than the government. For instance, Gokul pays farmers Rs28 a litre for cow milk.

(Source: Reuters) Usain Bolt duly delivered a 100m victory in 10.03 seconds for a sea of 30,000 fans bedecked in yellow and green. (Source: Reuters)World athletics chief Sebastian Coe says Usain Bolt will retire as the Muhammad Ali of track and field, hanging up his spikes as the greatest sprinter of all time. Coe was at Kingstons National Stadium on Saturday to watch Bolt run his last race on Jamaican soil before he retires at the World Championships in London.In an interview with AFP yesterday, International Association of Athletics Federations chief Coe said he had been determined to pay homage to Bolt as his glittering career begins its victory lap.Just instinctively you knew it was going to be a big moment, Coe said. This is where his home is. I sense people here recognized that there was going to be an outpouring of emotion and warmth last night which I just wanted to witness.And what was fascinating is those people who came up to me who had flown in from other continents to be here. People instinctively knew that they were going to witness something that was going to be special and unique, and it was.Bolt duly delivered a 100m victory in 10.03 seconds for a sea of 30,000 fans bedecked in yellow and green. Coe said Bolt will retire from the sport as the greatest sprinter of all-time, a rare athlete who transcended his sport and appealed across the sporting spectrum after dominating at three consecutive Olympic games.He has not just reached the level he has in terms of global presence because of three back-to-back Olympic Games or because of the world records, said Coe, who set eight world records in middle-distance track events, including three in the span of 41 days in 1979.He has a charisma that I havent seen in my sport in my lifetime other than with Ali and I put them in the same category. When Ali went we had the same conversations. But along came Sugar Ray Leonard and Floyd Maywether, Roberto Duran and Manny Pacquiao . We had great fighters. But have they soared to the level of the great Ali, no. But they kept the sport exciting and fresh.You cant take away the massive social contribution Jesse Owens made in 1936 and you cant argue with the extraordinary contributions other sprinters have made. But there is only one guy sitting at the top of the heap and you wouldnt have a split jury on that.This may be Bolts last race in Jamaica but he has a couple more events before he caps his brilliant career by running the 100m in Worlds which goes from August 4-13.National TreasureHe is going to come to the World Championships and yes that is a fitting place for him to end his career considering what he has done globally, said Coe.But you only have to spend a few moments with Usain to know that this is where he will forever be emotionally anchored. Coe said as a former Olympic gold medal winner in the 1,500m he can understand why Bolt would want to bow out now.He probably has instinctively realized this is the right moment. There comes a point at which the candle flickers a bit, he said. No athlete wants to be asked the question why didnt you retire sooner?Coe said Bolt, who has the world record in both the 100m and 200m, can retire in peace knowing that he gave it his all for 15 years.Sit back think about it. You are just into your 30s and you have won three Olympics Games back to back, you broke the world records and so maybe there is not a lot left to accomplish. He is also comfortable in his own skin. He will always be a national treasure and that is just enough, just enough.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Plastic rice or eggs are not being sold in the market. Unnecessary panic is being created. The public should not pay heed to such rumours, he said.The minister said that following reports of plastic food being sold in the market, 208 samples of sugar, 180 samples of rice, eight eggs, 12 samples of ragi from across the state were sent to various laboratories for testing. No traces of plastic were found in any of the samples, Kumar said.He said it takes Rs 200 to manufacture one kg of plastic rice. When rice is available at Rs 40 per kg why will anyone manufacture plastic rice and sell it in the market? the minister asked. He also said no case has been registered with regard to the sale of plastic rice or eggs.K T Srikante Gowda (JD-S) said that four people had been admitted to a government hospital in KR Pet in Mandya district after consuming plastic eggs.

(PTI Photo) Youth Congress members holding a protest on the railway tracks over the killing of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, in Ambala on Saturday. (PTI Photo)Agitating farmers in Haryana have refused to withdraw their agitation despite the acceptance of several demands of farmers in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Haryana farmers, who are sitting on dharna in many parts of the state, have decided to block national highways and state highways for three hours on June 16. On the other hand, keeping in view the increasing protests by farmers, the Haryana government has initiated the process of collecting details about the outstanding farm loans particularly given by its cooperative banks and societies to the farmers.A government official told The Indian Express on Monday that there is a defaulting loan of Rs 6,575 crore, which the farmers could not deposit with the cooperative banks and societies on time. Keeping in view the past practice of waiving such farm loans, the government may consider to waive off this much amount, said the officer, adding that no decision has been taken on the issue yet. As of now, only details are being collected, added the officer.However, the amount of total farm loan disbursed by both cooperative and commercial banks is much higher. As on March 31, 2015, the total outstanding crop loan in Haryana was pegged at Rs 28,558 crore with more than 22 lakh Kisan Credit Cards (KCC).Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Haryana unit president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, From the media reports, we have heard about farm loans of Rs 56,000 crore pending against the Haryana farmers.Chaduni said the issue of farm loans is related to the farmers of all states, not only Maharashtra. In the absence of good prices of crops, farmers lives have become miserable. The problems of farmers can be addressed only by two ways. First, waive off their existing farm loans and second, offer them profitable rates of their crops to increase their income, added Chaduni, who have led many agitations of farmers in the state.To help farmers ensure their survival, the government should implement recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission to ensure 50 per cent profit in the peasants input cost to their crops, said Chaduni.On BKUs call, the dharnas are being staged at eight district headquarters currently. Similar, dharnas will begin in Sonepat from Tuesday. The farmers also protested in Panchkula on Monday. Haryana BJP spokesperson Jawahar Yadav said their government was serious about tackling farmers issues.We have already reduced the rates of urea fertiliser apart from implementing a crop insurance scheme for farmers. As many as 15.73 lakh soil health cards have so far been prepared to prevent unnecessary use of fertilisers. We have already initiated the process to implement many of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, said Yadav.State Agriculture Secretary Abhilaksh Likhi said the state government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and accelerated its targets for different sectors to double farmers incomes by 2022, which requires an annual growth of 10.41 per cent in the income of farmers. Likhi said the government was aiming to ensure increase in agricultural and allied sector productivity through crop diversity and peri-urban farming.Among the high value crops (HVC), annual growth of 14.1 per cent in cotton, two per cent in sugarcane, 4.2 per cent in fruits, 5.7 per cent in vegetables, 3.5 per cent in animal husbandry and 12 per cent in fisheries has been envisaged by 2022. A target has been set to increase the productivity of fibre crop cotton from 0.274 metric tonnes per hectare to 0.693 metric tonnes per hectare and of sugarcane from 75.18 metric tonnes per hectare to 86.30 metric tonnes per hectare, he added.Hooda to hold MLAs meet todayGroupism in the Congress was visible on the issue of farmers agitation, too. Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda will hold a meeting with present and past MLAs of the party in New Delhi on Tuesday to launch an agitation on the farmers issue.However, Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Tanwar said Monday he would not attend Hoodas Delhi meeting as he had no information about the same. Tanwar said the party would launch a week-long agitation from June 18 on the issues of farmers and law and order.

The chief minister will lead a delegation of farmers to meet the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report so as to ensure better prices for crops.4. The farmers share in the profit of milk societies will go up to 70% share; the rest will go to the administration of the societies.At the same time, the milk societies will have to agree with 70:30 formula of profit sharing on the lines of sugar industry .

Realising that abandoned cubs cant survive in the environment, they started to track down their mothers.The state forest department, with help of veterinarians from Mandikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) and NGO Wildlife SOS, reunited 18 lost cubs in Junnar, Ambegaon, Khed and Shirur in 2016 and the rest this year.Members of the rescue centre said cubs get lost when their mothers go hunting leaving them in sugarcane or banana plantation.The reunion plays a significant role in avoiding man-animal conflict. When leopards are unable to locate their cubs, it is natural for them to turn hostile, aggressive and defensive on seeing humans in close proximity. This poses an immediate threat to farmers in the area, said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinarian, MLRC.Deshmukh said returning the cubs was important to conserve leopards. Captive leopards develop behavioural issues such as aggression and sometimes depression, he said.Forest officials said they dont animals from the spot where they are found abandoned to make it easier for their mother to find them. A medical test is done to check if they are healthy. We sent teams across a kilometre radius from where the cub is found to trace the mothers pugmarks. The area is completely cordoned off. Dim lights are put up at a distance. We ensure there is absolute silence near the spot. In some cases, we have waited for the mother for six to seven hours. The experience can be exasperating, said Deshmukh.However, the sudden appearance of the mother, slowly and carefully moving towards her cubs, seeing whether they are safe and finally carrying them in her mouth makes it satisfying and emotional, he said.Forest officers said loss of forest cover has led to an increase in such cases. Crops act as safe zones for the big cats as cubs cannot be easily spotted, while parents hunt for dogs, goats and other livestock, said SR Unde, forest guard."

Officials found indulging in such practice should be summarily placed under suspension, said an internal communication signed by Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani.Air India officials explained that after a plane lands, cleaners, ground staff, security personnel, engineers and members from the commercial team enter the aircraft to prepare it for the next flight and use surplus food such as meals, tea and sugar bags from inside the plane for their personal consumption.A former senior executive at Air India said that this problem was widespread and had been highlighted on several occasions in the past.This is not the first time that such a circular has been issued. However, there is tardiness in implementing such orders, the former Air India official said, on condition of anonymity.He added that sometimes the upholstery too gets soiled because the staff members eat inside the aircraft.Meal carts are supposed to be sealed before touchdown. One can easily identify who the wrongdoers are if you probe whether these seals were tampered with or whether the crew didnt seal them in the first place, explained the former official."

The incident was reported to us after which our teams reached the village and recovered the body, said forest conservator VK Singh.The forest department sent the body for postmortem examination.With Sens death, the toll in tiger attacks has gone up to 14 this year and 18 since October last year. Two farmers, aged 28 and 32, were killed in the same area earlier on Monday and Tuesday respectively.Sen had reportedly gone to the fields in the morning to collect green fodder for his cattle. His field is located close to the reserve forest and there are many sugarcane fields near by. The tiger must be hiding in one of the sugarcane fields before it attacked him, said the officer.As per Sens post mortem examination report, the tiger collapsed his trachea and broke the cranial vertebrae which resulted in his death. Unlike the previous attacks, the animal didnt feed on any of his parts. We are assuming that a single tiger is behind all three attacks which occurred this week. It killed Sen only out of fear, not for prey, said Singh who was preparing a team of forest staff which was about to set out in search for the tiger moments before the attack occurred. The search team was disbanded and sent to the spot where Sen was killed after the attack.Sens death fuelled the anger of the locals who are already enraged over the recent deaths. Forest officials are accountable for each of the deaths taking place in our area. They are using their tigers to scare and kill us, said Dalbir Singh, a resident of the area. This sentiment was shared by the other locals who consider forest officials their enemies .Considering this hostility, the forest officials have asked local police for security. The superintendent of police has deployed two units of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) to accompany forest staff during its search operation in the area.Read more| Tiger on the prowl: Two more fall prey in PilibhitMeanwhile, the incidents have also drawn the attention of BJP MP of Pilibhit Maneka Gandhi who is said to have directed the local administration to prevent such attacks in future.The MP has also promised a sum of Rs 20 lakh for electric fencing of the forest.

They have spotted over 33 species so far.special arrangementThe Amity School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Amity University, has organised the first-ever week-long Butterfly Count-2017, in and around its campus, to create awareness about the insects and promote its conservation.Conservation effortKushagra Rajendra, head of the Environmental Science Department at the university, told The Hindu that the presence of butterflies was an important indicator of ecological balance in a region. The event is being held in collaboration with the Bombay Natural History Society.Butterflies are more common near native plants rather than ornamental plants. So butterflies indicate the status of ecological balance in the region. The National Capital Region, especially Gurugram, has witnessed rapid urbanisation over the past few years and area under forest has been replaced by residential colonies and highways. Our understanding of urban conservation needs to change and we should maintain natural habitats. Else, these creatures will vanish without even being noticed, said Dr. Rajendra.A team of students led by Dr. Rajendra has been conducting the butterfly count for two hours daily in the morning since September 12 and has recorded 33 species of butterflies.Though no major study has been conducted on the presence of butterflies in the region since 1960, we expect there could be around 100 species in the NCR, mostly in the plains of the Yamuna. Our on-field survey is complete and a report will be prepared on Monday, said Dr. Rajendra.Notable speciesSome notable species spotted by the team, include Mormon ( Papilio polytes ), White Orange Tip ( Ixias marianne ), Lime Butterfly ( Papilio demoleus ), Common Albatross ( Appias albina ), Common Gull ( Cepora nerissa ), Blue Pansy ( Junonia orithiya ), and the Common Castor ( Ariadne merione ).Dr. Rajendra said the butterflies had three types of nutritional needs: fresh and easily digestible sugars (nectar), degraded/fermented fruit with ample flesh, and salt/minerals.A campus walk along with a lecture-cum-interactive session on status and importance of butterfly was also organised for the student as part of the programme.The session was also addressed by wildlife photographer Alankar Chandra who gave an elaborate description about the status of bird and butterfly habitats of India.The screening of the documentary Chasing Butterflies , based on the life-cycle of the insect, attracted students attention towards colourful world of the butterflies."

As he awaited trial in Baghdad, Saddam was watched over by a group of US soldiers from the 551st Military Police Company, who came to call themselves 'The Super Twelve'.The 12 American soldiers guarding Saddam initially forged a bond among themselves during their six months as the Iraqi dictator's private guards. However, the crew apparently bonded with Saddam too -- right to his bitter end, the report said.Among the guards was the author of the book.Saddam Hussein enjoyed tending to a scrubby patch of dirt at one corner of his outdoor area, watering the weeds and ""treating them more like beautiful flowers than the ugly growths they were,"" Bardenwerper writes.He was meticulous about his food, too, he ate his breakfast in sections, first an omelet, then a muffin, followed by fresh fruits. If the omelet was ""torn,"" he would reject it, according to the book.One of the Super Twelve specialists noted that Saddam Hussein was especially given to sweets.""He supposed it made Saddam less intimidating, that he could yield to the siren call of a sugary muffin the way anyone else might,"" Bardenwerper writes.Saddam seemed genuinely interested in his guards' lives.Several of the guards had children, and Saddam would share anecdotes from his own fatherhood experience. One story about disciplining children was memorable. Saddam recounted to his guards that his son Uday once made a ""terrible mistake"" that made Saddam ""very angry"".Uday had, in fact, shot up a party, killing several people and wounding several more.""I was very angry with him so I burned all his cars,"" Saddam told the guards, referring to Uday's large collection of luxury automobiles, including hundreds of Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and Porsches, according to the book.""Laughing wildly, the former dictator recalled how he gleefully watched the inferno,"" writes Bardenwerper.Saddam also listened to the radio and ""he'd always stop tuning if he stumbled across a Mary J Blige song"" and liked to ride a rickety exercise bike that he called his ""pony"", according to the book.His guards were struck by Saddam's appreciation of simple pleasures. Though he once owned dozens of marble palaces, he seemed reasonably content in his small prison cell, the report said."

Primarily because during UPA 2, they over-sold the benefits of AadhaarIronically, in the week that the UIDAI revealed its draconian face, serving a legal notice to those who exposed flaws in the Aadhaar eco-system, Ajay Pandey (CEO, UIDAI), wrote, The critics tend to forget that Aadhaar empowers the people, not the state (Criticisms Without Aadhaar, IE, May 13). However, government data reveals that Pandey is wrong to believe that Aadhaar empowers the people.Peddling long-debunked assertions on savings as facts without any proof is an old UIDAI strategy. Pandeys strongest claim, an independent study by the World Bank, reportedly estimates that Aadhaar can potentially save Rs 72,000 crore every year by plugging leakages. Actually, the study only states that the value of these transfers is estimated to be Rs 70,000 crores ($11.3 billion) per annum. There is no estimate of potential savings.Pandey claims that Aadhaar has cleansed delivery databases of fakes, duplicates and con men/intermediaries. Job cards and ration cards cancelled in the course of routine updation (or cleansing) drives are attributed to Aadhaar. In fact, in many cases, the cancellation pre-dates integration with Aadhaar. For instance, the 20 lakh cards deleted in 2014-15 in West Bengal are credited to Aadhaar-integration though only 15,000 cards were Aadhaar-seeded on March 2015.The case of LPG subsidies is well-documented. In July 2015, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian wrote in The New York Times that cash transfers resulted in estimated savings of about $2 billion. Yet, Cabinet Secretariat minutes from November 2015 report only Rs 91 crore savings due to Aadhaar. Later, the CEA himself clarified that it was potential (not actual) savings he had in mind, but the government still uses the earlier figures. The governments claim on deleted ration cards is also interesting. Out of 1.2 crore deleted cards, 62 lakh were from West Bengal. Heres the catch: All states (except West Bengal) report the number of cards in terms of families; West Bengal reports individuals. The ministry ignores the difference in units, adds them up, thus inflating the numbers.Why are governments resorting to such desperate measures to defend Aadhaar? Primarily because during UPA 2, they over-sold the benefits of Aadhaar. For instance, Aadhaar cannot reduce quantity fraud. When a PDS dealer undersells, whether I am forced to put my thumbprint in a paper register or a POS machine makes no difference to quantity fraud.Aadhaar cannot enhance inclusion. Possession of Aadhaar alone cannot guarantee benefits (say, pensions or scholarships), one still has to meet the eligibility criteria of those programmes. Exclusion from welfare was rarely due to the lack of ID documents (in a response to an RTI query, 99.97 per cent of those who enrolled in Aadhaar did it on the basis of existing ID documents). What Aadhaar can fix is identity fraud  for example, if I illegally get two ration cards or duplicates. But then, Aadhaar is one among several ways of de-duplication, and not the most efficient either  smart cards, or even painting the full list of beneficiaries on panchayat walls works well to identify ghosts and duplicates!The key question with respect to identity fraud (and the Aadhaar project) is what Senior Advocate Arvind Datar asked the government in court (during the PAN-Aadhaar linkage case), Did you do any study? The fact is there is no reliable evidence on the scale of identity fraud in welfare programmes. We are told that people are getting their benefits directly from the government without middlemen usurping them due to Aadhaar. Three clarifications are in order: One, benefits under some of the schemes he lists have been credited into bank accounts for years, so middlemen were absent from the payment process to start with. For example, payment of MGNREGA wages into bank and post office accounts became mandatory in 2009. Two, where middlemen existed (pensions delivered by a postman who demanded money), one type of middleman has been replaced by another (banking correspondents have taken the place of postmen). Three, the Aadhaar eco-system is breeding an army of middlemen (enrolment, re-enrolment of biometrics, Aadhaar-seeding, correcting demographic details, etc).Meanwhile, Aadhaar is also disempowering people. For example, names are being struck off pension lists without peoples knowledge (say, for not submitting their Aadhaar number) or MGNREGA wages get lost in the electronic payment system. In Rajasthan, more than 10 per cent of PDS beneficiaries are unable to get their ration after Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication (ABBA) was introduced. Monthly authentication of any one member is pointless: If someone dies, I can continue to claim their ration. At the very least, the government should move to annual authentication of all members, put people out of their monthly misery. Since 2009, we were lulled into believing that privacy is the price we pay for better welfare programmes. In 2009, the present National Security Advisor A.K. Doval rightly said: Now, it is being projected as more development-oriented, lest it ruffle any feathers. People would be unwilling to give up their right to privacy. Welfare, efficiency, transparency, empowerment, etc., was the sugar-coating.The writer is an associate professor, Economics, at the Indian Institute of Technology, DelhiFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia and senior officers from the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC). This was the first review by the PM after the GST Council finalised the rates, and the second since May 2.The GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising his state counterparts, has already finalised tax rates on almost all goods and services. It will meet again on June 11 to review some of the rates and discuss other pending issues.All goods and services have been put in slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent, with the exception of gold and precious metals, which will attract 3 per cent GST, and rough diamond at 0.25 per cent GST. Items like salt, milk, gur, egg, curd, unpacked foodgrain and paneer, fresh vegetables, unbranded atta, maida, besan, honey, besides education and health services, have all been exempted from GST.Tea, sugar, coffee beans, edible oil, packed paneer, milk powder, brooms, domestic LPG and kerosene have been put in the 5 per cent bracket.According to the fitment of rates in various tax brackets, 81 per cent of the items will fall in/below 18 per cent slab. Only 19 per cent of the goods will attract GST above 18 per cent.Hair oil, soaps, jams, soups, ice cream, capital goods and computers will attract a 18 per cent levy.Those placed in the 28 per cent slab are custard powder, shampoo, perfume, make up items, chewing gum, motorcycle, cement and consumer durables.The single-biggest taxation reform since independence, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will subsume 16 different taxes, including excise, service tax and VAT, and make India a single market for seamless movement of goods and services.GST is estimated to boost GDP by 1-2 per cent and bring down inflation by 2 per cent over the long termFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sikri and A.M. Sapre said in a ruling last month, overturning a high court decision that shut down a sugar factory because it was too close to another.India is ranked 130 out of 190 in ease of doing business by the World Bank and 172 in enforcing contracts. The top court's judgment sets a precedent as projects worth billions of rupees remain stuck for years in a judicial system that has more than 24 million pending cases, including commercial and criminal.The observations of the Supreme Court will usher in an era where the interplay ""between law and economics would be considered by the courts on more a sustainable basis"" especially where technical irregularities withhold economic development, Sandeep Chilana, a partner at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, said in an email.More than half of the 24 million cases in India are pending for at least two years and more than 9 percent have been unresolved for more than 10 years years, according to government data.The loss of productivity while attending court hearings amounts to 0.5 percent of Indian GDP, according to a report on the judiciary in 2016 by DAKSH, a Bengaluru-based organization that seeks to promote better governance and accountability in India.The economic implications of India's judicial backlog are hard to miss, a study on delays in the Indian Supreme Court by Simi Rose George of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government found.""A growing pool of empirical studies suggests that slow court systems discourage the growth of new businesses,"" according to the study. Speedy disposal of civil suits reduced breaches of contract, encouraged investment, and facilitated access to finance and foreign direct investment, it found, citing research papers.""The judicial process has now become a huge impediment in the implementation of very many large projects,"" said Mohan Guruswamy, who heads the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a New Delhi-based research group.Not only are judicial processes ""extremely slow,"" the courts increasingly had a tendency to pass comments and orders that require technical expertise. ""Our courts are increasingly encroaching on the domain of the executive often giving the constitution a go-by.""Guruswamy said.Even in cases where economic interest competes with the rights of people, the courts need to take a balanced approach, the top court said.The ""first duty of the court is to decide the case by applying the statutory provisions,"" the court said.""However, on the application of law and while interpreting a particular provision, economic impact/effect of a decision, wherever warranted, has to be kept in mind.""In the judgment, the Supreme Court overturned a high court ruling which shut down Shivashakti Sugars Ltd.'s factory in Karnataka, after a challenge from Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd. under a government mandate that stipulated there must be at least 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) between two sugar factories.The top court noted that the Shivashakti Sugars had spent 3 billion rupees ($47 million) on setting up the unit, which employed 377 people directly and 7000 indirectly.""Public purpose demands that the appellant's factory remain in operation and continue to function,"" the ruling said."

The Kiwi skipper, who made 28 runs in 24 deliveries, edged an outswinger from Hardik Pandya to wicketkeeper MS Dhoni. | APNEW DELHI: New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson said his side were outplayed by India in the first T20 International here and rued the dropped catches by his fielders.Hosts India thrashed New Zealand by 53 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.""The conditions are tough to prepare but given the experience within our side, we're certainly not using that as an excuse,"" Williamson said.""Most of the time when you come here and play in the evening, there's dew as there is on a number of other grounds that guys have played at. Not going to sugarcoat it but we were below par and came up against what is a very good Indian side that played very well in all the areas,"" he added.New Zealand dropped as many as three catches, including those offered by half-centurions Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma early in their innings.""Like I mentioned, we were outplayed in all the areas, fielding included, which is something we pride ourselves on and something we need to be much better at in Twenty20 cricket. That made the difference as we saw today that proved to be vital in a lot of ways. Guys went on to score big scores for their side in the Indian team and 200 on that surface was a very big total,"" Williamson said.The Indian pace duo of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah came in for praise and Williamson called them the most consistent bowlers in the world.""They're both very good bowlers (Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar). Because they got off to a good start, we were on the backfoot. The surface was seaming around, offering a bit to the seamers, but we had to have a defensive approach to try and combat their aggression because they were putting us under pressure.""""I guess the other side of that coin is when the bowling side is on top and they're able to hit the wicket and use the surface like we saw Bumrah and the others in their bowling attack, which was very difficult,"" Williamson said at the post-match press conference.He said in Twenty20 cricket batsmen need to be aggressive to try and take on bowlers.""We've seen Bhuvi and Bumrah throughout not just the one-dayers, but for a long time in the IPL. I've been fortunate to play with Bhuvi and against Bumrah and theyre the most consistent bowlers in world cricket.""Williamson admitted his side was under pressure from the word go.""We were under pressure pretty much from the word go. Losing early wickets puts you on the backfoot and on the surface, it was stopping and turning. Trying to accelerate the run rate when you are under pressure is not an easy task. That was the nature of the batting innings,"" said the visiting skipper.""We were never able to get momentum in our batting against them to try and get close to the total. Every time we attempted to increase the run rate, we lost wickets. A lot of it is our fault and then India bowled very well as well so the combination of that certainly did not allow us to get close to the total."""

5a0182509855b76bf13a9d4d,End of a protest: The story of Jantar Mantar as a protest site began in 1993,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jantar-mantar-protests-ngt-end-of-a-protest-2011-lokpal-agitation-anna-hazare-4922867/,2017-11-05,"Four days after the NGT order, the Jantar Mantar road, now cleared of debris and dissent, seems larger and quieter. Four days after the NGT order, the Jantar Mantar road, now cleared of debris and dissent, seems larger and quieter.With the NGT asking protesters to move out of Jantar Mantar, Aniruddha Ghosal tells the story of the tree-lined boulevard that for 24 years lent a space to anyone who wielded a placard and a cause  from a man fighting to prove he is alive to the 2011 Lokpal agitation that scripted a new political narrative.Last Thursday, Manohar Lal stopped hoping. His nearly 40-year battle for justice had ended, he had given up, he explained. Evicted from Jantar Mantar, the solo protester headed home to Dewas near Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Before leaving, he had dumped a few photocopies of pamphlets into a garbage bin at Jantar Mantar. It would have weighed me down, he says.The 60-year-olds protest began in 1978, when the small shoe factory he ran in Dewas was attacked by the management of a larger conglomerate. Extortion and violence allegedly followed, forcing him to give up the factory. A long legal battle saw him selling off almost everything he owned and he even ended up in jail. After he came out, in 2016, he headed to Jantar Mantar. When I came here, I realised that my experience was neither uncommon nor the worst. It was the most humbling experience to realise that there were so many people like me. It made me feel less alone. All of us wanted justice, wanted to be heard.On October 30, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned protests at Jantar Mantar, in the heart of New Delhi, after some residents of the area argued that they had to put up with noise pollution and unhygienic surroundings. The NGT found merit in their plea and asked authorities to shift the protesters to an alternative site  Ramlila Maidan, about 4 km away. The tribunal cited three grounds while issuing these directions  there is no executive order that demarcates Jantar Mantar as a protest site, that its marked as a residential area in the Delhi Master Plan and finally, that the agitations caused noise pollution.Supporters of the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement in 2011 that changed the political narrative. Supporters of the Anna Hazare-led anti-corruption movement in 2011 that changed the political narrative.And so, on October 30, dissent lost a 24-year-old address. The proposed alternative, the 15-acre Ramlila Maidan, run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, usually lets out the ground for a fee  to one party at a time for Rs 50,000 a day  for big political rallies, religious functions and even weddings.Jantar Mantar, on the other hand, was the capitals Hyde Park, where all you needed was a cause, a placard and a voice. That is how some of the protests, big and small, came to be held on the lane abutting the 18th-century observatory  from 36-year-old Santosh Murat Singh, who has been fighting to be proved alive after being declared dead 12 years ago, to the 2011 Lokpal agitation led by Anna Hazare that shook the establishment of the day. The physical proximity of the site to Parliament  less than 2 km away  was crucial to its relevance. Some see a larger symbolism in the NGT ruling  that the establishment, by moving the protesters further away from the seat of power, was muffling the voice of protest.Four days after the NGT order, the Jantar Mantar road, now cleared of debris and dissent, seems larger and quieter. Still barricaded on both sides, it is only at lunch time that the roadside eateries, with the usual fare of dosas, idlis and chole bhature, see some queues. But these are orderly; dissent, if any, is restricted to the lack of seasoning.******The story of Jantar Mantar as a protest site began in 1993. There was no ordinance, no official declaration, yet the tree-lined boulevard that connects Tolstoy Road to the Ashoka Road roundabout came to be the only place in New Delhi where Section 144  the 19th-Century British-era law that prohibits the assembly of more than five people  was not imposed. That year, the capital got its new dissent square  Jantar Mantar.Until then, at a time when Delhi was still to expand its boundaries southwards and eastwards, it was the Boat Club, with its view of Janpath, Rajpath and Parliament, that was the iconic space for resistance. But with the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid movement gripping the country, the Congress-led government, already rattled by an earlier agitation in 1988, imposed a ban on gatherings at the Boat Club.Former PM Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee addresses an anti-price-rise rally at Boat Club in January 1989.The 1988 agitation had been led by western UP farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait. With five lakh farmers and their cows, Tikait had reportedly paralysed Delhi. After initially camping at Raj Ghat, they had moved to Boat Club and finally taken over the lawns of India Gate in their bullock carts, camping there for weeks.A police officer posted at that time at the Parliament Street police station said, The entire movement was a nightmare for us. Imagine Delhi, the way it used to be  quiet, far fewer cars New Delhi especially was pristine. Suddenly, there were cows and farmers everywhere.Tikaits organisation, the Bharatiya Kisan Union, was born from the spectacular success of that Boat Club rally, which had forced the Rajiv Gandhi government to accept his 35-point charter of demands.But after that, it became apparent to successive governments that the protest venue had to be controlled. Jantar Mantar seemed ideal at the time. Though it was close to Parliament, it was not large enough to hold a big crowd. Besides, the topography of Jantar Mantar, with its two main entry and exit points, was easier to manage.Initially a trickle and eventually a torrent, protesters began moving into Jantar Mantar. Having travelled hundreds of kilometres from home, Jantar Mantar was their home for as long as they had the spirit to fight. They came, hoping their stories would be heard - from a farmer reeling under debts after successive droughts, to women who had been raped, but had not found justice. Each of these stories shared a similar sentiment: We want to be heard, we matter.At Jantar Mantar, democracy and dissent shared a complicated relationship. While some protests fizzled out, others led to momentous shifts in political realities.On April 5, 2011, Anna Hazare, then a relatively unknown social activist from Maharashtra, began a hunger strike at Jantar Mantar to root out corruption and to demand a Lokpal Bill. The movement snowballed, with prominent activists such as Prashant Bhushan and Arvind Kejriwal joining in, finally leading to the birth of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Journalist-turned-AAP leader Ashutosh says, Boat Club was wide and vibrant, very different from Jantar Mantar. There was a lot of space. From one end you could see Rajpath and from the other, you could see Janpath. Jantar Mantar, on the other hand, is a much more closed space. But the proximity to Parliament, the seat of power, is much more symbolic at Jantar Mantar than at Boat Club. For years, Jantar Mantar was an essential training ground for young journalists  to see how democracy works and the ways in which it doesnt.Senior BJP leader Vijay Jolly, who began his political career as a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and served as president of the Delhi University Students Union from 1980-81, says that just as protests sites changed, so did the nature of protests. Today, with the advent of TV debates, political battles are no longer fought on the streets or college campuses. Instead, lung power is exerted on television debates. Now with WhatsApp and other social media tools, it is easy to get people to turn up for causes, he says, pointing out that parties such as the AAP mobilised their crowds at Jantar Mantar through some smart use of social media.Looking back to the times when he was younger and angrier, Jolly says, Back in 1977, I was able to protest at Patel Chowk and that is something thats impossible now for very important reasons. But in a democracy, protest is ones inherent right. A protest, by its very definition, is going to inconvenience some. But if you have to pay Rs 1 lakh at Ramlila Maidan to protest, it is just not right.Few know more about the political power that Jantar Mantar potentially possessed than the Congress. Their defeat in Delhi in 2013 was linked to the 2011 anti-corruption protests and the December 16 protests that began from Jantar Mantar and spilled onto the streets of India Gate. But the partys Ajay Maken says, Jantar Mantar is close to Parliament and that was important  one could say youre demonstrating outside Parliament. Now that has changed and that is simply undemocratic. Secondly, if NGT has raised the issue of noise pollution, wont it be an issue with Ramlila Maidan so close to GB Pant Hospital and LNJP hospital. And finally, the move is elitist youre not allowing common people to protest in Lutyens Delhi, keeping it free of the din of protests. Maken has been at the centre of several protests in Delhi, first as DUSU president in 1985 and then as the president of Delhi Transport Corporation Trade Union.Conservation architect Anisha Shekhar Mukherji, who has authored Jantar Mantar: Maharaja Sawai Jai Singhs Observatory in Delhi, says the decision to move out the protest site was reflective of the fragmentation of the city, reminiscent of how the British designed Imperial Delhi.Originally, the Jantar Mantar area was outside the city of Shahjahanabad (todays Old Delhi). In 1857, the area had served as a refuge for the inhabitants of Shahjahanabad, who had been turned out of the old city by the British. But when Lutyens was designing the new city, he actively ignored existing spaces and inhabitants  the new capital wasnt for common people. The same attitude continues today, she says, adding that the protests on the street outside were never an impediment to the historical structure. The only time in recent years that protesters entered the observatory was during a farmer rally in 2009, she says.Historian, activist and filmmaker Sohail Hashmi talks of how the space for protest shrunk even within Jantar Mantar. Back in 1993, we could hold protests at the triangular park between the monument and the road. I have participated in and organised several such protests. But they had to beautify the park, so they shifted the protesters to the road. Then they put up barricades, so the space shrank further, he says, adding, In the capital city of the worlds largest democracy, this was the last remaining site to air dissent. Such spaces exist in the heart of London, New York and Washington DC, but here, you close it down? For what? Because some rich people think that its too noisy?Not everyone agrees that the move to stop protests at Jantar Mantar is undemocratic. Back in 1993, when Jantar Mantar was designated the protest street, Ashish Sood was a fledgling politician and a former DUSU president. Now a BJP councillor with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, he recalls how the shift from Boat Club had triggered a similar debate.Earlier, protests would take place at a chowk on Akbar Road, then they moved to the Boat Club, and finally, they came to Jantar Mantar. When VP Singh was PM, I rode my scooter right up to his 7 Race Course Road residence to protest, at a time when the party was taking up the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi. Later, when I protested against the Bofors scam, I marched all the way from Jantar Mantar to Parliament. Now all that is unthinkable. But the population of Delhi then was a mere 25 lakh. Today, Delhi is growing at an incredible pace, and traffic and pollution are major concerns. The question that one needs to ask is whether protesting for ones rights can infringe on the rights of others, he says, adding, If the cause has substance, if it has the power to move people, the venue is irrelevant.Historian Narayani Gupta agrees, Its one thing to get nostalgic about Jantar Mantar, but one also has to be pragmatic and find a practical solution for a space to protest. The park outside Feroz Shah Kotla, for instance, can work.At least one person has already made plans for a protest. Tikaits son, Rakesh Tikait, wants to hold a farmers rally in Delhi at the end of November. The issues are almost identical as those his father raised in 1988. The lives of farmers have not improved Sugarcane prices need to be raised. In Uttarakhand, the BJP is in power, but farmers loans, payment of sugar mill arrears and declaration of the minimum support price are still big issues. We will hold a massive rally, but with Jantar Mantar closed, I will come next week and figure out where we can protest.Asked what he would do if the government doesnt give him a place to protest, he says, I will speak to the commissioner of police. They have to give us space. If they dont, they are basically saying that it is okay if farmers die.******For now, the Ramlila grounds, though hardly ever empty, rarely looks angry. On Wednesday morning, there are a few cars parked outside the ground, a few inside. Students from the nearby Zakir Hussain College use the ground as a short-cut to walk to the campus from Ajmeri Gate.Jivan Das, a farmer from Odisha who was protesting at Jantar Mantar, has come to inspect the new address for dissent in Delhi. He isnt impressed. There is nothing to eat here. Nothing to drink. There are no trees no shade. Its dusty and far louder than Jantar Mantar ever was. Who will come to listen to a lonely protester? No one.Its at night, however, that Ramlila Maidan looks a world apart from Jantar Mantar. Long after the office crowd, stray journalists and Metro commuters had thinned out, Jantar Mantar Road would take on another form  gas-stoves get lit and the aroma of different regional cuisines fill the air, while some of the protesters would head to nearby Gurdwara Bangla Sahib for langar. Later, blankets of varying degrees of wear and tear would appear and dissent would take a temporary break, only to come alive the next morning.The Ramlila Maidan, in contrast, is deserted at night. There are few lights inside and the road outside is lifeless. For now, dissent is yet to find its new address.Protests elsewhereMumbaiAzad Maidan is Mumbais address for dissent. Part of the ground is where Mumbais budding cricketers practise their craft. The Special Branch, the intelligence wing of the Mumbai Police, and an outpost of the Azad Maidan Police station, mark the entrance to the ground. They act as a channel between protesters and the governmentHyderabadFor years the citys version of Jantar Mantar was the Dharna Chowk at the Indira Park, located close to the state secretariat and Assembly. In May this year, however, the Telangana governments decision to bar protests at Indira Park and move the designated site to a spot on the outskirts of the city sparked clashes between Opposition parties and residents of colonies near the park. Six people were injured in the clashesChandigarh/JalandharThe Rally Ground in Chandigarh has been the hub of protests since 2010, when a rally at the earlier earmarked site, Matka Chowk, turned violent. In Jalandhar, the proximity of the protest hub, the Desh Bhagat Yaadgaar Hall, to the deputy commissioners office (500 metres away), where protests culminate, ensures the city is never shut down by protestersGuwahatiThe city has no legal space for protests as the Gauhati High Court has banned protests on the banks of the Dighalipukhuri, the traditional venue for dissent. While the court ordered the government to identify an alternative site, authorities have so far failed to do soChennaiThe space near the Valluvarkottam campus and a part of the road outside Chepauk stadium are usually allowed for protests, though only under strict police guidelines. But the city has no venue for sustained protests. In January, a gathering at Marina Beach of a dozen students, who were protesting against the Jallikattu ban, had emerged as a mass movementKolkataWith the shift of the secretariat from Writers Building to Nabanna, protests at the Benoy-Badal-Dinesh Bagh, formerly the Dalhousie Square, have stopped. But protests at Esplanade or Dharmatala, in the heart of the city, continue till date, including the TMCs annual Martyrs Day celebrationsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The duo came up with what they thought was a perfect kidnapping plan, while simultaneously exploiting Olas concern with its image. The plan, though, had one flaw  a sticker they forgot to replace. Sources told The Indian Express that the driving licence of the two accused  Sushil Motla and Anuj Motla  were suspended by Ola an year ago. But since they were aware about the process of verification with the Ola service, they hatched a conspiracy and procured all forged documents needed for verification.Each document, including the bank account cheques and voter ID of the drivers, was forged. They had made such a watertight plan that they had not left any evidence for us to establish their identity, said JCP (eastern range) Ravindra Yadav.A day after Dr Shreekant Goud was kidnapped, the duo, on July 7, made their first call to Olas customer care office in Bengaluru. Yadav said, They called and said they had kidnapped a customer. When asked the reason, they said it was done for fun. But soon after, the accused called and said he wanted to talk to the senior manager and eventually demanded Rs 5 crore from the company, Yadav added.The two knew that the company was extremely conscious of its image and would definitely pay. In the meantime, they got repeated calls from the family, but they avoided those, the JCP said. Meanwhile, the team from Preet Vihar Police Station was tasked with verifying old drivers whose licences had been suspended or had quit, said sources, which led the team to Vasundhara in Ghaziabad, where they found the two brothers.READ: Abductors asked doctor what he wanted for birthday  cake or liquorTheir documents yielded little. However, police came across information regarding a WagonR car that they drove a year ago. The photo of this car, which they had sent to the company, proved crucial. They hadnt changed the colour of the car but the licence plate number was different. What also was the same was a sticker of Tanya Motors pasted on the rear end, next to right tail lights, said a source.Tracing it, police reached their village in Dadri, where at least a hundred villagers were questioned. Other teams were, meanwhile, formed to trace the duo. Eventually, police found that the two had been provided aide by Vivek alias Modi, Gaurav Sharma and Pramod Kumar. Kumar has since been arrested. Three days after the brothers submitted the forged documents to Ola for verification, they began getting calls from customers, said police. But they didnt want to ply a customer unless he or she was alone and would ask about it whenever someone booked the cab. Confirmed that he was travelling alone, on July 6, at 11:38pm, they picked up Goud from near Preet Vihar Metro station.Goud had booked the cab for his house in Gautam Nagar in south Delhi, but enroute the Wagon R, driven by Sushil, was chased and stopped by another car. They (Sushils accomplices) got out of the car and asked Goud to keep sitting in the car at gun point. They even thrashed him when he objected. Goud was then driven to western UP, from where, police said, their location changed frequently  from Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Baghpat, Hapur, Meerut, Bijnor, Muzzafarnagar and Haridwar. During this period, they used Gouds phone to make ransom calls. During one search operation, the accused fled into sugarcane fields leaving behind the vehicle used in kidnapping. Even though the car was recovered, Goud was not found.Interestingly, throughout the course of the event, Anuj Motla, kept updating his Facebook profile. On July 19, at about 6 pm, a raid was conducted at a house in Meerut, from where victim was rescued and four persons  Pramod Kumar (44), Amit Kumar alias Billu (37), Sohanveer (34) and Nepal alias Goverdhan (44) were arrested. The house belonged to Sohanveer and he was paid to harbour them. During the exchange of fire on July 19, Pramod sustained a bullet wound in his left leg. Police said during the time of the raid, Vivek and Gaurav were not in the house.An Ola spokesperson said: We are relieved on the safe return of Dr Sreekanth Goud We continue to cooperate with the police and assist the family to help them fully recover. Police said at least 200 policemen comprising 12 teams, led by DCP (east) Ombir Singh, three ACPs and 10 inspectors led to the whole operation.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

Expressing concern over the absolute lack of data on trans fats, she said a specific study on trans fats, including its levels in blood would also be done. It will also look into parameters like blood lipid levels and urinary salt excretion among others, she said.Having such data is important to formulate a policy that would guide not just production but publicity and consumption as well. In 2013, the WHO had released a report advocating against the food industrys marketing strategies that target children. To save younger generations, the organisation endorsed strict regulation of such gimmicks.India, too, has taken some baby steps in this direction. The Centre is also working with several State governments to bring about some policy changes as well as transforming the way the system is looking at chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension, Dr Swaminathan said. To start with, the Centre would launch a pilot effort in coordination with five or six States.Non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension and cancer form the major chunk of causes of death in India, the risk factors for which include high intake of fat, sugar and salt. This makes understanding the dietary pattern and the effect of these on the Indian population critical to form any policy.To assist the governments in policy making on FSS, the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, an ICMR institution, would set up a Centre for Public Health Nutrition, which would analyse the available data and identify the gaps, Dr Swaminathan said. At present, there are no institutions that look into these factors comprehensively.The dearth of quality data on FSS was revealed as recently as 2016, when the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) constituted an 11-member panel of eminent experts from the fields of medicine, nutrition and dietetics from reputed medical research and academic institutions to address the issue of high fat, sugar and salt in food. The team, however, could not find even a single comprehensive Indian study on this.They then collated all possible data from published and unpublished, region-specific, urban, rural and multi-centric studies from India and found 4,223 articles. But removing duplications, there were only 58 studies in all  23 of them on fats, 16 on sugar and 19 on salt.But these were far from being desirable. Experts found that dietary assessment was not the primary objective in most of these studies and thus felt the link between FSS and the various conditions may not be fully revealed. Another important limitation was their unreliable quality.Most studies mentioned carbohydrate, not actual sugar, intake. In the absence of fractions and details about simple and complex carbohydrate intake, the team could not derive many inferences. Also, these studies largely recruited diabetic patients which compromised the data.The studies on salt did discuss the link between high intake and hypertension but a majority of them did not report the 24-hour urinary sodium levels, which is considered the gold standard for sodium/salt intake estimation.They showed that the intake of total and saturated fats was higher than recommended, though did not report these facts separately.Observing that a meta-analysis could not be undertaken, the experts recommended that the country urgently needed long-term cohort studies with more emphasis on intervention trials for good quality data on public health nutrition."

Its unlikely the current drought in the peninsula would cause any food inflation that the RBI has to be worried about.No monsoon is perfect. Even in the best of years, there are patches that register deficient rainfall. During the current southwest monsoon season (June-September), India as a whole, so far, has received rainfall that is 3 per cent above the historical average or normal for this period. But the countrys southern tip  the old Mysore region (south interior Karnataka), Kerala and Tamil Nadu  has had roughly 25 per cent below-average rains. This comes on top of rainfall deficiency that amounted to over 35 per cent last year. Simply put, this contiguous belt has replaced Maharashtra as the new epicentre of drought, with back-to-back rainfall failures similar to what Marathwada experienced in 2014 and 2015 (thankfully not in 2016 and this year).Its unlikely the current drought in the peninsula would cause any food inflation that the RBI has to be worried about. Lower sugar, maize or jowar production in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will be more than made up by output rebound in other states, especially Maharashtra. The same goes for milk, where the big producing states  from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh  have all recorded enough rain to ensure plentiful fodder and feed availability. But merely because the countrys overall agricultural production will not take a hit cannot be reason to ignore the crisis thats bound to unfold in the deep south  it may be no less political, more so with assembly elections less than eight months away in Karnataka.Last September saw a major stand-off when the Karnataka government, in deference to a Supreme Court order, was forced to release water from its reservoirs on the Cauvery river basin to the Mettur dam across the border in Tamil Nadu. It triggered violent protests by pro-Kannada groups who contended that there was hardly any water in the Krishna Raja Sagara and other Cauvery reservoirs to meet their own farmers irrigation needs. The reservoir levels now are lower than even last years. Fresh tensions could erupt in about a month from now, when farmers in Tamil Nadus delta districts start transplanting their main Samba paddy crop. This is precisely the time for the Centre to convene a meeting of the three states to initiate drought relief work in advance and also arrive at some understanding on sharing of waters, of the Cauvery or the Periyar. And the political parties concerned should refrain from fanning the fires of parochialism.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Oinam Anand Purnima Shrivastav at the dharna. Oinam AnandWhen the country was busy celebrating a century of Mahatma Gandhis earliest experiment with satyagraha at Champaran in April, two mill workers from a small town in east Champaran were staging a protest of their own  demanding unpaid wages for the last 134 months, they set themselves on fire. But no one heard their desperate pleas before their death.Two months later, sugar mill workers from Motihari have assembled at Jantar Mantar to demand a CBI inquiry into the deaths of their fellow workers, Naresh Srivastava and Suraj Baitha.We had spread the word and informed all authorities about their protest yet no one helped us save Naresh and Suraj when they set themselves on fire on April 10, said Vinod Singh, joint secretary of the Mazdoor Sangh Union. Instead, the group of 25 workers Thursday alleged, police forces came to the spot after the incident and fired at protesters, lathi-charged them and lobbed tear gas shells at them.The sugar mill company owes us a total of Rs 75 crore since it shut down in 2002. The owner is from one of the wealthiest industrial families in the country. That is why we have not been able to eke out our wages. No one is investigating the harassment we have been through after Naresh and Suraj set themselves on fire, said 70-year-old Ram Chander Panit, rolling up his sleeves to show where a bullet had hit him.Social activist and chairman of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front, Swami Agnivesh, meanwhile, alleged that he had written to the ruling dispensation in Bihar, the BJP and several other political leaders, but in vain. We have contacted many politicians and all of them promised help but nothing has been done so far. We demand a CBI inquiry into the deaths of the two workers, he said.The protesters said they travelled to Delhi, thwarting attempts by police and administration to keep them from taking trains to the capital. Baithas wife, Maya Devi, and many workers were not allowed to board the train on Wednesday. Devi and her son will join us on Friday. We, who are here today, made it to Delhi after a lot of trouble, even hiding from police, Manohar Manav, one of the social workers accompanying the mill workers, said.Srivastavas wife, Purnima Devi, alleged the police, politicians and the mill owner were working hand-in-glove to oppress workers and thwart a fair probe into her husbands death. When my husbands body was being driven down to Motihari from a Patna hospital, where he had been admitted, I demanded that they drop us outside the mill, where all the workers had planned to gather to cremate my husband. But police lied to me and drove us to a ghat, where he was hurriedly cremated on April 12, she said.The workers also recounted how the sugar mill, spread across hundreds of acres had suddenly shut down in 2002, and had only opened intermittently when it was high sale season.Wages including arrears, PF, gratuity and interest amounting to Rs 75 crore owed to 600 have not been paid to the workers. After many months of protests, the state facilitated a mediation between the workers and the owner in 2015 but the factory management went back on its word. District authorities, meanwhile, said the matter was under investigated by a Special Investigation Team.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

I do not even know anything about sand mining and have never thought about getting into it. Khaira is making these claims because I am close to Rana Gurjit, who brought me into politics, said Laddi. Attempts were made to speak to Ramanjit Sikki for his response to Khairas allegations but his mobile phone was switched off.Launching an attack on Rana Gurjit, the AAP MLA alleged that the minister had emerged as a defaulter of payments of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and that as per that states Cane Commissioner, Vipin Kumar Dwivedi, Rs 202 crore were due to farmers from four sugar mills in the state.There are orders in place to seize his passport and this should be done straightaway so that he does not flee the country like Mallya, said Khaira. Asking for fresh auction of sand minies in the state, he added: Rana Gurjit was emerging as Punjabs Vijay Mallya.Calling the allegations baseless, Rana Gurjit said: There was a slump in the sugar industry last year and not only my mills were affected but there was an overall negative affect on the payments to be made. But all this has been sorted out now and you can speak to the affected farmers to check. What has Khaira got to do with all this? Does he know anything about the sugar industry.However, Khaira alleged that the inquiry commission was set up to give a clean chit to Rana Gurjit. He said that issues relating to money laundering and the ways and means through which Rana Gurjits employees received cash to bid for the mines had not been included in the terms and reference of Justice Narang Commission and this defeats the basic purpose of the inquiry. He demanded that the Narang Commission be disbanded.One bidder for 17 minesAAP MLA Sukhpal Khaira also demanded a probe into the manner in which there was only one bidder for 17 sand mine sites. He said that there was a need to inquire into the circumstances in which only one bidder emerged for such a large number of mines.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) Vice President Mike Pence joined NASA leaders in Houston, Texas to announce new astronaut candidates. (Representational Image)NASA has chosen 12 new astronauts, including an Indian-American, from a record number of over 18,000 applicants, who will be trained for missions into Earth orbit and to deep space. The seven men and five women comprise the 22nd class of American spaceflight trainees since 1959. This is the largest group NASA has selected in almost two decades. It was selected from a record 18,300 applicants  more than NASA has ever had during an open astronaut call. To get picked, people had to meet some physical requirements as well as certain education and experience criteria  such as having a bachelors degree in a STEM field or accumulating up to 1,000 hours of piloting jets.But its clear that this new class greatly surpasses all the minimum skills that NASA requires.After completing two years of training, the new astronaut candidates could be assigned to missions performing research on the International Space Station, launching from American soil on spacecraft built by commercial companies, and flying on deep space missions on NASAs new Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket.Vice President Mike Pence joined NASA leaders, including acting administrator Robert Lightfoot and director of flight operations Brian Kelly, in Houston, Texas to announce the new astronaut candidates, or ascans.The event was set inside the Johnson Space Centers Space Vehicle Mockup Facility in front of a full-scale engineering model of NASAs Orion spacecraft, which the new astronauts might fly in the coming years on missions beyond low Earth orbit.Pence said that President Donald Trump is firmly committed to NASAs mission in space and that America will lead the way in space once again.He said that NASA would continue to have the resources it needs to make history  even though the presidents budget request cuts funding and cancels certain programs at the agency.He also mentioned that NASA would continue to collaborate with the commercial space industry in the future.While delivering the speech, Pence touted the merits of the new astronaut class.The courage of these men and women, and all the astronauts who have gone before, inspires me to this very day, he said.The 12 new candidates include six military officers, three scientists, two medical doctors, a lead engineer at SpaceX and a NASA research pilot.Lt Col Raja Grinder Chari, 39, is a commander of the 461st Flight Test Squadron and the director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California.Hailing from Waterloo, Iowa, Chari earned a Masters degree in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and graduated from the US Naval Test Pilot School. His father is from India.Lt Kayla Sax Barron, 29, is a US Navy submarine officer from Richland, Washington. A member of the US Navys first class of women commissioned into the submarine community, Barron comes to NASA from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where she has been serving as the Flag Aide to the Superintendent.Zena Cardman, a 29-year-old is a geobiologist who had done research at Penn State University in Pennsylvania.

In a note that the police say he left behind, Jadhav said he should not be cremated ""till Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis comes here"".Jadhav had just 2.5 acres of cultivable land and a debt of over 60,000 rupees from banks and money lenders that he felt he couldn't repay. He leaves behind two young children and wife.Solapur Collector Rajendra Bhosale confirmed to news agency Press Trust of India about Jadhav's instructions and said he was rushing to the village. So are police reinforcements. Vijay Deshmukh, the state minister in-charge of Solapur district, has visited the state earlier in the day.As word about the suicide got around, farmer organisations blocked the main road and called for a bandh in the Karmala tehsil, triggering worries within the state administration that the farmer protests could spread.The suicide could further fuel the farmer protests in the state that have continued despite Mr Fadnavis announcement to waive loans held by defaulting farmers with small tracts of land and low incomes.Mr Fadnavis tried to buy peace last week with a loan waiver for marginal or poor farmers who defaulted on repayments. But it hasn't convinced the farmers yet; the farmers say they will continue the strike until the waiver was extended to debt of all farmers and not just marginal, or poorer, farmers who defaulted.They also want the government to take firm steps to boost farm incomes and cut supplies of vegetables and milk to Mumbai and Pune to get their point across.Maharashtra, the country's second-biggest producer of sugar, cotton and soybean, has the maximum number of farmer suicides in the country. In 2015, the last year for which national data is available, 4,291 farmers killed themselves as compared to 4,004 in 2014. Most of these suicides were linked to bankruptcy."

The seven men and five women comprise the 22nd class of American spaceflight trainees since 1959. Lt Col Raja ""Grinder"" Chari, 39, is a commander of the 461st Flight Test Squadron and the director of the F-35 Integrated Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California. Hailing from Waterloo, Iowa, Chari earned a Master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics from MIT and graduated from the US Naval Test Pilot School. His father is from India.This is the largest group NASA has selected in almost two decades.It was selected from a record 18,300 applicants - more than NASA has ever had during an open astronaut call. To get picked, people had to meet some physical requirements as well as certain education and experience criteria - such as having a bachelor's degree in a STEM field or accumulating up to 1,000 hours of piloting jets.But it's clear that this new class greatly surpasses all the minimum skills that NASA requires.After completing two years of training, the new astronaut candidates could be assigned to missions performing research on the International Space Station, launching from American soil on spacecraft built by commercial companies, and flying on deep space missions on NASA's new Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket.Vice President Mike Pence joined NASA leaders, including acting administrator Robert Lightfoot and director of flight operations Brian Kelly, in Houston, Texas to announce the new astronaut candidates, or ""ascans"".Pence said that Donald Trump is ""firmly committed"" to NASA's mission in space and that ""America will lead the way in space once again.""He said that NASA would continue to have the resources it needs to ""make history"" - even though the president's budget request cuts funding and cancels certain programs at the agency.He also mentioned that NASA would continue to collaborate with the commercial space industry in the future. While delivering the speech, Pence touted the merits of the new astronaut class.""The courage of these men and women, and all the astronauts who have gone before, inspires me to this very day,"" he said.The 12 new candidates include six military officers, three scientists, two medical doctors, a lead engineer at SpaceX and a NASA research pilot.Lt Kayla ""Sax"" Barron, 29, is a US Navy submarine officer from Richland, Washington. A member of the US Navy's first class of women commissioned into the submarine community, Barron comes to NASA from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where she has been serving as the Flag Aide to the Superintendent.Zena Cardman, a 29-year-old is a geobiologist who had done research at Penn State University in Pennsylvania.

5a03779c9855b76bf13b7161,Port Bans Choke Qatar's Commodity Trade As Gas Supply Worries Grow,http://profit.ndtv.com/news/global-economy/article-port-bans-choke-qatars-commodity-trade-as-gas-supply-worries-grow-1708986,2017-06-07,"Singapore/London: A campaign by leading Arab powers to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepening fears of a possible shock to the global gas market, where the tiny Gulf state is a major player.Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG).Traders worried that Riyadh's allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding ""radical ideology"" after he had demanded they take action to stop financing militant groups. Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. ""Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,"" it said.More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.However, shoppers packed stores on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean.Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refuelling at the UAE's port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refuelling points at extra cost, industry sources said.Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market.Qatar, the world's biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally.The UAE's ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar.""This shouldn't affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It's a minor inconvenience,"" one LNG trader said.LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country's Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said.Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies.Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura, Glencore and Vitol.""The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,"" a trading source said.The rift has also hit aluminium exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway's Norsk Hydro as it has lost access to the large Jebel Ali port in the UAE, through which it typically runs exports operations.Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.

He introduces himself as a ladykiller. Few Hindi films are as upfront and unapologetic about narcissism, andgives us a pair of fit young leads falling all over each other, giddy on their own vanity. He wears vests without sleeves, she wears shirts that say ""quinoa & kale"", as if to explain away her washboard midriff, and makes faces as she walks, as if slyly taking selfies when we aren't looking. He preens a lot, tightening his pecs and flaunting his abs, leading her to nickname him 'badan.' That might be a first.However, despite the refreshment promised by a relationship based on cockiness instead of conventional sap, Dinesh Vijan's Raabta is let down whenever the well-sculpted protagonists open their mouths. She tries to shoo him off, saying she has a boyfriend. ""I've known you for only two days,"" she exclaims. ""I've watched sunrises with him. Gone for long drives. Had candlelit dinners."" He presses on, undeterred by this relationship roll-call, already having announced that he's a ""player."" He's a banker in Budapest, she makes chocolate (but doesn't, I imagine, consume much of it) and the two swiftly become intimate, swapping around the same lollipop with nauseating ease.All this while, a 'love comet' - or one named by the curate from- is scheduled to fly across the skies for the first time in eight hundred years. What this portends is anybody's guess, but the girl, Saira, is finding her recurring dreams coming to life. There are a couple of men in weirdcosplay while she's dressed like an extra from Shah Rukh Khan's, and something dramatic and scary is happening underwater. She sleeps with a light on, but that might not be enough now, considering the two men from her nightmare have stepped into her world: Shiv, who has won her over with his abs and his absolute confidence, and Zak, a smarmy tycoon who has what she keeps calling a mysterious smile.After this, alas, the cosplay takes over. Suddenly we're bang in the middle of some past-life malarkey where she's a warrior princess who wants to fight tigers with daggers and her man, Shiv, is a snarling and scowly Khal wannabe. Let's just call him Khal No-Go. This extended and tedious sequence, pitched at an operatic high, is basically Apocalypto by way of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Which is to say it's all exaggerated emotion and exotic eyeliner.There's no coming back from that. When we return to the relative reality of the contemporary narrative, all is shattered and even the potential of athletic affection has been squandered. Not that, to be fair, there wasn't much to begin with. ""I'm a banker so I know economics matters,"" huffs Shiv, played by Sushant Singh Rajput, ""But is chemistry nothing?"" Kriti Sanon, who plays Saira, can only stare back in bafflement.Rajput, a fine actor, tries far too hard to play the boyish cad , behaving like a Ranveer Singh fan hopped up on sugar. He oscillates inconsistently between his broken Punjabi-English and regular English, but his energy just about sees him through. Sanon performs more consistently and has remarkably assured body language, but the past-life dialogues are too much for her to shoulder. In the middle is Jim Sarbh, slimy and Joker-like, painting lips on paintings and shooting his own henchmen and basically being an oily ham.By the time Deepika Padukone brings her almighty legs to the screen in an attempt to resurrect the film with a jig, all is already lost. Do not watch, unless you already suffered through it in a past life."

""The import of all food and consumer goods from different sources and countries continues normally.""Qatar, an arid country about the size of the U.S. state of Connecticut, relies heavily on imports to feed its 2.7 million people, most of them expatriates. Its ports and airports remained open to trade with countries not taking part in the Saudi-led boycott, the government said. Some 38 percent of Qatar's food comes across the border from Saudi Arabia, Mazen Al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital, a Riyadh-based financial services company, said Tuesday in a Bloomberg TV interview.""An abundant strategic reserve of food and consumer goods is available,"" the ministry video's narrator said. ""Prices are stable and will not be affected, especially that the prices of most consumer and food products have been fixed and any changes will require the ministry's approval.""Shoppers on Monday night waited by the dozens in checkout lines at supermarkets in the capital Doha as people stocked up on rice, chicken and other staples after Saudi Arabia and allied Arab nations severed ties.""I'm concerned some products may be out of stock until suppliers find new sources,"" Mohammed Saeed, an Egyptian engineer, said at a Carrefour SA grocery store in central Doha. ""There are some packaged goods from Saudi, and as you can see many people are stocking up in those aisles.""By Tuesday morning, stores were quieter, though shelves at one grocery outlet were empty of eggs from the U.A.E. and milk packaged by Saudi Arabia's Almarai Co.The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, together with Bahrain and Egypt, accuse Qatar of supporting extremist groups. The U.A.E. was the second-biggest source of imports into Qatar in the fourth quarter of 2016, while Saudi Arabia ranked eighth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Together, the two countries accounted for 15 percent of Qatari imports in the quarter, the data show.The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia are also Qatar's two biggest food suppliers, according to the World Bank.Both nations have stopped exporting white sugar to Qatar, ADM Investor Services International said in a report. ""Qatar's consumption is only around 100,000 tons a year, and they can source from elsewhere,"" it said.India and European countries will be quick to meet Qatar's sugar needs, Yves El Mallat, chief executive officer of Bahrain's Arabian Sugar Co., said Tuesday in a phone interview. ""Qatar might suffer a bit, but I don't think it will be for long,"" he said.Only about 1 percent of Qatari land is used to grow crops, according to the United Nations' Food & Agriculture Organization. The country has commissioned pilot projects to farm without soil, using hydroponics technology, and its $335 billion sovereign wealth fund owns rice, poultry, grain and livestock producers in Pakistan, Oman and Australia through its Hassad Food division.One potential source of food imports is Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran, whose cordial relationship with Qatar contributed to the diplomatic dispute. Iran can ship food across the Gulf to reach Qatar in 12 hours, said Reza Nourani, the chairman of Iran's food exporters' union, according to the Fars news agency.Even so, the opening of new supply routes could push food prices higher, causing pain for hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar, where the poorest such employees scrape by on 800 riyals ($219) a month. Shoppers at a Lulu hypermarket were loading up on essentials on Monday night.""I came today because of the news,"" said Martina, a 42-year-old office worker from the Philippines, who didn't want to give her last name. ""I need to buy before prices go up."""

The Men in Blue crushed the Proteas by eight wickets at The Oval in their final Group B fixture to set up a likely semi-final showdown with Bangladesh on Thursday.India had to win to avoid elimination after slumping to a shock loss against Sri Lanka, a spluttering performance that prompted Kohli to let his team know where they were going wrong.Rather than sugar-coat his comments to save his players' pride, the India captain made it clear they had to improve and he was delighted with how they responded in the make or break clash on Sunday.""You have to be honest. You have to sometimes say things that hurt. That's what I believe in,"" he said.""You have to lay it out in front of them that this is what we did wrong, including me, and we need to take it on the chin and accept it and prove it.""That's why we are chosen among millions of people to play at this level. You have to be good enough to do that for the country and you have to be good enough to bounce back, as well.""You can't do the same mistakes over and over again. That sort of mindset is really helping all of us to come together as a unit and make things happen.""It's not about asking two, three players to do it. We are asking everyone to do it and everyone is responding really well.ExperiencedWith India and Bangladesh joining hosts England in the last four and the winner of Monday's Sri Lanka against Pakistan match taking the last semi-final berth, it's been a strong tournament for the teams from the sub-continent.Kohli acknowledged the amount of one-day cricket played in the region was a factor, but he has also been impressed with the way India have adapted to the English conditions.""Maybe because of how much limited-overs cricket we play, I think the players are getting more experienced in difficult situations,"" he said.""Maybe some of the teams have really surprised the opposition with the way they have batted and bowled in certain situations.""(With inputs from AFP)"

People, irrespective of their age, are becoming aware of the need to get their BMIs (Body Mass Index) right so that they can avoid falling prey to lifestyle diseases. Nearly everyone is making a beeline to fitness centres. This trend has, in turn, worked in the favour of these centres.These fitness centres not only cater to those who want to lose weight but also to those who want to gain weight. Gym goers believe that the workouts enable them to strengthen their core and also preserve youthful energy.Sidharth Babu, who secured 15th rank in the Civil Services Exams this year, is one such gym enthusiast. I find working out at the gym relaxing,"" he says. This, in turn, helped me to overcome the stress and strain of preparing for my UPSC exams. Sidharth never misses even a single workout session. When I had to attend mock interviews as part of my Civil Services preparation, I worked out at home, he says.New types of workoutsWorkouts today arent restricted just to lifting weights and doing exercises on the various equipments. A lot of different but interesting types of workout methods are being used by the trainers to help their customers lose the flab.Zumba, kickboxing, power yoga, High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), group exercises, plyometric, spinning and supersets are some of the most favoured ones.According to Babukuttan, a trainer at the Ernakulam gym, more and more people are showing a preference for alternative fitness techniques.Earlier, the term gym evoked the picture of a place filled with complicated-looking equipment on which sweaty, well muscled men worked out. People thought of it as a place which only the body builders frequent. But the perception has changed today. he says.People are becoming aware of the need to be flexible and attain functional fitness. And this, in turn, has made alternative fitness techniques popular.If you are able to run 5 kms, you should also be able to do plyometric or kickboxing for 45 minutes, says Babukuttan. This marks the overall fitness of a person. The ultimate goal is to burn that excess fat.And HIIT is one of the techniques that helps a person to burn fat rather quickly, says Chandini, owner of Shape Fitness and Gym. A person will be able to burn calories at a faster rate by doing high intensity exercises with short rest periods like CrossFit and bootcamp classes says Chandini.But most people prefer to join group exercises, she adds. One major advantage of these group exercises is that they have an iron-clad schedule and this motivates the participants. They just have to show up with a positive attitude, participate and most importantly have fun, she says.Combos a hitWorkout combinations are also very much sought after. Trainers believe that by mixing all the right elements a fitness regime can work wonders. Aakash, a trainer at Gold Gym, says, The moves and exercise patterns are very simple. One flows from one exercise to the next. And because you dont take rest between the moves, the regime strengthens the body as well as enables you to have a cardiovascular workout. Every day the members are introduced to different techniques to break the monotony.Unisex gymsGone are the days when the men monopolised gyms. Women today are cool about doing exercise alongside men, paving the way for the rise of unisex gyms in the city. The whole girl thing-boy thing concept should be blamed for all the problems that the society faces today. We Malayalees have come far ahead in opting for unisex batches. I think theres hardly any need for women only batches. We need to step beyond the gender inhibition, said Jessy Seby Mathew, of Shape Fitness and Gym, Kochi.Siyad, trainer at Shape, agrees with Jessy. He says, Inhibition in any form will not only affect confidence but also stunt the overall development of a persons personality. We provide separate sessions for women whose religion prohibits them from working out with men, says Siyad.Under dieticians careMost of the gyms have their own personal dieticians, who guide the members in preparing their diet plans. Certified trainers also take up this responsibility in some cases to ensure a healthy dietary habit among their clients. Refined sugar is a villain, says power lifting state champion G M Anthony from Ernakulam gym. In order to be healthy stay away from processed food, he adds. But always consult a certified dietician before following a diet plan, says Sarika, senior dietician, Gold Gym.New fitness trendsCardio LatinA cardiovascular workout inspired by Latin rhythms. This is an interesting way to improve or maintain physical condition in a festive and colourful atmosphere. All moves in line with the rhythm and beat of Latin inspired dances.Boot campA type of group physical training programme. A high intensity weight loss programme. Both men and women can participate. These programmes are designed to build strength and fitness through a variety of intense set of exercises over a one hour period.What to eat before and after workouts?One hour before workout-Good carb food, egg white.Immediate after workout- Egg White, fruitsOne hour after work out- Brown rice, Fish (small fishes) Chicken and Salad.Things to noteDiet is the keyGet proper exercise with the help of a trainerFocus on your mealsNutrition is important23 hours equals 96 percent of your day.

(Syrian Democratic Forces, via AP, File) The SDF, an Arab-Kurdish alliance formed in 2015, spent seven months tightening the noose on Raqa city from the north, east and west. (Syrian Democratic Forces, via AP, File)US-backed Syrian fighters seized a second district of Raqa today and launched a renewed assault on a base north of the city, as they pursued an offensive against the Islamic State group. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) broke into Raqa earlier this week after announcing the start of a final assault on the IS-held city. Today, the Arab-Kurdish alliance said its fighters had liberated the neighbourhood of Al-Romaniya on the western front of Raqa, after two days of continued clashes.The SDF also holds the Al-Meshleb district, which it seized after announcing the final push for Raqa city on Tuesday. Today, fighters in Al-Meshleb were pushing deeper towards the city centre. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said they had also seized almost half the adjacent district of Al-Senaa from the jihadists.If theyre able to take the whole neighbourhood, it would be their most important advance to date because it would put them at the gates of the Old City, Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The western approach to the city was littered with mangled motorcycles and unexploded mortar rounds fired by IS, an AFP correspondent said. Three bodies of alleged IS fighters lay in the eerily empty streets of western Raqa, and SDF commanders took up positions on the rooftops of one-storey houses. The SDF fighters appeared on edge, both over IS-planted mines and reconnaissance drones that the jihadists have weaponised.Daesh is shooting anyone who sticks their head out, one SDF fighter said, using the Arabic acronym for IS. Artillery, sniper fire and air strikes rang out throughout the day and thick black smoke billowed from the city skyline. Bombardment had taken chunks out of the white dome of a neighbourhood mosque, and the notorious black IS flag hung limply from a nearby roof. After its capture by IS in 2014, Raqa city emerged as a key hub for ISs operations in Syria, neighbouring Iraq and beyond.The SDF  an Arab-Kurdish alliance formed in 2015 spent seven months tightening the noose on Raqa city from the north, east and west. The fighters have made less progress on the northern front, where jihadists are using a military base and an adjacent sugar factory to defend the approach into the city. Today they battled to dislodge the jihadists from the Division 17 base, with backing from the US-led coalition bombing IS, the Britain-based Observatory said. Originally a Syrian army base, Division 17 was seized by IS in 2014 when it took control of swathes of the wider Raqa province.Abdel Rahman said IS had heavily fortified the base in anticipation of a ferocious SDF assault. An estimated 300,000 civilians were believed to have been living under IS rule in Raqa, including 80,000 displaced from other parts of Syria. Thousands have fled in recent months, and the UN humanitarian office estimates about 160,000 people remain in the city. They have no electricity and were facing severe water shortages, according to the activist collective known as Raqa is Being Slaughtered Silently.Most of the bakeries are closed because of the lack of flour, the group wrote today. The Observatory said that coalition air strikes yesterday killed 24 civilians inside Raqa, up from an earlier toll of 13. Since the SDF first broke into Raqa on June 6, at least 67 IS fighters and 58 civilians had been killed, the Observatory said. There was no immediate toll for SDF fighters. To back the assault, the US-led coalition has provided the SDF with air cover, special forces advisers, weapons and other equipment.The alliance first began bombing IS positions in Iraq in August 2014, and expanded its operations to Syria the following month. In addition to heavy raids on Raqa, the coalition also pounded the IS-held town of Al-Mayadeen in eastern Syria today, the Observatory said.

There was no immediate toll for SDF fighters.To back the assault, the US-led coalition has provided the SDF with air cover, special forces advisers, weapons and other equipment.The alliance first began bombing IS positions in Iraq in August 2014, and expanded its operations to Syria the following month.In addition to heavy raids on Raqa, the coalition also pounded the IS-held town of Al-Mayadeen in eastern Syria today, the Observatory said.""Many of IS's second-tier leaders fled to Al-Mayadeen when the offensive for Raqa started months ago,"" said Abdel Rahman.More than 320,000 people have been killed since Syria's conflict erupted in March 2011 with demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad.It has since been transformed into a complex, multi-front conflict pitting jihadists, rebel groups, government forces and Kurdish fighters against each other."

File/PTI Photo Farmers and NCP activists throw away milk on the road outside Collectors office during a protest over farmers issues in Thane, Mumbai on Saturday. File/PTI PhotoClearing the decks for an end to the ongoing agitation by farmers in the state, the Maharashtra government Sunday announced a blanket loan waiver, the largest ever, to provide immediate relief to 31 lakh farmers. This is a clear departure from its earlier position that loans of only small and marginal farmers will be considered. The government also agreed to raise the price of milk.There are 1.36 crore farmers in the state and their loans add up to Rs 1.14 lakh crore but the government estimates that the loan waiver will not exceed Rs 35,000 crore when parameters are introduced to weed out non-farming categories to ensure that genuine farmers reap maximum benefits.These parameters will ensure that big business houses, professionals or politicians who own large parcels of agriculture land do not avail loan waiver benefits in the name of farmers.Announcing that a consensus had been reached and farmers had called off their strike, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who described the decision as historic, told The Indian Express: The loan waiver is for all farmers and not confined to just small and marginal categories. There will be defined parameters to ensure genuine and needy farmers are not left out of the institutional credit bracket.Indicating that financial implications are yet to be worked out, Fadnavis said the volume of loan waiver will be largest the state has ever offered. He hinted that the farm loan model would be almost on the lines of Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.When it was pointed out to him that the blanket waiver would mean writing off Rs 1.14 lakh crore for 1.36 crore farmers, Fadnavis said: There was an overwhelming response from farmer leaders that loan waiver should be for needy farmers, and not become a medium availed by rich and prosperous individuals or groups at the cost of poor and needy farmers.Earlier, in a series of tweets, the Chief Minister said: Government agrees for loan waiver for farmers. Conditions and detailing will be finalised by a Joint Committee.Govt also accepts the demand of farmers to increase the milk prices. At the same time, the milk societies will have to agree with 70:30 formula of profit sharing on the lines of sugar industry. Farmers and their betterment was, is and will always be this Governments top priority. Group of Ministers will also hold discussions with various political parties for a broader consensus and inclusion, he said.The development of farmers and their welfare has remained integral to all policy decisions with capital investments of Rs 26,000 crore. The loan waiver is another step to reaffirm our commitment to the farmers, he said.The waiver decision came after a meeting of the core committee led by state Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil and farmer representatives from Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli and Pune.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetty said, We are pleased with the decision. Our concern was for genuine farmers. We are not seeking a blanket loan waiver. Why should rich and prosperous politicians or industrialists get loan benefits?Patil said, This is a revolutionary decision. A loan waiver of such magnitude has never been considered in the state.Taking another step to provide relief to farmers supplying milk to cooperative dairy societies and private players, the government decided to increase milk rates from June 20.We want to stop exploitation of farmers who are often underpaid. The formula for fixing the milk rate for farmers will be derived, as is done in the case of sugarcane. The ration of 70:30 profit share between sugar mills and cane farmers will be enforced for the milk sector, Patil said.The farmers have demanded Rs 50 per litre but it is likely that they will get between Rs 28-30 per litre.Shiv Sena Minister Diwakar Raote said,  We are happy with the loan waiver. Any decision that helps farmers is welcome. NCP president Sharad Pawar said, I welcome the loan waiver decision. But now we have to see how soon it is enforced.The Shiv Sena along with NCP and other farmers organisations had backed the strike over the last ten days. Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, We had always urged the government to enforce the loan waiver and now they have accepted our demand.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The major reason being the tax rates are mostly on expected lines.In India, the FMCG sector comprises 50 per cent of the food and beverage industry and another 30 per cent from personal and household care.In line with our expectations, the impact of GST rates on the FMCG sector will be largely positive. The rates decided for the major FMCG products are lower than their current tax rates, said Suresh Nandlal Rohira, partner, Grant Thornton India.According to him, tax rates of hair oil, toothpaste and soaps has been set at 18 per cent which is below the current effective tax rates applicable in most of the states.Further, milk and cereal have been kept exempt, which is bound to provide relief to a large group of consumers, he noted.There is also a silver lining for FMCG companies in the country under GST. Currently, distribution costs account for 2-7 per cent of the turnover for these companies. At present, the FMCG companies set up warehouses covering every state, engaging stock transfers among them, which in turnfacilitate selling of goods to distributors locally. They usually set up warehouses in states where the effective taxation is low. With GST, they can easily put up storage facilities wherever they want.With the revised transition rules whereby the credit on closing inventory without excise invoice is increased to 60 per cent, the network of dealers/distributors across the FMCG distribution network should get the desired relief. The opportunities in optimising supply chain are a big plus for the FMCG sector. The biggest challenge going forward will be the readiness of dealers/distributors to meet GST compliance requirements, Sachin Menon, partner (indirect tax), KPMG India said.Vaibhav Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking, said FMCG companies will see a wider market opening up for them and will be positive for stocks such as ITC, Britannia Industries, Colgate Palmolive and Hindustan Unilever.Many important inputs for the food processing industry like jaggery, cereals and milk have been exempted from GST altogether. On the other hand, products like sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will carry concessional GST at the rate of five per cent. The tax bracket on toiletries like hair oil and soaps has been maintained at 18 per cent, which is a major relief for companies and consumers alike, he said.How the industry adapts to the change is the only concern, but it is common for all sectors, industry players point out.We are still closely evaluating how these rates are going to impact the raw materials for bread and working hard to understand the whole accounting part of the GST to implement it effectively once it goes on stream. Overall, we only see minimal impact on bread pricing for the end consumer/customer, said Aseem Soni, CEO and board member, Modern Food Enterprises."
5a037f9c9855b76bf13b75e2,"Over 15,000 Indian companies made profits in 2015-16 but paid no tax. Here's why",http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/govt-incentives-15-080-indian-companies-made-profits-in-2015-16-but-paid-no-tax/story-woI3UOpNBRzXxCQHgwroBN.html,2017-06-12,"Tax incentives allowed 15,080 profit-making Indian companies to have effective tax rates of zero, and in some cases less than zero, in 2015-16, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of the latest available national tax data or more specifically a government analysis called the Revenue Impact of Tax Incentives under the Central Tax System.The central government introduced minimum alternate tax (MAT) in the late 1980s to tackle this anomaly, but even MAT has exemptions that appear to have negated its original intent partially: 52,911 companies made profits in 2014-15 and paid no tax, IndiaSpend reported in March 2016.Larger corporates paid lower tax rates than smaller ones for 2015-16Effective tax rate is the tax rate actually paid by companies on profits, calculated as tax actually paid divided by profits before tax. While effective tax rates rose between 2012-13 and 2015-16, many exemptions remain, especially for larger companies.For instance, corporates have a statutory tax rate of 34.47%, which they must pay on profits. The effective tax rate in 2015-16 was 28.24%, higher than it was in 2014-15 (24.67%).The effective tax rate for a company making a profit up to Rs 1 crore was 30.26% in 2015-16 while the corporate tax rate was 25.90% for those with profits greater than Rs 500 crore.This means companies making smaller profits are competing in an unequal environment against bigger companies with substantial taxation benefits even though the gap in effective tax rates has been narrowing over the years.Effective tax rates vary across sectors in 2015-16The effective tax rates of the lowest paying industries (cement, sugar, financial leasing companies), which were in single digits in 2014-15, have increased substantially and all are touching nearly 20%.These sectors, however, continue to be taxed at lower rates than other industries.There are interesting contrasts on tax rates of different industries in the same sector:1. Banking companies paid tax at 40.3% while share brokers/sub-brokers paid tax at 25.1% (both financial services).2. Courier agencies paid tax at 41.7% compared to transporters who paid tax at 26.4% (both services).3. Forest contractors paid tax at 37.6% while mining contractors paid tax at 28.2% (both contractors).4. Drugs and pharmaceuticals paid tax at 24.2%, electronics paid tax at 35.5% (both manufacturing).The plan for phasing out of exemptions will kick in from April 1, 2017, finance minister Arun Jaitley said in his 2017-18 budget speech.The government provided the corporate sector Rs 76,857.7 crore in tax breaks or exemptions in 2015-16. The biggest tax exemption is the deduction on expenditure for scientific research (including for seeds and other biotech purposes), which allows for exemption which is twice the expenditure incurred and export profits of units in special economic zones (SEZs).The government also provided customs duty exemption of Rs 69,259 crore and Rs 79,183 crore for excise duty in 2015-16.Over 46% of Indian companies did not make any profit in 2015-16As many as 43% of Indian companies made losses, 3% companies made no profit and 47.7% of companies made profits up to Rs 1 crore in 2015-16.About 6% of Indias companies recorded profits in excess of Rs 1 crore, according to the tax data.Contribution by corporates to political parties shows variance compared to reporting by political parties to Election Commission for 2015-16The deductions granted on account of contribution by corporates to political parties has declined from Rs 112 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 14 crore in 2015-16, according to tax data.This is in contrast to the data submitted by parties to the Election Commission.Donations received by political parties in excess of Rs 20,000 was Rs 576 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 77.3 crore in 2015-16, according to data from Association for Democratic Reforms, an advocacy.One possible explanation for the variance could be under-reporting by corporates.

(Representational Image) (Express Photo by Partha Paul) The state government has also decided to prevent exploitation of dairy farmers by dairy cooperatives. (Representational Image) (Express Photo by Partha Paul)Farmers supplying milk to dairy cooperative societies are set to get higher remuneration from June 20 in a move to prevent their exploitation by dairy cooperatives. The proposal will be mooted at the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. A source in the government said: Apart from the blanket loan waiver, the state government has taken the decision to prevent exploitation of dairy farmers.The proposal states that profit-sharing in the dairy co-operatives should be similar to the sugar co-operatives sector, in the ratio of 70:30. With the Congress-NCP having the maximum hold on dairy cooperatives and unions across Maharashtra, the decision is likely to have far reaching implications. The move comes in the wake of mounting pressure from farmers unions about exploitation and underpayment for milk supply.A source in the dairy development said: After the cabinet ratification of the 70:30 formula, the profit margin of the farmers would increase. In the present context, the supply of milk per litre would be at Rs 30 to 32. A study across the state shows that the average rate that the farmers now get from dairy cooperatives is Rs 18 to 26 per litre. Another reason for the state governments intervention is being seen as the huge losses the sector has been suffering for the last 15 years.During the ongoing farmers strike, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, while expressing concern about dairy farmers, had said: The government believes they deserve higher remuneration. There are 11.6 lakh members in co-operative dairy societies, and 1.43 lakh in cooperative dairy unions, according to officials in the Commissioner for Cooperative and Registrar Cooperative Societies.The average daily collection of milk by the government and co-operative dairies together was 44.45 lakh litres in 2016-17. Whereas, it had recorded 51.13 lakh litres in 2015-16. In the government and co-operative sectors, there are 98 milk processing plants and 156 chilling centres with a capacity of 90.17 lakh litres and 26,55 lakh litres per day respectively. There are 14,921 co-operative dairy societies and 85 co-operative dairy unions across the state.About 37.6 per cent of the co-operative dairy societies and 29.4 per cent of dairy unions are running into losses. A NABARD report states that the estimated credit potential projection for 2017-18 for livestock (animal husbandry) is Rs 5447.17 crore, of which Rs 3,656.49 crore has been set aside for dairy development and Rs 1,103.69 crore for sheep, goat and pig farms.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

While the leaves can be used to make baskets, pillows, pouches and garlands, the tree also is the source for pathaneer (Palmyra sap), palm sugar, and palm rock candy. Palm flower mixed with punnaku is food for cows. But the value of it is unknown to many, except for toddy that you get from it, rues Chithra Nambi of Swadeshi, Ambattur, an organisationthat promotes and creates awareness on organic products.The entrepreneur, who has been travelling around the State to train womens groups in palm pillow and basket making, recently exhibited her products at the National Seed Festival 2017. From increasing the milk production of cows to reducing the human body heat, palm trees have several values, she says.A palm tree can give you a profit of `20,000 a year, while the Government has portrayed that the outcome is only 5% of it, says Chithra.From palm crafts, brushes, sugar to what not! We get everything from palm trees. We are trying to create awareness on a tree that gives us so much, she shares. Besides, protecting the tree will also provide job opportunities to several women.She picks a pillow made of palm leaves, stuffed with cotton. When people drive or work sitting on leather or other type of cushions for a long time, their body gets heated. Experts are now saying that body heat is the cause of most diseases, including diabetes. But when you use a cushion made of palm leaves, your body doesnt heat up, she explains. The State government can implement this for bus drivers. And this leads to jobs for so many women.Enthusiastically showing us the products, she points to a bunch of coloured clutches/purses and claims that these are in vogue. Not only that the palm leaves garland you see here are most preferred these days. she says. The size and colour of the garlands are customised according to the occasion and Chithra shares that they even receive orders for political events for which they use the party colours.Chithra rues that the palm-based cottage industry has been dying only because the workers have not been receiving proper remuneration. We provide wages to our female workers on an hourly basis. So, they earn a minimum of `400 a day. But they can earn more if the Government steps in to improve this cottage industry, she adds.For details, call 9445666700"

Chandigarh had largest number of participants in the study as compared to other states.A study released last week had found that overall prevalence of diabetes is 14% in Chandigarh, highest in 15 states, which were included. The citys 27% poor were also found having diabetes. The results were of an ongoing study, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes study, and published last week in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.Chandigarh has highest per capita income, which means people are more likely to stay indoors and less involved in physical activity, said Dr Mandeep Singla, endocrinologist, GMCH-32. Physical inactivity, excessive intake of junk food that is rich in carbohydrates are the other two reasons. Until people dont improve their lifestyle, they will continue to get metabolic diseases. he added.Dr Sanjay Bhadada, endocrinologist, PGIMER, said another reason could be in city a large number of people are from Punjab and they have highest waist circumference, blood pressure and BMI (body mass index).Dr Bhadada said the exact cause is not clear but there is theory called Barkers hypothesis, which can explain the scenario. According to the theory, baby does not get good nourishment in utero and during infancy are more prone to develop metabolic disorders like diabetes in life. Reason being that their organs like pancreas do not grow properly, Dr Bhadada explained.FOOD ABUNDANCE FOR POOR COULD BE ANOTHER REASONThe study has found that in the urban areas of UT, the prevalence of diabetes among individuals in the low Socio Economic Status (SES) is 27%, which is more than double the incidence among individuals in high SES, which is 13%.Now, large numbers of migratory people live in the city. They do not get good nourishment in their states but when they shift to Chandigarh, they get food in abundance. Their body does not adjust to the change in the environment of abundance food, leading to diabetes. This could be one of the reason, but this is just one hypothetical theory, Dr Bhadada added.The experts said the shift in diabetes towards urban poor is a cause of concern, as the treatment is lifelong and costly. The cost varies from Rs 50 to Rs 200 per day. Also, it can lead to lots of complications, including heart attack and kidney failure.According to a government report of 2016, Chandigarh had per capita income of Rs 2.42 lakh during 2015-16. The study found that the prevalence of diabetes seems to be higher in states with greater per capita income.FINDINGS OF THE STUDYThis study is largest ever to investigate diabetes in India. The prevalence of diabetes in all 15 states of India was 7%. The prevalence of diabetes varied from 4% in Bihar to 14% in UT.The diabetes epidemic in India is in a transition mode and it is a cause of worry for health experts.Reason: The disease of the rich is now spreading to urban poor living in affluent states, who can hardly afford the medication. The study showed that prevalence of diabetes was higher among poor people (low SES) living in urban areas of affluent states like Chandigarh, Punjab, Maharashtra and others.Nearly half of the people (47%) tested with diabetes during the study were never tested earlier for the disease.DIABETES: ITS SYMPTOMS, EFFECTS, PREVENTIVE STEPSDiabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys , and nerves. The most common is type-2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesnt make enough insulinSYMPTOMSExcessive excretion of urine (polyuria), thirst (polydipsia), constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly.CONSEQUENCESOver time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves Adults with diabetes have a 2-3-fold increased risk of heart attacks and strokes Combined with reduced blood flow, neuropathy (nerve damage) in feet increases chance of foot ulcers, infection and eventual need for limb amputation Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness, and occurs as a result of long-term accumulated damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. 2.6% of global blindness can be attributed to diabetes Diabetes is among the leading causes of kidney failurePREVENTIONSimple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes. People should: Achieve and maintain healthy body weight Be physically active  at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most days. More activity is required for weight control Eat a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats intake; and Avoid tobacco use  smoking increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases Diagnosis and treatment Early diagnosis can be accomplished through relatively inexpensive testing of blood sugar. Treatment of diabetes involves diet and physical activity along with lowering blood glucose and the levels of other known risk factors that damage blood vessels. Tobacco use cessation is also important to avoid complications (Source: WHO)"

He said creating the same scale of infrastructure through big dam projects would have cost the state Rs 30,000 crore.During an interaction with farmers in the fifth episode of Mi Mukhyamantri Boltoy, Fadnavis said: Today, 11,494 villages have become drought free. The water tables have risen. The water storage potential increased to 96,000 TMC bringing transformation in the lives of individual farmers in remote villages.He said the Rs 5,500-crore investment through Jalyukta Shivar had proved a good model to combat drought and make villages water neutral. As against the target of 1 lakh farm ponds this year, we have already completed 37,000 projects. Of the 68,000 wells, 40,000 have been constructed, said the CM. He said every eligible farmer could avail the Rs 50,000 subsidy for farm ponds through online application, urging farmers to utilise the scheme.Mahindra Agav, a farmer from Beed district, wanted to know by when all pending projects in the district would be completed. Fadnavis said, Almost 9,000 projects have been taken up in 527 villages with allocation of Rs 237 crore in Beed. Of these, projects in 306 villages have completed. The ongoing pending works have been expedited and would be completed by June end.The CM said a district-wise review was taken up every two months with course corrections to resolve the problems.Narrating his personal experience, farmer Dabaru Gavande from Jalna district said, The well in my field which would run dry is now filled with water. The crop production has increased from 18 to 25 sacks.Gavande wanted to know what measures should they take to ensure no repeat of drought. To this, Fadnavis said, Every village gram panchayats and individual farmer should exercise caution to ensure there is no misuse of water. The general trend is whenever there is plenty of water, farmers cultivate high water-intensive sugarcane. The farmers should think beyond sugarcane and look for other crops that can also bring higher income. The thrust on crop patterns is a must.Responding to a question from Vijay Gundhar of Chandrapur on rainwater harvesting, the chief minister said: The government has made it mandatory to make rainwater harvesting in every new development plan. The awareness is catching up with people and it is a very important aspect to save rainwater.Expressing concern over the long pending Gosikhurd National Irrigation Project, the chief minister said, In the last two years, we have taken concrete measures to tackle all the roadblocks. Revised approvals for the civil works have been cleared. The project should be completed by December 2019.Popatrao Pawar, sarpanch of Hiwre Bazar village, urged the CM to have the Jalyukta Shivar projects focus on water recharge and soil erosion. Fadnavis said the emphasis on water recharge projects had been accorded higher priority.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Highest amounts of adulteration was detected in milk samples from restaurants and traditional vendors.Synthetic milkA whopping 76 per cent of the milk samples from restaurants and 48 per cent from traditional milk vendors were found to be adulterated by urea, used for making synthetic milk. Detergents and soaps are also used for making synthetic milk. Detergents were detected in 40 per cent of samples from restaurants and 28 per cent from traditional vendors. In 36 per cent milk samples from restaurants and 20 per cent from traditional vendors were detected with soaps.ChemicalsAmmonium sulphate was also highest in milk samples from restaurants (24 per cent) and traditional vendors(20 per cent). It is added to increase the lactometer reading of milk. Glucose and sugar are also added for the same purpose were found in 10 per cent of unbranded milk sachet samples and 12 per cent samples from restaurants.SNF (Solids-not-fats) in milk are important source of nutrition. However, milk adulterers add starch and vegetable oils in milk to increase SNF content. Starch was detected in 90 per cent of samples from traditional vendors and 4 per cent samples from dairy farms. Vegetable fats were found in 32 per cent samples from restaurants and 24 per cent from vendors.Milk adulterers add harmful chemicals like boric acid, salicylic acid, hydrogen peroxide and formalin to increase shelf life of milk which were detected in range of 0-22 percent of milk samples. About 80 per cent of milk samples from traditional vendors and 2 percent from cooperatives were found to contain neutralizers.ColiformsColiforms ranging between 100-1000 colony forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml) were detected in 44 per cent samples from restaurants and 8 per cent branded milk samples.SOT raids dairy farmSpecial Operations Team sleuths of Rachakonda commissionerate on Tuesday raided a dairy farm where adulterated milk was being sold at LB Nagar and apprehended the dairy farm owner and seized adulterated milk of 51 litres, 18 litres of acid, 16 litres of alcohol, milk powder and processing and packing machinery from the dairy farm. The accused identified as M Yadagiri (57) was running the dairy farm at Hasthinapuram in LB Nagar for the last three months.

In all, 57 farmers committed suicide in the last three years in Maddur taluk. Of these, 36 cases were reported from Mandya taluk and 20 from Malavalli taluk.Farmers grow sugarcane, coconut and take up sericulture in Maddur taluk. Sericulture is much preferred due to the regions proximity to the silk market in Ramanagaram. Maddur is the home taluk of S M Krishna who executed lift irrigation projects here during his tenure as chief minister. The taluk is irrigated by Cauvery and Shimsha rivers. Despite all these facilities, more number of farmers in the taluk have committed suicide.A dry lifelineRaitha Sangha vice president Konasale Narasaraju said that agriculture is not possible if there is no water in the Krishanaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir. More farmers in Koppa and Athaguru hoblis have ended their lives as they are at the tail end of Visvesvaraya Canal. The farmers are not benefitting from Shimsha River after the lift irrigation projects became defunct as the pipes broke due to substandard works.Around 36 farmers have ended their lives in Mandya taluk situated in the Cauvery basin. Moreover, closing of MySugar factory is also one of the reasons for farmers committing suicides. As the taluk administration has failed to give proper information on crop insurance and benefits of loan facilities, the farmers who had borrowed from private money lenders ended their lives, Raitha Sangha leader Haniyambadi Nagaraju said.Around 100 farmer deaths have been reported from Mandya, Maddur and Malavalli taluks and 44 farmers from Srirangapatna, Pandavapura, K R Pet and Nagamangala taluks.MP C S Puttaraju told DH that the situation of farmers is like fish out of water. KRS is the lifeline of Mandya district. As the dam did not get sufficient water for three years now, the farmers were trapped in debts and have taken the extreme step, he said. Moreover, the government has released 60% of water to Tamil Nadu while farmers here are ending their lives, he said.CompensationThe government provides Rs 5 lakh compensation to the family of a deceased farmer. So far the government has released Rs 4.50 crore as compensation for 92 families for the year 2015-16 and Rs 2.30 crore for 46 families for 2016-17. The compensation for 2017-18 is yet to be released."

This was lower than the recovery in three successive drought years between 2013 and 2015, the average of which was 54 per cent. According to senior government officials, Rs 51,235 crore was disbursed among 52 lakh farmers. Three successive droughts had led to a steep rise in loss of crops and revenue in 15,000 villages in 2013; 23,000 villages in 2014; and 28,000 villages in 2015. Maharashtra has 40,913 villages. Yet, in these drought years, crop loan recovery was 52 per cent, 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively, according to official data.The state governments core committee and farmers representatives are now working out stringent guidelines to define farmers eligible for loan waiver. Government sources said rich farmers, and those with alternative income, would not qualify for the promised waiver. The Rs 1 lakh ceiling that is likely to be imposed is expected to cover the small, marginal and needy farmers, whose number is pegged at 30 lakh.Former agriculture minister and Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, Anticipation of a loan waiver is the main reason for the low recovery. Another reason could be shortfall in sugarcane cultivation, he said. Holding the government responsible, Vikhe-Patil said, Last year, monsoon led to higher foodgrain production. But the government failed to provide the MSP to farmers. This too may have led to their refusal to repay the crop loans.A BJP cabinet minister, however, said, While anticipation of a loan waiver can be a reason, the cooperative network which is under the oppositions control may also have fuelled the campaign against payment of dues. Of the Rs 51,235 crore disbursed, the share of state-owned banks was Rs 26,470 crore, private banks Rs 4,126 crore, rural banks Rs 3,044 crore, district central cooperative banks Rs 17,548 crore and others Rs 44 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0387a89855b76bf13b7aed,Delicious Sounding Descriptions Can Make You Favour Vegetables,http://www.ndtv.com/food/trick-or-treat-delicious-sounding-descriptions-can-make-you-favour-vegetables-1711764,2017-06-13,"Crispy broccoli with sweet, caramelized onions or would you prefer grilled, sizzling beans? You're tempted, aren't you? According to new research conducted by Stanford scholars and published in the Journal JAMA Internal Medicine, you are more likely to choose and favour vegetables if they are labelled with exciting and indulgent descriptions. For instance, adding words like 'caramelized' , 'dynamite' or 'sizzling' may make them sound more delicious and tempt you to eat them.To test the impact of labelling on the consumption of healthier food, researchers collaborated with the Stanford Residential & Dining Enterprises and conducted their study in a large dining hall on campus. They changed the labels for certain vegetables and made them sound more enticing using four types of descriptions: basic, healthy restrictive, healthy positive or indulgent. For example, beetroots were labelled as 'lighter choice beets with no added sugar' (healthy restrictive), green beans were simply called 'green beans' (basic), carrots were described as 'smart-choice vitamin C citrus carrots' (healthy positive) and they were not just sweet potatoes but 'zesty ginger-turmeric sweet potatoes' (indulgent).They made sure there was enough variety with a choice of vegetables like beetroot, butternut squash, carrot, corn, courgette, green beans and sweet potato that were rotated weekly. Researchers monitored the number of diners who chose the particular vegetable and how much of it was consumed for lunch over a period of 46 days (an academic quarter). No changes were made to the way the food was cooked and presented. They were only labelled differently but the diners were not aware of the fact that different sounding choices were the exact same item.It was found that vegetables with indulgent labels were preferred 25 percent more than basic labelling, 35 percent more than healthy positive and 41 percent more than healthy restrictive labels. In terms of per day consumption, vegetables with indulgent labelling were consumed 16 percent more than those labelled healthy positive, 23 percent more than basic and 33 more than healthy restrictive labels. It is believed that people consider healthy food to be less tasty and therefore, using delicious sounding descriptions and names can change their perspective and impact their sensory experience.The results of the study provide insights on how to encourage people to eat well by making healthy food more appealing. This simple strategy of changing the descriptions and making healthy food sound more indulgent and drool-worthy could have a significant impact on the food choices we make."

The basic objective of the land allocation was to eradicate poverty and improve the quality of life of the poor, the CM stated in his communication.Kejriwal said those who were allotted the land are still using it for agricultural purposes as per the allotment conditions, and hence should be granted ownership rights to the land. The CM said that since land is a reserved subject, the L-G has the authority to take a decision on ownership. Former L-G Jung had sent the file to the President of India to take a decision on the subject. However, it is still pending.

And his business partner, Shradha Agarwal, is close behind.Their windfall came with a USD 600 million infusion of venture capital into Outcome Health, the Chicago health care tech company they founded in 2006. It's now valued at USD 5.6 billion.Shah grew up in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, the son of a doctor who emigrated from India; his mother managed his father's medical practice. The initial idea for a company providing content to doctor's offices was inspired, Shah says in an interview to local media, by his sister.""My sister has type 1 diabetes,"" Shah says. ""If she gets on an insulin pump and she is able to achieve better blood sugar control and she is checking her blood sugar more effectively, the device manufacturer wins, the insulin manufacturer wins, the blood glucometer wins, the doctor wins, but the payor wins most of all. And she wins personally.""He attended Northwestern University as a transfer student, where he met a woman named Shradha Agarwal, now Outcome's president. Originally working on a campus magazine, they eventually founded a company called ContextMedia, out of Northwestern in 2008, funding it by taking loans that have over the years reached a combined USD 325 million instead of giving up equity. Knocking on doctor's office doors around the Chicago area, the two found little appetite for their idea.Some doctors didn't see the value in digital education in their offices; others who did wanted to see revenue to feel comfortable committing to such a fledgling product. Without signing them, however, the entrepreneurs had no revenue with which to placate them. They eked out $1 million in revenue that first year. ""Then we were off to the races,"" says Shah, doubling most years since. ""We had to build a profitable business, or at least a break-even business, from scratch,"" says Shah. ""We had no margin of error.""Outcome Health is not only the newest unicorn company, having earned the honor just last week, but it is also already valued in the top 30 on the list of roughly 200 non-public companies worth $1 billion.CEO Rishi Shah, 31 and president Shradha Agarwal founded ContextMedia in 2006 while the two were at Northwestern University. The company began to sell its video monitor services to physicians and hospitals without any outside investment.Over the next decade, the company grew and big-time investors noticed, but Shah and Agarwal passed up offers in order to scale organically and retain ownership. In January, the company changed its name to Outcome Health as it slowly pushed towards its first major round of funding.According to Crain's, the company took in more than $130 million in revenue last year and posted an operating profit margin of roughly 40%. Outcome Health doubled its revenue in each of the last two years, and it also grew with its acquisition of AccentHealth last November.Today, Outcome Health helps both patients and doctors by providing touch screen monitors to hospitals and health care offices around the country. The company installs large, interactive video boards that allow physicians to better explain a patient's current health care needs or problems through the use of video, graphics and interactive visual aids.Outcome Health also utilises specialised software to assist physicians and patients for everything from treatment decisions to medical warning signs.Outcome tries to maximise how both doctors and patients spend their time, which helps unclog those stereotypically crowded waiting rooms. According to one of the company's online testimonials, Neil Baum, a New Orleans-based urologist, cut the time it takes him to explain a common urological procedure from 12 minutes to less than five minutes through the use of Outcome Health's Digital Anatomy Board.Outcome Health often provides its services to medical providers for free. The company makes most of its money from insurance providers, drug makers, health care marketers and pharmaceutical companies."

In these circumstances, the decision to end sugar subsidy is not right, he wrote.The sugar subsidy was discontinued with effect from March 2017. The Union food ministry as well as some states had been keen on its continuance for at least families covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY).Subsequently, the government recently decided to restore the subsidy for states to ensure sale of 1 kg of sugar at a cheaper rate for 2.5 crore AAY families, the poorest of the poor, under the public distribution system (PDS).A decision in this regard was taken at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by the prime minister.In the 2017 Budget, the government withdrew the sugar subsidy and earmarked only Rs 200 crore to clear past claims.For the last fiscal, Rs 4,500 crore were allocated for the scheme that covered BPL families too.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Report after report of the National Family Health Survey has pointed out that more than 50 per cent of expecting mothers in the country suffer from anaemia and around 50 per cent of such women suffer from malnutrition.The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani and Homeopathy (Ayush) has some suggestions for pregnant women. Besides asking them to detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment and lust, and hang beautiful pictures on the wall, the ministry recommends that mothers-to-be shun non-vegetarian food.These pious tips are part of Ayushs booklet Mother and Child Care. Ayush minister, Shripad Yesso Naik, who released the booklet, claims that the booklet puts together relevant facts culled out from clinical practice in the fields of yoga and naturopathy and contains wisdom accumulated over many centuries of yogic practice. But Mother and Child Cares sermons on abjuring non-vegetarian food betray a lack of seriousness about the nutritional requirements of mothers-to-be.Report after report of the National Family Health Survey has pointed out that more than 50 per cent of expecting mothers in the country suffer from anaemia and around 50 per cent of such women suffer from malnutrition. Nutrition deprivation among pregnant women, it is now well-known, perpetuates an inter-generational cycle of such deprivation in children. There is also a vast body of literature on the dietary needs of pregnant women. The guidelines of the National Institute of Health and Nutrition, for example, recommend a diet rich in folic acid, calcium, iodine and protein. While nutritionists might differ on whether plant foods deliver these nutrients as effectively as meat, fish and eggs, the pertinence of non-vegetarian foods for mothers-to-be has never been in question. Mother and Child Care does not even make a pretense of joining this debate.It slots non-vegetarian food in a list of avoidable eatables and beverages that include refined flour, fried items, coffee, sugar and garam masala, but says nothing about how these diet tips could help deal with nutritional deficiencies in pregnant women. The Ayush booklets omission stems from the government body taking a highly moralistic approach to what is essentially a health issue.Ayush got a facelift under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Earlier, a department under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the independent ministry is now a lynchpin in the governments plan to revive the countrys indigenous medicine systems. It was hoped that under Ayush, such systems of medicine would contribute to addressing some of the pressing medical issues in the country, including maternal malnutrition. But going by Ayushs tips to pregnant women, it seems that the ministry is nowhere close to fulfilling that vision.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Why should we have to wait here in this long queue to get aid?We used to have a dream life and weve fallen all the way down to the bottom, said the 38-year-old mother of two, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals against family members left behind in districts still under jihadist control.IS seized the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 and imposed a brutal form of Islamist rule and a regime of terror on its inhabitants.Life has been made even harder since the battle launched last October by Iraqi security forces to drive out IS. East Mosul and a large part of the west is now back in government hands.In their no-holds-barred defence, the jihadists have used civilians -- caught in the crossfire and already the victims of food, water and electricity shortages -- as human shields.I break the (dawn-to-dusk Ramadan) fast with whatever I can find. Sometimes we even find sand and worms in the water we have to drink, said Umm Mohammed.She was among the women, children and the elderly standing in line amidst the rubble of pulverised buildings and the carcasses of burnt-out cars, many of them protecting their heads from the blistering sun with towels or rags.- What sort of life is this? -Another mother, Umm Yussef, stood nearby in tears, having failed to add her name to the list compiled daily of those entitled to the aid packages of rice, lentils, milk, sugar, tomato juice and cheese.I have 10 children. We break the fast just with water from the well and tomato juice. What sort of life is this? she asked, her voice tinged with both sorrow and anger.Umm Yussef said she would celebrate the Eid feast that follows the Muslim holy month -- at the end of next week -- only once her daughter Leila and their family are freed from Daesh (IS) control.All they have to eat is grass and sand, she said as a passerby handed a biscuit to one of her children.Young volunteers last week handed out 2,000 modest aid packages to inhabitants of areas of west Mosul recaptured by Iraqi forces.We try to meet a modest part of the needs of needy families, said 21-year-old Mohammed Dilan, one of those distributing the aid raised from donations by businessmen and other individuals.For those displaced from Mosul and forced to take refuge in overcrowded camps outside the city, life can be even more treacherous.A mass food poisoning this week at one such camp, Hasansham, left hundreds requiring urgent treatment, officials said Tuesday.Health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said around 100 of those affected required serious treatment after the iftar meal which breaks the fast.More than 800,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since the battle for Mosul erupted."

Most of the patients are seen to have a family history of the Alzheimer's. A new study, conducted by researchers from the University of Southern California in the United States, shows that consuming a western diet that high in cholesterol, fat and sugar may influence the development of Alzheimer's disease in people who carry a gene linked to this neurodegenerative disease.Alzheimer's is a chronic disease that affects your mental functions and ultimately leads to memory loss. The disease affects your brain connections that start to degrade due to the damage caused to the brain cells. This causes difficulties with thinking, problem-solving and language.According to the study, ApoE4 and ApoE3 are two variants of a gene that code for a protein called apolipoprotein E which is known to bind fats and cholesterol. While ApoE4 has been linked to increased risk of inflammation and cardiovascular diseases along with Alzheimer's, ApoE3 may not be a risk factor. However, researchers indicate that not all carriers of the APOE4 gene may develop Alzheimer's.For the study, the team placed a group of mice with ApoE4 on a control diet that contained 10 per cent fat and seven per cent sucrose, while another group of mice with ApoE4 ate a typical Western diet with 45 per cent fat and 17 per cent sucrose for a period of 12 weeks. A similar test was run on mice with the ApoE3 gene.The results showed that when the APOE4-carrying mice were fed a Western diet they showed increased deposits of beta-amyloid protein plaques in their brains that act as a marker for inflammation and can obstruct cognition and memory increasing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. They also exhibited a greater number of glial cells which are the brain cells responsible for immunity response.The study concludes that certain lifestyle changes can help in reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. For instance, the Alzheimer's Research & Prevention Foundation suggests that exercising regularly reduces your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by almost 50%. Your daily diet can also play an important role in determining your risk. A diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids from nuts and seeds, wonder spices like turmeric, green leafy vegetables and antioxidant-rich berries can help in keeping your brain healthy and also improving its performance.Inputs from IANS"

Captain Radhawa is a businessman and an associate of Rana Gurjit.Amit is the key figure in the case surrounding the allocation of the Saidpur Khurd sand mine in Nawanshahr.

His brother Sandeep repeatedly clarified that Amit was not a cook, he was liaisoning officer with Rana Sugar.He used to work as a liaisoning officer at Rana Sugar but he has no association with that company any more. Whatever work he is doing right now is with Captain Randhawa. Amitji will be able to tell you whether it is a business or partnership or whether he is an employee.

In western Maharashtra, the total number is 6,090. (Representational Image) In the region of Marathwada, the total number of banks is 1,889 and in Vidarbha it is 2,626. In western Maharashtra, the total number is 6,090. (Representational Image)The crop pattern in western and north Maharashtra gives an advantage to the farmers to avail of higher loan component compared to their counterparts in the backward districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra, officials in the agriculture ministry said.A source in the government said: The agriculture loan for cultivating pomegranate per hectare sanctioned is Rs 90,000, grapes is Rs 80,000, sugar cane is Rs 80,000 and for banana it is Rs 80,000.These are the main crops grown in the 10 districts of western and north Maharashtra.Whereas loan allocated per hectare for soya bean is Rs 40,000, tur (pulses) is Rs 30,000, cotton is Rs 40,000 and jowari is Rs 25,000. These crops are grown in the 19 drought-prone districts of Vidarbha (with 11 district) and Marathwada (8 districts) in the state. These two regions include 14 distressed districts that have recorded higher farmer suicides in the state in the past 15 years. The crop pattern of the farmers in Vidarbha and Marathwada fetches lower loans, a government official said.While average loan allocation to farmers in western and north Maharashtra comes to a minimum of Rs 2.80 lakh, for their counterparts in Vidarbha and Marathwada it is Rs 25,000.To enable the backward districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada to avail of a higher loan component at par with the economically prosperous districts of western and north Maharashtra, the state government is likely to urge the Centre to consider other parameters, including agriculture land price and labour cost, in the investment category.A source said: The state government is going to take up the issue with the Union Agriculture Minister, Radhabmohan Singh. A proposal is being worked out to facilitate higher allocation of crop loans for the backward districts of state.Several experts in the agriculture sector have pointed out that crop loan allocations cannot be determined on investment cost and crop pattern alone. The cost of investments should also include labour and land prices.A preliminary study of an agriculture experts committee has said: The six-decade-old parameters to allocate crop loans will have to be revised and re-evaluated to provide higher incentives to small and marginal farmers in the backward districts of the cotton belt of Vidarbha and Marathwada. The investments in cotton per hectares may be lower compared to sugarcane or pomegranate. But the labour cost is much higher, which is not considered.Another argument is that when an individual seeks loan for buying a home, evaluation is on the price of the property and income. Similarly, agriculture land holding and its price can be considered while sanctioning crop loan. According to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), in 2017-18, the total crop loan credit for Maharashtra will be Rs 58,862 crore. Of which, Vidarbha will get Rs 14,327 crore and Marathwada Rs 13,735 crore. It is lower than the total allocations for western Maharashtra at Rs 20,762 crore.Of the total 1.36 crore farmers in the state, 65 per cent are in Vidarbha and Marathwada. In terms of small and marginal farmers, the percentage is much higher in these backward districts compared to the economically prosperous western and north Maharashra.Another area of concern that is being reworked is related to the expansion and strengthening of the financial network in the region of Vidarbha and Marathwada to bring it at par with western Maharashtra. The state government and NABARD are working to address the problems of providing better banking infrastructure.A NABARD report states: The credit flow is always higher in economically developed regions. The higher loan allocations is linked to a higher banking network.In the region of Marathwada, the total number of banks is 1,889 and in Vidarbha it is 2,626. In western Maharashtra, the total number is 6,090.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He said the bank last released part of the loan amount on April 17.The AAP leader said Rana and his family members have violated Section 42-A of the East Punjab Land Holdings Act, 1948, according to which neither the village common land can be partitioned nor its tile can be changed. He said it was difficult to understand as how the minister managed to get a loan of over Rs 100 crore against 458-kanal land in a village. He said the present value of the land, registered on May 18, is Rs 58 lakh only.MALIGNING MY IMAGE OR IS DESPERATE FOR POLITICAL SURVIVALRana and his son Rana Inderpal, who is managing director of the family-owned Rana Sugars, also addressed mediapersons at their residence.Khaira has either been speaking out of sheer ignorance to malign my image or is desperate for political survival. He has been sidelined in AAP as he was not made the legislative party leader or the party state president, the minister said.If Khaira proves the charges, I will resign, he said.Responding to the allegations of fraudulent land purchase, Rana said, The court of SAS Nagar additional deputy commissioner (ADC development) using powers of collector had ordered on July 1, 2016 that the land does not come under the definition of 2(G) and hence its ownership does not vest with the gram panchayat.The court had accepted the petition of 180 Seonk residents. The ADC declared all of them as owners of the part of land under their possession, he said. The minister also produced a copy of the order.I have not purchased the land. My brother Rana Ranjit Singh and his wife did. It was only that Kulwinder (a former employee whose name cropped up in sand mining auctions) had my power of attorney and he used it. Where is the fraud? he claimed.Inderpal said, The Rs 109 crore loan was taken three years ago by our company Superior Foodgrains in which my uncle and aunt (ministers brother and his wife) are partners. Rs 55 crore was term loan and Rs 40 crore was working capital. The loan was taken against the company itself. The land was pledged as additional security for the banks comfort .On Khairas allegation of his being a defaulter, Rana said, Yes we owe Rs 52 crore to farmers. Even the UP government owes me Rs 72 crore payment."

The Opposition decided to press for a comprehensive loan waiver for farmers and implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions five-part report.The Opposition parties have decided to organise a Bharat Bandh on the issue of farmer distress. The decision came in the meeting of the Opposition sub-group on Wednesday to discuss a strategy for the Presidential election. Sources said that the farmers unrest on a range of issues  falling prices, Minimum Support Price and debt  was discussed at the meeting where many Opposition leaders felt this was the appropriate time to seek answers from the government.The Opposition decided to press for a comprehensive loan waiver for farmers and implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions five-part report. That 2006 report had suggested detailed, sweeping reforms to address agrarian distress: from ensuring better credit and insurance to marketing to better access to technology; steps to promote land reforms and productivity to food security and employment.The date for the Bharat Bandh, a source said, would be decided after parties discuss with their respective leaderships. On Wednesday, Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, an NDA ally from Maharashtra, met senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav at his residence here where the two discussed agrarian distress. Shettis party has set a deadline for the farm loan waiver in Maharashtra where protests have put the BJP government in a tight spot. A day before Rahul Gandhi visited Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh on June 7, Sharad Yadav and Gandhi had a long discussion at the JD(U) leaders residence, too.Yadav, incidentally, accompanied the Congress vice president to Mandsaur to protest against what he called was the MP governments apathy towards protesting farmers. Later, a delegation of the All India Kisan Sabha, led by CPI(M) leader Hannan Mollah, also visited Mandsaur this week.After Mandsaur, some Opposition leaders have planned a joint visit to Mandola in Uttar Pradesh to express solidarity with farmers who have been protesting there demanding revised compensation for land acquired under Avas Vikas Housing Scheme.An Opposition leader said that agrarian crisis cuts across caste and community lines and could, therefore, be a potent political issue to corner the government with. More so, he said, because both MP and Maharashtra, where the protests reached a flashpoint, are BJP-ruled states.Sporadic farmer agitations were going on at a number of places. Our effort is to unite all such forces, said a leader associated with the plans. A section is sceptical as well given the Oppositions diffused agenda and failure to build a narrative around the protests so far. They cite the fact that in the run-up to UP polls, a rally was organized in Delhi on sugarcane prices and other farmers issues bringing parties like JD(S), NCP, Congress, JD(U), RLD and SP on the same stage. A rally was also organized in Muzaffarnagar to bridge the Hindu-Muslim divide under the overarching umbrella of farmer identity. However, this campaign failed to make any impact during the elections which the BJP won hands down.However, on the land acquisition issue, after Opposition parties had joined hands in 2015 to call the government anti-farmer in and outside Parliament, the government was forced to retract its plan to bring key changes to the UPAs 2013 land law.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
