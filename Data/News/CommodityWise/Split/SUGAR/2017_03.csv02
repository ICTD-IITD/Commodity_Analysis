PTI Nitish Kumar and his ministers have food with farmers during a Kisan Sammelan at Gyan Bhawan in Patna, Friday. PTIBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday held a meeting with farmers representatives from across the state before announcing an agriculture roadmap for 2017-22. Speaking after the meeting, Nitish reiterated his reservations against Genetically Modified mustard. GM seeds would be dangerous for farmers. I have already taken up the matter with the Centre, he said.The state government received 534 suggestions on agriculture, 75 on animal husbandry, 25 each on fishery, cooperative and forest and environment, and 15 on sugarcane. Sunil Kumar, a farmer from Kaimur, listed the problems of the agriculture department before Nitish. Let me speak the truth. I am not an opponent of the CM but must tell him about the ground realities, he said.Several other farmers complained that subsidy and grants had not been reaching them due to a lack of proper survey to identify real beneficiaries. Following the meeting, the CM and his cabinet colleagues sat on the ground to eat with the farmers. The farmers were served puri, pulao, pulses and three vegetable dishes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Workers in hard hats monitor as giant yellow cranes lift hundreds of containers off cargo ships onto lorries waiting ashore.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed diplomatic, trade and transport ties with import-dependent Qatar 10 days ago, accusing it of supporting Iran and funding Islamist groups, charges Doha denies.The spat initially halted much traffic to its Hamad Port and raised fears of food and other shortages.But after launching new direct shipping routes to cope with the crisis, port officials say the worst is over and the episode may even help gas-rich Qatar seal new transport deals that do not rely on Gulf neighbours.Its a blessing in disguise, a port official said as cargo was unloaded on Wednesday. We are looking at signing agreements with shipping companies that can improve direct services instead of having to come through Jebel Ali in Dubai.The first ship on a new direct weekly service from Indias Mundra Port was expected to arrive on Friday. Another route to Indias Nhava Sheva Port was announced late on Wednesday, after two new services opened this week from Oman, which has remained neutral during the crisis.Earlier this week the worlds biggest container line, Maersk of Denmark, said it would accept new bookings for container shipments to Qatar from Oman.Several Maersk containers could be seen parked among rows of shipments at Hamad Port. Operations manager Omar El-Khayat said another deal with Maersk was being discussed.Some services hitMediation efforts to end the crisis have intensified, including by the United States, which has strong military ties with Qatar, host of the largest US air base in the Middle East. Two US Navy ships went through Hamad Port on Wednesday for a joint exercise with Qatar.Port officials said the cutting of transport links by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain with Qatar continues to affect some services.Ships from Chinas Shanghai, which normally go through Jebel Ali, have to be re-routed via Iraq, adding seven days to a normally 20-day voyage, one official said.Not all lines have resumed shipping services.Chinas COSCO Shipping Lines Co Ltd, Taiwans Evergreen and Hong Kong Kongs OOCL suspended container services to and from Qatar.The closure of land borders is also likely to put pressure on Qatar to ensure continuity of supplies. Trade sources say sugar imports remain frozen given the countrys main suppliers are Saudi Arabia and the UAE.Hamad Ports general cargo terminal can handle 1.7 million tonnes of goods per year, according to Qatars transport ministry, but it is not a bulk cargo port.Officials would not say at what capacity Hamad Port was operating compared to before the crisis, or whether it could handle increased demand.The Qatar Ports Management Company, Mwani, gave no import figures for June.But it hoped new services would help make up the shortfall.Livestock and gabbro rockMwanis Hamad al-Ansar said ties with Turkey and Iran, which have flown goods into Doha since the boycott, might expand, with Turkish vessels already on their way.Well open a relationship with anyone who can bring cargo.For now, port employees have their work cut out. As one large ship took back empty containers later in the day, a second one arrived bringing livestock from Australia.The first five days of the crisis there were fewer shipments. Now its back to normal. Ive seen the schedule and it looks packed, said a Kenyan supervisor.Hamad Ports imports include large quantities of food and building materials for construction projects including stadiums for the 2022 soccer World Cup, and a metro line running alongside highways that stretch out of Doha.The boycott raised concerns that projects could be delayed if building material including from the Far East and South Asia is choked.But at the nearby Mesaeeid stockyard, vast dunes of gabbro rock, around 10 million tonnes worth according to officials, lay stockpiled for construction.Its business as usual, the port official said."

Acting on the complaint, the department personnel placed a cage in a sugarcane field four days ago and tied a dog as a bait.As it did not yield any result, they tied a lamb as a bait on Thursday evening. This proved successful in trapping the wild cat.Hundreds of people gathered to get a glimpse of the leopard. While a few were trying to take a selfie with the leopard, some were seen videographing the wild cat.Residents staged a snap stir as the Forest department personnel failed to reach the spot even after hours of informing them. They stated that there were two or more leopards on the prowl and urged the department to take measures to trap them.The villagers later withdrew the protest after Range Forest Officer Shashidhar pacified them and promised to set a trap for other leopards. The trapped leopard cub is healthy and will be released in either Nagarahole or Bandipur forest, he said."

The objective was to find new medications against type-2 diabetes by addressing an important disease mechanism: the livers elevated glucose production.The classic drug metformin works by doing just that, but often causes gastric side-effects and can also not be taken when kidney function is severely reduced, which affects many diabetes patients.The researchers analysed 2,800 participants investigated and found that sulforaphane proved to have the best characteristics for the task. An antioxidant that was previously studied for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disease, but not for diabetes was thereby identified.Cell experiments were followed by animal studies on rats and mice with dietary-induced diabetes. The blood sugar of the animals that received sulforaphane dropped by 23 percent in four weeks, and by 24 percent in those given metformin.Anders Rosengren explained that when sulforaphane was removed from the extract, the effect disappeared and then they also looked at the genes from the liver of the animals and saw that the 50 key genes had been changed in the right direction.A daily dose of sulforaphane is extracted from four to five kilograms of broccoli.Anders Rosengren noted that sulforaphane targets a central mechanism in Type-2 diabetes and has a mild side-effect profile. As functional food, it can reach the patients faster than a medication, and it is also an interesting concept from a diabetes perspective, where diet is central.The entire study is published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

Lalli Majithia, who had contested elections against Bikram Majithia in the February 2017 Assembly elections and lost, alleged gross irregularities and nepotism in allocation of tenders for upgradation, modernisation and installation of co-generation of power in the eight sugar mills, resulting in huge losses to the state exchequer and rendering the Co-operative Sugar mills (CSMs) across the state incapable of being self- sustaining. He accused Majithia of favouritism in order take over all cooperative sugar mills in the garb of value addition through co-generation.The total estimated loss from 2010-11, the year in which these projects should have been operational, till now is Rs 915 crores. The loss will continue to increase till the time co-generation plants are put up and made functional, said Lalli. He demanded setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the alleged scam and bring the guilty to book. Meanwhile, Bikram Majithia was not available for comments. Financial Commissioner (Cooperation) VK Singh was also not available for comments on the allegations levelled by Lalli Majithia. Giving background to his allegations, Lalli Majithia said tenders were floated by SUGARFED, Punjab, on behalf of 8 CSMs of Punjab in 2008.Lalli alleged that M/s Saraya Industries Limited (SIL), a family unit of Bikram Singh Majithia, misused his official clout and obtained the contracts for four mills directly and four in the name of another company A2Z. Co-operative sugar mills had been facing financial constraints, and to get the mills out of this financial mess, it was decided to go in for co-generation to increase revenue, he said. SIL bagged orders for Nawanshahr, Ajnala, Batala and Gurdaspur mills and A2Z for Morinda, Budhewal, Nakodar and Fazilka mills. Lalli claimed that tenders received from SIL were conditional and not as per terms of notice inviting tenders (NIT) and hence, should have been rejected there and then.The earnest money deposited by these eight mills amounting to Rs 3 Crore should also have been forfeited, he added. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed with SIL on January 12, 2009, as per which the SIL and A2Z had to deposit a security amount of Rs 2 Crore with each of the eight CSMs by 11 April, 2009, but SIL and A2Z did not deposit a single penny. Hence, MOU was liable to be cancelled at this stage itself, said Lalli. In addition, M/s SIL and A2Z were also required to contribute towards modernization and ungradation of sugar mill machinery so as to make its functioning more efficient and fit for synchronization with co-generation plant, which also they defaulted on, he said.The Congress leader further alleged that in order to safeguard and get the Earnest Money Deposited (EMD) refunded, which SIL had deposited for those three mills where they could not start work of co-generation, SIL filed arbitration cases with Registrar Cooperative Societies Punjab for cancellation of MOU and refund of EMD. According to Lalli, had these plants started operations as per the terms and conditions of the agreement, CSMs would have been able to earn a revenue of Rs 668 crores, which would have enabled the sugar mills to make timely payments to sugarcane farmers from their own resources, without having to beg from the state government.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The rainwater gets percolated into them and the volume of water flowing down the drain gets reduced.

During the rainy season, however, mosquitoes swarm up wherever we try to relax on the benches of the park. Fumigation is rarely carried out to ward them off. If this is done, it will be of great help to walkers who drop in here for fresh air.Recently, I noticed some young men and women testing the blood pressure and blood sugar levels of visitors outside this park for a fee. I am not sure about the credibility of these agencies which make money by offering this service. After a walk, the blood pressure tends to remain high and so do blood sugar levels. I wonder how are such things done in a public park? Are people who maintain this park aware of it?

With the onset of the monsoon, the problem will become more acute. Garbage collectors do not remove the entire pile and leave the rest to accumulate.The BBMP officials concerned should inspect the site and instruct the garbage contractor to remove the pile from the whole area.

The BMTC helpline (1-800-425-1663) made a similar claim. But in the morning, the bus services were scaled down. In the evening, hardly any buses plied from Domlur to Banashankari and from Madiwala/Silk Board to Banashankari. I waited at Domlur from 8 pm to 9 pm but there were no buses. Some of the BMTC staffers I spoke to confirmed that fewer workers had reported for work and thats why the services were reduced. The BMTC collects 60% of its revenue from bus passes but leaves commuters to fend for themselves where it really matters.Murali KrishnaCong govt must act constructivelyIt is quite amusing to see Bengaluru topping the list for many undesirable things. It has already earned the dubious distinction of being a highly corrupt city notwithstanding its top rank in information technology and its large pool of technical and scientific talent. Then there are traffic jams ad the high cost of living. It has now emerged that the city appears prominently on the list of places whose residents treat senior citizens harshly.All this shows that there is no sincere effort from people in power to look into these things while being busy in planning high-cost steel bridges and projects like that. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and his colleagues in the government should try do something constructive instead of issuing boastful advertisements by wasting public money, which appear to be aimed at building the governments image ahead of elections.V S Ganeshan 58, AECSLayout 2nd Stage, 3rd Main Road, SanjaynagarWaste dumped on open siteA vacant site (No 1278) at 1st Stage, 1st Phase, Chandra Layout, 11th Cross, which falls under the Nagarabhavi ward (number 128), is being used for dumping waste which attracts dogs and has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.The site owner is requested to keep the land clean so as to prevent dumping of garbage.

This has helped villagers get rid of water tankers. More than 1,190 villages have become tanker-free.Fadnavis was interacting with more than 18,000 participants in the fifth episode of Mi Mukhyamantri Boltoy programme in Mumbai on Sunday. Many had joined the interaction from across the state via video conferencing.The Jalyukta Shivar projects are enhancing the irrigation potential of 25,000 villages across Maharashtra and will make them drought-free, Fadnavis said, adding that they will also help provide clean drinking water. The policies entail detailed planning with special focus on water recharge projects to elevate the underground water table. Our planning aims to make villages not only water-neutral but also get access to clean drinking water, he said.Fadnavis was asked by Sandeep Choudhiry from Thane about what steps the government has taken to complete irrigation projects. Fadnavis answered that the government has given priority to projects which have been languishing despite 75 per cent of the work being completed.In the last 15 years, resources were spread thinly in the irrigation sector and large number of projects were started, but none of these could benefit people, he said. Our government taken every project which would enhance irrigation potential on priority. We have completed 100 projects which will bring at least one lakh hectare of land under irrigation. Another 140 projects would be completed in next two years, he said.There are 23 mega projects which I personally monitor periodically through my war room to assess the progress address problems. Their completion would bring 32 to 40 lakh hectare of land under irrigation, he added. Chitali Asolkar (Shegaon) from district Buldhana asked when villages would get water supply like cities. Fadnavis said, The government has already launched a special project Mukhyamantri Jal Yojana for which Rs 2,500 crore has been allocated. The work is underway and Rs 900 crore has been released.While discussing the water policies, he said, A lot of impetus is given on identifying and strengthening underground water sources across all districts. The projects to strengthen water sources will ensure sustained water supply in villages. To Namdeo Rauts question on drip irrigation, Fadnavis said, We have taken the decision to bring sugar cane cultivation under drip irrigation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

At present the cost of production of a laddu is `33, but the TTD has subsidised it to `25.After the GST comes into force, if the TTD is allowed no exemption, it will have to pay more for the prasadam's ingredients. The GST Council has already made it clear that there would be no tax on the purchase of laddus by pilgrims. T h o u g h t h e Tirupati Tirumala D ev a s t h a n a m s Board has made a representation to the GST Council to exempt all its transactions from GST, no decision has been announced yet.The Council is likely to take a call on the matter on Sunday and also look into other requests such as the reduction in GST on the granite industry and textile yarn. Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrsihnudu on Saturday said he expected a positive decision on the state's representation. Speaking to media persons at the R and B Guest House in Kakinada, he said in case of any loss to states due to the imposition of GST, the Centre would collect a compensation cess and pay it to the aggrieved party.Meanwhile, the accounts department of the TTD and the office of the financial advisor estimated that the annual additional burden on the TTD would be `70 crore due to the imposition of GST. In 2016-17, the TTD made purchases worth `472 crore and another `200 crore was spent by the engineering department. The TTD spent `70 crore for the purchase of cashewnuts alone.The GST on the nut is pegged at five per cent. In the same period, the TTD purchased ghee for `122 crore which will now attract a GST of 12 per cent. The various items that the T i r u p a t i T i r u m a l a Devasthanams Board purchases for its service to pilgrims will be slapped with GST between five and 23 per cent.

He flew fighter planes like Vampires and Hunters at numbers 1, 7 and 17 Squadron. Besides, he also did an instructors course and was part of the first aerobatic display team consisting of nine Hunters.After an instructional stint at the National Defence Academy, he joined the second Mig-21 unit, 45 Squadron at Chandigarh.While rehearsing for the Republic Day fly-past on January 23, 1970 he was involved in a mid-air collision. Though his left stabilator (fully movable aircraft stabilizer) was damaged, affecting his stability, he managed to fly back to Chandigarh. His grit and flying skills were recognised by decorating him with the Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry). This was followed by a stint with the Directorate of Air Staff Inspection at the Air headquarters.During the Indo-Pak war in 1971, Bedi flew Mig-21s while on attachment with 29 Squadron (Scorpions) from Sirsa. On December 16, while launching a strike on the enemy troop concentrations near Bahawalnagar, Flight Lieutenant Menons Mystere IVA from 31 Squadron was hit by an anti-aircraft fire, inflicting Category B damage.Bedi and 29 Squadrons commanding officer, Wingco Sawardekar (who was flying top cover), nursed Menon and his plane back to Sirsa by employing every trick available in the book.A satisfying experience it was.After the war, he commanded 27 Squadron and was flying Hunters. His focus was now on building operational capabilities. Later, he became the station commander at Suratgarh and coordinated air support to the XI Corps. This was followed by a stint as the chief operations officer at Jamnagar.Commanding the stations at Arjangarh and Halwara, Bedi moved up the ladder in a succession of staff jobs and finally retired as director general of defence planning staff.Post-retirement in 1996, he was elected to the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, where he enjoyed working for the people. Nevertheless, he says politics has made him forget all virtues he had imbibed during his service life.Today, he is a writer and an informed commentator on strategic affairs.How KPS Gill Defeated TerroristsKnowing that the Army was unwilling to get actively involved in Punjab owing to the fear of losing public support in the aftermath of Operation Bluestar, KPS Gill creatively used this in a strategic manner.Army units were regaining control of the countryside using area domination tactics, exercising a commanding position at night through patrols and ambushes, disrupting terrorist movement and providing the manpower for cordons.A popular government being voted to power and excesses by terrorists had encouraged people to come forward with information about the separatists in Punjab. This was further encouraged by rewarding those who provided actionable intelligence inputs. An informer protection programme was also in place.Aided by some of the most brilliant intelligence officers, Gill was able to locate terrorists, their leaders and weapons caches, thus breaking the separatist movement.Punjabs topography is such that it does not provide militants any natural sanctuary (forest, mountains, among others) to hide in. Because of this, militants took refuge in peoples homes, in standing crops like sugarcane, and tubewells.Under Gills strategy, active and passive harbourers were neutralised by identifying them, taking them into custody, booking them under law, and even elimination in few extreme cases. These measures, some of them admittedly irregular, broke the chain of sympathisers and tractable shelter providers, leaving militants bereft of safe sanctuaries for refuge. Forced to come out in the open, they became easy targets for the police.Gills claim that Punjab had the most humane campaign ever in the history of counter-insurgency is not borne out by disturbing facts. A sad blemish on an otherwise chequered career.Please write in with your narratives of war and military life to msbajwa@gmail.com or call/WhatsApp on 093161-35343"

We have not caused any losses to the cooperative sugar mills... Also we are in no way associated with the company A2Z (which got tender for four projects), as alleged.The firm said it was the highest bidder in four of the nine projects, for which Punjab Sugarfed had invited tenders in 2008. The project entailed setting up of Rs 85-crore cogeneration plants on build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis at nine cooperative sugar mills.... at the end of the BOOT period, (the firm had to) hand it over to the cooperative mill. In 2011, cooperative mills initiated arbitration against Saraya and the arbitrator dealt with the issue and award was passed based on the merits of the case, stated the firm director.

5a03a68f9855b76bf13b8d08,Number of diabetic people in Chandigarh likely to double in 5 years:&thinsp;Study,http://www.hindustantimes.com/health/number-of-diabetic-people-in-chandigarh-likely-to-double-in-5-years-study/story-ez0eJhHSgMW6RNC5hbDugJ.html,2017-06-18,"The number of diabetic people in Chandigarh will double in the next five years if no preventive measures are taken, an ongoing study has found.Setting alarm bells ringing in the UT health department, the study says with 13.6% of its population suffering from the disease, the city, in percentage terms, has the highest incidence of diabetes among Indias 15 states. It also says 14.6% of the citys people have been diagnosed as pre-diabetic and they carry the risk of becoming diabetics in near future.The study, being conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research and INdia DIABetes, was published recently in the peer-reviewed international journal, The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.Increase over the yearsThe number of diabetics and pre-diabetics is more than what a study published in 2010 had found. At that time, the citys diabetic incidence was 11.1% while the pre-diabetes figure was 13.2%.One of the authors of the study, Dr Anil Bhansali, head, endocrinology department, PGIMER, said, Pre-diabetes means that you have a higher-than-normal blood sugar level and that is not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. It is reversible but if you do not take preventive measures, the pre-diabetes can become diabetes within 5-7 years,More participants in the study from the city were youngsters. In Chandigarh, a large number of youths are affected by diabetes because they are not very active, physically speaking. We had conducted a study in 2010, which showed that two/third of youth were physically inactive, he said.Complications associated with diseaseMore worrisome part of diabetes is the complications associated with it, Dr Bhansali said. Because now diabetic people are living longer, they have chances of developing complications.These days, the most common cause of renal transplant is diabetes.And this translates into more financial burden on the patients family, he said.Experts believe that it is high time when the UT health department should start working on preventing measures.Everyone is sleeping. They should organise frequent screening camps, make people aware about good dietary habits and promote exercise and physical activity, he said.Dr Anil Bhansali (HT Photo)Face-to-faceHT spoke to Dr Anil Bhansali, head of PGIs endocrinology department and one of the authors of the study. Here are the excerpts:Q: 27% of the citys poor people are diabetic. Why it is so?A: The urban poor are struggling to make their ends meet. The cost of living is higher and to compensate that they eat cheap food which is rich in carbohydrate and low in proteins and fats. Then they have very erratic lifestyle as they are struggling to live in the city. Therefore they are more prone to diabetes.Now, if you eat more chapattis and sugar, you are more likely to suffer from diabetes. So, the urban poor must be targeted and given dietary advice and encouraged to do more physical activity.Q: Why Chandigarh has the highest incidence of diabetes?A: The city has the highest per capita income in India, which means people are more prone to luxury lifestyle and less physical activity. A data of 2010 showed that 66% of its population in the age group of 20 to 40 did no physical activity. It is also possible that people are not really aware.Q: Shouldnt the health department should become more proactive?A: Everyone is sleeping. They only wake up on June 21 (Yoga Day) and then forget. The department has a very short time and it should take urgent preventive measures and check the increase in the number of diabetics. They should organise more screening programmes, particularly targeting the young population. Then they should educate people about good dietary habits and promote physical activities like brisk walking, cycling or other exercises.Q: What should people do to keep diabetes at bay?A: They should have a balanced food, which should have 50% carbohydrates, 20% proteins and 30% fat. In India, diabetes starts taking off at the age of 35, so people should go for regular screening.Q: Are you planning more studies?A: We will call over 2,000 urban patients enrolled for the study and will check their status as how many are alive and how many have developed complications.Q: Why a shift from rich urban people to the rich in rural belts?Whenever there is an economic advancement, there is epideomological transmission. The purchasing power of people increases. They have more access to food and adopt sedentary lifestyle and become more diabetic.So the first sufferers of economic progression were urban rich people. But with time and awareness, the prevalence of diabetes decreases. This is called as epidemiological transition.Now rich rural are more diabetic, because economic advancements reached rural population later. So, they are showing high prevalence of disease now."

Cogeneration plants help generate electricity and useful heat at the same time.The total estimated loss from 2010-11, the year in which these projects should have been operational, till now is Rs 915 crore, said Lalli. The losses will continue to pile up till the time co-generation plants are made operational.The mills not only failed to earn Rs 668-crore revenue, but also suffered losses of Rs 245 crore over a period of seven years on account of salaries, repair and maintenance, fuel and purchase of hydel power, said Lalli, on the basis of Sugarfed documents.Alleging the scam rendered cooperative sugar mills across the state incapable of being self-sustaining, Lalli demanded probe by a special investigation team (SIT) into it.Misused clout to obtain contractsSugarfed, apex body of cooperative sugar mills in the state, had floated the tenders for the work on behalf of the eight mills in 2008.Lalli alleged Saraya Industries Limited (SIL), a family unit of Bikram Singh Majithia, misused his official clout and obtained the contracts for four mills directly and four in the name of another company, A2Z.SIL bagged orders for Nawanshahr, Ajnala, Batala and Gurdasprur and A2Z for Morinda, Budhewal, Nakodar and Fazilka, said Lalli. Tenders received from SIL were conditional and not as per terms of notice inviting tenders (NIT) and hence should have been rejected there and then. The earnest money deposited by these eight mills amounting to Rs 3 crore should also have been forfeited.The Congress leader said both SIL and A2Z failed to deposit security amount of Rs 2 crore by the due date. Later, to get the earnest money refunded, which SIL had deposited for three mills, it filed arbitration cases with the registrar, cooperative societies, for the cancellation of the memorandum of undertaking (MoU).Lalli alleged Tajinder Singh Virdi, the then additional registrar, under coercion from Bikram ordered for release of 80% of earnest money deposit in gross violation of the MoU terms and also ordered cancellation of the MoU. Claims of the mills for losses incurred were completely ignored, said Lalli, who had lost the February assembly elections to Majithia.Majithia did not respond to repeated calls by HT."

Perumal, a farmer, said Seeni Thulasi (Stevia Rebaudiana) would provide relief to those suffering from diabetes and would also prevent the onset of diabetes in others. This is significant as India was emerging as diabetes capital.Perumal said many farmers in the northern states have already taken up cultivation of the plant on a largescale which, he believed, would help farmers and the society as well. He suggested that the plant could be distributed free of cost to farmers.Agriculture Department officials, who were present in the meeting, appreciated the suggestion and said the plant would be included in the forthcoming scheme to distribute herbal plant kit to farmers.When contacted, Dr Pandian, the head of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) Research Centre at Vrinjipuram near here, said Seeni Thulasi is natural sweetener and a substitute for white sugar extracted from the leaves of the plant species Stevia rebaudiana.Leaves are the most economic part of the plant. Native to Paraguay and other tropical areas of America, the Stevia plant produces leaves packed with super-sweet compounds that remain stable even after the leaves have been dried. Stevia leaves have been used to sweeten teas and beverages throughout South America for centuries. More recently, diabetics and dieters alike have turned to Stevia to reduce their sugar intake as it has zero calories, unlike honey, maple syrup, agave or molasses, and is not metabolised by the body.Stevia is especially well-suited for sweetening drinks, fruits, salad dressings, yoghurt and most creamy desserts.He said the TNAU has studied the plant and has documented its properties. Stevia grows well in sandy loam soil with an ample supply of water. The plant prefers acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 for its best growth.Annual average temperature of 31 degree Celsius with a rainfall of 140 cm per year has been found optimum for its good growth. The day temperatures should not exceed 48 degree Celsius and the night temperatures should not fall below 4 degree Celsius. Rooted cuttings are planted with a spacing of 45 x 45 cm, with a total plant density in the order of 30,000 plants per hectare.An estimated 3 to 3.5 tonnes per hectare dry green leaves could be obtained from three to four cuttings every year. It is cultivated up to five years after one-time plantation.Sandy loam soil most suitedStevia grows well in sandy loam soil with ample supply of water. It prefers acidic to neutral soil with a pH range of 6.5-7.5 for its best growth. Annual average temperature of 31 degree Celsius is suited for good growthA natural way to indulge your sweeth toothIts not just another herb. Stevia Rebaudiana or Seeni Thulasi has the capacity to make life of a diabetic much easier, when used in moderation. A look at its pros and consKnow the herbStevia plant is a culinary herb that has been used by native Guarani tribes in Paraguay for centuriesIt has very low calories and its dry leaves are almost 40 times sweeter than sugarGlycoside compounds such as Steviolbioside, Rebaudiosides A-E, Stevioside and Dulcoside are behind its sweetnessStevia extracts can withstand high temperatures, have long shelf life and will not fermentGood vs BadNot all Stevia products are good though. While consuming Stevia leaves is beneficial, chemically processed Stevia products are bad for healthThough there have been concerns about Stevia affecting fertility and inducing hormone related issues, studies have found that use in moderation could do no harmStevia leaves have a tendency to lower blood pressure. So those with low BP and those taking anti-hypertensive drugs should use Stevia with cautionHow to use itThough Stevia plant leaves can be used directly in your drink, it is usually used as dried powder or syrupRoughly one teaspoon of dried leaves will be equivalent to one cup of sugar. So be careful about the quantityStevia syrup can be made by adding a cup of hot water to 1/4 cup of fresh, finely-grinded leaves. After 24 hours, use a strainer to filter it and then refrigerateMultipurposeDifferent countries use Stevia in different waysJapan: To sweeten sweets, soft drinks, tea, sauce.

But it seems the CM doesnt want to share information with the assembly members, said Phoolka.Your failure to punish the guilty will be enough to prove that the Congress and the SAD-BJP have a tacit understanding between them when it comes to serving their own interests at the cost of the state. Your government is undermining the democratic rights of the people which envisage a complete transparency from the elected government. A person who hides the illegal deeds of another is equally responsible as having committed that illegal act, Aroras letter to the CM reads.Referring to reports that former revenue minister Bikram Singh Majithia got an illegal contract worth hundreds of crores for cogeneration of power in cooperative sugar mills in Punjab, Phoolka questioned why the Congress government was shielding him?The AAP also accused the Congress and Akali members of not allowing them to raise the burning issues, including farmer suicides, in the ongoing budget session of the House. The Congress government knows that if we are allowed to raise these issues, it will be embarrassed, Phoolka said.The AAP had demanded an adjournment motion on the sand mining auction, accusing irrigation and power minister Rana Gurjit Singh of indulging in impropriety in the contracts. It was denied by speaker Rana KP Singh on the second day of the session. The speaker had then suspended the AAP MLAs for the day and Simarjeet Bains for the rest of the session for throwing a bundle of papers at the chair.The SAD-BJP members had disrupted the proceedings of the House on the second and third day by storming into the well, demanding a debate on farm loan waiver. It has never happened in the assembly that the question hour proceedings were disrupted by the members. The SAD-BJP members were simply wasting the time of the House in order to prevent us from speaking, said Arora.AAP leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira, who wanted to raise the issue of sand mining, was suspended on the third day for the rest of the session, after he made a live video of the unruly scenes in the House and uploaded it on his Facebook page. He had subsequently accused the speaker of being a puppet in the hands of the Congress.When asked how the party will raise the issues in the absence of Khaira and Bains, Phoolka said: We will frame a strategy to counter both the ruling Congress and the Akali-BJP members. Our first-time MLAs would effectively raise their voice in the House, he said.(With PTI inputs)"
5a03a8769855b76bf13b8e30,"Lack of physical activity and faulty food main causes behind diabetes, says Chandigarh doctors",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/lack-of-physical-activity-and-faulty-food-main-causes-behind-diabetes-says-chandigarh-doctors-4710916/,2017-06-19,"Chandigarh has the highest prevalence of diabetes among 15 states/UTs of the country, says a Lancet study. Whats more worrying is that its no longer just a rich mans lifestyle disease; it is moving from the affluent to the urban poor Chandigarh has the highest prevalence of diabetes among 15 states/UTs of the country, says a Lancet study. Whats more worrying is that its no longer just a rich mans lifestyle disease; it is moving from the affluent to the urban poorLAST SEPTEMBER, 40-year-old city resident Bhupinder Singh suddenly began to feel extraordinarily thirsty. His local doctor advised him to go to Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). There, doctors advised him to go for a blood sugar test. It was positive for Type 1 Diabetes. Since then, Singh has been on insulin treatment three times daily. He spends Rs 592 on one cartridge of the anti-diabetes medicine which lasts 10 days.For Singh, who runs a cloth store at Zirakpur, the diagnosis was a shock. There is no family history of diabetes, he said, as he spoke about the extra financial burden of the treatment.Two weeks ago when the reputed Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal published a study about the prevalence of diabetes in the country, the report only corroborated what the city doctors had been saying for years. Chandigarh has the highest prevalence of the disease among 15 states/UTs of the country that were surveyed for the study. And with a per capita income of $ 3,433, it was the most affluent city.But heres the twist in the tale: its no longer just a rich mans lifestyle disease. The disease is moving from the affluent to the urban poor. The Lancet study, which is still ongoing, found the national prevalence of diabetes to be 7.3 per cent. Chandigarh has 13.6 per cent, not just the highest among the surveyed states, but almost double the national prevalence.Chandigarh was part of the studys Phase 1 along with four other states (the study was conducted in three phases until 2015) from November 2008 to April 2010. In UT, it covered 3,356 individuals. The city was among the places with the highest waist circumferences both for men (82.9 cms) and women (78.7 cms). Punjab was the highest with 87.8 for men and 76.6 for women.The study found that the prevalence of diabetes among Chandigarhs urban poor is about 26.9 per cent. Among those surveyed, 370 were from a low SES (socio-economic status); 1,059 from middle SES; and 1,920 from high SES. For the purposes of the study, the prevalence in the middle and high SES was taken together.The spread of the epidemic to economically disadvantaged sections of society is a matter of great concern in India, where most diabetes treatment expenses are borne out of pocket by patients, the report red flagged.Dr Vijay Viswanathan, head and chief diabetologist at M V Hospital for Diabetes, Chennai, maintains that the lack of physical activity and faulty food are the main causes behind the rise of diabetes among the urban poor. Health administrators must be prepared for dealing with increasing numbers of diabetes patients from the lower soci-economic groups, and the cascading effect it has on patients health as it affects other systems in the body.He asserts that people with less money to spend on food typically overload themselves with carbohydrates and transfats, as they tend to use the same oil repeatedly. Expensive items such as fruits and vegetables are the first to be sacrificed.The diet gets faulty and instead of fruits and vegetables they take rich carbohydrates like rice. They also consume a lot of food, which contains transfats. Since the urban poor gets diabetes, the health system has to look after these people as they would be developing certain complications related to heart, kidney and all, which is more expensive than treating the diabetes itself, Dr Vishwanathan told Chandigarh Newsline.In 2009, a similar study conducted by PGIMER doctors had concluded that the citys diabetic prevalence was 11.1 per cent. PGI then studied 2,227 people from urban Chandigarh during April 2008-June 2009.These studies were conducted some years ago, but the situation has not improved. The increase is now showing in the city hospitals, where doctors assert that the number of patients has gone up in the last few years. Other than the PGIMER, which records patients from neighbouring states, the citys GMSH in Sector 16 and GMCH in Sector 32 are also recording a rise, according to doctors.Over the years the number of diabetes population coming to us has doubled, said Dr Gopal Bhardwaj, head, department of medicine and endocrinology, GMSH, Sector 16. Our hospital records patients mostly from the city itself and also the Tricity areas. The number has tremendously increased. Now the patients are younger, and also from varied groups such as labourers and workers. This could be due to a change in genetic make-up, possible environmental factors and food adulteration and other changes in the food habits.Dr Sanjay Bhadada, from the department of endocrinology, PGIMER, believes the change in lifestyle post-migration from villages to cities adds to the risk factors of diabetes.We are witnessing a large number of people of low socio-economic status migrating to cities like Chandigarh. In their villages, they are accustomed to a particular type of food. When they come to the city, their body doesnt adjust to the change of food habits which could lead to diabetes, he said.The city also has recorded prevalence of pre-diabetes at 14.6 per cent  a similar prevalence was noted in both urban and rural areas (14.5 per cent versus 14.7 per cent respectively). Doctors caution that the alarming figures of pre-diabetes should be seen as serious and in the next few years, they should make some lifestyle changes.What adds to the diabetes problem is that the people in the city are becoming more obese. While the citys waist circumference was high, the Lancet study also pointed out that Chandigarhs average body mass index (BMI) was also high at 23.2.The normal values of BMI are between 18-22 in the country. According to the authors of the study, the prevalence of diabetes was higher in the urban areas compared with rural areas (14.2 per cent vs 8.3 per cent respectively).Fitness experts underline the importance of fitness and changing food habits.Its the combination of cardio, weight training and diet which could support the cause, said Vikram Kapoor, a city-based fitness trainer.The morning and evening walks along with jogging must be supported by maintenance of muscles which serves a great deal in burning calories.Kapoor insists that the shift of the diabetes in the lower age groups keeps the future generation also in the high risk. The shift of diabetes which was earlier in the 45-50 age group is now in the 30-35 age group. The lifestyle variations among this group are thereby promoting instances of hereditary diabetic symptoms in further younger generations.Bhupinder, the shop owner at Zirakpur, said he had little time to exercise, but occasionally he went for a walk. Recently, his doctor at PGI told him to get his kidney test, which has alarmed him. I hope everything is fine, and there are no complications, he said.(Inputs by Radhika Pasrija)For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI Photo) A panel of Group of Ministers constituted by the CM has submitted a report on a new mining policy and on clamping down on illegal mining, which is a major problem in UP. (Source: PTI Photo)As Yogi Adityanath completes 100 days in office this week as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, formidable challenges including funds for the farm loan-waiver, and law and order stare him at his face, with the opposition claiming the misses have outnumbered the hits. The loan-waiver, a major pre-poll promise of the BJP, is making finance department burn the midnight oil in trying all permutations and combination to offload the sudden fiscal burden of nearly Rs 36,369 crore. This coupled with Rs 34,000 crore for the implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations, has put an additional burden of a whopping over Rs 70,000 crore on the states coffers.The government faces other major challenges including of arranging funds for mega projects like the Purvanchal e-way.The government itself has admitted it could manage to make just 63 per cent of the state roads pothole-free by the June-15 deadline set by the chief minister.Distribution of free laptops among students  mentioned in the BJPs sankalp patra (election manifesto)  is another challenge confronting the Yogi government, which was inaugurated on March 19.No date has been announced for the scheme to be launched.With certain law and order incidents, especially caste and communal clashes, threatening to eclipse the achievements of the 45-year-old saffron-clad chief minister, his officials are going the extra mile to ensure there is no dent in BJPs image in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The chief minister and his cabinet colleagues have already sought more time saying they inherited a jungle raj from the SP government and it would take them some time to set things in order.Soon after being sworn-in, the CM had claimed he would prove his governments commitment to good governance first by ridding the roads of potholes completely by June 15.However, his deputy Keshav Maurya, who also holds the PWD portfolio, admitted that out of 1.21 lakh-km of road length, repair works on only about 70,000km had been completed.The condition of roads in Kanpur and PM Narendra Modis constituency of Varanasi is particularly bad.Another challenge for the government is holding the urban local body elections by July 15, when their term expires.The State Election Commission was ready and had completed its preparations, but the government itself put off the polls saying the rapid survey of the backward seats was faulty- the survey was conducted under the present BJP regime.Now the elections are likely to be held in October.As the state government prepares to come out with a 100-day achievement document later this week, state Congress spokesperson Dwijendra Tripathi ridiculed the ruling party for making promises that it could not meet.Two months of the Adityanath government have not sent out any strong message on any of the issues which were part of BJPs campaign  improved law-and-order situation and better administration, he said.BSP chief Mayawati has alleged that the Dalits, the OBCs as well as forward castes including Brahmins have been facing atrocities in the state in an apparent attempt to associate Adityanath and his government with Kshatriyas only.As head of the Gorakhnath Peeth, Adityanath has often associated himself with Kshatriya symbols.He is often seen surrounded by Kshatriyas mostly and he has supported Thakur leaders of other parties too  in 2013, he came out in support of Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya who was accused of conspiring to kill a deputy Superintendent of Police.Not known to take frequent barbs at him lying down, ex-chief minister Akhilesh Yadav recently took on the Yogi government, saying, I never knew officers wielded brooms so well. Now the question is how much filth have they cleared so far?He said the deadline to make state roads pothole-free by June 15 remained a pipe dream.When asked about the Yogi governments decision to probe the Expressway and river front projects launched during the SP rule, Akhilesh said, Will this government do any workor will it only conduct probes? This government should try to do better work than us.Presently, the entire state machinery  from ministry to departmental level  is working on their 100-day progress reports which will be presented to the public in the form of a white paper, an official said.While the CM is personally reviewing the works, a web-based monitoring system has also been put in place for 73 departments in the state to submit their progress reports, the official said.The government has not announced any major scheme or big-ticket infrastructure projects other than the farm loan-waiver.These are likely to be addressed when the government presents its maiden budget in the next few months. Adityanath has said that two months is a too short a period to showcase any achievements.Law-and-order and governance, however, remain the primary challenges for Adityanath. It will be a herculean task to change the attitude of the bureaucracy down to the lowest level and make the government machinery responsive to the needs of the public, political observers feel.Adityanath will need to begin the process of change and show tangible results soon in order to satisfy those who voted the BJP, and to stave off anti-incumbency sentiment before the Lok Sabha elections scheduled for 2019, analysts say.The recent clashes between the Dalits and the Kshatriyas in Saharanpur, several instances of vigilantism in the name of cow protection or moral policing and the run-ins of BJP leaders, including legislators, with police and officials have hindered the new governments attempts to send out right signals on good governance.The change has started to show in UP since the Yogi government took charge. Well-meaning people are feeling relieved with the closure of illegal slaughterhouses. With the constitution of anti-Romeo squads, anti-social elements harassing women and girls are now in fear.Rowdyism is dying and crime graph falling. Peoples confidence in the government has been restored, the state BJP had said in its political resolution at its recent working committee meeting at Lucknow.But, on the ground, certain recent incidents like caste clashes in Saharanpur and communal violence in Bulandshahr, Sambhal and Gonda gave the law-enforcing agencies sleepless nights more so as the BJP came to power on the plank of improving law and order, terming the erstwhile Samajwadi Party rule as a goondaraj.In Bulandshahr, members of the Adityanath-founded Hindu Yuva Vahini were alleged to be behind the killing of an aged Muslim man after a love-jihad-style elopement. The Bulandshahr incident took place even as Adityanath met senior Yuva Vahini workers during a visit to Gorakhpur and warned them againts taking law in their own hands.The attack on Saharanpur SSPs residence allegedly by BJP activists led by local MP Raghav Lakhanpal, hogged the headlines.And even before the dust settled on the controversy, caste violence broke out in the region.The Samajwadi Party latched onto these developments. We were termed the goonda party. Now, what is happening under Yogi ji? Will he act? Akhilesh asked.Perturbed over the sudden spurt in such incidents, the CM decided to set up a special monitoring cell in his office.A special cell will be constituted in the CMs office for crime-monitoring, which will be done personally by the CM, cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma said.Refuting SPs criticism over the law and order, he said, Those SP leaders, who have carried criminals and rapists with them in their cars, should introspect.Ever since Adityanath took over the reins of the state, the bureaucracy is constantly on its toes.It is an unusual sight to see that the parking lots at the secretariat here get full even before the clock strikes 9:25 in the morning.Adityanath has proved himself to be a tough taskmaster, holding back-to-back meetings with ministers and bureaucrats well past midnight, only to return to office before 9.30 the next morning.For almost a month, some 80-odd presentations were made by as many departments before the CM.The state government has so far announced half a dozen significant measures, starting with the Rs 36,500-crore loan-waiver and power-for-all agreement, said Principal Secretary (Information) Avaneesh Awasthi.At the BJP working committee meeting, Adityanath praised Cane Development Minister Suresh Rana for his efforts to clear Rs 5,558 crore of dues of sugarcane farmers within 40 days.A panel of Group of Ministers constituted by the CM has submitted a report on a new mining policy and on clamping down on illegal mining, which is a major problem in UP.A portal being launched under the CMOs supervision to allow people to file complain on illegal land-grab could be a game-changer, too.The Power-for-All agreement between the Yogi government and the Centre promises electricity around the clock to district headquarters and 18-hour a day to all villages.Another key decision was making transfers and postings of bureaucrats merit-based and free from extraneous pressures as reflected in wide-scale transfers done by the government.In the erstwhile government, transfers had become an industry. Now, honest and talented officers are getting respectable posts, a BJP leader said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

DH File PhotoThe Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), an autonomous board managing the affairs of Indias richest temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh has secured exemption from GST for its Laddus.The sale of human hair and all rooms with rent below Rs 1000 on the Tirumala hills have also been exemped from GST.According state finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Monday who took TTDs request in a memorandum addressed to the GST Council, the temple trust board sought exemption for ingredients not only for laddus but also for items used for pooja and serving pilgrims at choultries, guest houses and the sale of human hair and other revenue sources.However the minister said that the finance minister Arun Jaitley expressed his inability to exempt ingredients as other temples will also demand similar favour. The Minister said that the GST Council that met on 17 June has agreed to exempt laddus, human hair and low rate accomodation from taxable listTTD spends Rs 160 crore annually on ingredients out of which the major chunk goes to purchase of ghee, Rs. 60 crore for cashew nuts, Rs. 50 crore each for sugar and Bengal gram and Rs. 30 crore to Rs. 35 crore for the purchase of rice. While the TTD spends Rs 80 cr on free Annaprasada scheme it loses around Rs 250 cr on sale of laddus on subsidized rates.Tirumala temple nestled on the top of seven hills in Chittoor district, the abode of Lord Venkateswara, attracts about 60,000 to 80,000 pilgrims every day from all over India and abroad. The number crosses one lakh on special occasions and festivals.In April this year, the TTD declared that it earned Rs 1,038 crore through cash offerings from devotees in 2016-17. During the financial year, over 2.68 crore devotees visited the shrine.A total of 10.46 crore laddus were sold during the period. The TTD had approved the Rs 2,858 crore annual budget for 2017-18."

(File) Eight engineers of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department were booked in connection with alleged financial anomalies in the Gomti riverfront project. (File)An FIR has been lodged against eight engineers of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department in connection with alleged financial anomalies in the Gomti riverfront project, a pet initiative of former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. The FIR was lodged at Gomti Nagar police station last night, hours after the state government on Monday made clear that it will not hesitate in registering complaint against officials involved in committing financial anomalies in the Rs 1,513 crore project.Notably, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had order a high-level probe during a review meeting on April 1 after it was found that only 60 per cent work on the project was complete even as 90 per cent of the funds were exhausted. An FIR was registered against eight engineers of irrigation department late last night for their alleged role in anomalies during the execution of the Gomti river front project. The FIR was filed by an executive engineer of Sharda Project at Gomti Nagar police station for misappropriation of funds and other financial anomalies, Circle Officer of Gomti Nagar, Satyasen, told PTI on Tuesday.He said the officials against whom FIRs were lodged, were posted as chief engineers and superintendent engineers. Case has been lodged under various sections of the IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act for committing financial anomalies and misappropriation of funds, Satyasen said. SHO Gomti Nagar Sujit Dubey said the officials against whom FIR has been lodged will be arrested soon. We are collecting evidences against them, he added.UP minister of state for urban development Girish Kumar Yadav speaking to PTI on Monday had said, A few days back, the probe report was submitted to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. As far as CBI probe is concerned, all necessary steps will be taken and appropriate action will be initiated. If there is any need to lodge an FIR, the government will not hesitate in doing so. None of the guilty persons will be able to escape the clutches of law and stringent action will be taken against them, Yadav had said.The riverfront has witnessed a political showdown between the erstwhile Samajwadi Party regime in the state and the present Adityanath government. It had become a major issue during the recent Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.On April 1 the chief minister had ordered an inquiry by a retired High Court judge into the project. He had instructed chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar to constitute a committee and also directed for submission of the report within 45 days. Adityanath had also directed the urban development minister and the irrigation minister Dharmpal Singh to monitor the development work at the Gomti riverfront.During the meeting, officials had told the chief minister that of the total allocation of Rs 1,513 crore, 95 per cent of the budget, which comes to around Rs 1,435 crore had already been spent, while only 60 per cent of the work could be completed.Adityanath had directed the officials to ensure that no effluent should flow in Gomti river and ordered expeditious diversion of drains releasing effluents and polluted water in it. He had remarked that till the time the river water becomes pollution-free, its beautification would hold no meaning. He had also expressed his unhappiness that the river water was so much polluted that it was very difficult to even stand at the river front and said, In such a scenario, a fountain on Gomti river was useless.Gomti river, meandering through the 940-kilometre stretch of rich alluvial plains of Uttar Pradesh, is polluted by industrial effluents and domestic discharge. The river becomes more of a flowing dumping yard for the 15 smaller and bigger towns, including Lakhimpur Kheri, Sitapur, Lucknow, Sultanpur and Jaunpur, in its catchment area.The major sources of pollution in the Gomti are industrial waste from sugar factories and distilleries and sewage from habitations.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The lake is witnessing gradual depletion of water for the past two years.A large number of Tibetan refugees, who follow Buddhism, live in the district. The monks said they prayed to Snake God to forgive humans for bringing the lake to such a bad condition.We are praying to Snake God to forgive all of us and bring the lake to its old glory. We have brought four monks who prayed near the lake side so the angry god forgives, Tenzing Longthong, a Tibetan, told HT.The monks made the idol of Snake God from flour, milk, curd, clarified butter, sugar, jaggery and honey. The idol, after the prayers, was immersed in the lake.On June 14, the community prayed atop hill peaks. They will hold next prayer on July 8 to for the long life of the lake.The falling water-level of the lake has left locals baffled for the past last couple of months.A barefoot walk by thousands of local residents was held on June 3 from Gandhi statue to Pant statue on the Mall Road to highlight the dying condition of the lake. Meetings at different levels are being carried out regarding the water level of the Naini Lake.Concerned over depletion of Naini Lakes water-level, experts have asked the state government to declare Nainital as an eco-sensitive zone and bar any construction work near the water body.The 4.7 square km freshwater lake has never been like this. The stretched mounds of debris and the smell of dead fish dont give a pleasant sight.The erratic rainfall pattern coupled with the encroachment of natural recharge sources of the lake and growing demand of water are blamed for the present state of the lake.A natural catchment of the lake called Sukhatal has been encroached upon over the last few years.Nearly 15 million litres water lifted every day from the lake to fulfil the need of locals and tourists. Being a resort town, Nainital heavily depends on tourist influx.If so much water is lifted and with less or no water to recharge the lake, we lose almost 3-4 centimetres of water level every day said environmentalist Ajay Rawat, who filed a litigation in the high court in 2015 demanding Sukhatal to be made encroachment free.Shirish Kumar, secretary of Nainital Lake Development Authority responsible for keeping the tab on illegal construction, accepted that they were slow owing to administrative issues.Besides Sukhatal, some 60-odd natural water sources recharge the lake round the year. And with growing constructions, no less than half of them have dried up, Rawat said.Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand government has transfered the maintenance of lake from the public works department to the irrigation department.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, during a visit to Nainital on June 9, granted 3 crore for conservation of the dying lake.

Thats what a team of researchers led by the Indian Institute of Technology  Bombay (IITB) found when they used a process to extract pectin a gel-forming substance used as a universal additive in jams, jellies, ice creams and cosmetics  from the peels of Indian and Australian mangoes. The study is a part of the ongoing research on fruit waste, based at IIT-Bs bio-refinery.The research assumes significance as India produces 40% to 48% of the worlds mangoes.Currently, pectin produced from citrus peels and apple pomace is imported for Rs700 to Rs900 a kg from Germany, Mexico and China, owing to a lack of manufacturing capacity in India.Waste from fruits a global issue Globally, fruit processing industries contribute more than 0.5 billion tonnes of waste.There is no such data available for India.But, primary data on waste from mango processing factories in Maharashtra that was part of the study found that medium scale industries produce up to 50-100 tonnes of waste per day.In contrast, the five-member team extracted pectin using lemon juice, which is a natural acidifying agent. Despite being such a vast country, India doesnt produce pectin, which is used in food, confectionery, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, professor Amit Arora, principal investigator, Centre for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas, IIT-B.India produces millions of tonnes of mangoes, but all we now do is compost the peels and generate biogas. We, thus looked at an alternative green approach, in which the mango pulp is extracted and the peels processed right next to the industry without any hazardous chemicals, he added.Mango peels consist of approximately 20% to 40% of the total mango processing waste (by weight) generated in industries.The team conducted experiments on Indian mangoes, which showed that the amount of pectin in mango peels varies from 20% to 30% of total peel weight, as compared to commercial sources of pectin from citrus peel (15% to 20%), apple pomace (10% to 15%), sunflower (15% to 25%) and sugar beet (10% to 20%). To make the process of extracting pectin eco-friendly, the IIT-B and Monash University-led team replaced hazardous mineral acids with lemon juice as the former generates effluents, which need to be treated before they are released into the environment.Conventionally, industries use mineral acids nitric, sulphuric and hydrochloric to extract pectin that gels in presence of highly concentrated sugar.We used lemon juice to ensure that when we use waste, such as mango peels, it shouldnt result in us producing even more waste, said Jhumur Banerjee, a doctoral student at IITB Monash Research Academy. The effluent from the current process is comparatively safer as there is no mineral acid waste as a by-product.In addition to preventing acidic effluents, pectin, when extracted using lemon juice, was low on sugar in jams and jelly since it can gel in presence of calcium, which researchers said is a new concept in food additives for products such as low-calorie food and beverages."

Already hit by plunging prices for the crops he grows in his five-acre family farm in Maharashtras Pimpalgaon Dukre village of Nasik district, he is now staring at abject penury.The state government is set to acquire 50,000 acres of land for the Rs 46,000-crore Mumbai-Nagpur super communication highway to bring development to the backward regions of Vidarbha and Marathwada, but Waghchowre fears it will spell doom for him and his family.The proposed eight-lane highway would eat up four acres of his land holding. We survive and get by because of our land. You take this away from us and we are left with nothing. Not even hope, rues Waghchowre.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?Sharing his apprehension are 3,700 farmers in Nasik alone who have registered their objections after receiving the government notification for acquisition of their land. Incidentally, 84% of the land earmarked for the highway project is agricultural.Already caught in the spiral of high input costs and diminishing returns, the highway project is another reason for disquiet among local farmers. The recent farmers protests in north Maharashtra were triggered by the governments land acquisition policies among others.Not just this expressway, but all big-ticket projects cheat farmers, said Ulka Mahajan, an anti-land acquisition activist who had led the protests against the Mahamumbai Special Economic Zone in Raigad. Many farmers agree that road projects such as the Mumbai-Nasik highway will essentially leave them by the wayside.Their list of grievances against the government is long. Top among them is the administrations alleged lack of transparency in land acquisition. Farmers say no social impact assessment was done and the issue of compensation to landless labourers was ignored.They are also not impressed with the price  four times the current market rate  that the government is offering selectively. Our land is irrigated and we can grow crops the whole year round. I dont think you can put a price on that in Maharashtra, said Dhanaji Waghchowre, Shantarams brother.Farming has mostly ceased to be profitable, pushing more and more farmers into a deadly debt trap. According to estimates, 1,129 farmers committed suicide between January and May this year. Majority of these suicides are from Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmers practice dryland farming. And many of those who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods dont want to give up their lands because theres no viable alternative. The three Waghchowre brothers are among them.As far as Shantaram remembers, the last time he made a killing was in September 2013. Then, he had got Rs 5,000 for a quintal of onions. Belonging to the vegetable belt of Nasik, Shantaram made a cool Rs 2.5 lakh by selling his 50 quintals onions to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).Prices have gone downhill since, and so has his financial well-being. 2013 was the best thing to have happenedThis year the price is down to Rs 350 a quintal. I wont even recover my input costs, he said.Farmers spill milk on the road during a demonstration protest over various demands in Nasik. (PTI FILE PHOTO)With onions bringing him tears, he has scaled down his ambitions. A farmer lives on hope. I wont plant onions across my five acres but half an acre is my gamble. Something might pay off, he said. Nearly 40 quintals of unsold onions lie covered under a tarpaulin outside his mud and thatched house adjacent to his field.Onions, however, are just one of Shantarams many problems. Novembers demonetisation hit the family hard and curtailed their access to cash. Then ready-to-harvest tomatoes were lost in a hailstorm in May, resulting in a loss of Rs 40,000. The family thereafter also lost one of its bullocks and the tilling of land in the new sowing season suffered a setback.The Waghchowres are the typical small Maharashtra farmer with three brothers and their families living off the five-acre field. But what separates them from the rest is their irrigated land, courtesy a well and a pipeline that brings water from the Kadwa river nearby. Not every Maharashtria farmer is as lucky, with only 18% of land tilled in the state being irrigated.Report card This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguish Soil quality No soil health card yet from the government Water source: Irrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyNote: This year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on time This is what a Maharashtra farmer got from his farm this year,SS a reason for his anguishIrrigated by a well and a direct pipeline from the river nearbyThis year has been good but in the past, they have faced problems in getting payments on timeShantaram and his two brothers feel that though life isnt exactly good, it could have been much worse without the land. Besides onions, they grow tomatoes, brinjals and sugarcane. Their field is normally lush green even at the height of summer. But that does not necessarily translate into a windfall as there are too many imponderables plaguing the farm sector, including unseasonal rains, pest attacks and price fluctuations.Shrinking profits and heightened unpredictability have put the family in a quandary. The money the brothers make is just enough to feed the family of 10, but inadequate to service their debts. A far bigger challenge at the moment for them is to get Dhanajis daughter Suvarna into a college.The girl has just passed Class 12, the first to do so in the family, but is facing an uncertain future.Where will a farmer get Rs 70,000 by the end of the year for college expenses? asked her mother Sunita. Despite bountiful production, hope is in short supply among farmers of Maharashtra.This is the second part of HTs series, #BeingaFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh."

Express Photo. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has expressed displeasure over rising corruption and kept it on its priority to rid the state from corruption. Express Photo.Take a tour of jail, get a glimpse of the life behind the bars and decide for yourself if you want to indulge in corruption. This is the message the Farrukhabad District Magistrate has for government officials to deter them from graft. District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar hit upon the novel idea and sent 576 government employees to the central jail in Farrukhabad to interact with inmates, including government officials who are living in confines of the prison.Recently I suspended six government officials as they were allegedly involved in corruption. In the entire process of taking action, a probe officer is appointed and again the possibility of corruption rises. The best way to curb corruption is to instill a sense of responsibility among the officials so that they themselves deter from corrupt practices, Kumar told PTI over the phone.About his concept of sending government officials on jail tourism, Kumar said there were 88 government employees from across the state lodged in the central jail, Farrukhabad.Jail tourism should act as a new mantra to deter corrupt officials, he said.I sent 576 government officials to visit jail yesterday so that they share the experience of inmates, including government servants. The objective is that they should know the experience of those behind bars and ultimately deter them not to indulge in corrupt practice which might invite similar fate for them, the district magistrate said.Among those who visited the jail included Lekhpals (revenue officers) dealing in land-related matters, ration shop owners, who deal with supply of food items, and panchyat officers, who deal with various schemes implemented at village level.Head of some departments also went inside the jail to feel the life there, he said, adding that following the state governments zero tolerance for corruption his aim was to check the menace.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed displeasure over rising corruption and kept it on its priority to rid the state from corruption.He had also raised question mark on functioning of the anti-corruption organisation (ACO) in the state while saying that it was time to restructure the body to make it more effective and result-oriented.The ACO deals with complaints of corruption related to the police force and non-gazetted ranks of other state government departments.There has been a number of arrests of government officials, including an ARTO (Assistant Road Transport Officer) in Chandauli, and a number of policemen have been caught taking bribe.The CM has also recommended probe into a number of schemes launched in previous Samajwadi Party regime during which corruption allegedly prevailed.The alleged scams in Shia and Sunni waqf boards and Gomti river front project are already under the scanner, while sale of sugar mills without following norms is also being probed by the Yogi Adityanath government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

People from across Karnataka and from other states flock here for cheaper fixes.BENGALURU: As the sun lays its first rays on KR Market, it is greeted by the fresh fragrance of the local phoolwalahs and the early morning calls of prayers for Ramadan.The festival has invited several makeshift stalls to the roadside near a mosque in the market. As the day progresses, one sees a group of elderly men accompanied by their younger assistants setting up self-styled dental stalls on the footpaths in the market.All stalls have banners sporting nationalist chants, pictures of national leaders along with before and after shots of customers who got their teeth fixed with them. For as less as `30, one can get a new tooth fixed here. With dental work at high-end clinics prohibitively expensive, people from across the state (particularly Huballi and Belagavi) and from outside it frequent these stalls for cheaper fixes.New tooth in minutesLocated right next to the mosque and under the KR Market flyover is Eijaz Pashas open-air clinic. Two neatly dressed men, with ironed cotton shirts and well-combed hair occupy the chairs at this clinic. Ignoring the traffic chaos and the noisy customers bargaining closeby at a fruit juice stall, Eijaz listens to the problems of his patients intently. We can fix a new tooth in five minutes, he tells Ramesh Joseph, 45.Everything Pasha knows about his trade is from Dr Usman. The doctor died seven years ago. He trained me for three years.Everything I do here is an imitation of what I saw and learnt at his Tumakuru clinic.He claims to use the same solution and materials that he saw at Dr Usmans clinic. So, if he follows the same dental procedures and uses the same pharmacuetical items as the doctor, how come a session with Pasha comes cheap? Is it because its set on a dusty table and a partly rusted iron chair? Wo paisa kharcha karkey dentist baney degree laakey, toh wo zyada letey. Mai bin paiso ka seekha, to mai kum leta (They spent money on their degree to learn dentistry, so they charge more. I learnt it without money, so I charge less), he reasons.Is he teaching his children the skills of his trade? No... I am earning to educate them, so that they become officers, he says.Proudly, Without DegreeSheikh Eijaz, 55 learnt to make and fix temporary teeth from a Malabari man, who had a dental stall like him at KR Market about 35 years ago. All these people who tell you that it is a khandani business are lying, he says.Eijaz says that he always informs his customers that he is WD Sheikh Eijaz. Without Degree, before the consultation. To be fair, his banner too has the WD placed prominently in capital letters.Once he is done taking the customers measurement for a tooth, he claims he makes it by the time his client finishes drinking the tea.He says there are many practitioners like him that he has met in Delhi, Kolkata and Jaipur. Then there are some ten tests they make you do for one tooth at government hospitals. They will say check sugar, stand in queue, so the poor are scared to go there, says Eijaz.In his over 40-year-long career of working from the same location in KR Market, Eijaz claims he has never had a customer come back with a complaint. There are around 40 men like him who have set up stalls in the city. Everything I have today is because of this profession, he says."

The FIR was filed by an executive engineer of Sharda Project at Gomti Nagar police station for misappropriation of funds and other financial anomalies,"" Circle Officer of Gomti Nagar, Satyasen, told PTI today.He said the officials against whom FIRs were lodged, were posted as chief engineers and superintendent engineers.""Case has been lodged under various sections of the IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act for committing financial anomalies and misappropriation of funds,"" Satyasen said.SHO Gomti Nagar Sujit Dubey said the officials against whom FIR has been lodged will be arrested soon.""We are collecting evidences against them,"" he added.Yesterday, while speaking to PTI, UP minister of state for urban development Girish Kumar Yadav had said, ""A few days back, the probe report was submitted to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. As far as CBI probe is concerned, all necessary steps will be taken and appropriate action will be initiated.""""If there is any need to lodge an FIR, the government will not hesitate in doing so. None of the guilty persons will be able to escape the clutches of law and stringent action will be taken against them,"" Yadav had said.The river front has witnessed a political showdown between the erstwhile Samajwadi Party regime in the state and the present Adityanath government.It had become a major issue during the recent Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.On April 1 the chief minister had ordered an inquiry by a retired High Court judge into the project. He had instructed chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar to constitute a committee and also directed for submission of the report within 45 days.Adityanath had also directed the urban development minister and the irrigation minister Dharmpal Singh to monitor the development work at the Gomti river front.During the meeting, officials had told the chief minister that of the total allocation of Rs 1,513 crore, 95 per cent of the budget, which comes to around Rs 1,435 crore had already been spent, while only 60 per cent of the work could be completed.Adityanath had directed the officials to ensure that no effluent should flow in Gomti river and ordered expeditious diversion of drains releasing effluents and polluted water in it.He had remarked that till the time the river water becomes pollution-free, its beautification would hold no meaning.He had also expressed his unhappiness that the river water was so much polluted that it was very difficult to even stand at the river front and said, ""In such a scenario, a fountain on Gomti river was useless.""Gomti river, meandering through the 940-kilometre stretch of rich alluvial plains of Uttar Pradesh, is polluted by industrial effluents and domestic discharge.The river becomes more of a flowing dumping yard for the 15 smaller and bigger towns, including Lakhimpur Kheri, Sitapur, Lucknow, Sultanpur and Jaunpur, in its catchment area.The major sources of pollution in the Gomti are industrial waste from sugar factories and distilleries and sewage from habitations."

(Express Photo)Out of the total budget of Rs 1,18,237.90 crore, the effective budget size would be Rs 90,737 crore, excluding the budget provision of Rs 27,500 crore towards ways and means transactions during the current year. The total receipts are likely to be Rs 1,05,514.84 crore with states own tax revenue expected to be Rs 39,526 crore. Its non-tax revenue is proposed to be Rs 3,224 crore, share of central taxes at Rs 10,650 crore. The state expects grants-in-aid from the Centre to be worth Rs 6,678 crore. The states salary bill has been listed out to be Rs 20,872 crore while pensions and retiral benefits will touch Rs 10,147 crore. Salaries consume the lions share of the states revenues and have been a cause of concern for the respective governments.The government faces the daunting challenge of fulfilling its promises to the people of Punjab under extreme budgetary pressures. In the first year, our focus will be two-fold: to gradually reduce the crushing burden of debt and restore its fiscal health while at the same time taking immediate measures to ensure efficient use of resources already allocated by minimising waste and improving accountability, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal said while the budget. Revenue expenditure has increased to Rs 62,733.81 crore in 2016-17, from Rs 18,544 crore in 2006-07, a jump of 238 per cent, the minister said.During the same period, expenditure on salaries rose to Rs 19,800 crore from Rs 5,783 crore, pension to Rs 8,140 crore from Rs 1,905 crore and interest to Rs 11,982 crore from Rs 4,152 crore. Pre-poll promises, kept or notIn the budget the government, besides the loan waiver, raised the old age monthly pension by Rs 250. The pension would now be Rs 750 per month. The government had promised to raise it to Rs 2,000 but the FM said he is hugely constrained by fiscal stress of the state.The acid attack victims will be getting a pension of Rs 8,000 per month, the shagun scheme has been raised from Rs 15,000 to Rs 21,000. Rs 10 crore has been set aside for providing cell phones to youth as was promised. The FM said the state may not need to spend the money as a global tender may ensure a private company to provide the smart phones free of cost. An amount of Rs 91 crore has been kept aside for employment generation as the government has promised to ensure one lakh youths get employment avenues through its Apni Gaddi Apna Rozgar Scheme, Yaaro Enterprises and Hara Tractor Schemes. The government has not be able to fulfill its promise of providing Rs 2500 unemployment allowance. The government has also set aside Rs 500 crore for sugar and tea leaves alongwith the atta-dal scheme.

The Congress tried to meet its major poll promises halfway in its maiden budget presented on Tuesday.The partys poll manifesto had promised to double pensions Rs 1,000, shagun amount to Rs 31,000 and complete loan waiver for farmers. This when the white the paper presented by finance minister Manpreet Badal on Monday projected states growth rate for 2016-17 below the national average at 5.9%, tax growth 10% below target last year and the debt over 400% of the revenue receipts for this year.As the state of finances continue to be grim, Manpreets choices may not have changed much since 2010, when he had rebelled against his family and party, Shiromani Akali Dal, questioning free power to farmers as the finance minister.SCHEMES NAMED AFTER BHAGAT SINGH Manpreet named the job schemes for youth after his idol, Shaheed Bhagat Singh. Ola and Uber cabs for youth will come under Shaheed Bhagat Singh Rozgar Srijan Yojana, so will tractors and assistance to set up their own enterprises.But as the Congress FM, he chose good politics over good economics, populism over prudence. Having set the tone for austerity in its first three months in power, the governments first budget also did not give a direction on how the government would curb expenses or generate more revenue.But it did give an indication of the road the finance minister intends to take in the coming budgets  he staggered the funds for poll promises, deferred expenditure on some and wants us to believe that the new government will not cook the books like its predecessor.NO SURPRISESAnd if there were no surprises in the maiden budget of the Congress government in Punjab, Manpreet is not complaining. While concluding the debate on motion of thanks on the governors address on Monday, Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh almost revealed the most-anticipated part of the budget coming the next day  the poll doles from the government kitty.With opposition Shiromani Akali Dal using the poll promise of farm debt waiver as its main ammunition against the government, the CM announced not just the debt waiver but also smartphones for youth leaving Manpreet to just fill in the blanks in terms of the figures  Rs 12,500 for debt waiver and Rs 10 crore for smartphones.Also, going by the precedent, the CM is present as his government presents its budget. But Amarinder gave it a miss. A much-mellowed Manpreet was quick to offer an explanation. The CM was not well. And the big announcements such as loan waiver should have been made by the CM. He is the leader of the party and the people voted for him, Manpreet said. Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar too said since loan waiver was a personal promise of the CM, it was only befitting that he announced it. This proves he is a man of his word, Jakhar said.However, many in Congress believe the CM could have been brief in his address, without going into the details. The two-hour speech just before the budget day was not needed. It left little sanctity for the budget, which is a privileged document till the FM unfolds it, a senior Congress MLA said. But sources close to the CM said he delivered a speech on his governments intent and actions as the partys strategy is to be on the offensive against a divided opposition and avert any debate on the controversial sand mining auctions.There were no surprises in the budget even on the fiscal indicators. The white paper released on Monday almost said it all."

The Centre has failed to listen to us and discontinued the distribution of sugar from the programme (NFSA). But we have decided to work out the modalities from our own resources to continue providing sugar apart from rice, he said while addressing at a public meeting here.Though we will not be able to provide 3 kg per household, we will continue to give sugar at 1 kg per household from the states own resources, he said. Meghalaya is the only state in the country to provide 3 kg packaged sugar under the National Food Security programme, but the distribution of sugar has been recently withdrawn by the Central Government.The Chief Minister also distributed certificates of appreciation to wholesalers and fair price shop dealers here as a token of the state governments appreciation for their contribution in successfully implementing the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. The state government has been able to address the challenges of implementation of the Act in terms of distribution through the active support and partnership of different stakeholders, particularly the wholesalers and fair price shop dealers, he said.According to the Chief Minister, the programme is a mark of acknowledgement by the government for their hard work and all the hardship they have to undergo in lifting, handling and transporting the commodities to make them reach to the beneficiaries.Terming the National Food Security Mission as the biggest Food Security Programme in the world, the Chief Minister said it is a commitment of the Government designed for the needy which has been mandated by a law which is binding on the authorities to take care of the citizens.The Chief Minister also motivated the wholesalers and dealers telling them that they should consider the service as a social service and not as an enterprise but to learn from it and expand their horizon to building successful business models to enhance their livelihood.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

And it has forced 7.8 million people across the whole of Ethiopia to rely on emergency food handouts to stay alive.But by next month, that food will have run out, aid agencies say.Droughts are common in Ethiopia, and in past years the government and international community have mounted impressive efforts to curb starvation.This year though, Africa's second most-populous country is struggling to find the money for food aid, say aid agencies.""We're looking at the food pipeline actually breaking, so the food is running out in about a month's time,"" said John Graham, country director for Save the Children. ""After that, we don't know what's going to happen.""Distracted donorsOnce a global byword for starvation and poverty after a famine in 1984-85 killed hundreds of thousands, Ethiopia has seen its economy grow rapidly in the last decade. Health indicators such as infant mortality and malaria deaths have also improved.A stronger economy allowed Ethiopia to spend an impressive $766 million (683 million euros) fighting one of its worst droughts in decades in 2015-16.This year however, things are different.Economic growth has slowed, due in part to protests spurred by long-simmering grievances against Ethiopia's one-party state.Donors have also been distracted by other regional crises.To the southeast, Somalia is suffering from severe drought, with warnings it could tip into famine.Ethiopias western neighbour, South Sudan, has suffered four months of famine, and extreme hunger is at its highest levels ever after more than three years of civil war.Ethiopia by contrast has a strong central government and is relatively free from conflict.But with the situation so desperate in the region, donors aren't responding to the country's emergency as they have in the past, said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia's National Disaster Risk Management Commission, Mitiku Kassa.""They are stressed with the needs, especially from those countries which (have) declared famine,"" Mitiku said. ""That is why it is underfunded.""Skipping meals is commonEven though Ethiopia has contributed $117 million of its own money this year and the international community $302 million, a funding gap of $481 million remains, according to the United Nations.In the drought ravaged town of Warder, the hundreds of displaced families crowding a ramshackle camp say handouts of rice and sugar are becoming less frequent.""Skipping meals is common,"" said Halimo Halim, a grandmother living with her children in a shelter made of sticks and pieces of plastic. ""Skipping is the order of the day.""Families of nomadic herders such as Halimo's are central to the economy of Ethiopia's southeastern Somali region.The drought has deprived goats, sheep and donkeys of water, killing them or making them so weak that by the time the rains come they perish in the cold.Around 465,000 people who have lost their livestock have migrated to an estimated 250 camps in the region.The settlements are often located near water sources, but that presents its own problems.In Warder, workers are present around the clock at nearby wells to make sure people drawing water chlorinate it before they drink it, lest they contract ""acute watery diarrhoea"", which has broken out in the region.Some aid workers say this is actually cholera, which Ethiopia has long been accused of covering up to protect its image.Paying the billAid agencies have turned to so-called ""non-traditional"" donors like the Gulf countries for funding.At the same time they are keeping a nervous eye on budget negotiations in top funder the United States, where President Donald Trump has proposed slashing the aid budget.But some humanitarians privately complain that the Ethiopian government isn't doing enough to call attention to its plight.They argue that Addis Ababa does not want to distract from its development gains or resurrect the old image of Ethiopia as a place of mass starvation.""There is no shortage of funds to combat drought,"" communications minister Negeri Lencho insisted earlier this month.If the international community doesn't send more money, Mitiku said the government would be ""forced"" to tap its development budget for drought relief in July.But with a lead time of about four months required to procure emergency food, the UN says that may be too late.In Warder, those uprooted by drought, like Sanara Ahmed, are wondering how long they can survive on unreliable food handouts.""Some support was there, but it cannot substitute for our dependability on our livelihood,"" Sanara said."

Its a treatable medical condition but, lack of awareness leads to misconceptions about the problem.CHENNAI: Urinary incontinence is a silent struggle for many in the world. Though there are no hard statistics, doctors say that at least one in three women over 50 suffer from incontinence once in their lifetime, and this increases to one in two among those above 60.SeverityThe severity of the disease ranges from urine leakage with even the slightest cough or sneeze to a sudden uncontrollable urge to urinate every hour, which leads to leakage. This condition may be caused by a weakened pelvic floor, the main support to the bladder, due to overweight, pregnancy, chronic cough and asthma etc. Other causes include neurological diseases, long-standing bladder habits, repetitive urinary tract infections, kidney stones, previous surgeries, or unhealthy lifestyle habits  excess intake of caffeine, tea. Incontinence is prevalent more among women than men. As women age, their pelvic floor muscles weaken because of pregnancy and delivery. Men have less risk factor due to a stronger pelvic floor and a longer urethra but may develop incontinence as a result of a surgery.Quality of lifeThough not a threatening condition, urinary incontinence can be severely damaging to ones quality of life. Simple tasks like going to a movie or travelling can be very difficult due to inaccessibility to restrooms. It was very difficult for me to even go out because there may be no restrooms there. So I just stayed home and waited for it to get better, recalls Uma, 58, a homemaker. The fear of wetting oneself, and the loss of quality sleep due to frequent urges to urinate make life uncomfortable for many. The embarrassment and stigma associated with this condition has forced many women to not seek treatment, while some believe that this is an inevitable issue of ageing and treatment may not help.In India, women are not very frank about their incontinence. When I meet patients, they are uncomfortable to explain their issue and I have to prod them to speak about it, says Dr Nivedita, urologist, SIMS Hospital, adding that the need of the hour is for people to know they are not alone, and that easy treatment can give permanent cure. It can take a while to decide the kind of treatment you need but it is certainly treatable. On an average, the patient gets better over three-six months, she explains.TreatmentOf foremost importance is to change your lifestyle. Reducing weight and thereby your sugar levels, taking the right meds for blood pressure, avoiding coffee, tea and fizzy drinks , etc can help treatment, advises Dr Meera Ragavan, urogynaecologist, Apollo Hospitals. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) by a trained physiotherapist will focus on re-training the muscles to contract better, to regain muscle tone and maintain pelvic floor integrity. Bio feedback is used to measure progress and motivate the patients.Some people go every 30 minutes to empty their bladder to prevent leakage which causes the bladder to become even more active and habituated to emptying within that time period. So we advise behavioural therapy, where they are trained to empty the bladder at intervals of three-four hours, explains Dr Meera. Most women will also be on other medications for diabetes, blood pressure, etc. So these medications have to be tailored accordingly to avoid medicinal interaction. Thats why, going to a qualified urologist or uro-gynaecolgist is important.BotoxIn cases where medical treatment is not sufficient, like a resistive overactive bladder or elders with neurological diseases like Parkinsons where medications cannot be given, there are second-line management treatments. Botulinum injections, better known as Botox, are administered through an endoscope to the bladder muscles to prevent hyper reacting. There are also tapes that act as a scaffold to strengthen the pelvic floor to prevent leakage during cough, exercise sneezing or laughing, which offer very good cure rate.TypesUrge incontinence: Where there is a sudden uncontrollable sense of urgency, sometimes accompanied by pain and increased frequencyStressincontinence: Involuntary urination due to abdominal strain, weight gain/obesity, pregnancy, tumour, or excessive cough, sneezing,and laughing"

I think we are quite sorted after that meeting, Fadnavis told HT.Fadnavis indication was that the new understanding with the Sena goes beyond presidential polls, and would last until the end of his governments term.Sources in the BJP told HT that Shah had told Sena that after BJPs compromise in handing out the mayors post to the party after Mumbai civic polls , more support was expected from the ally. And, a decision to not back the BJP in presidential polls just for the sake of opposition, would be seen as the last straw for the alliance.Read: Why is BJP tolerating Shiv Sena?What has settled the diatribe for now is that both alliance partners are not keen on mid term or early polls.As such, in the meeting, it was decided not to stretch things to a point of no return.Meanwhile, in the backdrop of the ongoing farmers protests and the BJPs perceived bias against the co-operative sector, Fadnavis said that his party would continue to root out corruption in the sector, but was supportive of the co-operative movement and network as a whole.In the last two years we have only tried to clean up the co-operative sector. We believe the sector is there to stay and is very important to Maharashtra. However, we will focus on stringent laws to keep check on the scams in the co-operative sector. Our laws have withstood legal scrutiny, said Fadnavis.The BJP-led governments approach towards the co-operative sector, whether it is sugar mills or banks, is being questioned by political opponents. Congress and NCP dominate the co-operative network of sugar mills and banks in the state.However, the state government managed a turnaround on Wednesday by getting the Reserve Bank of India to accept scrapped notes deposited in these banks worth Rs 2,772 crore.This is a significant decision.Unfortunately, due to corruption, our co-operative banks started losing their relevance. There are scams in 16 co-operative banks, all under the tenure of the former government. The problem is that penetration of co-operative banks is high in Maharashtra, and it will take nationalised banks at least three to four years to set up their network. So, if co-op banks are not there, in certain areas we will have no institutional banking facilities, said Fadnavis.They destroyed the banks, we are trying to rejuvenate them. I feel that these institutions have always helped farmers and by destroying them (the former government) has done great injustice to farmer."

Last year, we sold 151 and earned Rs 2.29 crore. The demand increases during winters and the festive season such as Diwali when car sales also peak, said KK Dahiya, the citys special commissioner of transport.A Bond-style 0007 and a 0009 are equally preferred. The highest for 0007 was Rs 10.40 lakh in 2015 and Rs 8.50 lakh for 0009 the previous year.These tier-two numbers were bought this year for Rs 4.10 lakh and Rs 3.90 lakh.The base auction price for 0001 is Rs 5 lakh, while those from 0002 to 0009 start at Rs 3 lakh. In the third category, bids for numbers such as 0786, popular among Muslims as a talisman, start at Rs 2 lakh.Officials said the demand for fancy figures on number plates, popular as VIP numbers, has increased over the years, especially after the auction was made fully online from application to payment.Most buyers are companies  like the one that bought the 0001. The second top bidder was a sugar company. Only nine 0001 numbers have been bought by individuals since 2014, Dahiya said.The Delhi government began the auction in 2014 to increase revenues. Earlier the allotment of such numbers was purely discretionary.The number one, the starting digit, is the most fancied for varied reasons. But the craze stems from the numerological perspective, which gives the number an elevated spiritual symbolism.For many people, it gives the sense of being No 1 and flaunting it too.In 2010, Chandigarhs Narinder Singh Shergill splurged Rs 10 lakh, half the price of his Toyota Fortuner, to become the proud owner of a 0001 number plate. His wife got angry, but he has no regrets.The farmer was flush with money  a Rs2-crore compensation for land the government acquired to expand a national highway."

Empirical evidence also suggests that weakened credit discipline from repeated waivers creates disincentives for further lending by banks.The seeds of loan waiver sown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the form of a promise made during the UP assembly elections, have now turned into a full-grown tree spreading its roots across states. What began with the UP governments announcement in April, followed by Maharashtra, yet another BJP-ruled state, has now been emulated by Punjab and Karnataka where the Congress is in power. The loan waiver amounts vary from Rs 50,000 in Karnataka to Rs one lakh each in UP and Maharashtra, and up to Rs 2 lakh in Punjab. While the UP and Punjab schemes target those with less than five acres holding, the Karnataka and Maharashtra waivers seem to extend to all farmers, albeit restricted only to loans taken from cooperative banks. Either way, given the sheer number of potential beneficiaries, the fiscal costs  for the four states alone, the currently estimated burden is over Rs 85,000 crore  are going to be huge. And these will only mount, as the fever spreads and more states join the bandwagon.Its true that the farming community has gone through a harrowing time, whether due to adverse weather events in 2014-15 and 2015-16 or the more recent price crash across agri-commodities following demonetisation. If at all there is anybody deserving of special support today, it is certainly farmers. Putting the rural economy back on the rails is, moreover, in everybodys interest. But are loan waivers the right way to go about that? To the extent that they impose fiscal costs, these schemes also entail diversion of public resources that could have gone to build rural roads, hospitals, schools and irrigation works. Empirical evidence also suggests that weakened credit discipline from repeated waivers creates disincentives for further lending by banks. The ultimate sufferers from both  less public investment in rural infrastructure and reduced agricultural lending  would be farmers themselves.A loan write-off would be worth it if it specifically targets farmers who have fallen out of the institutional credit system. These farmers, and also those who have always been dependent on borrowing from local moneylenders and traders, have every right to be able to access formal finance that makes them more productive. But farmers would be better helped if they are allowed to realise remunerative prices for their produce. Why is the Modi government still persisting with restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and export of pulses, edible oils or sugar  when none of these exist for steel or software? There is also a case for reviewing import duties on most agricultural commodities; currently, these are way below the rates that India has bound with the World Trade Organisation. Better price realisations, not blanket waivers, is what farmers really require today.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Soon, farmer welfare activities will come under a single umbrella. In this regard, the state government will constitute a Farmers Welfare Board this year.Agriculture Minister V S Sunil Kumar told Express the Government had already taken a decision in principle and an Ordinance will be issued soon. The modalities on the functioning of the board have to be worked out, he said. Once it comes into existence, all welfare measures like farmers pension can be implemented through the board.To ensure their welfare, farmers pension was raised from Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 from June 1, 2016. As all other welfare pensions being implemented have been unified at Rs 1,100, farmers pension will also be increased, the minister said.Social auditing from this yearThe minister said the Agriculture Department will introduce social audits this year to bring in more transparency.Sunil Kumar said the government is planning to revive the Neera production unit at Aralam farm under the Kerala State Coconut Development Corporation. With technical support from the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, sugar and jaggery will be produced from Neera. Steps have been initiated in this regard to provide employment to the workers and their family members at the farm, he said.The government is also focusing on reviving coconut farming, the minister said. As part of supporting farmers, 36,900 tonnes of coconut worth `92 crore were procured.Vigilance squad to keep tabs on banned pesticidesThe department has set up special vigilance squads to curb smuggling of banned pesticides from neighbouring states. As much as 2.5 tonnes of toxic contraband, including Carbofuran, were seized, the minister said."

The authority had opened a 2.8km stretch of the elevated road to streamline traffic movement in October 2016.The Noida authority officials are busy in preparations ahead of the ministers visit, who will also review the progress of other under-construction infrastructure projects. Suresh Rana, minister of state (independent), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development is also likely to accompany Mahana, officials said.We have completed the major construction work on the elevated road. We are giving it finishing touches and will ensure that the elevated road is ready before June 28, SC Mishra, project engineer of the Noida authority and in-charge of the elevated road project, said.The authority is planning to organise an event at an open venue such as the Noida Stadium for the minister to address the public.Work on the road was started on October 14, 2014. Initially, the project was scheduled to be completed by October 2017. However, the authority officials were directed by the Samajwadi Party government to complete it by 2016, in advance of the assembly elections. But the work got delayed because the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned the use of hot mix plants, which were necessary to prepare construction material for the elevated road.We could resume construction of the elevated road only after NGT on May 8, 2017, temporarily lifted the ban on hot mix plants. Work was delayed due to the NGT order, but we have finally completed the project, a Noida authority official said.Due to the construction work over Master Plan-2 Road, motorists have been facing snarls due to the project. Also, residents of colonies situated along the elevated road have been complaining of pollution caused by dust from the construction activity.Residents will not face any problems and motorists can enjoy a smooth ride. The issues of dust and air pollution on this route have already been addressed with patchwork on the road under the elevated stretch. Commuters should look forward to a hassle-free 5-kilometre ride, the official said."

Gurmukh Singh, 44, is one of better-to-do farmers of Pandrali, a quiet, well-groomed village in Fatehgarh Sahib district with several newly-built houses, smooth streets and girls on scooters. Its a picture that could well be captioned prosperous Punjab. But the genteel faade hides the struggles of the states farming community.I am a farmer, have never done anything else, but its not sustainable any longer, Gurmukh clears his throat. A former village head, he is clearly uneasy about sharing his troubles with strangers. The price of potato, the crop he grew on part of the land hes leased, has crashed. It means more debt for he has to pay a rent of Rs 40,000 for an acre though his potato crop has fetched him only Rs 25,000. This is what happens when you diversify, he fumes.This week, the Punjab government announced a waiver of crop loans up to Rs 2 lakh for small and marginal farmers (up to five acres). Gurmukh is relieved that he falls in this bracket but wishes the government had announced a complete loan waiver. I know the state has limited funds, but the Centre should rescue farmers, he opines.Like most farmers in the state, this matriculate grows wheat and paddy, the two crops with a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP). Paddy has leached the land of water leading to fears of desertificationthe water table at Pandrali has breached 70 feet, and is falling at the rate of three feet a yearyet farmers refuse to grow other crops. I have tried turmeric, sugarcane, maize and vegetables, but marketing is a problem. The sugarcane mills dont pay us for months and prices of other crops are erratic, explains Gurmukh.RISING COST OF PRODUCTIONBut now even the MSP of the two main crops, he rues, is becoming unviable due to the spiralling cost of inputs. Its simple maths. In 1992, says Gurmukh, diesel cost Rs 4-5 a litre, a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) Rs 200, while wheat cost Rs 5 a kilo. Now while diesel is pegged at Rs 58 a litre and DAP is 1100 for a sack, but wheat has failed to keep pace at Rs 16 a kilo. Add to it the cost of boring tubewells every year due to the dipping water level, the steeply priced pesticides scarcely used in the past, and the cost of labour from UP and Bihar in the absence of local helping hands, says Gurmukh, explaining the high cost of production. A bore costs anywhere between Rs 10,000 and 1 lakh.Watch | Farmers have to borrow money to farmGroundwater irrigates over 73% of land in the state. This has led to a sharp decline in the water table. According to the Central Ground Water Board, of the 138 administrative blocks in Punjab, 110 blocks are overexploited, four are critical and two are semi-critical. Only 22 blocks are safe, but they have other problems such as arsenic, fluoride and uranium contamination.One reason for the indiscriminate use of groundwater is free electricity for farmers introduced in 1999. Also, the Punjab government hasnt placed any restriction on the depth of tubewells. Nor does one need any permission to dig up a well.Inadequate rainfall in the last few years is only increasing the general dependence on groundwater. The year 2014 was very rough on us, so was 2015, recounts Gurmukh. In 2015, Punjab received only 50% of the monsoon rainfall, and the next year it was 36%.Little wonder then that any mention of digging up Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal to provide water to Haryana raises hackles. The Bhakra canal flows 1.5 km from here; the Sirhind feeder and Narwana branch are also close but all the water flows to Haryana and Rajasthan, gripes a friend of Gurmukh.Haryana, he claims, also has the job advantage as it borders both Chandigarh and Delhi. They have benefited from industrialisation and the Gurgaon boom, says Gurmukh, adding how a working man drawing a salary of 35,000 a month is better off than a farmer who owns 10 acres.Haryana also offers a better market price for alternative crops such as sunflower. It fetches Rs 25,000 per quintal in Punjab while in Haryana it gets Rs 35,000, says Gurmukh.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The crop prices show no signs of increasing but land rental rates are going through the roof and range between 40,000 and 45,000 an acre in the district. With farming becoming unviable, more and more small farmers are leasing out their land instead of toiling on it. These landlords seek a rise of 10% every year regardless of any natural calamity or price crash, grouses Gurmukh. He recalls 2015 when he was forced to sell his export-grade Basmati (PB 1509) to the Food Corporation of India after the prices crashed from Rs 4,500 a quintal in 2014 to 1700 in 2015.Ask Gurmukh why he takes so much land on lease, and he points to his machinery. I have a tractor, a seed sower, a land leveler, a roller et al. I need land to make the most of them. Also, there is the lure of a good crop and the pressure of repaying the debt.Demonetisation dealt a heavy blow to Gurmukh who wanted to repay a crop loan. I had just sold my crop and deposited two lakh in my bank but I could only withdraw 5,000 a week. Somehow the little sums of money I took out were spent elsewhere while the interest on my loan piled up.Gurmukh Singh with daughter Gurpreet Kaur and wife Ranjeet Kaur in his House in Pandriali village in Sirhind district, Punjab. (Ravi Kumar/HT Photo)THE DEBT TRAPIn 2007, Gurmukh took a loan of Rs 5 lakh to build his house. While the house loan was from a bank, most of his other loans are from commission agents (arhtiya or the middlemen) who charge a higher rate of interest than banks. But Gurmukh appears resigned to working with them. Here is the reason: In Punjab, a farmer cannot sell his produce in the open market at the prevailing price. He can only sell it to commission agents under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act, 1961. A few days back, the Congress government passed an amendment to the act, allowing private players to set up mandis to purchase farm produce. But Gurmukh is yet to learn about it.As of now, the middleman also doubles up as a dealer of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers. So farmers not only sell their produce to him, but also purchase their inputs from him, often on credit.Milked dry Farmers in the grain bowl of the country, Punjab, are a distressed lot Rs 69,335 crore Rural debt Rs 5.5 lakh Per capita rural household debt 98% Area under irrigation 110 out of 138 blocks are water dark zones (water table dangerously low) 1.6% Rate of agri growth in Punjab from 2004-05 to 2014-15 1.5% Punjabs share of Indias total area FARMER SUICIDES6,926 No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*1,309 Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016Despite being a farmers daughter and wife, Ranjeet doesnt think highly of farming. No one values the farmer, she says.The couples only offspring, Gurpreet, who is doing post-graduation in English from a college in Fatehgarh Sahib, is now looking forward to a bank tellers course. The young woman, who stitches her clothes herself, may not be sure about her career path, but she is clear that her husband will not be a farmer. No way, she declares. Its too risky. No matter how hard you work, there is no guarantee of profit.Youngsters in the village, she claims, want to either get a job or go abroad. Farming is an option only for the uneducated.Jagtar Singh, Gurmukhs man Friday who works on his land for Rs 1 lakh a year, agrees. In farming, you throw money for six months and then dont know whether you will get it back or not. A salaried job is better.The only person who appears contented in the fields is Harendra Kumar from Motihari district in Bihar, who is here with his team of 10 labourers. We will sow paddy, he explains as he arranges ladoos for a pooja before they begin work. He explains, We pray for a bumper crop, our wellbeing and that of sardar ji.Amen to that."

But now that such products are available, locals will be made aware of them for conserving the environment through their use, Rawat told Hindustan Times.Disposables are widely used at religious places also, so their representatives will be sensitised. We will run this as an awareness campaign for a month, after which we are planning to make it compulsory, he said, adding that plastic products lead to environment pollution, choked drains and loss of fertility of agricultural fields.The initial cost of biodegradable items may be a little higher than the plastic disposables, but they are totally eco-friendly and cost-effective in the long run, said Dehradun-based activist Sujata Paul Maliah who is into distributorship of a similar range of products.They will also help in reducing the damage done to environment by plastic-based disposables, said Maliah, who was present at the meeting."

Cabinet Minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said the challenges existing before the government will be highlighted in the white paper.The scarcity of funds in the state exchequer after BJP came to power, poor condition of different departments and failures of the previous government in improving condition of the state will be highlighted in the white paper, a government official said. Since assuming office on March 19, the BJP government has already got a judicial probe conducted in the Gomti riverfront project, developed when Adityanaths predecessor Akhilesh Yadavs uncle, Shivpal Singh Yadav, was the state Irrigation minister.The state government has recently lodged an FIR in Lucknow against eight engineers in connection with the alleged scam, and sources said the probe may be handed over to the CBI in near future. Adityanath himself had inspected the riverfront project site in March and had expressed dissatisfaction when informed that 95 per cent of the Rs 1,513-crore project was utiltised but less than 65 per cent work had been completed. After officers presented a revised project cost of Rs 2,448 crore, Adityanath had sought a review of the necessity of remaining works, removal of unnecessary works, and quick completion. The government has also ordered inquiry in Alpsankhyak Samudaayaon ke Kabristaanon/Anteyshti Sthal ki Bhoomi ki Suraksha Yojana (scheme to build boundary walls around burial grounds to guard against encroachments).Approximately Rs 1,300 crore was spent across the state during the last five years in building boundary walls around Muslim graveyards. The scheme was implemented under supervision of Azam Khan, who was the minister concerned. The government has constituted a three-member committee to probe this. Following Adityanaths directive, another inquiry has been started in Janeshwar Mishra Park, Jai Prakash Narayan International Centre and beautification of Hussainabad area in the heritage zone of Lucknows old city area  all developed under direct supervision of Akhilesh, who handled the Housing portfolio.The process of awarding tenders in these projects would also be inquired. On April 11, Adityanath had ordered a stop on implementation of Samajwadi Pension Scheme, a flagship public welfare scheme of the previous government. Adityanath had ordered a probe on whether existing beneficiaries were eligible for the pension scheme, as also the eligibility criterion laid down for selection of beneficiaries.The government has stopped monthly pension of Rs 50,000 to recipients of Yash Bharti award and Padma awards from UP from March, and, in a review meeting of the Culture department on April 21, had ordered a thorough review of the awards, instituted by the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in 1994. The government has asked officers to look into the criteria of selecting the award winners. The BSP government under Mayawati stopped the scheme in 2007 but the Akhilesh administration revived it. It also raised the cash prize to Rs 11 lakh, and in 2015 decided to give a monthly pension of Rs 50,000 on demand.Adityanath has also expressed dissatisfaction on quality of infrastructure development works under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), and asked for a committee under Urban Development Minister Suresh Khanna to probe the works executed by Jal Nigam. The government ordered inquiry into sale of 21 UP sugar mills in 2010-11 on suspicion that it involved a scam of approximately Rs 1,100 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This trend needs to be addressed urgently and taken seriously by all sections of society, he said.Speaking at the seminar project director of Nagaland State AIDS Control Society, Dr Nganshimeren said the problem of drug trafficking needs to be tackled on two fronts by reducing the supply chain by the law enforcement agencies and also to reduce the social demand of the abusive drugs by creating awareness about the ill effects of drug abuse among the population both at government and NGO levels.Director of Kripa Foundation, Abou Mere urged the state government to put into the force the Nagaland State Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Policy 2016. Dr Niekiesalie Nicky Kire, MLA in his address suggested that all the legislators need to be briefed about the menace of drug abuse and support from the government towards establishment of detox and drug treatment centres in all the districts of the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

According to it, 17.3 in one lakh children in Karnataka are affected.Incidence of Type-1 diabetes was very low earlier, but it is rising now. New cases of the disease are coming up, said Dr M A Shekhar, director, Karnataka Institute of Endocrinology and Research.More frequentThe doctor added, I used to see Type-1 diabetes once in three months earlier, but now, I see it every other day. That itself is an eyeball assessment of the alarming rise.Dr Paramesh Shamanna, director of Bangalore Diabetes Centre said there a rise in Type-2 diabetes (blood sugar levels) too among children.Type-1 diabetes is a kind of diabetes that is mostly diagnosed in children up to the age of 15 where the body does not produce insulin, while Type-2 diabetes is a condition in adults where the body produces insulin but not in sufficient quantity for the body.Type-2 diabetes can be cured by change in lifestyle and food habits, while Type-1 diabetes can be controlled only by injecting insulin two to four times a day, saidDr Manjunath Malige, consultant endocrinologist and diabetologist.According to doctors, Type-1 diabetes, which affects children, is predominantly due to viral infections that develop antibodies that are capable of destroying cells. This type of diabetes affects children also due to reduced breast feeding when the child is born and exposure to cows milk which can produce antibodies that react with insulin. The incidence of such diabetes can be brought down to a certain extent if infections affecting children can be curbed. Doctors say that pollution is a reason for infection.The psychological trauma the child and its parents have to go through is massive during treatment. A six-year-old, affected by the disease, cannot take insulin on its own, said Dr Shekhar.Experts say the symptoms of Type-1 diabetes are excessive thirst, excess passage of urine and weight loss in children.According to experts, if Type-1 diabetes is not controlled, the patient might have multiple organ failure including kidney dysfunction.Parents and teachers should be educated on how to manage Type-1 diabetes, doctors say."

Though Shoria tries to follow tradition, Eid in exile is just another day for this Rohingya Muslim family in south Delhis Madanpur Khadar locality.Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state of Myanmar are the most persecuted minority in the world, according to the United Nations. Alleged ethnic cleansing by the majority Buddhist community in the neighbouring country has forced over 11 lakh Rohingyas to take refuge in different parts of the world. Of these, about 14,000 Rohingya Muslims are in India.In the national capital Delhi, Sabeer is one of nearly 900 Rohingya refugees in camps in Shaheen Bagh, Madanpur Khadar, Okhla and Vikaspuri. While some work as ragpickers and sweepers, others find small time jobs in NGOs and private offices.They fast but do not feast. How can we celebrate Eid when our family members and relatives are living in such danger? asks Sabeer. Sabeer fled to India in 2004 and has not been home since. He met his wife Shoria, also a Rohingya, at a refugee camp in New Delhi. Every day during the month of Ramzan and every Eid, Sabeer offers prayers at the Eidgah nearby. But there is no sumptuous meal waiting him after the stringent daylong fast.His neighbour Jaffar, another Rohingya who escaped violent clashes in 2011 in Rakhine, is in no mood to celebrate either. But its not just yearning for his homeland. He is traumatised by news from home that his nephew was stabbed last week after being accused of using a mobile phone to provide information to foreign agents.Living in India is safer but uncertainty looms large. They fear they can be deported anytime. We meet and greet people. We distribute sevian to each other but at the end of the day we are refugees, and it is very disturbing, says Jaffer.According to Ali Johar, a member of the Rohingya community working for the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) here, the Indian government allows Rohingyas to stay in the country, avail healthcare and educational services but they need get their refugee cards renewed every year. On humanitarian grounds, we continue to reside here but there is not enough assurance from the government, Ali says.While Jaffar, Sabeer and others remember their homeland with a certain sense of hopelessness, their children keep the excitement alive, punctuating the gloom with their laughter. Wearing new clothes and getting Eidi, the gift given by elders, is enough to make them happy. Only our kids are happy because they dont know about the situation in Myanmar, says Sabeer, who works for an NGO for Rs 12,000 a month.This year, however, he found it difficult to get new clothes for his son Rafiul. We dont have enough money and cant ask people for financial help here.It is heartbreaking for many Rohingyas to realise that their children, most of whom are born in India, will never know Jago teams, who sing wake-up songs asking their fellow Muslims to wake up for suhoor, the early morning meal before the day of fasting begins. Our prayers are for returning home. We spend sleepless nights worrying about our family members.

(Source: AP) After a long delay, the stadium will host the CPL final on September 1. (Source: AP)In April this year, a decision was taken to name the north stand at the Brian Lara Cricket Stadium after Sachin Tendulkar. Its learnt to have been a suggestion that came straight from Lara. However, the plan was stalled with both the Trinidad & Tobago Cricket Board (TTCB) and the opposition party of the island, the East Indian-run UNC, expressing their discontent with views that ranged from what has Tendulkar ever done for Trinidad cricket? and have they ever named a stand in Indian after a West Indian?. Just like that, the Brian Lara stadium was back in the news, and as always for the wrong reasons.The Brian Lara stadium is finally complete and set to host the CPL final on September 1 this year. Nobody really knows or can say with conviction anyway about when Trinidad actually decided to build a stadium eponymous with the most famous son of their soil. Some say it was conceived in the late 1990s, others that the foundation stone was laid somewhere at the start of the millennium. Everyone though remembers when it was supposed to be completethe 2007 World Cup.But one things sure, rarely has the Brian Lara Cricket Stadium in Taroubawhich is some 52 km, and a good hour-drive from Port of Spainever done much but incite debates or spread a lot of bakanalTrini for confusionaround Trinidad.If Brian Lara is one name that unites every race, religion and region in Trinidad, then the stadium thats named in his honour tears the island apart at the seams, along every line from political to racial. The original plan to build a government-owned stadium was floated to take cricket away from the historic Queens Park Oval, which is owned by a private club and has hosted international cricket since the inception of West Indies cricket.The Queens Park Club has always been a white-run establishment with many considering it as part of the colonial hangover. The government back then felt that it was time they stopped paying the club to host cricket and had a venue of their own, says a local.The stadium was developed by the Urban Development Company of Trinidad & Tobago (UDeCOTT) and Harish, the present manager of the stadium, joined the company as a 19-year-old some 10 years ago. And he insists that the venue was completely ready and set to host matches. But then when the UNC came into power, they didnt allow the stadium to be opened, and Harish quit the project in early 2011. That is before he came back in September last year once the African-run PNM party came back into power and decided to finally go ahead with the launch of the stadium.Ive come back to pretty much the same setting. The stands and the field (the grass has been imported from Tallahassee in Georgia, USA) were ready for use six years ago. But things are never that straightforward in Trinidad, says Harish.The stadium itself is a good drive, as you go past the heavily-Indian populated town of Chaguanas and then vast open expanses of green and hordes of abandoned sugarcane plantations. Its similar to the Pune stadium in terms of how it pops up out of nowhere in the horizon off the Southern highway. Its a state-of-the-art facility with storeyed stands and a grass-bank with the obligatory area for a limeDParty Stand as its called here.The insides still leave a lot to be desired but Harish insists the gaps in the ceiling and the scattered debris will be fixed in time for the big match. The media box actually has a provision for journalists to Telex or Fax their copies, complete with desks in the back where you could mechanically write your copies, which probably gives away how long the construction has been in limbo. The venue was designed by an American construction company and the costs are said to have gone up from the original 500 million to 1.3 billion TT dollars. The burgeoning cost has been a bone that the naysayers have picked on incessantly over the years.Youre also told by one local, whos clearly not in favour of cricket being shifted out of the Ovalwhich is the eventual planto Tarouba that, the earth moves in these parts and is not safe and also that the PNM went ahead with launching the Lara stadium rather than opening the Childrens Hospital, which you cross, which has been left unused.Meanwhile, a local in favour of the venue insists that since most of the young kids playing cricket come from the southern and central regions, from Chaguanas to Princes Town, its prudent to have a venue here so that they dont spend money and time traveling to Port-of-Spain. And the debate rages on, as it will continue to years to come.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

We distribute sevian to each other but at the end of the day we are refugees, and it is very disturbing,"" says Jaffer.According to Ali Johar, a member of the Rohingya community working for the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) here, the Indian government allows Rohingyas to stay in the country, avail healthcare and educational services but they need get their refugee cards renewed every year.""On humanitarian grounds, we continue to reside here but there is not enough assurance from the government,"" Ali says.While Jaffar, Sabeer and others remember their homeland with a certain sense of hopelessness, their children keep the excitement alive, punctuating the gloom with their laughter.Wearing new clothes and getting Eidi, the gift given by elders, is enough to make them happy.""Only our kids are happy because they don't know about the situation in Myanmar,"" says Sabeer, who works for an NGO for Rs 12,000 a month.This year, however, he found it difficult to get new clothes for his son Rafiul.""We don't have enough money and can't ask people for financial help here.""It is heartbreaking for many Rohingyas to realise that their children, most of whom are born in India, will never know 'Jago' teams, who sing 'wake-up' songs asking their fellow Muslims to wake up for suhoor, the early morning meal before the day of fasting begins.""Our prayers are for returning home. We spend sleepless nights worrying about our family members. What is Eid away from home, without the presence of loved ones?"" asks Shoria."

Projects like Gorakhpur Metro, to come up at an estimated cost of R12,000 crores , are among the dream projects of the CM and officials from the departments concerned have been instructed to ensure they materialise in time .Rapid transit: Gorakhpur Metro on the anvil The Gorakhpur Metro, connecting major routes in the city, seems to be the best plan to tackle traffic snarls, making commutation faster, easier and comfortable for office goers, students and locals.Officials from Rail Technical and Economical services (RITES), the government agency which entered an agreement with the Gorakhpur Development Authority (GDA)to prepare detailed project reports, have been visiting different localities to assess traffic load and conducting surveys.RITES has been entrusted with the task of preparing a detailed project report on Gorakhpur Metro within eight months. Within two months of agreement with GDA, they have to complete 25% of DPR work  said ON Singh , vice chairman, GDA, adding that the total estimated project cost of Gorakhpur Metro was around Rs12,000 crores.Introduction of Gorakhpur Metro would not only ease huge burden of traffic on roads and bring down pollution level but also help provide employment to jobless youth.No one had ever imagined that one day Metro would run in a city like Gorakhpur. Indeed this has become possible because of the personal interest of the CM who wants that Gorakhpur should not remain a backward area, BTech third year student Yashpal Singh said.AIIMSSetting up of the 700-bed AIIMS on 112 acres land of Ganna Shodh Sanstha in Gorakhpur is another ambitious project of the central and state governments which would boost growth in the city and help government deal effectively with ailments like encephalitis , the most fatal disease of east up which claims hundreds of lives every year.On July 1, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of AIIMS and fertilizer factory and assured people that he would not let a single child die of encephalitis .Giving pace to the project, DM Rajeev Rautela leased the land in the name of AIIMS for 90 years last week.Work on construction of three and half km long boundary wall of the site was initiated by service providing firm in March.AIIMS will be like a new ray of hope for encephalitis patients .It will also reduce burden of encephalitis patients at BRD Medical College ,where patients from 36 districts and even Nepal report for treatment , said DR RN Singh, paediatrician.Fertilizer factoryThe fertilizer factory which was once the pride of the city before closing down in the late 90s, is set to be revived to manufacture neem-coated urea for farming. The project is expected to be completed in three years, at a cost of R6,000 crore. Over 3,850 metric tonnes of urea will be produced here every day, helping in the green revolution.Youths, including those passing out in chemical engineering from MMMUT, would have a chance of employment at the factory, said Mohd Azhar, an engineering student.Two closed sugar mills in Padrauna and Munderwa will also be revived to usher in growth.Under the new industrial policy to be announced by the state government, east UP, particularly Gorakhpur, was to be developed as an industrial state , CM Yogi Adityanath had announced during his recent visit to Gorakhpur .Tax exemption and land at cheaper rates is what the government plans to attract investors here . Such policies s will further fuel growth and create more job opportunities .It will also help check migration of youths who move to Mumbai, Delhi and other big cities for livelihood, BJP leader Satyendra Sinha said.Better connectivityThe citys road and air connectivity will also be improved. After new Spicejet flights for Delhi and Kolkata under Udan scheme last year , flights for Mumbai and Kathmandu were also on the cards, MoS Civil Aviation Jayant Singh had announced during a programme at Gorakhpur airport on June 14.Power sectorThe government will spend Rs 214 crore to improve power distribution system under IPDS scheme and Rs 90 crore for underground power cables, said AK Singh, chief executive engineer, Gorakhpur zone . Of the 16.29 houses, only 11.53 lakh have power connections in Gorakhpur, depriving 4.76 lakh consumers of electricity. Under the IDPS, all such houses will be covered. Capacity of 18 substations will be enhanced while four new substations will be set up, Singh said.Tourism sectorGorakhpur and its surroundings have immense unexplored potential in tourism. The government has allocated funds for about half a dozen projects, including sound and light shows at Gorakhnath temple, revival of Chauri Chaura memorial and Budhdhist circuit in Kushinagar , said Tourist officer Arvind Rai.International flights from Kushinagar are also on cards to attract foreign tourists."

Express Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his ministers release their governments 100-day report card in Lucknow on Tuesday. ExpressHaving completed 100 days in office, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday released a progress report of his government in the form of a booklet containing brief details of its achievements and plans for the future. In the presence of all his Cabinet ministers, he spoke at length about the governments consistent efforts to fulfill the promises made in the manifesto his party had released prior to the Assembly elections held earlier this year, which it had won by a landslide.The 48-page booklet, titled 100 Din Vishwas ke, contains brief references to the governments take on various issues including law and order, policing, farmers issues including payment of pending sugarcane dues and loan waivers, steps being taken to attract investment, setting up industries to aid employment, infrastructural development as well as Metro rail operation in Lucknow and other cities.The first claim made is zero tolerance on law and order. The booklet mentions Adityanaths directives which include strengthening of police patrolling to stop incidents of theft and dacoity, effective action against crimes, to make police more alert and vigilant so they can fix responsibility at all levels while reviewing law and order.One of the pages in the booklet refers to the government as Aam jan ki sarkar (government of the common man). While referring to the governments paini nazar (sharp eye), the CM claimed while talking to the media that the formation of anti-Romeo squads has created a sense of safety among women and girls. As per the booklet, over 8.55 lakh persons were checked by the squad and 651 cases were registered with legal action initiated against 1,367 accused. Over 3.84 lakh persons were released after issuing warnings.The report also mentions that 16,152 cases of harassment of women were registered, 11,922 accused were arrested and 1,922 accused had surrendered in connection with such cases in the last 100 days. Besides, 3,326 cases of harassment of SC/STs were registered, 4,620 accused were arrested in such cases while 1,148 accused surrendered. Twenty-four cases have been registered under the National Security Act, added the report.The government claimed to have set up anti land-mafia task forces and identified over 1.53 lakh persons with illegal possession on government land, while 16,505 revenue/civil cases were registered and legal action taken in 940 cases. Also, 1,035 land mafias have been identified and 5,895 hectares of land was freed from illegal encroachment, claimed the report.Speaking to the media, Adityanath expressed satisfaction over the governments achievements in 100 days. He said that bringing about change in just 100 days in a big state like Uttar Pradesh, and that too with limited resources, was a challenge and the government had accepted that. He also claimed that his government was working for all sections of society without any discrimination.The chief minister further said that he wants to assure that the state government has initiated effective steps for growth and prosperity in the state. Taking a jibe at the previous SP and BSP governments, he said the state had been left behind in growth in the past 14-15 years because of corruption, pariwarvad (nepotism) and poor law and order.The chief minister said that crop loans of more than 86 lakh marginal and small farmers of upto Rs 1 lakh have been waived and the decision has caused a financial burden of Rs 36,000 crore to the state exchequer, which his government will compensate by reducing unnecessary expenditure. He further claimed that 36.99 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was procured this year, 4.5 times more than the wheat procured in the previous year.Presser becomes one-question affairA PTI report said that though it was billed to be a press conference at the Lok Bhawan, opposite the state legislature complex, the 45-year-old CM took just one question from mediapersons.Adityanath sought the cooperation of newspersons in helping him run the government when a scribe raised a question relating to the plight of small and medium newspapers.

Cultivation of water intensive crops like paddy, banana, sugarcane in major areas disturbed the demand and supply system, he said.Talking about the role of politicians, he said, If governments had directed the farmers to stick to the cropping pattern, then there would not have been a tussle. But politicians kept the issue alive for political gains. He added, Our politicians never felt it was necessary to inform farmers to link their crop pattern with rain pattern. When there is no coordination between crop and rain patterns, there is more demand for water. They assured to get more water from Karnataka. How can they get more water when there is no water? he asked.Singh said he had five rounds of meetings last May with farmers, industrialists and other stakeholders to find a solution. Farmers are unhappy as crops failed and were ready to find a solution. He hoped that experts and judges coming together to constitute the commission would resolve the issue amicably.Mahadayi issueIt is a geo-hydro morphological issue. Earlier Mahadayi was flowing towards east but now has changed its direction to west, like rivers Sharavathi and Kali. The natural flow diverted because of development and soil erosion, he said. There is no problem between Karnataka and Maharashtra but Goa has raised the issue. The Karnataka CM is eager to resolve the problem in the interest of north Karnataka people, he said.Diversion of Sharavathidemand for water is increasing with increase in density of population. Diversion of the Sharavathi river results in tussle between urban and rural people. So it is not a viable decision to divert the river water, he said.How to revive water bodies in Karnatakakarnataka is a teacher in water harvesting. Earlier, linking of lakes and tank system prevailed in the state and it was disturbed with the centralised irrigation system. Now again efforts are being made to re-establish linking of lakes and tanks with rivers. Definitely this would support in strengthening the water bodies, he said. Regretting the fact of more water bodies in the state being encroached, he said there were three challenges in the states water management system. It is encroachment, pollution and exploitation. The government has to come forward to identify and notify the encroachments."

The rupee has risen more than 5 percent against the dollar this year.That comes after the government in April allowed the duty-free import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar by the end of June to keep a lid on prices after local production fell by a fifth from a year ago.Nearly 60,000 tonnes of that 500,000 tonnes is yet to land in the country and the government is likely to extend the duty-free imports' period by up to two months, a government official, who declined to be named, said.""Right now refiners are processing duty-free imports. From the next month they could start importing (duty-paid) sugar for local consumption,"" said a sugar miller based at Kolhapur in Maharashtra. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media.Traders said predicting the scale of potential imports was tricky.""It is difficult to estimate how much Indian refiners will import ... (while) paying tax,"" said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.""The market has not anticipated additional imports. Once imports start, local prices could crash and could make larger imports unviable.""Local sugar prices have already fallen to their lowest level in three months in the wake of the duty-free imports and due to a cooler summer than usual, which curbed appetite for cold treats such as ice cream.""There is a need to raise import duty on sugar to 70 percent. Otherwise imports will pull down prices further and make it impossible for mills to pay the government's fixed cane price,"" said Baramati Agro's Pawar.India has increased by nearly 11 percent the price sugar mills must pay cane growers in the next sugar season beginning in October.There is no immediate plan to raise import duty on sugar and wheat, the government official said.""Mills cannot pay higher prices for cane unless they manage to sell sugar at higher prices,"" said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.""There is a need to stop imports as next season we will be self-sufficient in sugar production.""India's 2017/18 sugar output is expected to jump a quarter from the previous year to 25 million tonnes."

On Wednesday, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley gave no immediate assurance to state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who called on him on this issue in New Delhi.Mungantiwar sought Jaitleys intervention to direct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow nationalised banks to lend the state government Rs34,000 crore with a staggered repayment schedule over four years so that it can repay farmers loans. He also requested Jaitley to increase the cap on the states open market borrowing by Rs15,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of Rs35,000 crore, putting the state government in a position to raise funds for the waiver.According to information, Jaitley asked Mungantiwar to deal with the RBI for the loans and staggered repayment.The state government will have to deal with the RBI for the loans at a lower rate and their deferred schedule of the repayment. With permission to borrow and additional Rs15,000 crore, we can manage to raise Rs34,000 crore, Mungantiwar told HT.The state plans to shift the old loans that have been borrowed at a high rate of interest of about 10.5% to 7.5% to save about Rs40,000 crore on its outstanding loan of Rs75,000 crore from open market borrowings. The state has also requested the Centre for the waiver of the pre-clousure charges on the payment of the outstanding loans.Mungantiwar also requested Jaitley to extend the permission to export onions by three months to ensure rates in the domestic market do not fall on the backdrop of the bumper crop. Maharashtra farmers have produced 2.05 lakh metric tonnes of onion and the production is 25% more than the average. Similar rise in the production in other parts of the country has resulted in the fall in procurement rate of onion. The extension to the export permission by three months will prove beneficial to farmers in getting good procurement rate. Jaitley has assured us to positively consider the demand, Muntantiwar said.Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday began the procedure to waive off loans by issuing government resolution (GR) notifying the eligibility of the loan waiver.

It has also clarified farmers seeking the benefit of a one-time settlement of their outstanding more than the waiver limit of Rs1.50 lakh, will have to first pay of the remaining amount to seek the benefit.It has reiterated that except Class-IV employees, the families of the government servants, legislators, ex legislators, corporators and the members of cooperative sugar factories, district cooperative banks, cooperative milk unions will not be eligible for the loan waiver. The government has defined the family of farmers as husband, wife and children below 18 years. This means the nuclear families of the farmers will be separately entitled for the waiver.Read more:Farm loan waiver: Maharashtra to seek Centres help to raise 34,022 crore from banksMaharashtra readies game plan for farm loan waiver"

Dilip Kagda Gadkari arrives at the conclave on Tuesday. Dilip KagdaSwitching to biofuels such as ethanol and methanol, besides biogas, will make India pollution-free and generate employment, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said here on Tuesday.Alternative fuel sources such as ethanol, biogas and compressed natural gas which are cost-effective and pollution-free are the way forward for the country and the state, said the minister. He was speaking at the valedictory function of Badalta Maharashtra, a two-day conclave organised by Marathi daily Loksatta of The Indian Express group.He said that switching to ethanol, methanol and CNG will also empower farmers. Ethanol is an alcohol-based fuel produced by fermentation of sugarcane found in abundance in Western Maharashtra.We should promote large scale production of ethanol to meet the demand in the country. We would not need to import any fuel from any country, said Gadkari.If the transition is achieved, the country can cut down its dependence on petroleum. This will help reduce the countrys imports and make the country self-sufficient in fuel. If we increase usage of ethanol, companies such as Bharat Petroleum will become redundant and shut down, said Gadkari.Gadkari announced that the government is planning to convert one lane of the national highway between Mumbai and New Delhi into an electrified lane for electric buses and vehicles. We are planning to convert the last lane of the highways from Mumbai to Baroda, Baroda to Ahmedabad and Ahmedabad to Delhi to electric lanes, said Gadkari. Currently 55 buses in Nagpur run on ethanol, he said.Among other plans, the minister expressed the possibility of a bus service between Mumbai and Pune that will run entirely on ethanol. He urged officials and policy-makers in Mumbai to consider launching methane-run public transport in the city.Individual cars and vehicles must be discouraged and people should be encouraged to use public transport only, said Gadkari.Electricity tariff will be halved by 2030Electricity tariff will be halved in the state by 2030 as envisaged by the governments masterplan for development of energy resources, said Maharashtra Energy Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. He said the plan has been prepared bearing in mind the estimated rise in residential consumption of power.Currently, the demand for residential consumption is pegged at 23,000 MW but will increase by 1.5 times in a few years. The plan has been prepared keeping that increase in mind, said Bawankule at the Badalta Maharashtra conclave.The minister pointed out that by breathing life into several erstwhile defunct power plants such as Koradi, Chandrapur and Parli, the government has been able to generate 3,200 MW power and plug the shortage of power. He also claimed that the cost of production has dropped by 30 paise.Bawankule said that to meet the increasing power demand in Mumbai, the generation capacity will be increased from 3,800 MW to 5,500 MW.The minister announced that soon he will bring the tariff of distributors Tata Power, Reliance Energy and Maharashtra State Energy Distribution Company Ltd at par for usage of energy till 300 MW.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Of this 53,000 applications have been completed with details of business. The rest are in process, GSTN Chairman Navin Kumar told PTI here.New businesses have 30 days for registering on the GSTN portal beginning June 25.In first two rounds of registration window, about 66 lakh out of existing indirect tax payers of 80.91 lakh had registered with GST Network, the IT backbone for GST.Kumar said there were many businesses in sectors like tax, sugar and diamond that were earlier not registered with the state tax department and are now registering.Although businesses with turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh are exempt from GST and hence registration is not mandatory, traders and manufacturers are preferring to get themselves registered so that the input tax credit can be passed on in the supply chain.Also, on an average, 40,000-50,000 applications from existing excise, service tax and VAT assessees have come in, taking the total enrolment figure to nearly 68 lakh.This is against the 80.91 lakh existing excise, service tax and VAT assessees.We have already issued provisional IDs to the 68 lakh existing assessees. Of these, provisional registration certificate has already been issued to 10 lakh assessees. The remaining will be sent today, Kumar said.The 15-digit provisional ID would work as the Goods and Services Taxpayer Identification Number (GSTIN).GSTN -- the company readying the IT backbone for the GST regime -- has been working overtime to ensure a smooth registration and all these assessees have been given a provisional ID, using which they can start transacting business from July 1.When a business registers under GST, it is given a provisional GSTIN. After that, in the second stage, the business has to log in to the GSTN portal and give details of its business like the main place of business, additional place, directors and bank account details.The government has done away with the requirement of verification of registration through digital signature or generating electronic verification code (EVC) through banks.Businesses can just save these documents on the GSTN portal and an e-mail will be sent to them saying all their details are received and the process of registration is complete.The biggest tax reform since Independence, GST will be rolled out at the mid-night of June 30 and make India a single market for seamless movement of goods and services. The GST subsumes 16 different levies, including excise, service tax and VAT."

Excessive loss of salt and minerals in this weather can cause the body to dehydrate severely.Heat and humidityDehydration is one of the most common complaints and it is important to stay well hydrated.Drinking merely plain water does no good; the body loses essential minerals through sweat that needs to be replenished to maintain the bodys electrolyte balance, says Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, department of medicine, Moolchand Hospital.Coconut water, fruit juice, butter milk and lime water mixed with salt and sugar does help in replenishing lost vital minerals.Elderly people above 65 years of age, young children, obese people and those with underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, etc., are at a higher risk and need to be extra careful, says Dr Sharma.Water-borne illnessesTo beat excessive heat and humidity, people tend to eat fruits or drink juices from outside that can lead to stomach infection.Water-borne diseases primarily spread through contaminated water. A person falls sick by drinking polluted water either directly or by use of such water in cooking, washing or for other personal purposes. Eating spoilt food can also cause severe stomach infection.This is the time when we see an increase in the number of cases of water-borne illnesses, as people tend to drink water and juices from vendors in the open. Having cut fruits is a bad idea as bacteria formation is quite fast in this weather, says Dr RK Singal, director, department of internal medicine, BLK Super-Specialty Hospital.We have had frequent cases of jaundice and typhoid during the past one month as the weather is just conducive for the growth and multiplication of disease-causing bacteria and viruses.Many land up in hospital with dual infections.I am getting cases of people suffering from cross-infection, and it appears to be due to consuming contaminated water, says Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant, department of medicine, Ganga Ram Hospital.This is the season when food and water gets spoilt very quickly so it is advisable to eat as far as possible home-cooked food and carry your own water.Skin and hair damageYour skin and hair also tend to bear the brunt of the hot and humid weather.Irritation, itching, redness and rashes on any part of the skin, and pimples, dandruff, hair fall and fungal infections are all symptoms of damage.Doctors strongly recommend using a sunscreen even during the rainy season. A good sunscreen, with sun protection factor above 20, should be applied all over the exposed skin 10-15 minutes before stepping outPeople usually avoid applying sunscreen during rains, thinking there is no sun. But it is equally important as harmful ultraviolet rays are in the atmosphere even when its not sunny. In fact, one must keep reapplying sunscreen after every 3-4 hours as people sweat excessively in this humid weather, says Dr Deepali Bhardwaj, skin and hair expert.High humidity also causes damage to the hair as it tends to lose its lustre and becomes rough and unmanageable. It also destroys elasticity and resilience of hair strands, resulting in breakage.One should use a shampoo and conditioner containing sunscreen. Deep conditioning, using various hair masks can reduce the damage to quite an extent, says Shahnaz Husain, beauty expert.IGNORE FEVER AT YOUR OWN RISKRavinder Sehrawat was admitted to west Delhi-situated BLK Super-Speciality Hospital, after being diagnosed as a severe case of typhoid fever a water-borne disease.

So, I could not see a doctor and would take Crocin to bring my fever down that would go as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit at times, the 51-year-old, who is into transport business, told HT from his hospital bed.He was admitted to west Delhi-situated BLK Super-Speciality Hospital, after being diagnosed as a severe case of typhoid fever a water-borne disease.It is a bacterial infection that usually spreads through contaminated food and water. He had been careless which is why his condition worsened and we had to hospitalize him, says Dr RK Singal, director, department of internal medicine at the hospital.Sehrawat is not exactly sure what may have led to the infection.I cant remember exactly but the only cause I can think of is water. Its so hot and there have times when I have forgotten taking water bottle along, he says.I used to drink water from outside because I have had really long work hours of late, and it was not possible to sustain without water even though I werent sure of the water quality.MAKE SURE YOU DRINK CLEAN WATERDivesh Malhotra had typhoid as well as abscess in liver. (Burhaan Kinu/HT PHOTO)Divesh Malhotra, 33-year-old delivery analyst, was hospitalized at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital for a dual infection that was a result of drinking contaminated water.A resident of west Delhis Rajouri Garden, Malhotra says the quality of water supply at his residence has not been up to the mark recently. We were getting really bad water and that could have lead to the infection, he says.Apart from getting high fever that would increase towards the middle of the night, Malhotra also developed acute stomach ache, which are common symptoms associated with water-borne diseases. My condition worsened in office and I decided to see a doctor. I went through several tests and was told I suffered dual infection, he says.Malhotra had typhoid as well as abscess in liver, and had to be hospitalized. I am feeling a lot better now but I did not know it could be that serious, he says.Dr Atul Gogia, senior consultant, department of medicine at the hospital says, His condition was not good when he came to us but he is a young fellow that is why he responded well to the treatment.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also seen. (PTI)NEW DELHI: At the stroke of midnight, India finally embraced the Goods and Services Tax (GST), explained by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""Good and Simple Tax"", with members of Parliament as witnesses to the epochal transition.Modi drew parallel with the monumental exercise of unification of hundreds of princely states by India's first Home Minister Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, saying that the GST is likewise unveiling economic integration of the country.Even while the grand occasion at the Central Hall of Parliament lost the lustre of unity in the political class following the boycott by the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the RJD, the Prime Minister credited the rollout of the GST to the success of cooperative federalism and democracy in the country. ""From Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh to Lakshadweep, GST will unveil one nation, one tax,"" said Modi.With President Pranab Mukherjee keenly listening, Modi recalled the journey of the GST, which began with the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee constituting a committee under Vijay Kelkar and afterwards the introduction of the Constitution Amendment Bill in 2006 and underlined the collective efforts of different governments and stakeholders.The PM seemed aware of the possibility of the glitches and pains to traders, as he suggested that time is needed to adjust to transition even while he cautioned people from rumour mongering.Seeking to give an esteemed position to the momentous event, Modi noted that Gita has 18 chapters as had been the number of meetings of the GST Council. Referring to a host of luminaries, including Albert Einstein, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Chanakya, the Prime Minister sugar-coated the rollout of the GST strongly as a decisive step to uplift the conditions of the poor. ""The additional resources will help eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Bihar to join the path of economic prosperity,"" Modi noted.Apparently addressing the concerns that the rollout of the GST may mark the return of the Inspector Raj, the Prime Minister stressed that the simplicity of the measure, in contrast, would end tax terrorism and help the country improve ease of doing business, besides boosting exports.Invoking the ideals of ""New India"", Modi said that the rollout of the GST will herald ""Ek Bharat-Shresht Bharat"".President Pranab Mukherjee too retraced the journey of the GST and said that he had been personally attached to the monumental exercise.Both President and the Prime Minister jointly pressed the button to inaugurate the GST.Earlier speaking on the occasion, Finance Minister Arun Jaitely said that the rollout of the GST signified India rising above narrow politics while stating that the old India was economically fragmented.""With the rollout of the GST, India is awakening to limitless possibility. While the old India was economically fragmented, new India will write a new destination with the Centre and states working toward shared prosperity,"" Jaitely said in his introductory remark, while noting the consensual approach adopted in the meetings of the GST Council."

Co-operatives could prove to be a new engine for growth, he said.Farmers are not getting as much benefit as they must get. Farmers must get a complete stake in the supply chain and this could happen through co-operatives, Prabhu said.Prabhu, speaking at the D R Gadgil memorial lecture organised by the Maharashtra Economic Development Council at Yashwant Chavan Centre, reminded that Gadgils contribution in setting up sugar co-operatives in the state had brought a change.Today, we are discussing farmers problems all over the country. Sugar co-operatives changed the entire landscape of Maharashtra. There are more than one lakh primary agriculture co-operative societies and they can work at grassroots with farmers to bring about a change. Building more co-operatives could help us solve farmers problems, Prabhu said.Prabhu added that self help groups (SHG) must be involved with co-operatives that could aid in socio-economic change. There must be a partnership between co-operatives and corporates which could bring about socio-economic change. SHGs can also work with co-operatives which will aid the economy, he said.In the new economic order, farmers must benefit. As farmers constitute more than half the population, they must be our focus group in India. Their income will increase, Prabhu added.Speaking on initiatives of the government, he said significant changes happen only after a period of time. Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be a game changer. Make in India will change the GDP profile of the country. Many other programs like Swachh Bharat and Digital India will also initiate changes in the coming few years, he said.The Railway Minister said that a group has been set up to study the impact of GST on railway operations. Inevitably, all sectors will be affected (with the GST rollout) We are studying the impact. In any case it is the law of the land so we will adopt it. We have already set up a group to look into the implications of GST on all our operations, Prabhu said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Samples lifted as part of the national milk quality survey by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) show that a fifth of them contain adulterants, some of which could have adverse impacts on health.But there was a difference in the surveys target group. While the current controversy revolves around private branded milk packs, the FSSAI didnt go after them. They lifted samples from small distributors in towns and villagers who supply fresh milk at the doorstep.Of 102 samples collected from Tamil Nadu, 22 were substandard. In fact, two samples from Tiruchy region tested positive for detergent. The surveillance survey, done in November last, came after a gap of five years. The results, released recently, show that 22 samples in Tamil Nadu were substandard. Two of them, which had detergent, were unsafe for human consumption, a food safety department official told Express.However, though over 20 per cent of the samples across the country were substandard, the department had limitations in initiating action, as it was a surveillance survey. We cannot hope to get them penalised by a court based on the surveillance survey, explained the official.Who failed the test?A food safety department official refused to name the companies that failed the quality test during the surveillance survey, but said samples mostly lifted from small-scale milk distributors in villages were found deficient in quality. When asked about testing State-owned Aavin, too, the official said no samples were lifted from the milk cooperativeHence, the department lifted two more samples from the same small-scale milk distributors from Manapparai and Tiruchy. During the surveillance survey, samples from Tiruchy had shown the presence of detergent, while that from Manapparai also contained a chemical neutraliser, said another official.But, in a resampling test, the one from Tiruchy Corporation limit showed satisfactory quality, while the milk sample from Manapparai was substandard. A case has been filed in a court against that unit, the official added.However, the official refused to name the companies that failed the quality test during the surveillance survey, but said samples mostly lifted from small-scale milk distributors in villages were found deficient in quality.We found excess water and reduced fat content in 22 samples. Detergent is added for longer shelf life and also to give a thick consistency to the milk, the official added.When asked about testing State-owned Aavin, too, the official said no samples were lifted from the milk cooperative.The national milk quality survey was carried out to assess the quality of milk with a focus on unsafe and adulterated milk.The samples were tested for fat and solids-not-fat (SNF), vegetable oil, detergent, hydrogen peroxide, formalin, sugar, glucose, urea, starch, boric acid, ammonium sulphate, nitrates and cellulose maltodextrin. When asked about other adulterants, the official said, Not in Tamil Nadu, but in other states, chemicals like hydrogen peroxide, formalin, acid and urea were found in samples."

The four boys, two 15-year-olds, a 13-year-old and the 11-year-old, reached home a day later, on the evening of June 27, and are now in detention at the Kupwara police station.A few kilos of rice, some packets of biscuits, a sleeping bag, two school bags, and Rs 280 in cash  these were among the things the four boys carried when they left their homes on June 26, the day of Eid, intending to cross the Line of Control (LoC). But an arduous 8-km trek up the slopes, a sleepless night under the open sky, and the cries of the youngest member of the team  a homesick 11-year-old  got the four to abandon their journey at Reshwari and come back home to Gulgam, their village in Kupwara, north Kashmir.The four boys, two 15-year-olds, a 13-year-old and the 11-year-old, reached home a day later, on the evening of June 27, and are now in detention at the Kupwara police station. A fifth boy, a Class 11 student from the same village who allegedly motivated the four and even accompanied them some distance, is also being questioned by the Kupwara police. Inside a small staff resting room at the police station, where the four are under detention, the 13-year-old said, For six days before we left, we would meet at the Eidgah and plan for the trip.He said the Class 11 boy had told them that a person would meet them at Noun Nard, a hilltop 13 km from Gulgam, and help them cross the LoC. The route from the village to Noun Nard and onwards to the LoC is non-motorable. He said they set off on their journey soon after the Eid prayers on Monday. The boys rushed to their homes, ate, collected their Eidi (gift money from parents) and then met at a common place.He (the Class 11 student) told us we can reach Pakistan through the border and eventually, settle there. He also said we would get arms training, said another boy, one of the two 15-year-olds. We first walked to Awoora village and from there to Reshwari, 8 km away. We reached by evening. That night, we decided to camp under the open sky, outside an abandoned hut. There was a masjid nearby but we decided not to stay there to avoid being noticed, he said. The trek to Reshawri is over hilly terrain and through pine forests. The boys said they were exhausted by the time they got there.We lit a fire but did not know how to make rice. We ate half-cooked rice. We were carrying some sugar and teabags so we drank tea. During the trek, we rested several times and drank water from nullahs, the 13-year-old said. After we lay down for the night, suddenly, he started crying, he said, referring to the 11-year-old. He cried the whole night, asking us to take him back home. We couldnt sleep. We also started missing home. We were worried about our families and for our own safety. There was an army camp nearby and we were afraid of getting killed right there. We were all very scared.The 11-year-old sat on the floor, silent through most of the conversation, only saying, I missed home a lot. So on the morning of June 27, the boys decided to start the trek back home. By then, news of their disappearance had spread. When they reached Awoora bus stand, they said, villagers spotted them and took them to their homes.On the evening of June 27, as soon as they reached home, we took all four of them to the Kupwara police station. They were kept there that night. The next day, they were handed over to us and they spent the night at home. But the next day, we were summoned to the police station and told to come with the boys. Since then, our boys have been kept under detention, said the father of one of the four. Police, however, denied that the boys have been under detention. The four boys are called in the morning for questioning and handed over to their families in the evening. We are investigating all the angles. In a day or two, we will come up with more details, Kupwara SSP, Shamsher Hussain, told The Sunday Express.Police also have different version of how the boys got home. On June 28, the day police handed the boys over to their families, SSP Kupwara Shamsher Hussian had held a press conference to say that a police team had intercepted the missing boys from near the LoC and brought them home. Family members and villagers accuse police of distorting facts. These children are so innocent that they lit a fire to cook food near an army camp, without realising that it would give them away. They were fortunate to come out of there alive. Police should appreciate that they came back; instead, even after so many days, they continue to remain under detention, said a relative of the 11-year-old.On Saturday, three of the four boys were to take their first-term examination in school, but police allegedly didnt allow them to. I intervened on behalf of the boys families but police have been delaying their release. They cannot keep minors at the police station its illegal, said local MLA Bashir Ahmad Dar, whom the boys parents and the village elders met to seek their release.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

I met psychiatrist Dr Dilip Karan Rathore, who hails from Jalore in Rajasthan but is settled in America, during his visit to India, said Mal Singh Jamara, secretary of Jaisalmer-based NGO Godawan Sanrakshan Sanstha. Dr Rathore agreed to treat the addicts.During Dr Rathores visit in March this year, detoxification camps were organised at Jaisalmer, Mohangarh, Ramgarh, Chandhan, Nachana and Narsighon ki Dhani (NKD), and about 300 addicts were identified.After the Rajasthan government banned doda post sale from April 1 last year, the addicts faced psychological problems because of non-availability of the intoxicant; some youths started consuming capsules and medicines to get intoxicated.Through Skype video calling from America, Dr Rathore treats addicts thrice a week -- Friday, Saturday and Sunday -- from 3pm to 8pm. After knowing about blood sugar, blood pressure and other details, he prescribes medicines to patients, said Jamara. We bear the cost of medicines as the addicts are poor.He said, Dr Rathore wanted to serve his country; now he is happy that he is trying to help out addicts.According to the health department data, the state has 19,000 registered doda post addicts. The department had organised camps under the Naya Savera campaign from January to March in 2015 to help addicts deal with withdrawal symptoms.The number of doda post addicts in the state, Jamara said, could be two lakh as many are not registered.In Jaisalmer district, youths aged between 20 and 30 years are addicted to opium and capsules, and people aged 40 years and above consume doda post, Jamara said. People consume these things because according to them the drugs energise them and they are able to do heavy work for a long time without feeling tired.Sawai Singh (42), a resident of Sipla village in Jaisalmer district, said, I was consuming opium for last eight years and also started drinking liquor in the last two years. After taking medication, I gave up consuming these things and am feeling better.Anop Singh (40) of NKD village said, I got into the habit of taking capsules. I take 4-5 capsules a day and without them, I feel tired and am not able to sleep. After taking treatment from Dr Rathore, he brought it down to 2-3 capsules a day. Anop did not go for follow-up treatment and again he has started consuming 4-5 capsules a day, Jamara said.He said, Of the 300 addicts identified, many have stopped taking drugs. One should have strong will power to quit addiction and the success rate is 30% only.The NGO works for conservation of Great Indian Bustard, child education, environment and drug de-addiction in Jaisalmer."

Eating out will be costlier. Watching movies at a multiplex will cost more, as will staying in premium hotels.Air conditioners and television sets will be more expensive. Salon and spa services will cost more.The general perception is that even buying a house and then furnishing it will cost more once the goods and services tax (GST) kicks in on 1 July, say consumers.Overall there will be some escalations in costs. Everything will become more expensive. There will be very few basic things that will become cheaper, says Rajesh Kurup, 40, an architect in Mumbai, who expects no relief to consumers from GST, at least in the short term. In the long term, it could be different, he says.Under GST, daily consumption items such as milk, fruit and vegetables, foodgrain, pulses and cereals have been exempted from tax. Sugar, tea, coffee, edible oil and newsprint have been placed in the lowest slab of 5%.When it comes to packaged consumer goods, most items like detergents, hair creams and colours, shampoos, liquid detergents, liquid soaps and instant coffee are under the highest tax slab of 28%. Soaps, toothpastes and hair oils have been spared.The GST rate for these goods is higher than under the current tax regime, where the indirect tax on most packaged consumer goods is in the range of 20-24%, said a 19 May report by Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. Ltd.We will be paying more for everythingfrom eating out at restaurants to buying air conditioners and television sets, says Aparna Shinde, 26.Shinde says goods like televisions, refrigerators and air conditioners are household necessities today. Also consumers like herself are frequenting restaurants more often. To continue to lead the same lifestyle under GST will cost more, she says.Pankaj Sharma, 30, a digital marketing executive, agrees with Shinde. The costs of everything from mobile bills to eating out at restaurants, travelling and staying at hotels will be more expensive. Even branded clothes will become more expensive, he says.With multiple messages on social media on GST and the expected tax rates on various goods, consumers are confused about what the real impact will be.I am not really sure what will happen... There are so many different news reports on social media about the prices of various goodssome will increase, some will decrease. but we will know the reality only on 1 July, says Vishwajit Mane, 33.According to Mane, the general perception is that GST will improve ease of doing business for corporate entities but for consumers, it may only increase expenses."

You may, at most, get Rs 10 difference (compared with non-sale) on some items because BigBazaar is anyway known for low prices, Prashanth said.Better products at a lower price would have been worth it but the same products at just Rs 10 or so off is not too satisfactory, she added.Prashanth wanted to buy a microwave, a dustpan, a bedsheet and teacups but finally settled for a bed sheet sold at a 60% discount on a retail price of Rs 1,199.Naseer Ahmed, a travel agent, too was not satisfied.I was looking only at clothing. The products are good but the discounts arent too much, he said.The retailer was largely offering a 2-22% discount on food and groceries items, reflective of their new cheaper pricing under GST.Sales keeps on happening but this is a price reduction which is permanent, said Kishore Biyani, chairman and chief executive officer of Future Group, which operates Big Bazaar. Biyani was talking of the sales offers in June.For those who just bought groceries, the sale lived upto its promise.It was a pleasant surprise for me...If this (grocery) comes at a 30% discount then theres nothing like it, said Akanksha Singh, a credit analyst at a bank.In Mumbai, regular big bazaar customer Raghunath Bhattacharya too was happy man.I bought daily consumption items and got some discount which is a relief, said Bhattacharya, 60, who visited the mega store in Mahim.There was also panic buying as many people are rise boom in cost of essentials.The most visible change under GST is the payment receipt which now reflects the tax slabs for the state, Centre and intra-state transactions. (Kavya Kothiyal/LiveMint)At a Star Bazaar store in Mumbais Andheri West, one customer filled four shopping carts with groceries such as biscuits, rice, tea powder, noodles, soaps and detergents, as she felt the prices would go up post GST.The prices will shoot up from tomorrow and for a middle-class customer we would definitely look for such sales. Normally, I wont come for shopping at midnight but if something cheap is available on your plate for a limited number of time, I would try not to lose a chance, said a 45-year-old woman.Under GST, daily consumption items such as milk, fruit and vegetables, food grain, pulses and cereals have been exempted from tax. Sugar, tea, coffee, edible oil and newsprint have been placed in the lowest slab of 5% while ready-made garments will be taxed at 18%.For others still, a sale is a sale and means better prices.I made up my mind to come for shopping at Big Bazaar as soon as I came to know about the mega sale late in the evening, said Poornima Shah, 20, who is confused about the impact of GST on her daily purchases.Consumer fears of rising prices drove sales across retail stores last month. Moreover, retailers also offered steeper discounts as they looked at making most of the old tax regime.I am surprised business has gone unprecedently high. I thought the business would go down but the business from our expectation is 30% up, said Biyani.The most visible change under GST is the payment receipt which now reflects the tax slabs for the state, Centre and intra-state transactions and also shows harmonised system nomenclature (HSN) or the master item code.This is unlike the Value Added Tax (VAT) regime where bills just reflected the MRP of the items and discounts with a summary of the applicable taxes at the end."

It is important to eat a good amount of vegetables to provide enough nutrition to the body, she suggested.Eating protein-rich food along with fibre is also necessary during this period. After breaking fast, one should eat more salads and vegetables, along with roti and dal or chicken, she said emphasizing upon the importance of a balanced diet.After breaking fast with dates, figs and fruit juices, which are good sources of simple sugars, Ms. Murthy suggests that heavy meals be avoided during Iftar to prevent a load on the digestive system.If planning a dinner, it should be consumed at least one to two hours after breaking fast and should be light. Also, do not sleep immediately after eating, she said.The bodys immediate need at the time of Iftar is an easily available energy source in the form of glucose for every living cell, particularly the brain and nerve cells. So, having foods high in carbohydrates can compensate for the reduced glucose levels experienced as a result of fasting, she said.Soup and porridge along with dates, milk and tea are best options for Iftar as they are light and prepare the stomach for a dinner. People should not indulge in an unbalanced diet with too many servings of sherbets and sweets with added sugar as these are unhealthy.Referring to the tendency among a lot of people to drink too much water after Iftar, Ms Murthy said consuming too much water can contribute to fatigue and stomach pain. Eating a fruit or nuts after Iftar is recommended, but not sweet desserts as they make an individual feel hungry after a while, she said."

It was the low contribution of manufacturing that led to transition of economy from agriculture to service sector, bypassing the manufacturing sector.But, for a country with 1.3 billion people, not every one can move from agriculture to services. This is where the small and medium-scale enterprises will provide opportunities.The manufacturing sector has to be more vibrant and it should be revived. The Union Government has taken several steps and now the country is moving into high end manufacturing, both in terms of production process and products. For this, the emphasis should be on skill development so that the industries can adopt technology. There should be occupational standards for manufacturing.The key sectors for growth in the coming years will include defence, railways, automobiles, and renewable energy.There are also lot of opportunities for innovation. A positive environment should be created at industries to encourage innovation. The MSMEs should leverage on design and engineering capabilities that are available and adopt them successfully in their units.Rajshree Pathy, chairman and managing director of Rajshree Sugars and Chemicals, said that the Union Government was forthcoming to encourage innovation in all sectors and it was taking innovation seriously as it is the next growth sector.Even in smaller towns and cities there are entrepreneurs who are thinkers with ideas.

Subsequently, the entire district besides the adjoining regions of Chamarajanagar have received copious rainfall as a result of which farm work is in full swing in south interior Karnataka.While paddy is yet to be taken up for sowing, ragi, jowar, maize, toor, and green gram have been planted and cotton and tobacco have occupied the largest swathe of cultivable land. The authorities have set a target of bringing 3,88,220 hectares (ha) under sowing for khariff season. This includes 2,74,120 ha coming under rain-fed area and 1,14,100 ha under irrigated land.Out of this, 2,04,236 ha of land has already been brought under sowing in rain-fed areas thus achieving almost 75% of the target, while 2,392 ha under irrigated land have been brought under sowing. Nearly 70% of agriculture in Mysuru district takes place under rain-fed conditions, while the irrigated area constitutes only 30% of the total cultivable area. Hence, the pre-monsoon showers are important for farmers to take up tilling and prepare the land for sowing while the monsoon rains provide the requisite moisture during growth stages of the crop.As per statistics maintained by the office of the Joint Director of Agriculture in Mysuru, 46,338 ha of land has been brought under cotton while 68,415 ha of land has been brought under tobacco. The extent of the coverage of other crops are jowar (4,229 ha), ragi (1,213 ha), maize (28,901 ha), and sugarcane (2,192 ha).Officials maintained that there was adequate stock of fertilizers and seeds to enable farmers to complete sowing activity and the authorities have advised farmers to take up sowing of green manure crops and pulses such as horsegram, blackgram, and cowpea in view of the congenial moisture in the soil.The Grameena Krishi Mausam Sewa at Naganahalli has cited the Indian Meteorological Department forecast to indicate that the onset of monsoon may be earlier this year.

(CNNL) for performing homa at the Talacauvery, the birth place of river Cauvery, seeking good monsoon after a three-year drought.While officials insist that it is a common practice to offer puja at reservoirs and the place of origin of rivers, the criticism has now forced the States Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil, on Friday, to state that he would go ahead with the puja with his own money and not take funds from CNNL.Responding to the controversy, Mr. Patil said he was hurt by criticism over the allocation of funds for the puja. He said such rituals were not unusual as all governments have offered puja when the dams were full. He clarified that the cost of the ritual may not cross Rs. 1 lakh.On Friday, Mr. Patil visited Mahabaleshwara, the hilly region in the neighbouring Maharashtra where river Krishna takes its origin, to offer puja along with his wife and senior officials of the Water Resources Department.Interestingly, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, known for his rational outlook, tried to wriggle out of the row by stating that he was unaware of any plans to conduct homa and that the government had no role in such rituals.But Mr. Siddarmaiah is the chairperson of the CNNL and hence funds could not have been earmarked without his approval.Earlier, the decision to earmark funds in the CNNLs budget for performing a homa at Talacauvery was opposed by some of the farmers leaders from the Cauvery region itself.Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association president Kuruburu Shanthakumar argued that it was strange on part of the government or the CNNL to conduct a homa now as they had allegedly prevented farmers from offering puja to Kabini, a prominent tributary of Cauvery, in 2015."

Traders particularly from sugar and textiles industry fear losses owing to a higher GST rate on inventories and ambiguity on input tax credit.After the state government subsumed the sugarcane cess and excise in the GST, the difference between the old and new stock is Rs30 a quintal. In the absence of clarity on input tax credit, traders fear, they will have to bear losses.Before GST, each quintal of sugar attracted Rs71 in excise duty and Rs124 in cess. Now, the 5% GST rate is levied on sugar. As a result of the difference, the old stock is dearer. The industry has made representation to the Union finance ministry and the decision is awaited, said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of State Co-Operative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd.Meanwhile, traders complained about glitches while registering themselves on the GST network owing to slow servers and crashes. The registration of the existing assessee is fast, but the new one are facing problems owing to an unfriendly system and lack of clarity on many fronts. In Bhiwandi, which is known as powerloom town, only 17 traders have registered against expected registration of 25,000, said an official.In the absence of the GST-enabled system at many outlets, customers faced the inconvenience. At a garment outlet of a leading brand in Phoenix Malls, I had to stand for more than an hour for billing as they were preparing the bills manually. Customers were told that the system was not ready, said Gaurav Shah.Trades and suppliers were also found insisting for the cash payments instead of credit card or cheques."

With a grant of $115,000 (Rs. 74 lakh), Armman hopes to cover 2.2 million pregnant women and mothers across the country.The idea of the service took birth on a summer night in 1998 when Dr. Aparna Hegde was in her first year of residency at Sion Hospital. Dr. Hegde was witness to the death of Aruna at the hospital. Aruna breathed her last three days after her baby died due to birth complications at Thane Civil Hospital.Owing to lack of medical assistance during her pregnancy, Aruna developed gestational diabetes (increase in blood sugar levels). Aruna was brought to the Thane hospital when she went into labour, but she had a obstructed labour. The babys head passed through the birth canal, but the shoulders become stuck during labour.

Bharat Sundaresan Warri is the national pastime of Antigua and Barbuda. Bharat SundaresanSOME HUSBANDS leave their home for a game of dominoes and by the time they come back their wives are gone. Because its been a week since they left. If you think thats an exaggeration, think again. Time does fly when you are sitting around a dominoes table with a bunch of highly competitive men from the Caribbean. And its effect on marriages are well-publicized. Not that it stops anyone from the indulgence.At times, it does appear that some people in the Caribbean have more than 24 hours in their day. And most of that bonus time, along with the regular hours, is spent playing dominoes. Its in Jamaica that youll find hordes of gents in groups of four almost on every street corner or, at times, on the side of a busy alley, animated and boisterous while slamming a domino on the makeshift table. But the game that came to the Caribbean, via sugar and slave trade from Europe, is a staple in every island.Playing dominoes in the Caribbean is almost an initiation into manhood. And the older you get, the harder you slam the domino on the table, explains Daryll, who works at a restaurant in Fort James but dabbles in his favourite pastime with his colleagues when business is slow. You are afforded the beginners luck and shown some kindness initially. But the niceties are over by the second game itself, and its all serious business now, with a little sledging thrown in.But not all Antiguans call dominoes their game. They prefer their national game, warri (house), another board game that was brought to the isles by slaves from Africa, Sudan in particular. Its believed to have been the most common form of entertainment following a long day at work for them. What helped was the contempt that the European masters held for the game that they felt occupied too much of their workers time. Unlike dominoes, warri is a slower game based on strategy and deception. It uses a wooden tablet like board with various holes and with both players starting with a fixed number of warri seeds or nickernuts. Youll find competitors deep in battle at almost every bus stand in Antigua while those waiting for the buses stand around cheering or jeering them. The boards are left there overnight with the belief that nobody would commit as blasphemous an act as steal it. And some boards have been around for decades at St Johns east and west bus stands.You will never find a Warri board not being used. Someone or the other is always using it for a game, says Daryll.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The industry players here described the event as a historic initiative for development of Kolhapur and adjoining areas in western Maharashtra and Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts of Konkan.Kolhapur is an important centre of agriculture and foundry business. But lack of adequate railway network force people to rely on road transport which is comparatively more expensive. Due to this transport costs, produce from the region becomes incompetent in market. Hence, people had been demanding electrification of the Pune-Miraj-Kolhapur track for fast movement of goods and passengers. With the ports in the western coast are being developed, connectivity with Sindhudurg and Rantnagiri districts would provide a boost to export. The new lines and electrification would lead long-term development of the region.Prabhu said at Karad on Sunday, ""These railway projects lead development of tomorrow's Maharashtra. Western Maharashtra is a developed region. With the connectivity with Kokan through the Kolhapur-Vaibhavwadi line, the region would develop further. This rail network would further connect to Marathwada and Vidarbha and boost passenger and cargo transportation.""Lalit Gandhi, president of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, ""Electrification of Pune-Kolhapur track is the basic infrastructure work for cargo transportation. It will boost sugar and bauxite transportation. At present, sugar from Kolhapur fails to compete in major markets due to transportation cost. Electrification would also speed up transportation.""He added, ""Rail connectivity with Konkan is a historic opportunity for the industrial sector. At present, we rely on Jawaharal Neharu Port Trust (JNPT) for export. The Jaigarh port in Ratnagriri is being developed. Once it is done, our dependence on JNPT would reduce. Konkan is still an untapped market and rail connectivity will provide an opportunity to explore it. It will also help expand the manufacturing base in Kolhapur and nearby districts.""Member of central zone railway users committee Samir Sheth said, ""Electrification of Pune-Kolhapur track will save time and bring down cargo and passenger transportation expenses by half. It will also lead to increase in the frequency of trains. Railways can also run fast trains on this route.""He added, ""The Konkan is full of natural beauty.

It has taken him blood, sweat and tears to join the ranks of the toppers in the district, studying by candlelight and going to a neighbour's house when the candle got over.Son of a poor farmer, Rampal's father Bhagwan Das earns about Rs 2,000 a month, toiling in the fields of Pilibhit. But this never deterred his father, a school dropout, from aspiring for proper education for his three children, who he sent to Bareilly and enrolled them in good private schools.Giving credit to his father for his success, Rampal said, ""My father always wanted us to get proper education and hence, he got me enrolled in a reputed private school of the city. He borrows money at 5% interest to pay for our schooling and pays back the loan after harvesting the sugarcane crop. However, this time, we are yet to pay the fees of Class X. As I am good in studies, the school officials allowed me to write the exams.""Rampal is a student of Woodrow School.

He shares the room with his older brother Purushotam, a Class XII student, and younger sister Hemvati, who is promoted to Class X.""My father somehow managed to get an electricity connection in the room. However, I had to study in candlelight during the long power cuts in the area.

He aspires to become doctor one day.Unable to buy books, Rampal borrowed NCERT books from his seniors but could not arrange expensive books and test papers that his peers had. ""My friends used to lend me books of prominent authors and test papers for a couple of days.

The founder of EnviGreen Biotech India Ltd , Bengaluru, who nurtures the dream of a plastic-free India, is set to launch biodegradable EnviGreen (EG) bags this month. TOI caught up with Hegde to learn more about his anti-plastic mission. Excepts:In 2012, the Mangaluru City Corporation banned the use of plastic. While it was an excellent move, people were not prepared for it. We started a campaign - I Love Mangaluru -and a lot of companies joined us. But fishermen and kirana store owners told us how difficult it was to sell cloth bags at Rs 15 each.After speak ing to a few biotechnol ogy scien tists, I real ized it was possible to invent 100% biodegradable products but research and development (R&D) would be costly. After a four-year struggle, we came up with EnviGreen Biotech India Ltd.We started collecting raw materials available in India, like natural starch from tapioca, potato, banana peels and sugarcane. We have three products -EG Centum are biodegradable garbage bags, EG bags are meant for shopping and EG packaging bags for wrapping food products. These are all compostable plastics. We are setting up a factory with a 1000-metric tonne capacity and creating employment opportunities for over 200 people. We hope to expand operations to Mumbai.A team of agents helps us pro cure starch from India and southeast Asian countries.I always wanted to be a lawyer and not an entrepreneur. But unfortunately in 2010, I met with an accident and was told to rest for six months -I suffered a head injury and had a rod in my left arm. That was a turning point in my life. I realized I had to do something big.I dropped out of college, wrote exams through distance learning and founded Areka Artefacts to export cutlery made of betel leaves. At present, I am pursuing international marketing studies at Cambridge Marketing College, UK. It's an online course and in a couple of months, I'll be going to Dubai on an internship.Increasing our global presence is not easy. When the UN in vited us to Shanghai, it was a three-month process. They sent our samples to China, confirmed they were 100% biodegradable and organic and only then approved our visit. The Changemakers' summit was an amazing platform and the theme was zerowaste. I spoke about a plasticfree world, incorporating my EnviGreen experience and cutlery-manufacturing business. I got an overwhelming response from Chinese industrialists who are willing to invest in the business.During our initial research, we came across compostable plastics, which were being promoted by some companies. However, on probing further, I realized making 100% corn starch-based bags would not be feasible. To reduce the cost, companies were adding substances like tar, calcium carbonate and other hazardous materials, and selling them as environment-friendly bags.Our products can burn like paper, dissolve in water and degrade when they come in contact with soil. That's because they contain no additives and are 100% biodegradable. Initially, due to the cost factor, it was difficult to sell our product in India.In Qatar, we launched a campaign with the environment ministry -Go Green Qatar. It saw the participation of 13 ambassadors from countries like Italy, Palestine, India, Saudi Arabia and UAE among others. The initiative was a success and we met former environment minister Prakash Javadekar, who inspired me to come back to India and set up a brand in consonance with the Swachh Bharat and Make In India initiatives. It was with his motivation that we launched the company in August 2016."

No, hes not some sort of underworld operative for whom Interpol has put out a red alert.Garry is a hobbyist who collects labels taken from beer bottles, an activity known as labeorphily. As a globe-trotting travel journalist, hes managed to collect beer labels from over a hundred countries, including a Rosy Pelican label from the now defunct Haryana product of that name.Beer label collectors, however, are not to be confused with people who collect beer mats and beer coasters from bars and are termed tegestologists.When you go to a restaurant do you pick up and pocket those little sachets of sugar and artificial sweeteners left on the table for putting in your tea or coffee? If you do, the chances are you could be a latent sucrologist waiting to come out of the closet. Sucrologists are people who collect sugar and other sweetener packets.If you find it hard to throw away all those Archie and Jughead and Amar Chitra Katha comic books, you might well have contracted a mild dose of pannapictagraphily, which is a passion for collecting comic books.Philatelists, of course, are people who collect stamps  and who also sometimes go by the alias of timbrologists  and are distinct from deltiologists who gather postcards.What is behind this obsession with collecting all manner of things? It would be both uncharitable and inaccurate to dismiss it as a mere acquisitiveness.All such collectors play by a set of self-imposed rules, which they will not break to add to their collections. Garry, for instance, collects only the labels of beers he has sampled, and wont accept such donations from well-meaning friends.Could the motivating drive behind collecting objects be an innate human desire to create harmony and order out of the randomness of things, a cohesive bringing together of scattered but similar elements? Perhaps.But what about collectors who collect the different names given to people who collect things? What should they be called? Omniterminologists?"

Other medications have no effect on heart risk, while still others lower the odds of heart disease but may have other drawbacks, like high cost or side effects.Its becoming clear, researchers say, that theres far too little evidence on how diabetes drugs affect the heart to make rational evidence-based judgments. If you think the landscape is confusing, it really is, said Dr Leigh Simmons, an internist in Boston.Daunting is how Dr JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Womens Hospital, describes the situation for patients and their doctors.There are 12 classes of drugs on the market and two or three different agents in each class. The drugs range in price from about $4 a month for older drugs to $700 a month for newer ones, and they have varying side effects. Many patients take more than one drug.The older, cheaper and more popular diabetes drugs were never tested for their effects on the heart  they were approved before any links were noticed.A particular drugs effect on blood sugar does not predict its effects on the heart. Even understanding the chemistry at work  the drugs act in very different ways to lower blood sugar  does not predict whether a particular medication will increase heart risk in a particular patient, researchers say.We cant predict what happens to people just based on the mechanisms of these drugs, said Dr Kasia J Lipska, a diabetes expert at Yale University who wrote a recent paper on the issue. We have to study large groups of patients and examine what drugs reduce complications of diabetes such as heart attacks, and in which patients.But that has rarely been done. These drugs are already approved; there is little incentive to do such expensive studies now. Its a disgrace that so little is known, said Dr Victor M Montori, a diabetes expert at the Mayo Clinic.No one disputes the importance of lowering blood sugar when levels are very high. Doing so may help prevent complications like kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the eyes, and may alleviate symptoms like fatigue and frequent urination. The starting point for lowering blood sugar is diet and exercise. But for many patients, that is not sufficient. Then doctors and patients are faced with two questions: How low should blood sugar go? And what drugs should be used to lower it?Doctors track blood sugar by testing for levels of a protein, hemoglobin A1C, which reveals average levels over the previous three months. The higher a patients A1C, the greater the risk of complications of diabetes.While this measurement is a good predictor of risk, the question is, who benefits from intensive blood sugar lowering and which drugs are best for whom? said Dr Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale.The target level varies among patients, though many do not realise it. They and their doctors often aim, at times obsessively, for an A1C level of seven. Yet that level is actually appropriate only for young, newly diagnosed people who have no other medical problems, Manson and others said.Older patients with other chronic conditions, like atherosclerosis, should not aim for such a low level, the researchers added. Studies find no obvious benefit to them  no real reduction in the rate of complications like kidney, nerve or eye disease.Perhaps more distressing, while higher levels of A1C are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, what is not clear is whether a drug that reduces A1C will also improve cardiovascular risk, said Montori. That was made abundantly clear in recent years when, at the insistence of the Food and Drug Administration, companies making some of the newer diabetes drugs began testing them to be certain they were not actually raising the chances of heart disease even as they lowered A1C in patients.The results were a surprise. At identical A1C levels, some drugs lowered risk, some did not change it  and some actually increased the chances of heart disease. Older and much cheaper diabetes medications, like metformin, have not been subjected to such tests, although they do have long and well established safety records. But whether they actually prevent heart problems is unknown, Montori noted.Greater riskNone of that has stopped doctors from urging patients to lower blood sugar at all costs. But many of their patients, particularly older ones, often take other medications, too. The more drugs they take to get to an A1C level of seven, the greater the risk of ensuing complications. And they run the risk that blood sugar levels will dip too low.Vito Ciaccia, 64, of Old Saybrook, Connecticut, learned he had diabetes 30 years ago. He spent years chasing an A1C of seven, spurred on by doctors who focused single-mindedly on that number. They were always upping the dosage of drugs, wanting to get to seven he said. One doctor was very adamant and very demanding. He told me if I didnt do what he said, I would not be here much longer. I felt the treatment was just to pound drugs in and hope they work, Ciaccia added.But he rarely hit that A1C target, and the drugs caused uncomfortable side effects. While he was taking them, his blood sugar dipped up and down, often going so low that he experienced sweating, confusion and dizziness. Had his doctors realised how tenuous was the connection between lowering A1C and heart disease, the biggest threat to these patients, they might have been less insistent. And he might have been less worried.I have patients who flip out if their A1C level is above seven, said Dr John Buse, an endocrinologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Some are desperate to get it to six. I try to talk them down, but sometimes I fail. I dont think there is evidence for such zealotry, he added.Ciaccia is now being cared for by Lipska. She tells him hell do fine with an A1C level higher than seven, and can avoid the low blood sugar episodes that were so distressing.And it was OK to take one drug  insulin  which he preferred over a pile of diabetes drugs. Her approach, Lipska said, is to be straightforward with patients about the choices of treatment. I tell them, this is what we know and this is what we dont know,' she said."

Like i start off casually talking about this back pain and the odds on it being arthritis as we age, that sort of stuff.I also ask him about my occasional ear infection and as we munch peanuts and start struggling with little tubs of sauce and butter that defy gravity i say, you know i also have this slight giddiness when i get up suddenly, keeping my BP under control i am, try the dessert, it is quite nice, thank goodness i dont have a sugar problem.A pleasant man clearly full of the milk of human kindness. We exchange visiting cards and just as we are leaving the plane i ask him if aspirin side effects were really an issue and we shake hands at the luggage carousel and this morning i get a bill of Rs 15,000 for services rendered at 31,000 feet.I am so appalled i get my lawyer on the line and tell her how incredibly greedy the human race has become, so selfish and can you believe it, he sent me a bill and she said, well you did ask him questions relating to your health and you got specialised information so he is kind of within his rights.I said, you too, it was just a pleasant conversation between fellow travellers and we were chatting about this and that  This and that being your health, she said little aware that i have been thinking of changing her for sheer ineptitude.It was just a happy little talk, i say, it isnt as if he whipped out his stethoscope and put me through an MRI or took X-rays on the flight, for heavens sake whose side are you on. She said, you asked my opinion, so i am giving it, you have no case, so pay up and stop raising your voice, i am not one of your minions.I dont have minions, i shouted, i dont even have a job, all i asked for is a little advice, like i am asking you and you are not billing me. There is a long silence on the phone. You are, you cant be serious. I dont see why not, she said, you are taking legal advice during office hours. But we are friends, i yell. And thats why you are looking to find a replacement, i will invoice you tomorrow."

The answer is a categorical yes. Is there a need to let Indians, especially the young, become aware of these, so that they are less ignorant about their own civilisational legacy? The answer is, again, yes.Can this exercise of recall and inform, that all post-colonial societies need to do, be done intelligently by those who do not know the difference between science and mythology, philosophy and ritual, fact and faith, and history and propaganda? The answer is a categorical no.Traditional branches of Indian medicine need revival. They embody centuries of careful clinical observation that treats the human body (and mind) holistically. Anyone familiar with the medical achievements of the sixth century surgeon Sushruta would think twice before dismissing Indias ancient medicinal wisdoms.The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy is, therefore, far from being an act of misplaced nostalgia. Why then did AYUSH do such a clumsy job of advising pregnant women on the wisdoms of yoga and naturopathy?The answer lies in not knowing the difference between what needs to be salvaged from the past and what needs to be updated in light of contemporary knowledge. Such knowledge need not entirely invalidate our ancient wisdoms but it may require an intelligent incorporation of what other branches of modern medicine rightfully tell us today.Thus, instead of only advising pregnant women to keep away from lustful thoughts and non-vegetarian food, the booklet produced by AYUSH, entitled Mother and Child Care, could have also emphasised the need for adequate nutrition rich in protein, iron, calcium and iodine, especially since half of all expecting mothers in India suffer from either malnutrition or anaemia.Incidentally, not everything the booklet says is obscurantist rubbish as some excessively westernised observers seem to think. Why must much of our intellectual class wait for some foreign scientist to proclaim that an atmosphere of serenity and harmony is good both for the expectant mother and the child? Modern medicine is increasingly acknowledging the power of the mind over the body, and pregnant women who strive to shun mental agitation could well be doing themselves and their future child a favour.Equally, what is wrong in the advice for expectant mothers to try and avoid refined flour, fried items, coffee, sugar and garam masala? Such advice, now offered ubiquitously by western medical practitioners, is, in fact, a validation of our yogic forebears.The key is to find the right balance between over-glorifying everything about our past and dismissing everything about it as obscurantist or communal or xenophobic or even unnecessary. One example of the former approach is Prime Minister Narendra Modis comment that plastic surgery of an advanced order must have existed thousands of years ago if an elephant head could be transplanted on a human body as is seen in Ganeshaji. He also said that the manner in which Karna was conceived by his mother in the Mahabharata showed that advanced genetic sciences existed in ancient India.Such comments devalue both ancient Indias real achievements and the delicate, symbolic meanings of mythology. Moreover they blur the lines between science and mythology, thereby caricaturing both. Lord Ganesha, with his elephant head, was not an advertisement for advanced genetic science. He symbolised, depending on individual interpretations, the imagination buttressing religious beliefs, in which man and nature were intertwined and representative of the one supreme energy called Brahma.Perhaps he was a haiku, where the sheer profiling of a riddle catapults the human imagination beyond the routine to the possibilities beyond. Similarly Karna represents a certain human predicament, which is far more important than the mythological representation of how he was conceived.There is also a great deal of illiterate aggression today in interpreting our past. Members of Bajrang Sena recently protested against the sale of Kamasutra books in Khajuraho. These high minded individuals have no idea of the pragmatic acceptance in Hindu tradition of the sensual as part of a balanced life, best represented in the four purusharthas or goals of life: dharma, artha, kama and moksha.Ethics, materialism, sensuality and salvation have philosophical validity in the canvas of human endeavours  and therefore Khajuraho and the Kamasutra, as also the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Gita, are part of the many-splendoured fabric that constitutes the Hindu world view.Vatsyayana, author of the Kamasutra, himself says that dharma, artha and kama, pursued in proportion and not in exclusion, lead automatically to the fourth purushartha, moksha. The self-righteous and ignorant prudishness displayed by Bajrang Sena is thus more representative of Victorian morality and the general colonial view that the natives were heathens with unmentionable carnal thoughts, than of the wisdom and balance of the Hindu vision of life.The remarkable refinements of ancient India need to be saved from the uninformed evangelism of self-anointed arbiters whose ignorance is only matched by their aggression. Equally, the disdainful dismissal by westernised critics of anything that pertains to our ancient past is misplaced. Great civilisations need the right balance between both these extremes."

The government has released a total of Rs 72 crore in five phases. When the first phase of the amount was deposited in the bank accounts, there was confusion as Aadhaar numbers were not linked to the bank accounts of the farmers. Now, the confusion has been cleared and the amount is remitted to their respective accounts.Additional Deputy Commissioner B R Poornima said around 90% of the compensation for crop loss has been released. The remaining 10% will be released soon and would be remitted to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, she said.According to the Agriculture department, ragi, cowpea and sesame that were grown on drylands and sugar cane and paddy grown on irrigated lands have withered. Maddur taluk is said to be the worst affected by drought as per the report submitted by the department. Crops grown on 28,226 hectare in the taluk is estimated to have been lost. Similarly, crops grown on 22,188 hectares in Mandya taluk and 18,800 hectares in Nagamangala have been lost due to drought.Speaking to DH, Rajasulochana, Joint Director for Agriculture, said, the officials who conducted survey to determine crops loss, had submitted a proposal to the government seeking Rs 102 crore towards compensation. It included Rs 28.92 crore for Maddur taluk, and Rs 20.27 crore for Mandya taluk. The Horticulture department too has submitted a report, seeking Rs 6.10 crore as compensation for coconut growers."

The cook assumed charge as director of the company on August 8, 2015. The firm was doing a business worth Rs 3.9 crore in 2013-14 and Rs 20.38 crore in 2014-15. After Bahadur took over, its revenue shot up to Rs 103.81crore in 2015-16. Before Bahadur joined the firm, its profit was just Rs 14,503 in 2014-15. After, he joined, the profit was Rs 4.39 lakh after tax deductions. One of its biggest expenses was Rs 67 lakh towards packaging goods manufactured by the company.Bahadur is one of the four people, who are either working in Gurjeet's sugar mills or have been employees in the past, and have collectively won mining contracts worth Rs 50 crore despite their annual income not exceeding Rs 6 lakh. TOI had disclosed that Bahadur's income tax re turns (ITR) and salary receipts had shown an income of just Rs 92,679 in 2015-16 and had Rs 4,840 in his Indusind Bank accounts in April 2017 before he won the mining site auction worth Rs 26.5 crore and even submitted Rs 13.5 crore as the first instalment.Opposition parties, including AAP , SAD and BJP , have accused Gurjeet of using Bahadur and others as fronts for the mining business. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has set up a judicial commission led by a retired Punjab and Haryana high court judge, Justice J S Narang, to look into the allegations. But AAP and SAD have questioned the commission's terms of reference, saying they do not include a probe into the money trail between the four men and Gurjeet.TOI is in possession of the balance sheets, annual property returns as well as profit and loss statements of R J Texfab.These documents further reveal that the company in 2015 also gave an unsecured loan of Rs 1.12 crore to the power minister.The firm gave unsecured loans running into Rs 75 lakh to Gur jeet's sons Rana Inder and Rana Ranjit Singh.The company states its purpose of business as ""manufacture, produce, with or without foreign collaboration and to purchase, sell, import, export or otherwise to deal in all types of cloth including furnishing fabrics, in India or elsewhere in the world. To carry on the business of merchants, brokers, agents, stockists, dealers, sellers and buyers of all kinds of yarn, fibres, fabrics"".Gurjeet's son Inder told TOI that their firms have a clean business record and have nothing to hide. ""Our business transactions have always been clean and we have maintained the highest standards of propriety ,"" he said.TOI had earlier disclosed that another Chandigarhbased firm Flawless Traders Pvt Limited where Bahadur was made director in August 2015, had investments of Rs 16 crore in shares in Gurjeet's firm Rana Polycot.Bahadur has told TOI that a Chandigarh-based businessman J S Randhawa has invested the money through him into the mining business. According to the balance sheets, Randhawa is a shareholder in R J Texfab with 32,100 shares. The value of these shares is Rs 3.2 lakh."

Besides, there were two samples of kulfi and milk lolly, which also failed quality test, and were found to be of sub-standard quality. They were having lesser fat than the prescribed limit as per Food Safety and Standard Act.The health department officials have collected 60 samples of milk, ice creams and juices from April 23 to May 31. The test reports have arrived. Still reports of 13 samples are yet to arrive.But, the highlight of the campaign launched by the health department remained the manufacturing unit which was unearthed on May 6. It is situated in Jaipuriyon Ka Bad at Sirsi Road.When the food safety officers inspected the factory they found that the manufacturer was allegedly using saccharin in orange ice-candies.The food safety officers had collected two samples of ice candy and milk candy. Besides, they had destroyed 1,000 ice-candies which were prepared with saccharin.Officials said that the orange candies are sold in large quantity and the manufacturer made it locally to cash in on the increasing demand in summers. Officials said that sugar is little expensive in comparison to saccharin. To make more profit, the manufacturer was allegedly using saccharin in place of sugar compromising with the health of children. Saccharin is 300 times sweeter than sucrose, the commonly used sugar, the officials said.According to health experts, saccharin is harmful to children, especially those who are under-14 years.It affects bones of the children.However, the test reports show that samples of juices collected from the city are safe for consumption."

Of this, it has been able to repair 70,030km roads, or 82%, Maurya said.Other than PWD's major share, 139km of 189km of national highways were repaired. National Highways Authority of India roads repaired 49km of its 60km and Panchayati Raj only 333km of its 3,890km. A total of 2,457km of 10,193km of Mandi Parishad roads, 489km of 3,716km of sugarcane department, 1,637km of 1,703km under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and 1,222km out of 6,455km of local bodies and municipal corporations' roads were made pothole-free. The irrigation department did not repair any of its 9,668km roads.Claiming that the progress report of some departments was not up to the mark because of lack of proper resources, Maurya said the Yogi government's bid to begin e-tendering in all contracts also hampered the road repairing considerably.The agreement between Union government and the UP government includes construction of seven elevated roads in Lucknow to ease traffic congestion. Maurya said the seven sections would come up between Lekhraj Market and Polytechnic Crossing on Faizabad Road, between Daliganj and IT Crossing, between Sarojininagar and Banthra, between Telibagh and SGPGI, between Engineering College Crossing and IIM turn, between Tedhipulia crossing and Sector 20 Indiranagar crossing and between Koneshwar crossing and Dubagga on Hardoi highway.The UP government has given its consent to a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of railways. Now, Bridge Corporation would construct the portion above railway lines unlike in the past when the railways used to do it. This would help in expediting the construction of railway overbridges in the state. The minister of railways also suggested that Bridge Corporation should get involved in laying of railway tracks."

Dar had done his post-graduation from BU's aquaculture department. He was among the six cops gunned down and mutilated by Lashkar terrorists in Anantnag on Friday.Students turned emotional while paying tribute to Dar. ""He was a man of substance. He was an intelligent and a brave policeman. We are all proud on him,"" said Dar's senior Akhilesh Raghuvanshi.Dar took admission in M.Sc (zoology) in 2006. He was in Bhopal for two years.Recalling the days when Dar was residing in the hostel, Raghuvanshi said, ""He became my friend on the very first day. Despite being a junior, he mixed up with everyone like sugar in water. His gentle behaviour and participation in every activity of the hostel was really admirable."" Dharmendra Singh , another senior of Dar, had a different relation with him. ""Despite being a Muslim he was the one who always took lead in Hindu's festival. I have lost a younger brother,"" said Dharmendra.Even those students who had never met Dar joined in large numbers. ""I have only heard about him. We are fortunate that we are living in the same hostel in which Dar used to live while pursuing his course,"" said a junior student Pankaj Singh.Citing an incident, a student who studied with him, said: ""We used to organise Saraswati Puja every year in the hostel. Dar used to take the lead in chanda collection and Saraswati Puja. Feroz was a secular person who knew how to respect other religions,"" he said.Feroz's hostel mates said he loved sports. ""However, his best hobby was sleeping. He used to play cricket and volleyball with us in front of the hostel,"" said another senior Manoj Diwakar. A man of quiet humour, Dar listed his ""zodiac"" as his only weakness.His friends and seniors knew that Dar would join police. ""He was always keen to serve society. From the way he spoke, we could gauge he was keen to don the uniform,"" said his seniors. The last line in a letter he wrote to a senior on December 13, 2006, said: ""And don't forget me."" They haven't. Dar's seniors Sanjay Raghuvanshi and other students were also present during the condolence meeting."

But, one of the most successful start-ups has emerged from two enterprising alumni from the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology ( VNIT )  the Doboz Solutions Pvt Ltd which at present has a turnover of Rs 75 lakh and a net profit of Rs 15 lakh.Doboz (means gift box in Hungarian) is a retention-marketing platform which enables firms and companies to create their own custom currency and loyalty programme through gift cards, promo codes, reward points and referral programs without having to build their own internal systems. Doboz has partnered with ICICI Bank and RBL Bank for their platform.Co-founded by Pravin Kamble, an ex-VNITian and 2001 graduate in electronics, and Mrudul Tarwatkar, a 2017 graduate, Doboz has its presence now in UAE and India. It is likely to go global next month with its ten-member team.""We started our start-up two years back with works like loyalty, reward and promotion managements for our clients along with referral and social campaigns,"" said Kamble.While Kamble left his highly paying job at New York as a technology banker for a decade who also built enterprise solutions for leading banks like JPMorgan, Citibank, Bank of America and Credit Suisse, Tarwatkar missed his exams due to poor attendance as he was more busy making software for the Doboz. Though the company was not officially incubated by anyone, it does have a recognition from the Centre for Innovation at CIVN-VNIT and IIM Ahmedabad.All the team members in the start-up have a similar history but Gorakh Ovhal, a Masters in Computer Application from Ambejogai is an example of how team work can change the fate of any venture's success. Until recently, he was working as a daily wager and a sugar cane-cutter but is now the company's software engineer.""I came to meet Tarwatkar from New York and we clicked. He is now the chief technology officer of the company. But Ovhal's story is amazing. He came to my office through an acquaintance. Now he is our software engineer. I left my marathon running and Tarwatkar his movies to sit round the clock to work,"" said Kamble.Doboz was chosen among the top ten winners at the Startupbootcamp Fintech, a leading accelerator on financial innovations and one of the largest start-up support organization in the world, to mentor and expose them to the world of financial investors and venture capitalists.Last year, Doboz got selected in the Facebook mentorship programme called FBstart which gave them $40,000 of credit to use various services. They were among the top eight start-ups in CIIE (IIM Ahmedabad incubator event called 'Pitch Town').But all this has not come so easily to the Doboz team. Kamble and Tarwatkar had tough time for seeking a loan for the start-up. ""All the so called start-up funding is hopeless. I was asked to mortgage property or land and was also asked a personal guarantee. What then is the difference between a bank loan and start-up funding? If you fail in your project you lose your business as well as your home,"" said Kamble, the CEO of the company. Kamble finally put in Rs75 lakh from his pocket to launch the start-up. But, now, he says there is no looking back.DOBOZ also has an app. ""It is not central to our solution but it is an enabler which complements the entire solution. So, assume you receive a gift card from your boss in your in-box. So what now? Normally people take a print out and take it to merchants or note down the 12 or 16 digit number over their mobile. But if you use Doboz as platform and have our app, the gift card will come directly to your digital wallet and you can redeem it anywhere,"" said Tarwatkar.The app has several other unique features too, he added. ""You can share your wallet (value) of gift cards with your friends and family; can make multiple wallets with different or the same cards and share it with the same or many different people; partially redeem your card etc,"" said Tarwatkar.The other members of Doboz team are Gaurav Dhandre, Ankur Pohekar, Nikhil Dandekar, Ashish Jambhulkar, Shubhangi Taklikar, Poonam Wasnik and Ketan Mate.DOBOZ HIGHLIGHTS* Is a retention marketing platform providing end to end solutions for retention marketing for all kinds of clients* Businesses can even opt for exclusive branding of their gift card* Each corporate can have a separate dash board where they can see the complete set-up to be a better decision maker for next year and save costs* Is user friendly and sign-up takes just a minute and there is no installation fee* Charges a small cut on the face value of the card of brand sold from its platform* Is targeting 500 customers in the first year* Is raising Rs 2 cr to scale up its marketing, sales and operations"

Senior RSS functionaries are also likely to suggest ways to carry forward the RSS agenda and advise ways to improve various sectors.A senior RSS functionary told TOI that Laghu Udyog Bharti has expressed reservation on the new industrial policy being launched in the state. Its general secretary Ravindra Singh in an earlier press communique had raised objections saying there was no encouragement for the shut and old industries of the state. He said monetary incentives announced for small-scale industries are very little. Singh has demanded that the incentives being given to big industries should also be given to small-scale industries.Singh has also demanded one-time assistance for the closed small-scale industries.The three-day meeting would have discussions on such government initiatives and shortcomings, the RSS functionary concluded."

During this time, many pop-up stalls serving Ramzan delicacies mushroom on streets across the city. So, it won't be hard to find eateries where you can tuck into food that is made specially for iftar.

Check out the number of food stalls and the variety of food available in areas like Periamet, Royapettah and Egmore, and you'd know what we are talking about.Farooq Ali Syed of Pista House, who has set up a stall with his brother in Chennai, says, ""Food scene in Chennai during Ramzan is definitely improving every year.

""We were the pioneers in getting haleem to Chennai, in 2007. It was all about educating people at that time and getting them to taste haleem, which is an acquired taste for many. Now, the market has opened up, and how! Though there are several places, both big and small, serving iftar specials, there aren't that many takers, yet. It is still small compared to other big cities. We have a long way to go, but there is definitely an increase,"" says Abid. From specials like mutton haleem, Hyderabad biryani, mutton and chicken starters, gravies like dum ka murgh, roast mutton, aloo gosht korma and not to miss, the special nombu kanji  there is no dearth for options in this city. The spurt in demand has only opened up an increase in variety, too. ""Haleem is a sell-out every single day. Owing to the growing demand, this year, we have also started making chicken haleem.

Bhavya selected Pilibhit Tiger Reserve for her study in reference to more than half-a-dozen killings of villagers by tigers in just three months.The GTF is an international organization working in the field of tiger conservation in countries where the big cat survives. Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam are its member countries apart from India.According to additional secretary general of GTF and senior Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer SP Yadav, the study in question primarily aims at providing a feedback to the Union government as well as National Tiger Conservation Authority ( NTCA ) for their policy intervention over this issue.Speaking with TOI over the phone from Delhi, Yadav said, ""As a study on this vital topic has never been carried out in India for official reports, Bhavya has been permitted to review and evaluate the after-effects of man-tiger conflicts on social and economic conditions of residents of the area.""The 17-year-old who studies science, maths and economics in school, TOI learnt, was exposed to the jungle when she was a child as her father, Ramesh Panday, is a forest officer.

The CM has told a few of his close party colleagues that he is in no mood to give a long rope to Matoshree any more.Senior state BJP functionaries will discuss the issue with Amit Shah, the party's national president, when he visits Mumbai on June 17, sources said on Tuesday. Shah is expected to meet Maharashtra BJP functionaries during his three-day stay in the city.""We have two options before us. Either create a split in the Congress-NCP or the Sena to prop up our minority regime or go for mid-term elections. A sizeable section in the party is in favour of the second option,"" said a key state BJP functionary. With 123 MLAs under its belt, the Fadnavis ministry has to, much against its wish, rely on the 63 Sena MLAs' support for its survival on the floor of the assembly.However, favourable findings of a recent opinion poll has triggered confidence in the BJP rank and file about freshelections in Maharashtra. The poll says that should the state assembly elections be held sometime in November or December this year, the BJP is slated to win more than 140 seats in a house of 288 MLAs. Sceptics, however, say the farmers' strike could bring down the BJP's tally considerably.""The BJP's TRP is intact across the nation, thanks to Narendra-ji's (Modi) unabated popularity and the Opposition's inability to throw up a charismatic leader to take on the PM,"" said a party MLA. Factors such as Fadnavis' 'Mr Clean' image, and his emphasis on infrastructure and good governance will stand the party in good stead at the hustings, he added.Yet, the farmers' strike, which entered the sixth day on Tuesday, has brought to the fore the internal contradictions in the state BJP, said political experts. Barring a lukewarm statement here and there by a minister or two, there has been no concerted strategy by either the Maharashtra BJP or the state cabinet to lend unflinching support to Fadnavis in his hour of crisis, they pointed out. Said a senior bureaucrat, ""The chief minister is seen as a lonely figure battling on all fronts.""Moreover, Fadnavis' move to broker peace with the coordination committee of the striking farmers by announcing a partial loan waiver has backfired miserably. As a result, the rival sections promptly geared up to launch a fresh offensive on the already beleaguered Fadnavis regime. The Congress-NCP's strategy is to use the strike to make inroads into the regions which do not grow cash crops such as sugar-cane, said a senior state Congress functionary.The 40-something splinter groups of farmers, which are spearheading the strike across the state, have turned down Fadnavis' offer of partial loan waiver which, if implemented, will entail an additional burden of Rs 30,000 crore on the state exchequer. Experts say the partial loan waiver may not help the state's 31 lakh debt-ridden farmers tide over their escalating financial losses.Fadnavis is said to be deeply upset with the Sena for its open support to the striking farmers. In Jalgaon, Dhule and Nashik districts, Sena functionaries joined the Kisan Kranti Morcha stir and pelted stones at vehicles ferrying goods and foodgrains to local markets.A delegation of agitating farmers met Raj Thackeray at his Shivaji Park residence on Tuesday. The MNS president said the state government should create infrastructure--such as warehouses, godowns, cold storages and a smooth transport network--to help agriculturists get decent returns for their farm produce.Meanwhile, Saamna on Tuesday warned the Fadnavis government that empty assurances would not help resolve the farmers' agitation. Urging the state government to accept the farmers' demand for complete loan waiver and minimum support price for agricultural produce, the Sena mouthpiece said the ""hundred per cent"" Maharashtra Bandh on Monday reflects the anger brewing among farmers.""Outburst of farmers collective ire will lead to a grave crisis,"" warned Saamna and reiterated support to the farmers' on-going agitation."

""If this doesn't work, the party will then have to move court,"" AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira said at a press conference.Khaira added, ""Just like Vijay Mallya, Rana Gurjeet too could leave the country and his passport should be confiscated. The Uttar Pradesh government has already initiated such a move in view of default in payments by three sugar mills owned by Gurjeet's family. As per news reports, cane commissioner of Uttar Pradesh has said that the four sugar mills belonging to his family have defaulted payment to the farmers to the tune of Rs 202 crore. The UP government has lodged an FIR against them and ordered impounding of their passports. ""Khaira demanded that the money trail of Amit Bahadur, a former employee of Rana should have been included in the terms of inquiry to trace the source of the amount of Rs 13 crore to bid for the auction. ""First, the government gives time to those under the scanner to defend themselves. Then a retired judge known to the minister is picked to conduct the inquiry. The inquiry should been handed over to the Chandigarh police,"" he said, adding that AAP rejects the judicial commission.The party demanded that there were 17 other suspicious mining contracts and the entire bidding process should be cancelled. Khaira said Rana is part of a cartel and there are two other Congress leaders who have stakes in the mining business. ""The cartel formed to hijack sand mining trade in Punjab at the behest of Rana Gurjeet Singh includes ""benami"" investments of Ramanjit Singh Sikki MLA Khadur Sahib and Laddi Sherowali defeated Congress candidate from Shahkot and close associates of the accused Minister.

Investigations are now expected to spread across state as agencies expect similar leakages in other districts.According to officials there is an entry tax of 0.25% on sugar that comes from the states like UP, Maharashtra, Gujarat and MP. However, in the investigation, it was observed that some of the dealers did not register while some others, though registered, were not paying tax.Sugar being an essential commodity is exempted from VAT. However, traders dealing in this commodity are required to pay 0.25% of entry tax when purchased from outside Rajasthan Sources claim that sugar of about Rs 1,263 crore was purchased by the dealers in Surajpole Mandi at Jaipur over the period of five years. However, nearly 150 dealers were found to be evading entry tax which is estimated to be Rs 4-5 crore. Added with penalty and interest, the realization is expected to be around Rs 9-10 crore.Similarly in Alwar district, one the major market of sugar in the state, 13 such dealers were found to be evading the entry tax. As per records, in past three years, sugar of Rs 90.74 crore was purchased by the dealers.Commercial taxes department ( CTD ) will now assess tax penalty and interest and will soon send notices to evaders. ""Dealers will get the opportunity to present their stand and if they failed to put any rational reasons, they will be asked to pay penalties,"" said an official of CTDAgencies meanwhile have broadened their scope of investigation and are at present carrying it out in Ajmer and Bharatpur. It is likely that similar exercise will carry out in almost all the districts of the state.""Sugar is something whose consumption is universal.

Farmer protests in several parts of the country are now threatening to snowball into a major crisis for both the central and state governments. How these protests are handled in states like Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan  where assembly elections are due next year  carries extra political weight because these state results will help set the tone for the 2019 national elections.In MP, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans assiduously built agri success story is looking ragged now. In Karnataka, Siddaramaiah, the custodian of Congresss last stronghold in the south, finds himself immersed in water shortage problems for sugarcane farmers, with opposition BJP threatening to rouse up another agitation if his government does not write off farm loans. In Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje is being cornered by both the Congress opposition and organisations linked to RSS, which are demanding better irrigation facilities and higher MSP for crops and of course farm loan waivers.Agriculture contributes about 17% of GDP but employs around 50% of the countrys workforce. This is simply unsustainable. Playing the narrow politics of agitations and waivers neither the BJP nor Congress leadership is showing effective leadership on the national imperative to move a greater portion of the agri workforce into other industries, to create new jobs, especially more high-productivity and high-wage jobs. Its not just about unemployment. Niti Aayog has stressed that India also has a severe underemployment problem. A young mob increasingly short of work even in harvesting and sowing seasons portends more rancourous protests in the future.The MP, Karnataka and Rajasthan chief ministers may be counting too much on the infighting in opposition ranks in their states. Chouhan and Raje may also draw strength from the continuing popularity of the prime minister, which would help them at the hustings next year. But when farmers are in acute distress even in states with very high crop productivity, it really should be wake-up call for political parties to build a constructive consensus on innovative agricultural and jobs policies. Their failure to move forward threatens to shove aspirational Indians backward."

And, in a world where brands of fountain pens like Sailor, Pilot, Montblanc rule the roost, Ranga handcrafted pens in ebonite have carved a niche.M P Kandan, son of Tiruvallur-based craftsman M Pandurangan who owns the brand, takes us to the one room factory in his simple house.Pandurangan, who worked in nib feeder factory when young, began crafting pens five decades ago, because I dont know any other workHe has travelled a long way since working on foot-operated machines, but he hasnt forgotten his origins. An old foot-operated machine he worked on still lies in a corner of the room. We use it during power shutdowns, says Kandan.The brands customers, Kandan says, are from all over the world. There are many top Indian bureaucrats too. Most we get through word-of-mouth publicity, he adds and says many are repeat customers. Weve partners and dealers all over the world, with our customer base spread over 100 countries, he says.The nibs, in iridium and gold variants, are sourced from Germany-based Bock and the pens assembled as per clients request. The company, with gold-nibbed pens as its specialty, also makes ball pens.Each pen can take around two hours to make, based on the request. Whatever your choice  thin or thick, long or short, with ink barrel or ink syringe, and gloss or matte finish  it is fulfilled here. A customer can even send the nib of his/ her choice to the factory or travel to Tiruvallur and do it personally. Are there challenges? Well, not much. Everything is organised, so mostly its smooth, says Pandurangan. At times customers send us some material and request that we craft a pen from it, which is challenging.Kandan, in explanation, says the ebonite rods for the pens are usually available at a length whereas customers send the material just enough to make a pen. So we have to be extra careful to ensure we do not damage it while finishing.Asked about the future, Pandurangan, with a smile, says everyone in his family knows to make pens. For bulk orders he is assisted by Kandan and daughter Rajeswari. His elder daughter Padmavati helped before she relocated after marriage. My wife Chengilakshmi and daughters help with packaging for bulk orders, says Pandurangan.How much does he make in a day? Depends. If most of it is of the same type, we can make up to six pens in a day per person, he says.The most unique pen order they received, Pandurangan says, was the sugarcane pen. A regular client, says Kandan, commissioned two sugarcane pens like the bamboo pens in demand now. They sent us the blanks, which are not so easy to work with. We had to be very careful, and that stressed appa [Pandurangan] a bit. But finally when it was done, everyone was happy, Kandan recalls."

It got its 'chai' name from the country's first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru.After a long disappearance, the roti has returned this year to the kitchens of Akbari Gate. One can see large crowds gather during iftar and later in the evening at the city's busiest food junction this time of the year.The place where the maghzi pista roti was invented is the legendary Raheem's, owned by Haji Zubair Ahmad. People gather to savour the golden flaky bread prepared with several ingredients.""The shortage of buffalo meat has created a flutter among food lovers this Ramzan. The reason why we decided to bring back the old tradition of this roti is that it is eaten with Kashmiri chai or regular chai and not with 'paya' or 'nahari',"" says Ahmad.The roti was introduced by Ahmad's great grandfather Hakeem Haji Abdul Ghani in 1850.""It was a day during Ramzan and it was peak summer. Being a Hakeem, he innovated a special roti which could meet the nutrition need of the body,"" says Ahmad.He goes on to add that whenever Jawahar Lal Nehru was in Lucknow in the 1950s, he would stay in Farangi Mahal and order the 'maghzi pista roti'.""My father Haji Fakhruddin Ahmad served it to him with tea. Just after his first bite, Nehru termed the roti 'chai wali roti'. From that day, whenever Nehru would arrive in Lucknow, he would order the 'chai wali roti'.The original name of the roti comes from its creator Hakeem Ghani, who was a royal chef. It is derived from the ingredients of the bread. There are five major seeds that make up the recipe. These are seeds of bottle gourd, water melon, melon, pumpkin and cucumber. The finest flour, sugar, butter, a large amount of pistachios and mint and coriander leaves are then added to it. These ingredients help maintain the temperature of the body and give strength in soaring summer.People who had come to relish the roti at Akbari Gate said they did not know the story behind it but when they held it in their hand, its aroma and taste took them in another world. When eating the 'maghzi pista roti', however, they said they did not miss nahari or meat."

Thousands of traders in Mysuru city have already enrolled under the GST network. A few have also decided to slow down their businesses until they get used to the new system. Some of them are eager to clear old stocks while others have taken it in their stride and have decided to wait and watch.Shopkeeper A E Louis, who deals with vessels, also the treasurer of Mandya District Chamber of Commerce and Industries, told DH that, If the invoice is raised by implementing GST, the prices will overshoot the maximum retail price (MRP). If the product is sold above the MRP, it is an offence and no customer is ready to pay more. Hence, the traders are confused. Who will bear the loss incurred from selling old stock?Pharma companiesPharma companies, meanwhile, have acceded to bear the expected loss of 5% post GST. This has come as a relief for druggists. K Prabhakar of Lakshmi Drug Agencies, Mandya, said that, Post GST, the price of various products may come down but if it turns out to be otherwise, it would surely cause losses to the traders. I do not have too many old medicines and will replenish stocks only after the implementation of GST, he said.Farmers sparedThe GST will have an impact only on major crops as others come under zero taxation. Sugarcane, coconut, paddy and ragi are the major crops of the district and all fall under zero taxation. It will not affect the farmers as they do not come under the GST network and thus will be spared of the confusion of the new taxation system. GST will, however, be applicable if their produce comes under commercial crop category.For instance, if they sell jaggery in retail, it does not invite tax, but if the same product is branded, it comes under GST purview. Normal coconut oil is not taxed but branded products invite taxes. However, farmers have no clue about the effects of GST on them. They are concerned only if their crops fetch a good price, said Raitha Sangha district president Shambunahalli Suresh.Rice to cost moreS C Basavaraj of Basaveshwara Agro Rice Industries said that procurement and sale of paddy does not come under GST. Rice invites 5% GST only if it is packaged and sold under a brand name. The price of rice may increase by Rs 5 per kg, he said."

From 2014 to date, the department has earned nearly Rs 1.83 crore just by e-auctioning the number ""0001"" in different series (different strings of alphabets).Availability of the coveted number is now scarce as the department has run out now scarce as the department has run out of series with which the number can be provided. ""The second most-sought-after number is 0009, followed by 0007, as these numbers are considered lucky by many,"" an official said.""There is a huge craze for fancy numbers, particularly among youngsters, and it has only increased since we put the bidding process completely online some time ago,"" the official said.Due to great demand, the minimum reserve price for bidding for the registration number 0001 is Rs 5 lakh, followed by Rs 3 lakh for numbers 0002 to 0009, Rs 2 lakh for 0010 to 0099, 0786, 1000, 1111, 7777 and 9999, Rs 1 lakh for numbers such as 0100, 0111, 0300, 0333, etc., and Rs 20,000 for any other registration number. E-auctions are scheduled in the first week of every month for registration numbers with a reserve price of Rs 1 lakh and above, and every week for any other registration number.The e-auction is conducted by the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd on behalf of the transport department.Earlier, allotment of fancy registration numbers, popularly known as VIP numbers, was purely discretionary. In 2014, the Delhi government had framed rules wherein a minimum reserve price for these numbers was fixed and it was decided to conduct e-auctions for these numbers.Even though e-auctions of registration numbers began in 2014, the process was cumbersome. It was only recently that the department made the process completely online, with no manual intervention.""Earlier, applicants had to come with a draft and make a security deposit, and then they would get an allotment letter. And they had to make a lot of rounds of the department to complete the process,"" the official said. ""Now the entire process, including e-payment, is online,"" he said."

That is why we are maintaining a low profile,"" a member of the Anjuman said.Community members, however, said that they faced severe difficulties during Ramadan due to lack of adequate supplies. ""We require some specific items, such as chickpeas, pakoras and dates, to break our day-long fast. We will have a big namaz on Thursday evening and the alvida jumma on Friday . We need a lot of things to prepare for these events. Even basic items like sugar are not available in adequate quantities,"" another Anjuman member said.The community is making efforts to procure sacrificial animals and food items for the festival but goods have become expensive. ""Sugar, if available, is being sold at Rs 60-65 per kilogram. Even then, adequate quantities aren't available. We are going from one market to the other in search of commodities. Even if there are stocks, we don't have cash to buy items. The banks are closed.We just hope for a few days relaxation before the festival on Monday for the sake of our children,"" an elder community member said.A tailoring business owner in Darjeeling sounded dejected. ""People haven't been able to buy new clothes for their families. Usually , my business flourishes during Eid. I had 20 tailors from the plains working for me. All of them have left and the orders remain unfinished.Though our basic needs are being met, no preparations for the festival have been made yet, he said.Most Muslims in Darjeeling communicate in Nepali and consider themselves as locals. They said they would be greatly disappointed if the Gorkha leadership doesn't make an exception for Eid."

The leaders have said they will block all the national highways in the region on June 16.Various farmers' organisations, such as the Bhartiya Kisan Andolan, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Asli) and Ajgar Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, have pledged their support to the call for blocking national highways.""We have prepared a detailed plan and have people supporting us in each village of western UP. They are coming together under the new banner of the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. There will be lakhs of farmers out on the highways and we will not allow any vehicular movement for three hours in the afternoon of June 16,"" said Harpal Singh, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Asli), a breakaway faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union founded by legendary farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait.""We are not demanding anything outrageous. Before the 2014 elections, PM Narendra Modi himself had promised the implementation of MS Swaminathan commission recommendations. It has been three years. Farmers are committing suicide across the country and the government is not bothered,"" he added.The main demands of the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh are waiver of all farmer loans, and assurance of income of more than 50% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan panel in 2006. ""Our demands are the same as those of our brothers in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The government has dealt mercilessly with them. The time has come to show them the power of the farmers. Farmers across the country will be out on the streets on June 16,"" said Kuldeep Tyagi, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Andolan.Farmers across the sugarcane belt are preparing for the blockade. ""We will be there in full numbers. This is a matter of life and death for us and we will make our voices heard,"" said Ravinder Choudhary, a farmer in Daurala on the outskirts of Meerut. ""We will take all our tractors out on the highways and not allow any vehicle to pass,"" said Monu Choudhary, a farmer near Sardhana in Meerut. ""It's going to be a bitter harvest for the government which ignored us for so long,"" said Sachin Rathi, a farmer in Muzaffarnagar."

There are abundant stories out there about lives that have been transformed for the better once people have started practising yoga. On International Yoga Day , we talk to a few about how the mental, spiritual and physical discipline has been a life-changing experience:Lovely John, an 48-year-old ardent yoga practitioner, had been struggling to find a way to reduce her sugar levels, which used to routinely shoot up to 255 mg/dL and she had to inject at least 35 mm of insulin every day to keep it in check. ""There weren't any places that I didn't go for treatment. It was always a concern for me,"" she says. As a last resort, she decided to try out yoga under the training of Omana Ajay and ""it did wonders"" for her. ""Practising yoga daily brought down my sugar level to 102 mg/dL,"" she says.Similarly, for 55-year-old Parvathi Janardhanan, an entrepreneur, periathritis or frozen shoulder and knee pain were recurrent concerns, and at the age of 28, she was cautioned by doctors that she might have to turn to wheelchairs.Cut to the present and she proudly says that she is walking with ease, all because of yoga. ""There were days when I couldn't even take a step forward without discomfort. But now I have trekked Mount Batur at Bali, along with my husband. From someone who was told that I would have to seek refuge in a wheelchair to venturing to mountaineering, my life has seen a sea change after yoga,"" she says.Media person and entrepreneur, Sanjitha S Kanth had to go through a lot of emotional turmoil, when her mother was diagnosed with cancer. She says, ""It was a traumatic experience, as I had to work, take care of her and also look after myself, as I was pregnant at that time. The process of chemotherapy and blood transfusion sessions were mentally draining for me. Yoga came to my rescue and helped me find mental balance.""Her mother's death though piled on more stress that had physical consequence as well. She developed hyper thyroidism and began putting on weight. ""From around 55 kg, I had become almost 90 kg. I was warned not to take too much tension, as it would risk the life of my child too. With the help of yoga, I meditated and to my amazement, without taking any medication, all my health woes vanished,"" Sanjitha says. And soon, she was back to being her old self again. Yoga has helped her find a new life, emotionally and physically, she adds.Sonal Joshi, 55, was bedridden for a while because of multiple ailments. Practising yoga relieved all her problems in just six months, and she was so intrigued by it that she equipped herself with all courses and started imparting the knowledge to others too.She says, ""Nothing seemed to be working for me until I took up yoga. Later, the thought of sharing the joy to many others made me pursue Masters on the same from a prominent University in Bangalore."" Sonal now trains people at Mattanchery, and says even her memory power has improved.Another trainer Nuthan Manohar, who teaches at Panampilly Nagar, recollects how she used to take medicines for depression, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, ligament tears and many more. ""Within a month of practising yoga, I could steer clear of all my health issues. That was when I realised how you could you use your own body and breathing to improve the quality of your life,"" she says.For her, yoga has helped her focus better, multitask, sense intentions of people and assess group dynamics well. ""The greatest benefit is to be aware of my own idiosyncrasies. Once we know that, we can actually work to evolve ourselves better,"" she says.Those who practise yoga say that their whole approach towards life has changed since taking it up. Sonal says, ""From a 'no, I can't do' attitude, I have now switched to saying 'why not?' Earlier, I had to force myself out of bed, but now, I am more inspired."" She adds that she has also been invited to teach yoga in her grandchildren's school.""The kids are really proud that I would be teaching at their school, and they couldn't be any happy to say that I am their granny,"" Sonal beams.For Mariam Thomas Moolapat, who used to work as a branch manager at a private airline, yoga helped overcome her inhibitions that eroded her self-confidence. ""I had gradually started developing fear to go out somewhere alone, and I did not have much of a social circle. That was when my son pushed me to join classes,"" she says.Her trainer Girija Prajapati, who is known for training many prominent personalities, used to pump confidence in her by saying, 'Ningalk pattum, pattum, pattum...', Mariam adds, making it her maxim as well. ""Yoga has paved way for a total metamorphosis. While earlier I couldn't even climb stairs, now I feel I can do anything, and I also see to it that I do.""Often, physical weaknesses take their toll on the mental well-being, by affecting morale. All thanks to yoga, Lovely says, ""I am 48 years old, but I feel very light, as though I am just 17. Yoga makes me feel young each day.""It has helped change her perspective towards life at large. ""The way I approach people and life has changed. I used to always get miffed at things very easily,"" she says. ""Standing in kitchen for long hours earlier used to make me uncomfortable. But today, I hum intermittently and have control over my meandering thoughts.""Looking smart and younger is an add-on to this healthy practise, says Parvathi. ""The different body movements and breathing exercises give you a proper figure, bringing about a visible change. Moreover, the skin starts glowing too,"" she says."
