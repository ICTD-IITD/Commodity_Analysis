Earlier, a 2% premium was deducted on the loan taken by farmers compulsorily under the insurance scheme. Farmers were told that this amount would go towards compensation for them in case more than 50% of their crop got destroyed. Farmers, however, contended that the sugarcane crop never gets destroyed on such a large scale and that damage to the sturdy crop, even in a very bad scenario, doesn't exceed 25-30%.Deputy director (agriculture) Jaspal Singh said, ""Farmers were opposing the scheme. We had written a letter in this regard to the agriculture secretary. Now the crop insurance scheme has been made voluntary for sugarcane farmers. A notification is set to be released soon. We have asked the lead district manager that no bank should cut the premium from the credit card of the sugarcane farmers without their consent. If any farmer wants to avail the benefit of the scheme, he can contact the respective bank.""Confirming the development, lead bank officer Ajay Kumar Singh said, ""Last year, an amount of Rs 12.15 crore was deducted as the premium from farmers in Bijnor alone under this scheme.""The central government had launched the ambitious crop insurance scheme that promised lowest premiums for farmers in January last year. Sugarcane framers who were kept out of the scheme's ambit nationally were included in the scheme in UP.It immediately faced stiff opposition from cane farmers in UP who declared it an ""agricultural tax"". Farmers in several parts of UP, especially cane-growing western parts, staged dharnas and held road blockades. They also threatened to lock the doors of banks if the premium was deducted without their consent.Bijnor district president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Digambar Singh, said, ""There are over 2 lakh sugarcane farmers in Bijnor, the second largest cane-growing district in the state. During the kharif season last year, banks deducted an amount of Rs 12.15 crore as premium under the scheme just in Bijnor district. The scheme was not beneficial for sugarcane farmers as their crop is not damaged so much during natural disasters. And the scheme allows compensation only if the damage is more than 50%. The scheme was being run to benefit insurance companies."""

The bar code would be connected to computer data to ensure each batch is sold by the rightful dealer.Talking to TOI, state excise minister Jai Pratap Singh said provision of chip on hologram was also discussed but because of financial constraints, the more feasible proposal to introduce bar code system might get approval. Once bar coding is introduced, the department would be able to track each consignment easily, said the minister.Bar coding might be useful in case of countrymade liquor, said a trader, for the reason that quota of country made liquor is allocated to a number of dealers. ""Once a dealer finishes his quota, he purchases more stock from the government. Since additional quota is expensive, many dealers contact their counterparts from other districts and buy out their unsold stock,"" said the trader.In case of foreign made liquor too, bar coding could help check exchange from special zone to normal excise zone, opined another trader.The minister told TOI that introducing bar coding would require funds, so a proposal would be placed before chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi for approval. The policy is expected to taken three to four months, the minister said and added that officials have visited nine states and taken inputs about the policy in the respective states. More inputs and suggestions are being incorporated from sugarmill owners and other stakeholders, the minister said.Lucknow liquor association president S P Singh, however, said bar coding might not be useful unless illicit liquor trade is checked. He also demanded that new policy should do away with lottery system and added that if at all it remains, it should have proper criteria like linking of the trader with Aadhar card and all money transactions should be transparent."

Some distributors have even shut their operations in the run-up to the new tax regime, citing ongoing software upgrade.""We predicted this situation and have been planning for the GST rollout for months. We use technology and predictive algorithms to plan for our inventory which is helping us stock up well for the next few days,"" Dr Dhaval Shah, co-founder of PharmEasy, said. ""Also, a majority of our customers are through subscription and we know well in advance what they will need and thereby ensure they don't face problems,"" he added.PharmEasy also alerted customers to place orders in advance for a few products that might not be available.Surendra Mantena, chief operating officer at MedPlus, said, ""Depending on how frequently a drug is being ordered and whether they are used for chronic conditions, we have created a bank of drugs to meet the shortage in the market."" While MedPlus usually follows a cycle of lifting drugs for 15 days, this time they did so for an additional 10 to 15 days.Another leading online medicine supplier too confirmed that it had stocked up on more frequently used drugs  such as those for fever, common cold, cough, antacids and paediatric medicines  and those used regularly by patients with hypertension, diabetes, cardiac issues and rheumatoid arthritis.""We are ensuring that we have access to all key medicines during this transition phase... But there could be shortage of some medicines in smaller towns. As the situation becomes clear, we will send an advisory to our customers. The shortage, if any, should be only for a few days of transition. There is no cause for panic. If doctors prescribe generics instead of specific brands, chances are high that at least a few brands will be available through the transition,"" said Prashant Tandon, founder of online pharmacy 1mg.Customers relieved""My father-in-law cannot skip his dose for even a day due to high levels of sugar,"" said Sangeeta Sharma, 32. ""After online pharmacies alerted me in time about the possible shortage of medicines from next month, I have now stocked up on a month's medicine.""Sneha P, 36, registered with an online pharmacy after local chemists failed to procure her mother's arthritis drugs. ""My mother is a patient of acute rheumatoid arthritis and due to unavailability of medicine in drug store, she missed her dosage for two days till I bought it from an online pharmacy and stocked up for the next two months,"" said Sneha."

The price of sugar has shot up by Rs 25 per kilogram and the prices of eggs have almost doubled.But worse may still be in store with supplies of edibles dwindling and replenishing the stock becoming extremely difficult due to problems in movement of goods vehicles. The residents who are the worst affected are too scared to identify themselves while narrating their plight.""The situation is grim here.People do not have disposal cash in hand and most of the shops are shut. Some shops that are open are selling things at very high prices,"" said a resident of Darjeeling.According to local people, the situation is even worse in Kalimpong and Kurseong with reports of people stopping goods-laden truck and fleeing with the edibles and other ingredients of daily use. ""Since these two places are not in focus, the situation is even worse here.We are fast running out of food and other things,"" said a resident of Kalimpong.Joyoshi Dasgupta, district magistrate of Darjeeling, did not comment but sources ad mitted that the prices were skyrocketing in the absence of any replenishment. ""If the situation continues like this, nobody knows what the condition will be,"" said an officer. Many GJM supporters did distribute vegetables and biscuits in some pockets on Tuesday but they were clearly inadequate to cater to the widespread demand.Chotan Mukhia, a grocer in Darjeeling, said: ""Two days ago a few women came to my residence at around 2am and requested for some vegetables and sugar. They did not have any money on them. I told them I could not open my shop because other people may attack and take away the ingredients since there is a crisis. But they insisted so much that I had to relent and give them what they wanted. They promised to pay me later. I had to trust them,"" said Mukhia.Another crisis is looming over the public health care system since the Darjeeling District hospital is left with only 40 units of blood. It is also the referral centre for the primary health care centres in the district.The doctors are not issuing medicines with short expiry dates that are being desptached to primary health centres."

However, the core committee of ministers, headed by revenue minister Chandrakant Patil, fixed some eligibility criteria for the loan advance. And some of the norms were not acceptable to the farmer groups holding talks with the state government.Most of these norms were revised on Tuesday and a fresh notification will be issued incorporating them. One of the norms fixed by the committee was that farmers with four-wheelers would not be eligible for the advance. Now, that norm has been revised and farmers who own a vehicle of up to Rs 10 lakh will be eligible for this advance.Similarly, the government had decided that families of government servants or members of the panchayat samiti or sugar mills administrative body will not get the benefit. Even this norm has been revised: Now, a government servant who draws a salary less than Rs 20,000 and is also a farmer can avail of this scheme. Members of the panchayat samiti too would be included in the scheme. Similarly, members of the administrative bodies of sugar mills too would be eligible.On Tuesday, most district cooperative banks in the state were unable to provide the Rs 10,000 instalment citing cash crunch or low liquidity. Government sources said they have asked all the banks to make the necessary funds available.In a related development, the government has said it will no longer hold talks with the coordination committee of the farmers after the latter staged a protest on Monday against the decision to cap the loan waiver at Rs 1 lakh and set the cut-off date as June 30, 2016. ""We will now hold talks with small groups in their individual capacity. The committee that calls itself representatives of the farmers is fuelling the issue to gain political mileage out of it. So, the government will not hold any discussions with them from now,"" said a senior BJP minister, who is on the committee."

Ethanol is mainly obtained from sugarcane residue, but can also be produced from various biowastes like agri-residue.Although petrol and diesel have been kept out of the purview of the GST for now, taxation on ethanol and biodiesel will mean that the cost of blending will result in higher cost of blended fuel. Currently, different states have different taxation and incentives for blending of ethanol and biodiesel.""Tax on ethanol and biodiesel will be a disincentive and is like a punitive tax. Taxes on these should be as low as possible,"" said G Chandrashekhar, commodity expert and Biodiesel Association of India honorary member.Sandip Chaturvedi, president of the association, said biodiesel is a 'sunrise industry', and needs a 'bit of hand-holding'.Biodiesel blending is in early stages with about 1-2% of blending happening in certain eastern states of the country (West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha), where states allow tax benefits. Elsewhere across the country, it is yet to take off.Ethanol blending with petrol hit a high of about 4% in FY16, before tapering off as sugarcane growth came under strain in FY17."

This set off speculation that police had arrested him. However, Bengaluru police commissioner Praveen Sood scotched the rumour.CM Siddaramaiah, who also holds the home portfolio, has advised police not to arrest Belagere and Raju.The journalists have been accused of writing defamatory articles about the assembly speaker and a few legislators, including a member of the House Privileges Committee that has recommended the punishment.Sources said Belagere got discharged from the Dharwad hospital and shifted to an undisclosed location early Monday. He is likely to move court against the assembly's decision on Tuesday.Police sources said he moved into a farmhouse on Dharwad outskirts, but his family claimed he was at a farmhouse at Jagalpet in Joida taluk of Uttara Kannada district. Belagere had been admitted to SDM Medical College Hospital in Dharwad after he complained of illness and high blood sugar. Soon after the assembly speaker issued the order, police officers from Bengaluru came to Dharwad to arrest Belagere on Saturday. But they couldn't as the doctors were conducting tests on the journalist.Sources in the CM's office said Siddaramaiah reportedly told officials to defer the arrest of journalists till he holds talks with legislative assembly speaker KB Koliwad and asks him to withdraw the order seeking to execute the decision taken by the assembly last week.Siddaramaiah was forced to stall the prosecution under pressure from media associations, including the Editors' Guild of India, and some senior ministers who said the assembly decided on the punishment in haste. ""Even before we knew what was happening, the speaker had given his ruling. The government has no role in it,"" said law minister TB Jayachandra, who held talks with the CM on the issue.Justifying his decision, Koliwad told TOI he had not received information about the government stalling the arrest or the CM planning to meet him. He said he has no qualms if the government wants to defer the journalists' arrest. ""I just read out the privilege committee's recommendations that day. When the House has accepted the report, I alone can't be held responsible. I was only a presiding officer in that matter,"" he said."

For commuters headed towards South Delhi, the drive from NH-24 to Ashram will speed up significantly when the road opens.The 17km stretch from Uflex to Ashram will now be signal-free and, if traffic is smooth, will take less than half an hour to cover.The elevated road will be officially launched by Uttar Pradesh industrial development minister Satish Mahana on Wednesday at 5pm.Before that, the Noida Authority will start trials on the elevated stretch from Tuesday. A 2.5-km stretch of the road from Uflex to the ISKCON Temple is already operational, having been opened to commuters in October last year.When the entire stretch opens, traffic flow around sectors 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 33 should ease. Due to construction work, motorists have been facing regular snarls along the Master Plan 2 road. Those bottlenecks too will go.""We are giving the elevated road finishing touches and will ensure it is ready a day before the official opening,"" said S C Mishra, project engineer, Noida authority and in-charge of the elevated road project. ""On the morning of June 27, we will undertake trial runs along the stretch to ensure all is fine,"" he added.Suresh Rana, minister of state (independent), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development is also likely to accompany Mahana. A public address is scheduled at Cambridge School before the ribbon cutting ceremony, officials said.The project was commissioned in October 2014 when Akhilesh Yadav was in power. Initially, it was scheduled to be completed by October 2016 but was affected by the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) ban on use of hot-mix plants, which was necessary to prepare construction material for the road.""We did face a delay, but construction was resumed in full swing after NGT on May 8 temporarily lifted the ban on hot-mix plants,"" Mishra said.The elevated road has exit and entry ramps at Nithari (Sector 30) and (NTPC Sector 24) to allow traffic from internal roads access it.

Call it the collateral damage of demonetization or sehri feasts becoming less indulgent and the rich turning more altruistic, but this year, whatever extra cash there is is finding its way to charity.Till last year, sehri parties were a rage with a section of the city's rich Muslims. Those who held these parties previously--most of them builders say demonetization, combined with inflation, has forced them to cut down on indulging friends with offers of sumptuous food post-midnight. ""This year, we are not holding any sehri party, but will certainly hold Eid milan in July (Ramzan ends on June 26),"" says Bandrabased builder Khalid Qureishi, whose sehri dos at Rizvi Colle ge Complex in Bandra would attract the who's who in town, including actor Sanjay Dutt.Qureishi laughs it off when asked if demonetization has had an ""effect,"" but a source says most builders who earlier held such parties are feeling the pinch post-notebandi. Some say the ""realiza tion"" of Ramzan's real value has dawned on them now.""The holy month is granted by Allah to purify body and soul with prayers, reflection and contemplation. We don't want to throw away our money on holding sehri parties. Instead, we try to help the poor eat nutritious meals in the night and celebrate Eid comfortably,"" says Parvez Lakdawala, another builder in Bandra who too held sehri parties in the past.The tradition of dishing out food packets for Ramzan and Eid has picked up. Haji Arafat Shaikh, president of the Maharashtra Shiv Vahtuk Sena, the transport arm of the Shiv Sena, stopped holding parties during Ramzan a couple of years ago and now directs the money to buy ration for the poor. ""Why spend money on feeding the well-fed? We are distributing food packets among the poor in not just some of the impoverished localities in the city but also in distant suburbs like Mumbra and Nalasopara,"" informs the Vahtuk Sena's vice-president Sajid Kassam Supariwala, who supervises the distribution as Shaikh is currently away on Umrah (the mini-Haj) in Mecca. Former MLA Yusuf Abrahni began a campaign in the beginning of Ramzan this year, pleading with people not to ""waste"" their money on sehri or iftar parties but instead help the impoverished imams and muezzins in Mumbai. ""So far we have distributed around 80 pack ets among imams and muezzins in the city . The packets include all the essential things like sugar, ghee, tea, flour, spices, dates,"" explains Abrahni.Even some medical practitioners have taken to approaching the rich. Eminent cardiac surgeon Dr Zainul Hamdulay hopes to raise around Rs 3.37 crore this Ramzan to fund 100 bypass surgeries, as many angioplasties and 500 angiographies for the poor and the underprivileged. ""Most of our donors are Muslims who contribute with their zakat money (2.5% of the annual savings),"" says Nagpada-based Dr Hamdulay .However, some, like the managing trustee of Mahim Dargah Sohail Khandwani, claim the sehri parties have not ended, only the format has changed. ""Every night, 800 to 1,000 poor people are fed iftar and sehri by Mahim Dargah Trust with the help of some wealthy individuals.Parties in Ramzan are still there but increasingly not to indulge the affluent,"" says Khandwani."

They wanted to take stock of the condition of this ancient river and its environs in the context of a highprofile campaign by the state government for Narmada conservation. What they found was a stark and chilling reminder of how one of the most holy rivers of India is being destroyed. In the 14 districts that they travelled through, towns and cities are emptying untreated sewage in to it and industries are pumping effluents even as deforestation in the surrounding Satpura and Vindhya ranges has dried up 60 of the 101 tributaries that used to feed the Narmada. Groundwater levels have fallen to lows of as much as 300ft or more in the vicinity, garbage lies piled in towns and riverbanks are encroached upon.Unfettered mechanised sand mining is taking its toll throughout the nearly 1,100km length of the Narmada in MP .Several fish species, including the mahaseer, are in terminal decline because of pollution and destruction of habitat.""Even at the source, the Narmada kund, at Amarkan tak, we found pipes dumping waste water into the river and people defecating on the opposite bank,"" Vinayak Parihar, a member of the team, told TOI.The trip was organised by Vichar Madhya Pradesh, a platform of small environmental and other rights groups.Almost none of the urban centres on the river's banks have sewage treatment plants (STP). Jabalpur, the biggest city on the Narmada, produces 200 million litres of sewage per day but treats only 0.55 MLD. One 50 MLD STP built near Kathauda village is nonfunctional.Along the whole length, industrial units are seen discharging effluents into the river or its tributaries. In Jabalpur, a gelatin factory at Lamhaita Ghat allows effluents to drain into the river, as do six sugar mills in Narsinghpur, the Suhagpur industrial belt in Hoshangabad, and several dozen big dairies.The state pollution control board has filed cases against 18 municipal bodies located within 10 km of Narmada river, including the Jabalpur, Hoshangabad, Mandla, Dindori and Bhedaghat civic organisations.Also on the mat are five industrial units, including the central government-owned Security Paper Mill, which is situated in Hoshangabad. The team found that small and big tributaries along the whole course of the river were in distress. All of them used to carry water all year round till about a decade ago. Now, nearly two-thirds are dry , many lost forever.""Heavy encroachment and sand mining has destroyed the channels while deforestation of surrounding forests has dried up the sources of water,"" Parihar explained.Despite court orders prohibiting mechanised sand mining and mining from under running water, these practices are taking place openly .In Hoshangabad, for example, there are only 11 approved sand mining sites but the team found mining taking place at 50 sites. At the lower end of the river, as it flows through Dewas and Khandwa, most tributaries are not flowing as water has backed up from the Indra Sagar Dam. Parihar says that glitzy programmes involving senior politicians and film stars are of little use, as is giving the river a ""living entity"" status. Until the government seriously implements existing laws and involves people in this, Narmada will continue to die a thousand deaths."

We have asked the DGP to complete the medical examination before September 30, 2017.""A circular issued by the home department listed out a battery of tests the police officials would undergo: complete blood count, random blood sugar, liver and kidney function, oral health, eye health, blood pressure, chest X-ray and, if suffering from hypertension and diabetes, ECG.""We expect that the DGP, commissioners and superintendents of police will coordinate the medical check-up plan with the civil surgeon or the medical superintendent of the local government hospital,"" the official said.The large-scale exercise is a first of its kind, said the home department official.""The unit heads, in consultation with the civil surgeon and medical superintendent, will not only scrutinise the medical reports but draft an action plan for ailing police personnel,"" the official said."

Initially the product will be exclusively available for Araku tourists and later sold in other parts of the state.""A huge amount of jack fruits are left on the trees in the agency and plain areas even after traders meet the local demand and export the required quantity. We got the idea to brew jack fruit wines from a person in Coorg,"" GCC MD A Ravi Prakash told TOI.The corporation has sent a few officials to Coorg to learn the process of preparing the wine, he said, adding that tribal people will be involved in the entire process and GCC will ensure that maximum profit is earned through sale of jack fruits that are lying waste.Sources said that jack fruit wine contains around 5% alcohol, whereas normal wine contains 12-15% alcohol. Visakha Agency, Rampachodavaram Agency in East Godavari and Seetammapet in Srikakulam district have numerous jack fruit trees. Many fruits are left on the trees even after consumption.For preparing the wine, the bulbs will be cut into small pieces before they are boiled and ground. Sugar in the form of syrup will be added to the bulbs along with yeast. Later, it will be stored in a pot for 15-18 days. Afterwards, the drink will be drawn from the pot and filled into bottles, an employee involved in the fermentation process, K Jagadeesh told TOI."

They have further observed that the soil in many mandals in the district are deficient in these two minerals and noted that for long farmers have been oblivious to the fact that both their crop as well as their yields have suffered due to the lack of these two minerals.Assistant professor M Bharata Lakshmi of NG Ranga Agriculture University, said, ""Many farmers refuse to understand the importance of zinc and sulphur as soil and crop enrichers. They do not know that these two minerals help the planted crop respond to fertiliser application by not only becoming pest resistant but also by growing in a healthy way and finally resulting in the increase of yield by 30%.""Regarding the requirement per hectare, Prof Lakshmi said on an average 50 kg of zinc-sulphate can be used every year. She noted that such large quantities of the minerals is required to replenish deficient and alkaline soils.However, scientists at the Agriculture Research Station (ARS) in Anakapalli as well as officials of the district agriculture department have pointed out that things are looking up now, especially after the sample survey was conducted following which the department itself is providing farmers with the micro-nutrients at a subsidised cost."
5a04ef489855b76bf13beff0,"For farmers today, grass is ‘greener’ than rice and pulses",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-farmers-grass-is-greener-than-wheat-and-rice/articleshow/59304620.cms,2017-06-24,"Growing grass and selling it in the market may be more profitable than cultivating crops like wheat, rice, pulses or oilseeds.This bizarre conclusion, a reflection of the desperate conditions of Indian farmers , can be reached if one looks at how the value of various crops has changed over the last five years.Between 2011-12 and 2015-16, the total value of cereals and pulses produced in the country went down by about 3%, for oilseeds by over 13% and sugars by 1%. But value of grass, which is mainly used as cheap forage for milch animals, increased by about 1%. Output values zoomed up for two types of food items  fruits and vegetables by over 15% and condiments and spices by nearly 18%.This information is derived from the latest National Accounts Statistics 2017 released by the Central Statistics Office.It is this declining output value, which is at the root of farmers ' sorrow and anger, finding expression in a range of ways from suicides to agitations demanding loan waivers or even job reservations for specific communities.Output values are declining because the cost of what the farmers put in  seeds, fertilisers, water etc. - is rising faster than the prices they get by selling their produce.Nearly a third of the total value of agricultural production in India was contributed by cereals and the same by fruits and vegetables, up from about 24% five years ago. Many of the estimates of output value, which is obtained by multiplying total production of a crop by prevailing prices for that crop, are broad guesses, says Vikas Rawal, associate professor of economics at JNU. He especially flagged fruits and vegetables estimates at being sketchy and growth rate seeming to be higher because of starting off from a lower base.""But, even then, the data does show that most farmers, involved in food grain production, are not getting good returns for their investment and labour,"" he told TOI. Fruits and vegetables have emerged as a much more attractive investment for farmers because of a mix of several reasons. With nearly half of the cultivated land in India under small and marginal holdings of less than two hectares, it has become increasingly difficult for farmers to manage the longer duration and more demanding crops like cereals, pulses and oilseeds.Vegetables offer the big advantage of needing much less fertilizers or pesticides, and they can grow up and be ready for cash sale within 2-4 months. With prices of pulses sky-rocketing, demand for vegetables too has shot up. Better transport facilities and road connectivity eases marketing.But everybody can't start growing only vegetables and fruits. Besides not paying enough, their marketing is subject to many risks including sharp price fluctuations and perishability.Food grains can provide much more security and larger incomes - provided prices are good. And, the govt. too provides some support through various subsidies and procurement. Ultimately, the whole country survives on the food grains produced by farmers."

But liquor manufacturers, who incur the additional cost, and excise officials who determine MRP for CL-2 (retail) licence holders, term it illegal. ""As such, liquor sold at retail outlets and elsewhere is not in the ambit of GST and the new taxation system is not linked to the pricing of liquor. The MRP of liquor is subject to excise rules and it has not been changed,"" said Rajendra Prasad, joint commissioner of excise. ""Traders must sell the drink at the price they used to before July 1. Selling liquor at a price other than MRP is illegal.""""Input goods like packaging materials attract GST, but it should not be reflected on the output tax of liquor sold in the market. The manufacturer has to absorb the tax on the raw material and hence the MRP should not be changed even in the GST regime,"" said Rakshit Neelakanta Jagadale, excutive director of Amrut Global Luxury Malt and Spirits, a division of Amrut Distilleris Ltd.One key input, ENL (extra neutral alcohol), used to make Indian-made liquor, does not attract tax. ENL is fermented from molasses, which draws 28% GST, but it is exempt from tax if it is used for captive production of ENL by sugar factories. Captive production, said one manufacturer, accounts for about 98% of the ENL produced in the state and hence does not attract any tax.""Most of the distillers buy ENL from sugar factories directly to avail tax-free benefit.Only a few distilleries may buy from others in which case they have to pay tax, but it has be absorbed by them,"" said Shivalingaiah, secretary-general of Karnataka Brewers and Distillers Association.However, packaging materials, including bottles, caps, labels and boxes attract 18% GST.The materials were taxed at 14.5 % in the previous value-added tax (VAT) regime. ""But since the increased tax burden is to be absorbed by the manufacturers, no way can the traders charge more than the MRP of liquor,"" said Shivalingaiah.Notwithstanding this, from Saturday, several MRP-liquor stores have increased bottle prices by at least 15%. Beer was costlier by 38%. Harsha Jayaram, who had flown down from Mumbai for a family gettogether, said, ""I had accompanied my cousin to this MRP store that we have been buying from. We had picked up beer on Wednesday and it was Rs 120. Today , it is Rs 165.""The price of one bottle of Black Dog Reserve (scotch), which was Rs 1,730.85 until Friday , is now Rs 1,960 -a hike of 13%. ""When I enquired, I was told that it was because of GST.A bottle of Black Dog Triple Gold, which was for Rs 2,870 when I purchased it last, was being sold at Rs 3.070 (6% more),"" said G Ritchie, employee of an an IT firm.When TOI enquired at MRP shops -in Sanjaynagar (New BEL Road), J P Nagar and Indiranagar -cashiers said the price rise was due to GST. When told that liquor did not attract GST, a cashier from the Sanjaynagar store said, ""Our distributor told us the input cost has gone up. We have nothing to do with this.""Industry representatives demanded that the government take action against those violating MRP . ""Some of the retailers are cheating in the name of GST. Both excise and legal metrology departments should take note of it and punish them,"" said Shivalingaiah."

Even at some air-conditioned restaurants, the bills may come down, as GST will subsume service tax and value-added tax (VAT) that is currently charged."

These kitchens are run on donations from devotees.Badal said SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar had already made a representation on the issue, and the same could be examined.Based on representations from the UP government, the GST council had exempted puja samagri.Similarly, intense lobbying by industry led to lower tax on agarbattis. The council has, however, refrained from exempting several institutions despite demands."

5a0506889855b76bf13bf273,HS Prannoy: I have beaten top players in the world but not my inconsistency,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hs-prannoy-i-have-beaten-top-players-in-the-world-but-not-my-inconsistency/articleshow/59399342.cms,2017-07-01,"Kerala's shuttler HS Prannoy has been as smashing hit in the world badminton circuit of late. The Thiruvananthapuram lad, who has earned the tag of giant killer for surprising the world's best, is quickly rising through the ranks. The 24-year-old attributes it to his punishing schedule and work ethic at the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad.The world number 23, who is currently busy gearing up for the Canada Open, tells us how he trains, what keeps him driven and more.My practice session starts at 7:30 am and goes on till 11:30 am. I have a 30-minute break in between for breakfast. After that I have another session from 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm, where the focus is on improving fitness. The training involves gym, on court shadows and running. It helps improve the speed, power and endurance. That's the daily routine, except for the weekends. I have been training like this for the last eight to nine years.I love the game. That's a must for anyone at this level. When you have victories under your belt, you are motivated. Fellow competitor's success also keeps you driven, because you think if they can do it, why can't you? That spurs you on. That said, sometimes even after giving your best, if you don't find success, you start questioning yourself and that's when your performance also suffers.I think it's the most important aspect because when you are in the top 20, you lose more than you win as compared to the top three. That's why I believe it's essential that everyone plays a sport. During my school days in Aakulam Kendra Vidyalaya, I remember I was the only one who participated in sports while my classmates were busy with academics. You realise the benefits of playing only when you are in your 20s and face setbacks in life. Some people get extremely disappointed by minor failures and that often drives them to depression and suicide. But I think those who are active in sports grow up facing defeats and by the time they are adults, they don't let these hurdles affect them.Sometimes I feel down, feel like giving up. But I also understand it's part of the process. If I lose a tournament, I set my sights on the next one, rather than dwelling on the defeat. I always try to learn from what has happened.I have been able to beat all the top players in the world right now. It's not something that every Indian player has done. However, I am also aware my performance is inconsistent. Two days I might be on top but on the third I might not maintain the same standard. But in the recent Indonesian Open, I thought I played well. Even in the semi-final, I gave my best but things just didn't go my way. Maybe I need a bit more time to win something big.Nowadays, when you are playing top players, most games stretch to the third set and you have to be physically fit. There are so many players in the top 20 who are capable of beating anyone on a given day. But it's the physical aspect that sets the players apart. A world no 1 can play all six matches the same way but a player ranked 20 might not be as consistent. Recently, I haven't lost matches due to fitness issues. My problem has been with players of my level who take risks. I just need to be more focussed.I have not followed one in the last six months. But from July 1, I am trying to avoid junk food when I am travelling and also sugar, because it slows you down. I weigh around 73 kg right now, so I am trying to shed some of it.He regularly talks to all of us. Every morning session, he is there on the court, observing and letting us know about the mistakes we make. He would point out what we could have done differently based on our previous matches and so, next time we would be aware of what type of shot to play on a similar situation. After the semi-final loss in the Indonesian Open, he told me that not to dwell too much on the defeat and think about the victories.The competition is so high because in one centre itself you have people who are winning super series and consistently beating top players. So, you can't afford to relax because the other guy would get ahead. That makes you push yourself harder. This training structure has been in place for the last three to four years. We weren't troubling anyone back then. But with more training, everyone's game has evolved. So, when one person improves, consequently three or four other players also raise their game. Obviously there's competition, but we also try to help each other out.We get time off only after the evening sessions and we don't go out because we have practice the next day too. We all try and hang out together when we are in Hyderabad. We don't have an off season like footballers or cricketers as we have tournaments round the year. So, the problem is if you want to skip and enjoy for a while, your rank would go down. Nobody wants to do that. In fact, I haven't visited Thiruvananthapuram in the last three months.

Elaborating on the plans, officials noted that they are mulling the introduction of inter-cropping in over 5,000 hectares in the upland orchard plantations.Speaking to TOI, joint director of agriculture V Satyanarayana said, ""We have identified vegetables that are easy to grow such as water gourd so that they can be grown in mango and cashew topes in the district. Mandals in Narsipatnam division are being identified for the purpose.""Elaborating on the reasons, Satyanarayana said, ""In Narsipatnam division we have observed that Casuarina is taking over vegetable patches and sugarcane plantations. In the long run this is unhealthy, but unfortunately farmers cannot be told what to do. Instead we are coming up with the idea of promoting vegetable cultivation especially gourd which are easy to grow in orchards and farmers can make additional income during the monsoon.""Regarding the availability of seed, horticulture department officials noted that seeds are quite cheap and the horticulture department would provide seeds at Rs 400 per kg, while the requirement per hectare is close to 3kg. In the open market, seeds are being made available at almost double the cost (Rs 700 per kg).Farmers, however, are yet to buy this idea of inter-cropping. Ch Ganesh, a farmer from Uratla in Narsipatnam division, said, ""Vegetable cultivation was common in this region. However, nobody has ever tried inter-cropping. They were always grown as stand-alone crops."

It is very simple,"" Adhia said.Under the composition scheme where the turnover does not exceed Rs 75 lakh, manufacturers will have to pay 1 per cent of turnover as GST, traders - 2.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent of turnover in state in case of other suppliers.CBEC in advertisements said single tax GST will bring down prices for most household. ""GST a boon for households. 81 per cent of items to fall below or in 18 per cent GST slab,"" it said.Butter, ghee, almonds, fruit juice, mobiles and umbrella have been placed in 12 per cent tax bracket while 18 per cent rate would be levied on hair oil, toothpaste, soap, ice cream, and printers.The highest tax of 28 per cent will be levied on chewing gum, chocolates, custard powder and waffles containing chocolate. Besides, cars, aerated drinks, AC, refrigerators and capital goods and all industrial intermediaries will attract the highest rate.The new tax regime, to be effective midnight tonight, will replaces the messy mix of more than a dozen state and central levies built up over seven decades, with a one national GST unifying the country's USD 2 trillion economy with 1.3 billion people into a common market.GST will require businesses to file their returns online, for which the company providing the IT backbone GST Network has been working on the modalities.The returns are to be uploaded once a month by retailers following which the return form are to be matched for availing input credit and thereafter the computer will generate the tax liability.""Today Income Tax returns are also filed online, so nothing is impossible, it is easy,"" Adhia said."

Guhas missive, made public on Friday, is an explanatory note on why he resigned from the CoA, and it reflected his twin obsessions  a historians rigour and a cricket-lovers affection for the game. The letter did not spare Indian crickets holy cows. Truth be told, Guha did not even sugar-coat his observations about the CoA, of which he was a member. First up, he stated that he respected the CoA and yet there were points of divergence, and in explaining those differences, Guha virtually lit a fuse under Indian crickets administration. The accursed conflict of interest issue that has plagued the BCCI ever since the game drew in popularity and big money, was brought right back under an unforgiving microscope. Guha adores legendary cricketers but that did not hinder him from making an indirect reference to Rahul Dravid, whose national contract is structured in such a way that he can be the India A coach for 10 months and mentor Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League for two months.While Dravid was not named explicitly, the historian was more direct in his approach towards Sunil Gavaskar, who runs a player management group and is also part of the BCCI TVs commentary team. Guha also did not spare Sourav Ganguly, stating that a former cricketer, now a president of a state association (Bengal), is also allowed to make comments on current players through his media contracts. Guhas fusillade made no exceptions and even questioned why M S Dhoni should have a Grade A contract when he has quit Test cricket. Current skipper Virat Kohli found no lenience, too, as Guha delved into the superstar culture gone berserk. Guha held the CoA complicit in the way Anil Kumbles head coach position has come into needles scrutiny.The issues Guha raised have been in vogue for a while. To be seen not just as great players but also as men of integrity, it is at least now upon stars ranging from Gavaskar to Kohli to step away from all pursuits that are seen as obvious conflicts of interest even if it means losing some rupees and shedding extra-constitutional influence. The naysayers might argue that for all his clarity of thought, Guha quit the CoA when he had a chance to cleanse the BCCIs stables but he deserves kudos for bringing some uncomfortable cricketing truths into the public domain."

You have to sometimes say things that hurt. That's what I believe in,"" he said.""You have to lay it out in front of them that this is what we did wrong, including me, and we need to take it on the chin and accept it and prove it.""That's why we are chosen among millions of people to play at this level. You have to be good enough to do that for the country and you have to be good enough to bounce back, as well.""You can't do the same mistakes over and over again. That sort of mindset is really helping all of us to come together as a unit and make things happen.""It's not about asking two, three players to do it. We are asking everyone to do it and everyone is responding really well.""Until you have a team effort, you cannot win games, especially in conditions that you are not familiar with. Today was a team performance.""ExperiencedWith India and Bangladesh joining hosts England in the last four and the winner of Monday's Sri Lanka against Pakistan match taking the final semi-final berth, it's been a strong tournament for the teams from the sub continent.Kohli acknowledged the amount of one-day cricket played in the region was a factor, but he has also been impressed with the way India have adapted to the English conditions.""Maybe because of how much limited-overs cricket we play, I think the players are getting more experienced in difficult situations,"" he said.""Maybe some of the teams have really surprised the opposition with the way they have batted and bowled in certain situations.""South Africa captain AB De Villiers was one of three players run out as his side collapsed to 191 all out.De Villiers endured a miserable tournament, scoring only 20 runs, while his team came in for heavy criticism after losing twice in three matches.However, the 33-year-old insists he is still the right man to prepare the side for the 2019 World Cup.""It is always very disappointing when we lose but the way we lost was the most disappointing,"" he said.""Through soft dismissals we lost our way and that was the part that hurt the most. Run-outs happen but three in one innings is not how we want to play our cricket that is for sure.""I'm a good captain and I can take this team forward and win the World Cup I believe, I love doing it.""Not a lot of people believe me but I feel it is pretty close, it is very difficult to say that after a performance like this but that is what I believe in my heart."""

Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

Traders from accross the country called for a shut down. PTI PhotoA train was stopped by traders in Uttar Pradesh and commercial establishments and wholesale commodity markets in some cities remained closed today in protest against the ""hasty"" rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.As the GST was set for an ambitious rollout, Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation (KTMF) called for a general strike in the Valley tomorrow against the new unified tax system.Protests against the GST broke out in different parts of Uttar Pradesh over ""anomalies and complexities"" in the GST while commercial establishments in major cities in Madhya Pradesh were closed as part of a bandh called by traders.A trade bandh call by Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal (BUVM) in West Bengal against the ""hasty"" rollout of the GST evoked mixed reaction.Trade and industry bodies in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana urged the Centre to be lenient for at least one year on filing of returns as many more businesses come under the GST regime for the first time.In Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur was one of the main centres of the protest with office bearers of trade organisations taking part. Reports of protests also came in from Varanasi, Allahabad, Jhansi, Faizabad, Shahjahanpur and Ghaziabad.Traders in Kanpur squatted on rail tracks and stopped the Kanpur-Pratapgarh passenger train.The traders led by 'Akhil Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal' leader Gyanendra Misra protested at the Lucknow railway crossing around 9.47 AM and stopped the local train.It was only when the GRP personnel rushed to the spot and removed the protesters from the tracks that the train could resume its journey, Railway sources said, adding there was, however, no disturbance by the protesters at the main station.The wholesale and retail markets in Kanpur werer closed with the trade organisations taking out processions in the market areas throughout the city.The bandh call was given by Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar Pratinidhi Mandal, which also got the support of around 50 trade organisations.""We are not against the GST. But we are certainly not happy with the way GST is being implemented in a hasty manner. The officials and traders are not ready. Apart from this, the portal is not ready,"" Rajiv Anand, chairman of UP Yuva Vyapar Mandal, said.""The transformation to GST should have been gradual and not a sudden one.""Wholesale commodity markets, including grains, pulses and sugar in Delhi were closed in protest against the five per cent GST on branded grains and sugar.A majority of wholesale grain, pulse and other commodity shops were shut in Naya Bazar, said Ashok Kumar Bansal, General Secretary, Grain Merchant Welfare Organisation.Bansal said the organisation has been demanding a zero per cent GST rate. Branded grains, rice, sugar and atta will be levied a five per cent GST.According to Ravindra Modi, president of the Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, it would take at least six months for the trade to get accustomed to the new regime.""...There are some issues that need clarity. We will learn about it only after implementation,"" Modi said.""Many more new traders and service providers will now come under the tax fold. They need some time to become familiar with the taxation and filing systems,"" he said.In Madhya Pradesh, shops in main cities like Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, and Jabalpur downed their shutters while commercial activities remained suspended in small towns as well. The bandh was called by various organisations of traders.In Bhopal, important commercial markets like MP Nagar, New Market, Chowk, Bairagarh, BHEL township etc. largely remained closed.""We are not against the GST but are protesting its anomalies and complexities. The Centre is going to impose this new tax regime without any prior preparation. The government has not taken traders into confidence,"" Bhopal Chamber of Commerce and Industries general secretary Vishnu Bansal said.Bansal said a total of 72 traders' organisations extended their support to today's bandh.According to Bansal, business in almost all major cities and towns in MP was affected due to the bandh.In West Bengal, impact was visible in shops of Burrabazar, Asia's biggest wholesale market and the city's prominent retail hub New Market, as they downed their shutters.There were reports of many retail stores remaining closed in various parts of Kolkata and the state.""The bandh is in protest against the procedures and provisions of GST, "" an official of the Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations said. He said response to the bandh was mixed in the districts.The KTMF while calling for a general strike in Kashmir Valley tomorrow said they will not allow the implementation of this new law, even if we have to sacrifice their lives.""We will not allow the erosion of our special status.

(File photo) What should worry Fadnavis is that the Rs 30,000 crore farm loan waiver will add to the states deep indebtedness. (File photo)As a young legislator in 2013, Devendra Fadnavis went for the erstwhile Prithviraj Chavan-led NCP Governments jugular on the issue of farmer suicides, the irrigation scam and the governments position on the farm sector.Three years later, it is the farm sector which is threatening to weigh him down. Fadnavis critics are accusing him of being urban-centric and having a limited connect with farmers, even though he hasnt been as singed as fellow BJP chief minister, Shivraj Chouhan of Madhya Pradesh.But as the farmers agitation spread, Fadnavis was forced to compromise on another plank  writing off loans. The Maharashtra chief minister has always believed that loan write-off is not a durable solution, but in this case, politics came in the way. Apparently, Delhi prodded him into announcing a Rs 30,000 crore waiver.Fadnavis may have kicked the can down the road. Thats because the detailed scheme for the write-off will be finalised only by the end of October. It could be that the government is hoping that a good monsoon will allay a large amount of troubles on the farm. Significantly, Fadnavis completes three years in October; the farm loan write off at that time could be used to counter opponents who believe the Chief Minister and his party lack the sensitivity in handling issues relating to the farm sector.Whats been noticeable about this issue is that Fadnavis has had to handle it personally  many political heavyweights have been benched and many newcomers are too inexperienced. Maharashtra has a well diversified farm sector  sugarcane is dominant in western Maharashtra, cotton, soyabean and pulses (such as tur dal) are grown in the dryland farming belt of Vidarbha, while horticultural produce such as oranges, pomegranates and mangoes are grown in the Konkan belt.Incredibly, a record production of pulses  over 20 lakh tonnes  has eaten into farmer incomes. With India being a traditional importer of pulses, last years Minimum Support Price was pegged at over Rs 5000 per tonne, which means that famers who grew pulses made good money. But in March, the government put out an advance estimate of 11.7 lakh tonnes, which it had to later embarrassingly revise to 20.35 lakh tonnes.Compounding the states woes is the continuing ban on export as well as a bilateral agreement signed with Mozambique last year to import tur dal for five years. Additionally, the squeeze post-demonetisation didnt help.What should worry Fadnavis is that the Rs 30,000 crore farm loan waiver will add to the states deep indebtedness. Over the last two years, the state has added Rs 100,000 crore to the debt bill  its total debt is set to top Rs 4 lakh crore next fiscal. Annual interest payments alone will account for Rs.30,000 crore.The elbow room for extra borrowings is fast narrowing at a time when several big ticket projects are underway. Fadnavis is betting big on the Nagpur- Mumbai expressway and the expansion of the Mumbai metro. For a state which is the top contributor to the countrys GDP, the fiscal indicators look a little more worrying now.The latest farmland agitation is a sign that any thoughts of a mid-term poll, fuelled by the partys strong showing in the zilla parishad polls a few months ago, may have to be jettisoned for now.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Earlier in 2011, he owned assets worth Rs 166 million, the Dawn reported.The value of his assets has further declined to Rs 1.72 billion in the year that ended on June 30, 2016.Sharif owns a Toyota Land Cruiser, gifted to him by an unspecified individual, as well as two Mercedes cars.The house he lives in is owned by his mother and he has multiple foreign and local currency accounts, huge swathes of agricultural land and investments in industrial units such as sugar, textile and paper mills.Sharif declared in 2015 for the first time ownership of birds and animals worth Rs 2 million, which are valued at Rs 5 million, the daily said.The Sharif familys estate in Raiwind is priced at Rs 4 million, while his property in Lahores Upper Mall area is said to be worth over Rs 250 million.The prime minister is one of the richest lawmakers of the country.Another prominent billionaire lawmaker in Pakistan is Sharifs rival and vociferous critics Imran Khan, chief of Pakistan Tehrek-e-Insaf (PTI), whose declared assets valued at Rs 1.4 billion.The cricketer-turned-politician told the ECP that he sold the only vehicle registered in his name last year.In 2015, Imran had declared the value of his total assets at Rs 1.026 billion. The value of his residence, declared a gift, in Islamabads Bani Gala suburbs of Islamabad is Rs 750 million.The value of his family home in Zaman Park in Lahore stands at Rs 29 million."
5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Police said the gang raided the one-room office on the first floor of a three-storeyed building in a lane leading to Strand Road around 3.45pm. The office, Maruti Enterprise, belongs to Biharilal Agarwal, who owns a sugar godown in the area. Agarwal was away during the heist. The employees who were in the office told the police that the robbers had tied them up. ""One of the employees was gagged with a handkerchief and his hands were tied with a towel. He was forced to stay put on a chair opposite the desk that had a laptop on it. The hands and legs of the other two were also trussed up. One of them was forced to lie on the bed and the other on the floor,"" an officer of Jorabagan police station said. The cops said no one had heard any scream from the office during the robbery. A dingy lane off Strand Road - lined with sugar godowns and offices called gaddis - takes one to the building housing the office of Maruti Enterprise. A dark flight of stairs ends in a narrow passage that leads to the office. Maruti Enterprise shares the floor with two other offices, which were apparently closed when the robbers struck. ""The robbers were not wearing any masks and were speaking in Hindi and Bengali. At least two of them were carrying guns. The gang opened the vault with the key and took out the cash. They also took away four cell phones belonging to the employees,"" the officer said. The operation lasted around 15-20 minutes, sources said. ""The amount robbed was not much, going by the daily transaction in the office.... The office transacts lakhs of rupees daily,"" an officer said. Agarwal, the owner of the godown, came to the know about the robbery from one of the employees who called him up from the landline of the office. ""Thankfully, the gang forgot to disconnect the landline. One of the employees alerted me. I immediately got in touch with the police,"" Agarwal said. A member of the Posta Bazar Merchants' Association said: ""This is the third time over the past few months that an office in the area has been targeted. The earlier cases have not yet been cracked."" Sources said the traders' association had got 46 CCTV cameras installed on the stretch from Posta to Strand Road.

""However, the date of the implementation will coincide with the date of the GST roll-out.""The government plans to roll out GST, the biggest taxation reform since Independence, from July 1.It will subsume 16 different levies, including excise, VAT, service tax and other local levies.Under GST, cess would however be levied on luxury and demerit goods."

Coe was at Kingston's National Stadium on Saturday to watch Bolt run his last race on Jamaican soil before he retires at the World Championships in London. The International Association of Athletics Federations chief Coe said he had been determined to pay homage to Bolt as his glittering career begins its victory lap. ""Just instinctively you knew it was going to be a big moment,"" Coe said. ""This is where his home is. I sense people here recognised that there was going to be an outpouring of emotion and warmth last night which I just wanted to witness. ""And what was fascinating is those people who came up to me who had flown in from other continents to be here. People instinctively knew that they were going to witness something that was going to be special and unique, and it was."" Bolt duly delivered a 100m victory in 10.03 seconds for a sea of 30,000 fans bedecked in yellow and green. Coe said Bolt will retire from the sport as the greatest sprinter of all-time, a rare athlete who transcended his sport and appealed across the sporting spectrum after dominating at three consecutive Olympic games. ""He has not just reached the level he has in terms of global presence because of three back-to-back Olympic Games or because of the world records,"" said Coe, who set eight world records in middle-distance track events, including three in the span of 41 days in 1979. ""He has a charisma that I haven't seen in my sport in my lifetime other than with Ali and I put them in the same category. ""When Ali went we had the same conversations. But along came Sugar Ray Leonard and Floyd Maywether, Roberto Duran and Manny Pacquiao . We had great great fighters. But have they soared to the level of the great Ali, no. But they kept the sport exciting and fresh. ""You can't take away the massive social contribution Jesse Owens made in 1936 and you can't argue with the extraordinary contributions other sprinters have made. But there is only one guy sitting at the top of the heap and you wouldn't have a split jury on that."" This may be Bolt's last race in Jamaica but he has a couple more events before he caps his brilliant career by running the 100m in Worlds which goes from August 4-13. ""He is going to come to the World Championships and yes that is a fitting place for him to end his career considering what he has done globally,"" said Coe. ""But you only have to spend a few moments with Usain to know that this is where he will forever be emotionally anchored."" Coe said as a former Olympic gold medal winner in the 1,500m he can understand why Bolt would want to bow out now. ""He probably has instinctively realized this is the right moment. There comes a point at which the candle flickers a bit,"" he said. ""No athlete wants to be asked the question why didn't you retire sooner?"" Coe said Bolt, who has the world record in both the 100m and 200m, can retire in peace knowing that he gave it his all for 15 years. ""Sit back think about it. You are just into your 30s and you have won three Olympics Games back to back, you broke the world records and so maybe there is not a lot left to accomplish. ""He is also comfortable in his own skin. He will always be a national treasure and that is just enough, just enough."" (AGENCIES)"

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, June 26: The number of intravenous drug users, who are taking opioid substitution therapy (OST) to kick the habit, has risen thrice over the past five years in Assam. The number of drug users enrolling for OST programmes reveals the extent of drug abuse in the state, Assam State AIDS Control Society told the media here today during an awareness programme at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital on International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, commemorated every year on June 26. OST is a maintenance therapy for opium-based drug (heroin, cocaine, brown sugar) users. It involves replacing an opioid with a longer acting but less euphoric one. Commonly used drugs for OST are methadone or buprenorphine, which are taken under medical supervision. The Society has two OST centres - at GMCH and Diphu civil hospital - that registered 91 people taking daily OST in comparison to only 30 in 2012. The Society registered 4,275 intravenous drug users in May this year of which, 2,644 are still taking drugs. ""At present, little data is available on how many people consume drugs as it comes through unregulated channels and the users are hard to identify. So, when they come under a therapy programme, it gets recorded,"" Sanjeeb Chakraborty, an employee of Society, said. According to SHI360, a North-Carolina-based NGO working on drug abuse in the Northeast, more than 50,000 youths are addicted to drugs or other psychotropic substances and more than 10,000 are in Assam. While the euphoria-inducing drugs are called narcotic drugs, those that cause hallucination or relaxe the body or initiate addictive behaviour among users are called psychotropic substances. ""The usage of heroin (an opium-based drug) is more common in Cachar, Dima Hasao, Karbi Anglong, Dhubri and Goalpara while brown sugar (an adulterated form of heroin) and pharmaceutical drugs are more prevelant in Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar and Dibrugarh. Opium, in raw form, is also used in the state's districts bordering Arunachal Pradesh,"" Dipti Kailash, deputy technical leader of the NGO's Northeast chapter, told The Telegraph here today. The bulk of the drugs enter the Northeast, especially Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, through Myanmar and then gets distributed throughout the region while some enter the state from Bihar through west Assam. The involvement of the Society becomes necessary because the intravenous drug users often reuse the syringes that lead to the spread of HIV that causes AIDS, besides causing Hepatitis A, B and C. About 1.78 per cent of HIV-infected in the state have acquired the virus through syringes. Manvendra Pratap Singh, project director of the Society, said, ""Drug menace in the state has increased in the last few years. About 7.8 per cent of the population were addicted to drugs or psychotropic substances, according to a 2014 census, and it is increasing at a rate of 1.77 per cent."" Hemanta Ram Phukan, head of the department of psychiatry in GMCH, addiction at a very young age is one of the main reasons for increase in drug abuse. A rally was taken out from Dighalipukhuri today to raise awareness against drug abuse."
5a05be909855b76bf13c0cf7,Cinnamon hope for heart,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170624/jsp/nation/story_158535.jsp,2017-06-24,"New Delhi, June 23: Three grams of hand-powdered cinnamon a day may help reverse metabolic syndrome, a state of health that raises the risk of heart disease, diabetes and strokes, medical researchers said today. A clinical trial in India has shown improvements in blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or the ""good"" cholesterol after four months of this daily cinnamon intake. A team of doctors and nutrition scientists at the Fortis Centre for Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol (C-DOC), New Delhi, has offered the cinnamon option to patients with metabolic syndrome and people at risk of diabetes or heart disease - but not those already being treated for diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is a clinical state marked by abnormal measurements of three of five health parameters: blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides and waist circumference. ""Cinnamon is a commonly used spice in India and there have been suggestions in the past that it has medical benefits - but not with the rigorous scientific evidence needed to back claims,"" said Anoop Misra, a C-DOC director and lead investigator of the trial. The findings have just been published in the journal Lipids in Health and Disease. Misra and his colleagues carried out the trial following multiple hints from earlier studies, including a landmark trial from Pakistan over 14 year ago, that cinnamon may help combat metabolic syndrome. In 2003, Mahpara Safdar, a human nutrition scientist at the University of Agriculture in Peshawar, and her colleagues had shown that cinnamon could reduce blood glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol in diabetes patients. They found that three doses of cinnamon - 1 gram, 3 grams and 6 grams a day -- had similar effects on these biochemical measurements after 40 days of treatment. Now, the C-DOC researchers have conducted the first double-blind placebo-controlled trial with cinnamon in patients with metabolic syndrome. Such trials, where neither the researchers nor the patients know who received the drug and who the placebo, are the most rigorous way of evaluating a drug's effectiveness. The researchers divided 116 patients with metabolic syndrome into two groups. Members of one of the groups received 3 grams cinnamon a day: two capsules of 500mg each after breakfast, lunch and dinner. The other group was offered placebo capsules: of whole wheat powdered and roasted with cinnamon flavour to make it indistinguishable in taste from real cinnamon. Those patients who received cinnamon showed significantly improved reductions in fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or ""bad"" cholesterol compared with those who received the placebo capsules. ( See chart) The first group also showed a 6 per cent rise in HDL. ""This is a bit of a surprise. There is no pharmacological therapy known that increases HDL - nothing except exercise,"" Misra said. Seema Puri, an associate professor of nutrition at the Institute of Home Economics, New Delhi, and a co-author of the study, said: ""The significance of these results lies in the robust scientific design of the study with a simple dietary intervention."" Puri said the findings would justify recommending 2 grams of cinnamon (lowering the amount from 3 grams to accommodate fears of possible side-effects) - about a level teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon - per day to patients with metabolic syndrome. ""It should be hand-powdered cinnamon: grinding it in an electric mixer would heat it and weaken the effects of its ingredients,"" Puri said. She said one needn't gulp down the powdered cinnamon off a spoon - it could be sprinkled on food (but not hot meals) such as curd, cold milk or porridge and eaten. The scientists believe that cinnamon's ingredients stimulate the release and activity of insulin and decrease glucose production by the liver. They have, however, cautioned that while their results are promising, they need follow-up studies on much larger samples of patients over longer periods of time. ""Long-term studies will be critical,"" Safdar, who is now at the Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad, told The Telegraph over the phone. ""We need to rule out the possibility of any side-effects associated with cinnamon, particularly on the liver,"" she said. Cinnamon, the inner bark of the cinnamon tree, has been used as a spice for centuries in a dry form --- as sticks or as a powder. But the Pakistani study kicked off its marketing as an anti-diabetic food supplement in many countries, stirring concern among health agencies about possible side-effects of its long-term use. Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment said in 2006 that there was ""no toxicological data on the long-term daily administration of high levels of cinnamon"". It recommended that cinnamon products to reduce blood sugar be viewed as ""medical products"" --- subject to a rigorous approval process by the drug regulator ---- rather than food supplements. ""We're not recommending the daily cinnamon to pregnant women, nor to patients already diagnosed with diabetes who are on medical therapy,"" said Seema Gulati, a nutritionist who was part of the study team. ""We tested it only in a group of people at risk of developing diabetes and other health disorders."""

The elephant had died at Kheroni forest range a couple of days earlier but the matter came to light today when the villagers informed about forest officials about a foul smell. The elephant, named Captain by the forest department, used to roam around the greater Amreng reserve forest and Kheroni area in search of food. ""We are busy with the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council election duty. We were discussing among ourselves that the elephant had not been spotted for some time. This morning, the villagers informed us about Captain's death when they saw his carcass in a sugarcane field. He had died five days ago,"" Kheroni forest ranger Chandra Singh Tisso said. ""Captain had become notorious in the area as he had trampled at least three persons to death. There is a possibility that he was poisoned. The matter will become clear only after investigation. We have conducted a post-mortem and are waiting for the report,"" he said. About 142km from Kheroni, in Adarsha Mising Gaon in Kaziranga, a domesticated elephant, Rajdhan, is struggling for survival. ""We had treated him at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC). After his condition improved, we had released him about 15 days ago and he was taken back by his mahout. But he fell ill again. Post-medication care is of utmost importance and we are trying our level best to save his life,"" Pranjit Basumatary, a veterinarian at CWRC, which is located near Kaziranga, said.

""The proposal of the students to cater to the healthcare needs of a village is certainly laudable. We are working on identifying the village in Bodam block, which is near the institution. Students can undertake the activity as part of their curriculum under the preventive and social medicine course. We will extend full support because there can't be a better tribute to Dr B.C.

Gaurav, Roy, a final year MBBS student of the college, said they would pool in funds from their own resources and look forward to assistance from their institution for the purpose. ""We will work out the logistics soon."" Bodam block has 12 panchayats and 65 revenue villages and is barely a few kilometres from the medical college. ""We are yet to zero in on the village, but we will do it soon. The idea dawned on us while we were conducting awareness campaigns in nearby villages asking people to attend the free health check-up camp on our campus as part of the Doctor's Day programme today,"" Roy said. Students of the medical college had gone in groups to various villages and urban slums in Mango, Dimna and Bodam blocks and in Baliguma and Bhillaipahari panchayats to urge villagers to turn up at the day-long camp. Meanwhile, more than 200 villagers got their pressure, blood sugar and general health checked at the camp today. They were also prescribed medicines. ""We are grateful to our faculties who spared their time to attend the camp to not only treat the patients but also prescribe medicines,"" said Abhirup Shome, another final year student of the college. The students have been observing National Doctors' Day for the last three years, but have started to counsel villagers on lifestyle diseases and distribute pamphlets on hygiene practices from this year. ""We also informed the villagers about the harmful effects of consuming tobacco products and spurious liquor and made them aware of basic hygiene practices, symptoms of common diseases and preventive steps against bacterial and viral diseases,"" second-year student Varun Kumar said. Earlier, a blood donation camp was organised at the MGM Medical Hospital in Sakchi to mark the National Doctors' Day."

While not specifying the amount of the hike, Coca-Cola said it would also introduce a more affordable range of aerated beverages to cater to price sensitive consumers. The company said aerated beverages were one of the worst hit categories under GST with a proposed tax of 40 per cent. The GST Council in its meeting on May 18 had said that aerated water containing added sugar or a sweetening matter would attract a GST rate of 28 per cent and a cess of 12 per cent. ""The company has, therefore, no choice but to minimally increase prices even after absorbing a significant portion of the tax increase. It will, however, launch an affordable range of aerated beverages to cater to price sensitive consumers,"" Coca-Cola said. On the packaged drinking water sold under the Kinley brand, the company said it had advised its bottling partners to reduce prices. The company has also decided to launch affordable ""value water"" priced lower than Kinley. On juices and juice-based drinks, though the tax has gone up marginally to 12 per cent, the company has decided to keep prices unchanged and absorb the increase in tax. Coca-Cola said it would continue to provide new variants of fruit juices. The company said it had expanded its juice portfolio to include Minute Maid Pulpy Mousambi and Fanta Fruity Orange - both containing 5 per cent juice sourced from fruits grown on Indian farms. ""The GST is a landmark reform to create a unified taxation system in the country. Since GST is expected to propel India's growth story forward and benefit society at large, we are committed to provide our consumers with the right value for money with various refreshing options.

On the sidelines of a seminar on drug abuse and illicit trafficking at the district library here today, the director of the social welfare department, S.S. Meenakshi Sundaram, told The Telegraph that a drug policy had become necessary because drug consumption was rising in the state. ""The social welfare department is drafting an anti-drug abuse policy to check the menace at the consumption level. Lately, there is a rising trend in consumption. Details of the policy cannot be revealed yet but all the departments working to check the consumption, such as health, police, social welfare, and excise, will be stakeholders in the policy,"" he said. ""A WhatsApp group has been formed, which includes officials from the police, Narcotics Control Bureau, health and social welfare departments and social organisations, to take more consolidated steps against the menace and identify the vulnerable areas, societies and economic classes that are more prone to addiction,"" Sundaram added. According to reports, about 7.8 per cent of the state's population is addicted to narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances. Assam has been a transit point for drugs being shipped from the Golden Triangle - one of Asia's two main opium-producing areas that is spread over Myanmar, Laos and Thailand - for more than four decades. While the Assam CID has a narcotics cell and the office of the state anti-drugs and prohibition council under the state excise department was set up in 1974, the state does not have a policy on how to stop drug consumption. ""It is time that we take a holistic approach to stop this menace by implementing strict laws against drug trafficking and proper infrastructure for de-addiction of the addicts. There 40 drug de-addiction centres in 14 districts. We are setting up more such centres in the rest of the 19 districts of the state,"" Sundaram said. According to the CID's narcotics cell, arrests under the Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, have doubled since 2014. In 2014, 191 cases were registered and 235 people were arrested under the act. In 2016, 328 cases were registered and 587 people arrested. ""Most of the arrested were themselves addicts. The addicts in most of the cases eventually turn into peddlers and make others addicts too...This is how the products move and soon a place, which once was a transit station, turns into a consuming state. This is how drug addiction has spread through Punjab. We must act before Assam turns into another Punjab,"" Indrani Baruah Mahanta, senior superintendent of police of CID's narcotics cell, said. Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu, who was also present in the seminar, said the drug menace is growing by leaps and bounds. ""A survey conducted by the district administration along with an NGO has found that students of even Class VI are getting addicted to drugs, he said. Opium-based drugs such as cocaine, heroin and brown sugar enter the state from Myanmar through the neighbouring states of Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram. It enters mostly through Moreh in Manipur and Dimapur in Nagaland into central and Upper Assam. But lately, the most-preferred route is from Mizoram to south Assam's Barak Valley. Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamines and mephedrone, commonly known as Meow Meow, mostly come from Punjab and northern India while a huge quantity of brown sugar comes from Bihar, through Cooch Bihar in north Bengal to Kokrajhar in Assam. Cannabis is cultivated in the hilly areas of Karbi Anglong and North Cachar Hills districts while opium is produced in several isolated parts of Arunachal Pradesh and makes its way to Assam. In 2016, the CID destroyed cannabis plants covering one bigha and 10 lessas and seized more than 4,366.76kg of cannabis, 10.12kg of heroin and 2,22,639 bottles of pharmaceutical and psychotropic drugs."
5a05d1889855b76bf13c115f,Booklet battle over Yogi 100 days,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170628/jsp/nation/story_159095.jsp,2017-06-28,"Lucknow, June 27: Yogi Adityanath didn't organise any programmes to mark 100 days as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, only releasing a ""booklet of achievements"" on a day that the Opposition dubbed the ""100th unfortunate day"" for the state. ""I am satisfied with 100 days of my work,"" Adityanath said, releasing the booklet at a news conference that contrasted with the grand celebrations previous chief ministers like Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati held after crossing such milestones. The booklet titled 100 Din Vishwas Ke (100 days of Trust) lists among the accomplishments the crop loan waiver scheme for marginal and small farmers, purchase of 36 lakh tonnes of wheat at state-guaranteed support prices, settling payments worth Rs 22,517 crore due to cane farmers by sugar mills, and improvement in law and order. Also on the list was a ""plan"" to observe Uttar Pradesh Day on January 24 next year. The dossier also said the BJP government was working without any bias against anybody, making the claim even as minority community protesters clashed in Muzaffarnagar with police over arrests linked to unfounded rumours of cow slaughter following complaints from gau rakshaks (cow protectors). The Congress dismissed the assertions by releasing another booklet, Sau Din, Sau Fareb (Hundred days, hundred deceits). Reminding Yogi about the BJP's election promise that all criminals would be behind bars within 45 days of the government taking charge, the Congress's pamphlet pointed out that the incidents of murder, rape, loot and robberies have increased 200 to 400 per cent under the new administration. Farm-related claims were rejected too. ""The government has purchased only 33.90 lakh MT wheat from farmers at the support price. The payment of sugarcane farmers is still awaited,"" the Congress report said. State Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh reminded Yogi that his party had promised to purchase 80 million tonnes of wheat this year and termed the cane-payment claim to farmers a ""big lie"". Singh also questioned the law and order picture. ""While the chief minister was holding his news conference, the body of a six-year-old girl was found in Lucknow's Thakurganj area. She was kidnapped yesterday evening by unidentified people and the police had refused to register a case at that time. We are passing through an unfortunate time."" The police claimed it would nab the killers with the help of CCTV footage, only to be left red-faced after a few hours when it emerged that none of the cameras in the locality were functional. ""Before that, an undergraduate student of Bareilly succumbed to burn injuries this morning. This is the law and order situation,"" Singh said. A youth had poured kerosene on the girl, the daughter of a constable, and set her on fire when she resisted sexual assault last night. The police registered a case only after she died. ""Yogi had asked his ministers and officers to declare their assets within 15 days. But the majority of ministers and officers have refused to follow his orders,"" said Satyadev Tripathi, the state Congress's media in-charge. Mayawati gave the BJP government a ""zero"" and said ""crime has reached its peak in 100 days"". ""The Adityanath government is following Narendra Modi government at the Centre in cheating the masses. The two governments are happy because their own saffron-clad people are involved in criminal activities."" The BSP chief appeared to be alluding to today's Muzaffarnagar clashes, stoked by the gau-rakshaks' complaints. The locals, angry because three persons were arrested despite no evidence of cow slaughter, damaged a police jeep and threw stones at the cops. A large police picket has been deployed at the spot in the Kassawan locality. ""Today's incidents are enough evidence that the law and order has collapsed and the Adityanath government has failed to provide security to the people. It was 100th unfortunate day for Uttar Pradesh,"" said Rajendra Chaudhary, the chief spokesperson of the Samajwadi Party."

Bora, officer-in-charge of Dibrugarh police station, said the duo - Nazir Ali and Anwar Hussain - were arrested from their residence.Ali is a relative of druglord Ellahi Sheikh and was arrested earlier, he added.""A case has been registered against the two under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985,'' Bora said.""Sheikh is the kingpin of illicit narcotics trade in the entire Upper and central Assam. He runs his business from Panchali and Kalibari area of the town with the help of a close-knit network consisting mostly of women and school dropouts. Recently, he was arrested but managed to get bail,'' a police official said.Addicts prefer brown sugar because it's cheaper than cocaine and heroin. While a gram of brown sugar can be bought for Rs 500, the same amount of heroin will cost anywhere between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000, a police source said."
5a05d5159855b76bf13c12c7,When a peasant revolts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/when-a-peasant-revolts/article18716297.ece,2017-06-04,"It didnt last long enough to turn public attention away from more weighty matters like cattle trade and peacock tears, but nevertheless, the two-day strike by farmers in Maharashtra ought to have politicians and policymakers worried everywhere. That is because when the Indian farmer decides to take collective action, there is really no way to counter it.Chaudhary Charan Singh demonstrated this way back in 1978. His kisan rally remains the largest gathering witnessed in Delhis Boat Club lawns to date. It was an awesome display of political power which propelled him  howsoever briefly  into the Prime Ministers office.Mahendra Singh Tikait demonstrated it again a decade later at the same venue. Half a million farmers squatting on the lawns off Rajpath soon brought the Rajiv Gandhi government to its knees, which accepted Tikaits long charter of demands, ranging from higher price for sugar cane to waiving of electricity dues.More recently, the Jats of Haryana once again demonstrated the might of farmer power, seeking Backward Class status  and associated reservations in jobs and education  for themselves by coming out into the streets.So, it is hardly surprising that the Devendra Fadnavis government had to cave in, in a span of just two days. With fruit and vegetable prices soaring 50% and faced with an imminent milk shortage, the Fadnavis administration bought peace by agreeing to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers  nearly 80% of the States 13.7 million-strong farmer population  as well as waiving interest and penalty on pending power bills.The government also agreed to hike the procurement price of milk  though perhaps not to the Rs. 50 per litre farmers demanded  and promised to bring in legislation to make procurement of agricultural produce at prices below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) a criminal offence. It also agreed to set up a State-level commission on agricultural costs and prices.Of course, the ruling party has accused middlemen of machinations to jack up prices (quite true) as well as the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party of political shenanigans (also quite true), but that shouldnt distract us from the real takeaways from this episode.The first one is this: when the Indian farmer is roused enough to march on the streets, it is almost impossible for any government to counter it. That is what 65% of the population means. Faced with large-scale farmer protests, Rajiv Gandhis Congress caved; the Janata Party caved; the UPA caved and, now, the BJP has caved in  in Haryana and Maharashtra.The second is this: unless the powers that be stop merely paying lip service to agrarian distress and actually double down efforts to find meaningful solutions, we are looking at potentially much larger, much more impactful uprisings in times to come.A distorted subsidy regimeIt is paradoxical that agrarian distress has risen even as agricultural output has grown. There are many reasons for this. At the core is a distorted subsidy regime which has pushed cereals in favour of oilseeds and pulses, and water or input-intensive cash crops like sugar cane or cotton in areas which are agro-climatically not suited for them. On the other hand, with rising incomes, education levels and prosperity, the nature of food demand has also changed. Indias per capita cereal demand, as Credit Suisses Neelkanth Mishra pointed out in a recent article, has been declining by 1% a year for the last 30 years. This means that domestic demand for cereals isnt growing any more  while output, even in bad monsoon years, has risen.Farmers continue to grow cereals, tempted by rising MSPs. Procurement, faced with growing grain mountains and tightening of subsidies, has reduced, except in traditionally strong agri-markets like Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.This forces distress sales at below MSPs, as was also seen in the case of toor dal this year. Last years record price surge forced the government to announce higher MSPs and incentives. However, an immediate and overwhelming response from the farmers found it unable to actually procure at the promised support price, leading to distress sales, and a continuing cycle of rising agricultural debt and unpaid bills.In Maharashtra, for instance, one of the subsidiary demands was to stop harassment by microfinance companies, which leads me think that another Andhra Pradesh-type crisis may well be brewing there.This in turn triggers demands for loan waivers and other write-offs. Yogi Adityanath set the ball rolling with a loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh  now the demand is spreading. Tamil Nadu farmers, despite a high-profile demonstration in Delhi and a half-hearted strike, have not managed to get one yet, but that is only because they havent yet found a forum  or a leader  they can rally behind. If Tamil Nadu finds a Tikait, the tale would unfold quite differently.The point is, given the manifest shortcomings in execution capability, and the limits on capacity, state intervention  of the type which Fadnavis and the Yogi have preferred  can never really solve the problem. There isnt enough capacity and there isnt enough money.What needs to be done instead is to find holistic solutions  actual, rather than theoretical access to credit, lifting of market access controls, better rural infrastructure, affordable and reliable power supply and a crackdown on middlemen. Otherwise, it may not be milk that flows down the streets the next time around."

The impact may soon be felt in the open market, where the price of sugar is likely to skyrocket. The current price of sugar in the open market is around Rs. 45.Moreover, there were reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) forecasting a further increase in the global prices of sugar.With the Centre taking away the sugar subsidy following the NFSA legislation, there has been no supply of sugar to the State since April.Six States, including Kerala, had been receiving sugar from the Centre at a subsidised rate till MarchTill now, the States had been purchasing sugar to be supplied through the PDS, from the open market at wholesale rates, to be sold through ration shops at a subsidised rate of Rs. 13.50 a kg to BPL families [The BPL category is now divided into Priority card holders and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) card holders or the poorest of the poor].The Centre used to give a subsidy of Rs. 18.50 per kg to States. But with the allocation on sugar subsidy curtailed from the earlier Rs. 4,500 crore to just Rs. 200 crore in the Union Budget 2017-18, the Centre had sounded out the States early itself that it will not be supplying sugar any more to be sold through ration shops.The BPL category is not defined under the NFSA, while it talks about the AAY, Priority and Non-priority categories.The subsidy had to be scrapped as the classification of Priority category was almost double that of the earlier BPL category, entailing a financial burden that the Centre could no longer support.We have not received any sugar since April. We had been holding the stock we received in March, which is now being supplied to both Priority and AAY card holders as per the existing guidelines. In future, however, the State will have to decide if it can bear the huge burden of buying sugar and selling it at a subsidised rate to 34 lakh families in Kerala, says Babychen Mukkadan, all-India general secretary of the Retail Ration Dealers Association .We have now received a communication from the Centre that the sugar subsidy will be continued and limited to just the AAY category, which will receive one kg sugar per family, Special Secretary, Civil Supplies, Mini Antony said.Kerala has about 5.95 lakh AAY families. Approximately 29 lakh families in the Priority category who used to receive subsidised sugar through ration shops will now have to buy from the open market."

Sure, chia is all the rage right now in fad diets, but I cannot get myself to shell out hundreds of rupees on something so similar to a packet of basil seeds or sabja , which only costs me a measly Rs. 20.On seeing several chia puddings flood our Instagram feed week after week, I set out to redeem the falooda seed and reclaim its seat of pride on the kitchen shelf.Underrated heroThe world is turning to chia because it claims to keep hunger at bay, but so does sabja . In fact, sabja has more of a bite to it, because of its glutinous exterior that yields a slightly nutty interior, with no taste of basil. The sabja seed doubles in size when soaked in water, and hardly takes any time to prepare, whereas one would have to wait for a couple of hours on the fussy chia, if soaked. Both are low in calories, but chia seeds are slightly higher in fat, while sabja has more carbs and is higher on protein.In the superfoods race, chia takes the lead because it is packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, but sabja isnt far behind. It not only helps control blood sugar, but also aids with digestion and has cooling properties. Besides this, it also happens to be an excellent source of iron and possesses the same antioxidants that chia prides itself on.Apart from adding sabja seeds to smoothies, juices and making falooda , you can also add it to kheer or stir it into a panna cotta mixture to give it bite. For an overnight sabja pudding, soak the seeds in lukewarm milk with fruits, oats and honey, and it doubles in size in a matter of minutes. This can be made much in advance in little mason jars, and can be taken to-go for a quick and super-nutritious breakfast fix. Play around with the flavours of your sabja pudding like I do  todays pudding has coconut milk, oats, honey, vanilla and, of course, sabja , while tomorrows could be almond milk, oats, maple syrup, sabja and a shot of espresso.The right crunchUnsoaked chia and sabja can be sprinkled on salads for added texture, or combined with other seeds to make snack bars. Since theyre both so versatile, you could also add them to an everyday pancake batter or flatbread dough. Make bonus bliss balls to snack on through the day, that are as simple as combining nuts, mixed seeds, dates, peanut butter, a bit of cocoa and some coconut milk. Roll them into balls and chill. Its super important to get at least a tablespoon of your seed fix every day, because they house essential amino acids that the body needs, but doesnt produce, so we have to get them from our food.This orange cake recipe is speckled with sabja seeds and finished with a light buttercream frosting  perfect for the season. Its also a textural delight, with lots of little black seeds in every bite  my kind of superfood diet."

5a05e0fa9855b76bf13c18f6,Singh  the gin king,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/singh-the-gin-king/article18720425.ece,2017-06-05,"So, you are part of the Vaibhav fan club, chuckles Riyaaz Amlani, restaurateur. Weve been discussing the business of restaurants in the country, increasingly difficult to engage in (thats another story). The conversation has moved to bars and, inevitably, to Indias foremost bar guy, universally acknowledged in the industry as Mr Nice  loved by his ever-growing base of millennial customers, but so media-avoidant that you may not have heard of him at all! For someone at the top of his game, it is surprising that Vaibhav Singh should feature so seldom in pop lists of F&B people in India. But then thats why you are reading this.Partner at Perch, a coffee, wine (and now cocktail-centric) bar in Delhi, Singh is far more than the regular restaurateur. He is also at the centre of a web of beverage businesses, making him the most exciting bar entrepreneur to watch in the next few years. Gin features big time in his scheme of things.A dry startThis month, Singh, in partnership with Anand Virmani (who trained in wine marketing in Dijon, France, and helped do the wine list at Perch), will launch Indias first craft gin. Two years in the planning, the project has been kept tightly under wraps. Greater Than (>) is being produced in Goa and is a London dry gin with about seven to eight botanicals from all over the world: Bulgaria (juniper berries), Morocco (orange peel) and so on. It is gin intended for regular bar use, pegged at Rs. 700 - Rs. 900 a bottle in different markets. At this price, it will hit the sweet spot in the spirits business, says Virmani, explaining how it will be cheaper than the handful of quality-but-imported options that gin-quaffers in the metros have.A bottle of Tanqueray, for instance, costs Rs. 2,000 in Delhi and is the cheapest of the dry gins available. Hendricks is Rs. 5,000 a bottle, while the craft brand, Monkey 47 (to launch here in July) is estimated around Rs. 7,000. These prices mean that your gin and tonics at most regular bars come from cheap house pours, like the made-in-India Blue Ribband (Rs. 350 a bottle). Thats the only way bars maintain their margins, says Singh.The difference, of course, is in quality. London dry gins, even if they are not craft, have fresh botanicals and are expensive to make. Cheaper gins, made by a method called cold-compounding, simply infuse artificial flavouring into any odourless, colourless spirit. Greater Than hopes to address the gap in the market.Craft is really what makes the gin world go round these days. The trend has not abated internationally, with hipster consumers oblivious that many of the worlds craft labels are, in fact, owned by big liquor companies. Pernod Ricard, for instance, bought a majority stake in the Black Forest gin, Monkey 47, last year.What Singh and Virmani hope to do later this year is to give us a sip of some premium artisanal gin with Indian botanicals. Hapusa (meaning juniper in Sanskrit) is going to be relatively pricey, with botanicals handpicked from farms across the country. Himalayan juniper berries are to be foraged by farmers in Uttarakhand, while dried ginger, mango, haldi and gondhoraj lime are being sourced directly from farms, too.At Perch, scores of Vaibhav fans  a tightly-knit bunch of regulars whove followed him as he has bar-hopped across some high-profile establishments  press him for a tasting. Gin, after all, is the with it spirit for those under-40 Indians who aspire to global sophistication, much like their Scotch-drinking fathers had sought. Singh remains affable but firm. Well do a proper tasting in a few days, he promises. In the meanwhile, there are other cocktails to stir.Last year, Singh, Virmani, mixologist Arijit Bose and Pankaj Balachandran (who now looks after Perch with Singh) formed the BarBack Collective. An umbrella consultancy for beverages, it tackles both ends of the spectrum: from setting up bars for others and engaging with liquor companies entering India. From small exclusive events to working with big brands, the idea is to build a single consultancy, points out Bose.The end of 2016 saw BarBack set up two bars from scratch, including an ambitious one in Bengaluru for Sly Granny, launched by Azure Hospitality (that owns Mamagoto). This year, there are two more on the anvil besides the under-the-radar work in collaboration with spirits companies. It is a gossamer web of enterprise in a notoriously tough beverages business.The big bangWith the dexterity of a trapeze artist, however, Singh has swung from one high to the next in his career of 18 years. Chat with him and you realise how almost every major bar opening in the capital since 1999 has had him. When Gungroo at the ITC Maurya was still the epitome of cool, Singh, then a butler, worked there in his spare time, cutting his teeth at the bar. He was part of the opening team at Dublin that came up when the club shut, and at Agni and Aqua at The Park that ruled partying in the mid 2000s. In 2009, his big break came with the luxe LAP. It was this slightly decadent lounge with three partners. Since it was a complex arrangement, Ms (Priya) Paul called me to run it, Singh says, in his understated way. He quit two years later. But by then Delhi society had him on their speed dials.In 2012, he set up PCO in a partnership. That was the year when south Delhis pretty people discovered that standalone bars could be more exclusive than hotels. When Singh opened Perch in 2015, it was this lot that perched with him. The rest as they say is history.Anoothi Vishal writes on dining trends and food cultures.

He found fame behind the bar at Delhis PCO before moving to Q Street in Singapore as its head bartender. The American-style speakeasy became no. 7 on the list of the Worlds 50 Best Bars and number one in Asia.Devender Sehgal Head bartender at 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo, a three Michelin Star restaurant in Hong Kong, Sehgal is quite the celebrity bartender. He represented Hong Kong in the prestigious world finals of the Bacard Legacy Global Cocktail competition in Sydney, creating The Optimist (rum, ginger, honey and basil). Thats the cocktail you should ask for if you ever drink at his bar.Hemant Pathak Junoon in New York City is best known for Vikas Khanna, but behind the Patiala Bar, Pathak does some good work. He uses Indian spirits (think feni and Amrut), and spices to create India-inspired drinks.Vijay Mudaliar Well-known in Singapore, Mudaliar has opened his own bar, Native, which uses Asian ingredients and local spirits. A third-generation Singaporean Indian, he says, I try to reference the flavours that I grew up with. His India cocktails could thus have ghee and jaggery; the Thai-inspired ones use farmed ants in place of citrus; and the Chinese-inspired have performance drugs sourced from local apothecaries.For a cool heartUsually called Gil gil jigarthanda (which translates to cool heart in English), this popular drink is mostly prepared in roadside stalls.

GOVARTHANM.GOVARTHAN ;M.GOVARTHAN - M_GOVARTHANThe Agriculture Department has planned to train 1000 farmers in the district during this year under the State Governments major initiative to promote dryland farming in cluster mode.The idea is to enable farmers in rain-fed areas to sustain livelihood through production of millets, pulses and oilseeds. Animal Husbandry Department, Agricultural Engineering Department and Cooperatives Department are also involved in implementing the programme over a four-year duration until 2019-20.Six clusters have been identified in the district. In each cluster, farmers clubs will be formed for capacity-building through dissemination of technical knowledge and providing hand-holding support, Joint Director of Agriculture S.Viswanathan said.Official sources said each cluster will have a primary agricultural cooperative credit society as its nodal centre.The programme involves establishment of demonstration farms and construction of water conservation structures like community ponds, percolation ponds, check dams and farm ponds have been planned. Farmers are being supplied with the required kits to generate higher income from dryland agriculture.Mr. Viswanathan also informed that Erode district has been sanctioned Rs. 35 crore to be disbursed as subsidy for installing drip irrigation. Drip irrigation would be the remedy for salvaging coconut, sugarcane, maize and other major crops during water-shortage situations, he said.Farmers could install the paraphernalia for drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation and rain gun by availing themselves of the benefit of subsidy utility under the Pradan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Mr. Viswanathan said."

Rajagopal, members of the Left Democratic Front and the United Democratic Front unanimously supported a motion moved by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at a special session of the Assembly on Thursday against a Central notification issued on May 23, imposing curbs on cattle trade.Mr. Rajagopal described the convening of the special session as a misuse of the Assembly to target the Centre and said it marked the launch of a larger alliance (Mahagatbandhan) of parties comprising both fronts against the BJP and the Centre.This stance was quite evident. The session was convened for discussing a non-issue to create confusion and concern among the people for reaping cheap political gains, he said.Farmer friendly: BJPThe notification was issued four months ago on the basis of Supreme Court directions. There was no ban on meat sale. It was aimed at helping farmers. Though there were opportunities to register opinion against the notification, none had bothered to do it so far.The Centre had clarified that it was open to suggestions and for amendments too. Still, both fronts were unwilling to accept it and were pursuing it for political gains, he said.VS calls for legislationFormer Chief Minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who initiated a discussion on the motion, said the State should frame a legislation against the notification.The State had a strong cooperative movement and hence more modern slaughter houses should be set up in the cooperative sector.He termed the notification as a national tragedy and said that it was aimed at setting the ground for monopolising cattle trade for corporate majors such as Adani and Ambani.Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala described it as an infringement on the personal freedom of the people to have food of their choice. He termed the notification as a surgical strike and sought a legislation against it. The notification was a sugar coated poison.

Kanagaraj said 56,500 farmers from the district had insured their crops such as paddy, maize, black gram, green gram, groundnut, cotton and sugarcane cultivated on 51,482 hectare under the Crop Insurance Scheme for 2016  2017 and had paid Rs. 3.07 crore as premium.For the current kar season, farmers should pay the insurance premium of Rs. 470 per acre for paddy before July 31 and the deadline for paying the premium for other crops is August 15, he said.However, the farmers complained that those who had insured their crops by properly paying the premium with the designated insurance company were yet to get compensation for the unprecedented crop loss they had suffered.District secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam P. Velumayil said the farmers, even after paying the prescribed premium before the deadline, were desperately waiting for the compensation to be paid by the insurance company.The farmers indefinite wait after suffering huge crop loss is really agonising When we raised this issue earlier, the insurance firm and the officials assured us that the compensation would be paid at the earliest. However, the affected agriculturists are yet to get the compensation, Mr. Velumayil said.He also complained that the premium of Rs. 330 per acre for paddy had been increased to Rs. 470. This is due to the governments policy that favours a private firm. Instead, the government itself should implement the insurance scheme so that the farmers will get benefited while paying affordable premium, Mr. Velumayil said.Endorsing his views, farmer S. Kasamuthu and S. T. Shaik Maideen of Communist Party of India charged that the insurance firm was just cheating the farmers by delaying the compensation disbursal.Intervening, Mr. Sandeep assured the farmers that the first phase of compensation disbursal would be completed by June 26.The officials replied that the farmers would get increased compensation as the crop insurance premium had been upwardly revised.A senior official from ICICI Lombard, the insurance firm, Kothandaraman replied that their company, which had completed the compensation disbursal in Salem and Tirupur districts, would commence this exercise in Tirunelveli district from June 20.Even as he was replying, Mr. Kothandaraman swooned. However, he recovered after a few minutes, much to the relief of the officials and farmers.When the farmers urged the Collector to take a survey on the coconut trees withered due to drought, Mr. Sandeep said any decision in this connection could be taken only by the government and hence could not be conducted at the district level.He also assured that the district administration would take appropriate action for sinking borewells or digging open wells if the farmers could provide information on availability of groundwater near the affected areas."

The proposal has been suspended after a meeting on Thursday.Earlier this week, farmers of several villages along the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border falling under Pallipet taluk, Tiruvallur district, agitated against the move to construct a check dam across a supply channel of Kusa river at Nelavoi, Andhra Pradesh. The supply channel fed Velliagaram tank, which was the main source of irrigation for 10 villages. The construction of check dam upstream would pose a threat to their livelihood, farmers said.Though Kusa river originates in Andhra Pradesh, it is crucial for Tamil Nadu as it brings copious inflow to the Kosasthalaiyar river that joins the Poondi reservoir. The 4-km supply channel that branches off Kusa river feeds tanks within Tamil Nadu limit.P. Ravindranath, a resident of Velliagaram, said while 3.5 km of the channel runs in Andhra Pradesh, only 500 metre falls in Tamil Nadu. A check dam upstream will block surplus water flowing into the chain of water bodies from Velliagaram tank. Many farmers depend on the tank to grow sugarcane and paddy. We agitated as it poses a threat to our irrigation rights, he said.Members of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association said about 2,000 acres of irrigation lands in villages, including Velliagaram Colony, I.V. Pattadai and Sanakuppam depended on the inflow from the supply channel. C. Perumal, the associations treasurer, said there was no need to construct a check dam as the Kusa river has flow for over eight months and villages in the Andhra Pradesh limits also benefited from the Velliagaram tank."

Thanikodi, a farmer from Usilampatti, alleged that the private companies were charging more than double the market price for certain components for setting up drip irrigation. However, the government insists that we buy only from them, he said.When officials from Horticulture department pointed out that the farmers could choose from a list of 24 companies, Mr. Thanikodi and a few other farmers who supported his allegation said that the companies had formed a cartel and were charging roughly around the same amount. The farmers demanded that they should instead be allowed to choose from any vendor in the market, provided procurement bills were submitted properly to the government for reimbursement.Highlighting that farmers were asked to take care of transportation and installation, they also insisted that the entire cost be covered in the subsidy.Pointing out that the scheme subsidised only the materials and not installation or transportation, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, who presided over the meeting, said that the list of companies and other provisions of the scheme could not be changed at the district level.

Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, pointed out that the private and government-run sugar mills together owed roughly Rs. 2,000 crore to farmers across the State, of which the National Cooperative Sugar Mill in Alanganallur owed Rs. 11 crore. We are planning a protest in Chennai on Thursday if the government does not initiate measures to settle the dues, he said.Farmers also demanded that drip irrigation subsidy be extended for onion cultivation, for which Horticulture department officials said that a proposal had already been sent to the government.Pointing out that a majority of issues raised at the meeting related to PWD, Collector Rao instructed PWD officials in the rank of Assistant Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer from every division to be present to properly respond to farmers queries.Similarly, registering his disappointment over the absence of Forest department officials at the meeting despite many issues raised in relation to them, Mr. Rao called the District Forest Officer over phone during the meeting and asked him to ensure that the department was properly represented."

The farmers held a lathi poojan (baton worship) ceremony on Sunday.Sugarcane is considered a profitable crop, but the farmers are miffed over the delay in payments. According to sources, dues worth 140 crore against the sugarcane supplied by the farmers to the sugar mills during previous years are pending in Udham Singh Nagar. There are four sugar mills of corporation and co-operative sector in Sitarganj, Kichha, Bazpur and Nadehi in Jaspur.The farmers, demanding their dues, have organised dharnas, sent memoranda to the state government and met public representatives, including the chief minister, many a time, but in vain. Fed up with the assurances, farmers have decided to weild lathis to fight for their dues. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer and organiser of the programme, said, Bazpur sugar mill owes 45 crore to the farmers. Farmers have taken loan from banks, but are unable to repay them because of the financial crisis. Bank officials are visiting their houses for the loan recovery. Government has sufficient money, but not giving the payment and price of the farmers produce.He added, We have performed lathi poojan because Mahatma Gandhi played a vital role in freedom struggle with his own lathi. Lathi in Bazpur will boost the morale of farmers and help awaken the state government against the delay in payment.Bajwa said, We have given the government time till July 8 to take action in this regard. If our warning is unheard, then we will start (an) agitation in the interest of sugarcane producers of the area.According to Dharmveer Singh, assistant commissioner, sugarcane, US Nagar, Last year, farmers cultivated sugarcane on 31,657 hectare land and the management of sugar mills have to pay 140 crore to the farmers. Out of this amount, around 44 crore of 2015-16 is yet to be paid to the farmers. He said he has sent notices to the management of sugar mills to pay the pending dues of farmers."

While it is not considered a major problem in women in Kerala compared to those in other States, two separate studies on anaemia in schoolchildren  published in 2015 and 2016 in the National Medical Journal of India and Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research showed that the prevalence of anaemia was more or less equally distributed in all socio-economic categories, with highest among the upper classes and least among the lower classes.One of the studies in schoolchildren from classes V to IX  boys and girls in government-run and privately managed schools in Kollam  it was found that irregular intake of iron supplements and drinking tea or coffee along with meals, among other things, were responsible for the anaemic status. The study had found 31.4% of the children anaemic. In another smaller-size study in the field practice area of Kottayam Medical College, girls in the Ettumanoor panchayat were assessed for their haemoglobin levels. The prevalence of anaemia was found to be 21%. Improper personal hygiene, improper footwear usage, heavy menstrual blood flow, and less jaggery intake were found to be the causes for low haemoglobin.Both studies indicated that the prevalence was comparatively lesser in lower socio-economic groups. This may be owing to iron and folic acid supplementation through peripheral health institutions and government schools that were better utilised by lower socio-economic groups, the studies conclude.Similar patterns are being found in clinical practice too. V. Girija, gynaecologist at the rural centre of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences at Njarackal, said incidence of anaemia among pregnant women visiting her the clinic was less.Smithy Sanel, gynaecologist at Sree Narayana Institute of Medical Sciences, who sees a cross-section of rural and urban women, said there could be about 20% pregnant women who were anaemic.The problem is our carbohydrate-rich diet, said Dr. Sanel. We have little iron in our diet, she added. Jaggery, which was a source of iron in traditional diet, had been replaced by sugary snacks, she said. Green leafy vegetables were a good source of iron, but phytates made them less absorbable, Dr. Sanel said. Milk-based diet had been found to be good to increase the iron and calcium levels in blood, she said.There was a rise in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in adolescents that could be a cause for anaemia, said gynaecologist Shirley Mathen of Aster Medcity. Dietary factors could be responsible, but the causes are largely unknown, she said. The issue was major topic of discussion in the Gynaec-Gastro Interface meet held here recently, she added.The Ettumanoor study points out that poor dietary pattern followed by members of the higher socio-economic group with more of snacks and junk food, which lack micro-nutrients, is the cause of higher prevalence of anaemia among them. It had also concluded that prevalence of anaemia was higher among the obese (37.5%), followed by those who are overweight (26.1%), normal (21.4%), thin (16.1%), and severely thin (7.7%). This may be owing to certain imbalances in the body metabolism that hampers iron absorption.Both studies also point out how fruits do not make a major portion of the diet in children in both higher and lower socio-economic groups.Shyama Rajagopal"

It was interwoven with the life of every rural family in the past. Palmyra was popular not only for the drinks like toddy, sweet toddy, fruits and tuber, but also for the numerous other benefits it offers  from timber to leaves.Unfortunately, this permanent crop that thrived with less human contribution for its growth has been losing its importance among the masses over the decades. The city residents are reminded of the palm only during the summer when its translucent nungu (ice apple) or sweet toddy are sold on the roadsides.The widening gap between common man and the robust palm is basically due to fast urbanisation, change in lifestyle, advancement in plastic science and State governments policy on prohibition.Palmyra was all over our district. They grew on their own without any need for irrigation. It never required any fertilizer or pesticide, but a regular maintenance, said P. Arumugam (83) of Ayyampatti near Alagarkoil.His life and livelihood centred around palms since his childhood. The septuagenarian said most of the palm groves had given way to urbanisation.Who wants palm and palm products these days, he rued. The economy of palm farmers was based on its jaggery (karuppatti), toddy and sweet toddy (pathaneer) and also its leaves that were used to put up thatched roof.The first blow to palmyra was when sugar extracted from sugarcane started gaining popularity. That was the first point, when palmyra started to lose its sheen, said coordinator of Tamil Nadu Toddy Movement C. Nallasamy.Before Independence, palmyra jaggery was the only means of sweetness in Tamil Nadu. But, now 46 sugarmills here have pushed jaggery to a remote corner.People have a craze for white sugar. And this craze has killed palmyra farming and also left a good size of population diabetic, he said.Fast urbanisation and lifestyle changes rendered the palm leaves less useful. Most of the rural families used palm leaves for putting up roofs, fences, huge shelters and sheds for the cattle. But roof tiles reduced the demand for palm leaves.However, palms importance was still there in its timber used for putting up roof. Later, the advent of steel and asbestos sheets made it redundant.The city and the villages have concrete structures and this has made palms irrelevant in day-to-day usage to a larger extent, said Pannerselvam (45), son of Mr. Arumugam. He left his family occupation and became a driver.It was the State Governments prohibition policy of introducing arrack and later Indian-made Foreign Liquor and replacing toddy that dealt a fatal blow to palms, accused Mr. Nallasamy.It was a mindless move by the powers-that-be to replace the healthy toddy with liquor which has become a major evil in society, he added.Consequently, the number of palms were reduced to 5 crore in Tamil Nadu from 50 crore in the mid 1900s, he said.The advent of nylon ropes and polythene bags nullified the usage of palm leave baskets and palm fibre ropes. Even the hand-held fans, baskets used to pack eatables and rattles for babies that were made of palm leaves are now in plastic.However, some kinds of baskets are still alive due to traditional needs in processions and even funeral rituals, said Pusphalatha (40), who weaves baskets for her daily expenses.Now, palm climbers are a rarity. I am dependent on three persons who can climb palmyras and cut nungu, said V. Thangaraj (29). Thangaraj has taken on lease some 100 palms along Alagarkoil-Melur highway from State Highways department.With palmyra being useful only during the nungu season, one of the palm climbers, V. Karuppasamy (22), said he went for other farm works on other days. It is very risky. But, this fetches me good money, the youth said. However, he said he could climb only five to six palms a day.We risk our lives to bring nungu to the doorsteps of the people despite increasing labour and transportation cost. But, people still want to buy it at a price that is not remunerative, Mr. Thangaraj lamented.A discouraging trendIf the same trend continued for another few years, all palmyras will vanish and no one will be involved in this traditional farming, Mr. Nallasamy said.He wanted the government to bring in a legislation to make cutting of palmyras a non-bailable offence.If the government is really interested in encouraging palmyra farming, it should withdraw subsidy to sugar sold in ration shops. Instead, the subsidy should be extended to jaggery, he added.However, the biggest encouragement would be lifting of the ban on tapping toddy. He had thrown up a challenge with a prize money of Rs. 10 crore to anyone who proved that the IMFL was a better than toddy health-wise.Toddy and nungu were highly rich in vitamins and minerals. If toddy is properly packed and exported, it will bring in huge foreign exchange and revive the livelihood of farmers, Mr. Nallasamy added.Palmyras were all over the district. They grew on their own without any need for irrigation. They did not require fertilizer or pesticideP. ArumugamAyyampatti villagerNow, palm climbers are a rarity.

The participants, working in two groups had added butter, sugar, egg yolks and four to a KitchenAid mixer to get the dough to the right consistency.For Daniel Fernandes, whose family runs a catering business, the opportunity to hone his skills in patisserie, which his father has outsourced so far, is something he didnt want to miss. Much like the others who participated at this workshop held at Andheris Callebaut Academy, Fernandes had paid Rs. 15,000 for a class with Geuffroy a teacher at Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athne, Paris. Geuffroy one of Frances top dessert chefs began teaching at the prestigious culinary institute, Alain Ducasse Education (where hes the Pastry Director), six years ago.As part of a tie-up between the Taj and the Ducasse Education, Geuffroy is one of two chefs travelling the country taking classes with baking enthusiasts. This will be followed by a trip to the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM) Aurangabad where chefs from across the country will get a chance to learn new techniques, plating ideas and keep up with international patisserie trends. The workshop at IHM is an alliance between the Maulana Azad Education Trust and the Taj Group. To wrap-up, Geuffroy has a workshop in Delhi for Taj chefs from across north India.At the class, Geuffroy gamely fielded questions on vegetarian substitutes for gelatin and its proportion in recipes. The chef talked about different brands that hes encountered on his travelsoften leading to subtle changes in flavour and cooking time. There is a challenge with moving from place to place, he said. In the Philippines, I had to make a croissant, and I found it hard to find the right ingredients. But I have to oblige, to whatever circumstance and situation comes [and] constantly adjust. Its this ability to keep tweaking recipes, while teaching them, is one of the reasons that Geuffroy enjoys his job, and interacting with students. He elaborated, You need to have [the] understanding, if you dont have the right ingredient, there will be a difference.The participants, who varied from expatriate wives to Indians with a penchant for baking, were eager to learn, working to replicate the techniques shown. They took videos on their phones to make a note of the consistency that the pate  choux should achieve before being piped onto a baking tray and topped with chopped peanuts, walnuts and almonds. Working collaboratively, the members of each group took turns working with ingredients, manning the mixers, whisking ingredients, zesting lemons, filling piping bags and then piping out dough. When asked why she enrolled, Klara (who declined to give her last name), a Hungarian whos been living in Mumbai for three years says, the opportunity to improve my technique, In the same breath, she added, and to meet a big chef.As the class took a break for lunch, I chatted with Geuffroy as he talked about working with seasonal ingredients like the king of fruits. To make a mango tart here would be better than using any other fruit, since it is available here locally, he said. For him travelling around the world throws up its fair share of challenges, but theres the benefit of local produce to balance that out."

Every evening during the holy month, the streets around Minara Masjid are heaving with iftar food stalls and with people  those who are breaking their fast and those looking to just relish the meaty delicacies and sugary specials. There are some essential pit stops such as Noor Mohammadi Hotel (shami kebab and Sanju baba chicken), Bismilla (offal dishes), Janta Fast Food (quail tandoori), Noorani Milk Centre (malpua) and Suleman Usman Mithaiwala (phirni), not to mention the myriad kebab stalls and the famous khichda vendor at the end of the road.When I came to Mumbai for the first time in 2007, I went to Mohammad Ali Road (for iftar). When I joined [Sofitel] in 2015, I thought why not bring the experience of that street food here during Ramzan, says chef Shadab Ahmed Qureshi of Jyran  Tandoor Dining and Lounge at Sofitel Mumbai. The restaurant has launched a Mohammad Ali Road food promotion, which will continue until Eid later this month. This is the restaurants third edition featuring iftar food. On the menu are several Mohammad Ali Road favourites, albeit with a five-star twist.Tried and testedWe began with sherbets, essentially fruit juices spiked with masala. While the watermelon sherbet was refreshing, the pineapple one was cloyingly sweet. Theres a long list of appetisers, including cutlets, kebabs, and rolls of all kinds. The chicken achari tikka was a standout for its spicy pickle marinade and the succulent chicken perfectly cooked in a clay oven. The roti pe bhuni roti sounded great on the menu  lamb cooked on griddle, flavoured with red chillies and served on Indian bread. Though the lamb, served taco-style on a tiny roti, was well-cooked, it struck a single flavour note paling in comparison to the other dishes. The macchi tawa fry made with tilapia was competent enough. We tried both the vegetable and chicken cutlets, and the former one far outshone its meaty counterpart; indeed it was our favourite amongst all the appetisers. Not only was the patty juicy and flavourful, the semolina-encrusted top gave a crunchy texture to the cutlet, something that was sorely lacking in the chicken version.The gloriously meaty main course features bara handi, khichda, kheema pao, and a couple of offal dishes. We picked the gurda kaleji pao  a finger-licking delicious mix of lamb kidney and liver cooked till the organs turn pleasingly soft but not mushy. The fluffy mini paos on the side were warm and glistening with a dab of butter  perfect companions to mop up the spicy kidney-liver preparation. The menus pice de rsistance Khichda, the slow-cooked dish of lamb and mixed lentils with its mildly spicy flavours, is bound to be a crowd-pleaser. Khichda is more popular than Haleem in Mumbai, and if youre looking to try just one dish, I would recommend this, says Qureshi. There are biryanis and pulao on offer as well, but we left them for another day.Desserts galoreVegetarians have limited options, though the vegetable cutlet is far superior to most we have had in the city. After fasting the entire day, the body needs energy and protein, so meat is the best option, says Qureshi, explaining the paucity of vegetarian dishes in an iftar spread.

The dessert menu has all the iftar specialities, from sheer korma and phirni to kulfi falooda and malpua-rabdi.

The bandh was called seeking Prime Minister Narendra Modis intervention to implement the Kalasa-Banduri Nala project in north Karnataka and demanding a permanent irrigation facility for the parched districts of the Old Mysore region.Though all the organisations are united in support of these two issues, the main contention of those who have decided against participating in the bandh is that they dont want to cripple normal life repeatedly by observing bandhs. Nevertheless, all of them have offered moral support to the bandh.While veteran Kannada protagonists Vatal Nagaraj and Sa. Ra. Govindu are leading the bandh, Kannada organisations such as the Narayana Gowda faction of Kannada Rakshana Vedike are not supporting the bandh.Similarly, Bengaluru Tourist Taxi Owners Association, Bengaluru Hotel Owners Association, the auto-rickshaw owners and drivers association, and the APMC traders union have decided to stay away from the bandh. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation will take a call on operating services after gauging the situation on the day.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and Home Minister G. Parameshwara said the bandh call would not get the support of any sections.Meanwhile, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha also has called for a bandh on Monday, seeking waiver of farm loans by the Centre. But the Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association has made it clear it is not participating."
5a05fe7b9855b76bf13c2ab8,Adulteration provides food for thought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adulteration-provides-food-for-thought/article19097316.ece,2017-06-18,"Last week, the city witnessed a video of MTC staff purporting to show plastic rice being served in their canteen. The clip, showing men in khaki bouncing small balls of rice off the walls and tables at the canteen of the Ayanavaram bus depot, spread like wildfire on social media. The footage also came close on the heels of information shared on WhatsApp regarding the seizure of alleged plastic rice in other parts of the country.In a State where its own Dairy Development Minister came out with the shocking allegation that private milk producers were adding chemicals to their products, similar claims pertaining to adulteration of rice with plastic seemed ever more probable. So, is there really plastic in rice and sugar, and are there chemicals in milk? Could eggs be made of plastic? Was there any truth to the messages circulating on WhatsApp or were they merely old wives tales that no one in the position of authority was prepared to debunk?As one scare story after another finds prominence through social media platforms, questions are asked, and sometimes answered, with knee-jerk reactions. As adulteration has long remained a tool of choice for unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick buck, only the adulterants have varied with time. Consumer activists point to the need for a proper system capable of answering these questions in a scientific manner, and wherever necessary, allaying rumours and suspicions about food safety that arise periodically among the public.The term plastic rice came into being after a scandal was exposed in China in 2010, in which pellets were made by mixing sweet potato powder with poor quality rice. A resin was found to have been used for the bonding. But this was banned.But in India, although there have been several complaints and allegations of rice being mixed with plastic, tests conducted on so-called plastic rice have conclusively proved that there had been no plastic element in such rice samples, said A. C. Mohan, secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners and Paddy-Rice Dealers Associations.As regards the clips showing rice balls being bounced off the walls, Mr. Mohan said that gelatine, which is found naturally in rice, could make it bouncy if rolled into balls. Boiled rice has more of gelatine, which retains more of its germinal matter. While raw rice varieties including Basmati are not sticky, varieties grown in Tamil Nadu such as Ponni , ADT 36 and Adhisiya Ponni are more sticky than the usual boiled rice. Rubber samba and Maappilai samba are rare varieties that have even more starch and gelatin and are suitable to make kall dosai . These varieties take longer to grow (in some cases six months) and are more healthy, he explained.Federation president D. Thulasingam said that rice merchants were also consumers in the first place, and that they will not sell such adulterated products. Various government agencies had taken samples and conducted tests but so far, no plastic has been found in rice anywhere in the country. Plastic cannot be cooked, it will only melt in the heat. Rice will sink in water, whereas plastic will float. Any home-maker can differentiate between boiled and raw rice by mere feel, smell and sight, he said.It also does not make economic sense to mix plastic with rice, he said. Plastic pellets available in the market are costlier than rice. A kilo of plastic costs anywhere between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100, whereas rice costs Rs. 30-Rs. 60 a kilo. How can someone use a costlier item to make something cheaper? Also, we have at least six months worth of stocks of rice and there is no need for importing rice, let alone plastic rice, Mr. Thulasingam added.R. Kathiravan, designated officer, Food Safety department, Chennai, said that 20 samples of rice were collected and sent for analysis. While 16 of them were sent to the food analysis lab at the King Institute campus in Chennai, four samples were sent to a lab in Thanjavur . Of the 15 results received till date, there has been no evidence of any plastic content in the rice in Chennai, he said.Chemicals in milkUntil a few days ago, milk vendors too had to ward off such queries from consumers after State Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji levelled allegations against certain private milk brands, saying they were adding chemicals to milk.In the wake of the controversy, district administrations stepped in at places such as Madurai and Coimbatore and tested milk samples submitted by the residents. In Madurai, the electronic milk adulteration tests showed that out of 217 samples taken on three different dates in the city and two other locations in the suburbs, 25 samples were found to be of sub-standard quality, while another was found to be unsafe for consumption. District Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that awareness was high among rural people as well.Maheswari of Jawahar Nagar, Thirumangalam, in Madurai, said she purchased milk from a vendor who supplied it in quantities of 100 ml and 150 ml. Since it was not branded, we decided to provide a sample of it for testing and found that it was safe to consume, she added.Madurai-based consumer activist Andrews pointed out that the government officials carried out tests only after the Minister for Dairy Development raised the issue of adulteration, adding that such tests should be conducted on a regular basis. Not just milk, the officials should also carry out periodic tests on all items including oil and rice as there have been complaints of sub-standard goods coming in, he added.Adulteration of milk is being monitored on a monthly basis, said a senior Food Safety department official. Of the samples we collected, only one from Madurai was found to be unsafe, as soap oil had been mixed with it. With regard to the other samples, some were found to be sub-standard  containing water, for instance, in milk, but they were not unsafe in terms of health, he said. While sub-standard milk can attract a penalty, unsafe milk can lead to a case in court, a fine and imprisonment, he noted.A milk industry expert said that so far, in samples lifted by the Food Safety department, only samples of unpackaged milk have been found to contain traces of detergent or soap oil.The soap element may have even been due to improper cleansing of utensils at homes. Private milk producers know that their customers are brand-conscious and loyal to their brands due to certain factors, the most important being quality. At times, when it comes to favoured brands, consumers wont even bother about the cost. Companies will not compromise on quality and end up losing the loyalty of such consumers, he said.However, the Milk Commissionerate has stopped taking samples of milk ever since the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) stepped in and began collecting samples.Plastic eggs scareIn the wake of the recent plastic eggs scare, acting on a State-wide directive and complaints from consumers, checks were conducted on eggs in Coimbatore district. All of the 161 samples collected in April this year were found to be safe. Samples of popular White Leghorn were tested at the government laboratory in Madurai, said O.L.S. Vijay, designated officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.Adulteration not newWith plastics and chemicals prevalent in pretty much everything we use, the adulteration scare is here to stay. In the 1980s food adulteration was something that people had just begun hearing about  it used to mean stones in rice, water in milk, sawdust in tea and brick powder in chilli powder. But all that is pass now.Adulteration has taken on a new avatar. It now comes in the form of non-permitted colours being added to snacks like bhajji and pakoda sold on the roadsides, maida bleached with chemicals, oil-soluble red colour added to chilli powder and cheap palm oil mixed with other cooking oils to reduce the price, says G. Santhanarajan of the Consumer Association of India (CAI).Even the word adulteration is not to be found in the Food Safety and Standards Act. The Act talks about safe foods, sub-standard and unsafe foods. You can simply pay a fine and get off the hook unless the product is deemed unsafe. We now have to be afraid of plastics, especially those that come in the form of food packaging. Packing hot food items in plastic bags is bad for health as the heat causes the plastic to react. Everything from oil to water to pulses that we buy comes in plastic packs. But since nobody has time for anything, people dont even bother to carry their own bags to department stores to avoid plastic bags, he rued.Enforcement failureAfter the Food Safety and Standards Act came into force, though a separate set-up came into being to check food standards, the very same officials of various local bodies have been implementing the norms. Consumer activists feel that the department is failing at enforcement.Nirmala Desikan, chairman and managing trustee, CAI, said that the new Act was a detailed and more comprehensive one than the one that it replaced. There are so many things that are adulterated, but the problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rules. We also dont know how many complaints it (Food Safety department) receives or how many are dealt with. The department is not transparent, she said.Food Safety officials have refused to provide the exact data on adulteration of milk in the State to The Hindu . Only rough figures of complaints and samples collected were provided. Each laboratory gets around 500 samples a month. Just 100 samples are collected from milk products, said a source.Many residents have registered complaints with the Food Safety department through its WhatsApp number 9444042322. We will increase random sampling to study the trends. The analysis is done in three days. Samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints, said an official.But activist T. Sadagopan is far less optimistic. The very few checks that are done hardy matter since very few people are penalised. And those who adulterate will continue to do so. For the consumer, this would only mean unchecked adulteration leading to an adverse impact on their health.( With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez and Zubeda Hamid in Chennai, L.

5a05ff709855b76bf13c2b11,How does the monsoon affect the economy?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/how-does-the-monsoon-affect-the-economy/article18962893.ece,2017-06-12,"Earlier this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted the country would get normal monsoon rains in 2017. The state-run weather body last week said Indias annual monsoon rainfall is expected to be 98% of the long-period average (LPA), up from 96% projected earlier, raising prospects of higher farm output and economic growth.The forecast has a margin error of 4%. The monsoon is considered normal if rains in the June-September season are between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 89 cm.Why are monsoon rains important for India?The monsoon is the lifeblood for Indias farm-dependent $2 trillion economy, as at least half the farmlands are rain-fed. The country gets about 70% of annual rainfall in the June-September monsoon season, making it crucial for an estimated 263 million farmers.About 800 million people live in villages and depend on agriculture, which accounts for about 15% of Indias gross domestic product (GDP) and a failed monsoon can have a rippling effect on the countrys growth and economy.Whereas, a normal to above-normal and well-distributed monsoon boosts farm output and farmers income, thereby increasing the demand for consumer and automotive products in rural markets.What were recent trends?India witnessed a normal monsoon in 2016 but only after two back-to-back poor monsoons in 2014 and 2015 that affected the overall growth in the country.However, with a good chance of a normal monsoon in 2017, analysts expect the growth momentum to continue.The second consecutive year of normal monsoon will help revive consumption demand, which was severely affected by the de-legalisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, India Ratings and Research said.What happens in case of a poor monsoon?The monsoon has a direct impact on the countrys agricultural GDP. The planting of key kharif, or summer, crops like rice, sugar cane, pulses and oilseeds begins with the arrival of monsoon rains in June.Summer crops account for almost half of Indias food output and a delayed or poor monsoon means supply issues and acceleration in food inflation, a key metric which influences Reserve Bank of Indias decision on interest rates.A deficit monsoon could also lead to a drought-like situation, thereby affecting the rural household incomes, consumption and economic growth. A poor monsoon not only leads to weak demand for fast-moving consumer goods, two-wheelers, tractors and rural housing sectors but also increases the imports of essential food staples and forces the government to take measures like farm loan waivers, thereby putting pressure on finances. Whereas a normal monsoon results in a good harvest, which in turn lifts rural incomes and boosts spending on consumer goods. It also has a positive impact on hydro power projects.What is the current forecast for rain distribution?The monsoon rains arrive on the southern tip of Kerala by around June 1 and gradually covers a major part of the country by mid-July before retreating by the end of September. The IMD has predicted seasonal rainfall this year to be 96% of LPA over north-west India, and 100% of LPA over central India.Rains in the southern regions are likely to be 99% of LPA while precipitation in north-east India will be 96% of LPA in the four-month period. All projections have a margin error of 8%.Rainfall in July and August, crucial months for crop sowing, over the country is expected to be 96% and 99% of LPA, respectively, both with a margin error of 9%. India Ratings said the spread of monsoon over space and time is also forecast to be normal and that bodes well for agricultural output.Even the water storage available in 91 major reservoirs of the country for the week ending on 1 June 2017 was higher than last year by 128% and 105% of the last 10 years, which augurs well for kharif sowing, it noted."

He added that Haryanas farmers had seen an era of prosperity during the Congress rule, but the present government had wrested away power by making false promises.Sounding a word of caution for the BJP government, Mr. Hooda said that the farmer was silent, not dead.Several farmers leaders also addressed the gathering, appealing to the former Chief Minister to lead the farmers agitation in the State. Several Congress MLAs were also present in the meeting.State-wide stirThe farmers, meanwhile, raised their hands to adopt a charter of 14 demands, including waiving Haryana farmers loans based on the lines of Uttar Pradesh and Maharasthra, immediate implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report and guaranteed 50% profit over and above their input cost, fixed Minimum Support Price (MSP) for sugarcane to commensurate with the price of sugar, MSP for vegetables and poplar, reduction in diesel and urea prices to pass on the benefit of fall in prices of crude oil, construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal, and to run all thermal power plants in Haryana to their capacity.The Kisan Panchayat was held as part of the Congress State-wide agitation from June 16 to July 7 in support of the farmers.The next dharna will be held at Sirsa on June 21, followed by Rewari (June 25), Sonipat (July 1), Jind (July 5) and Nuh (July 7)."

A number of studies have shown, says endocrinologist Jayashree Gopal, that greater use of pesticides increases the prevalence of diabetes. Acute pesticide exposure can lead to blood sugar shooting up, and chronic or long-term exposure can make an individual more prone to diabetes, she says. And this is just one among a number of chemicals that we are being exposed to in our daily lives. From shampoos and car fresheners to the plastic boxes in which we store our food, our environment contains an ever-increasing number of what are known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, Dr. Gopal says. They enter our system at different levels  you could inhale the fumes of a scent, eat food wrapped in plastic or even have it enter your body through printed receipts that you handle. Even if disposed of, these chemicals leach into the groundwater and re-enter our food chain, she says.Pernicious effectsWhile there have been no long-term human studies as of yet, animal studies have shown that these endocrine-disrupting chemicals can cause a number of problems: thyroid disorders, low sperm count in men and even affect the developing foetus in pregnant women, she says.Oncologists too say that long-term exposure to chemical carcinogens can lead to cancer, and at times, these chemicals can contaminate food and water.In immediate cases, adulterants in food or drinks can cause gastric irritation, vomiting, diarrhoea and even jaundice, if they contain an infectious material, says S. Raghunandan, professor of medicine at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.In the case of adulterated tea for instance , regular intake of tea containing synthetic colour can lead to gastrointestinal diseases, said O.L.S. Vijay, designated officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.However, Dr. Raghunandan says how adulterants affect the body can be difficult to predict, as it depends on the substance used and how long a person is exposed to it.(With inputs from Wilson Thomas)"

The study had found 31.4% of the children anaemic.In another smaller-size study in the field practice area of Kottayam Medical College, girls in the Ettumanoor panchayat were assessed for their haemoglobin levels.The prevalence of anaemia was found to be 21%. Improper personal hygiene, improper footwear usage, heavy menstrual blood flow, and less jaggery intake were found to be the causes for low haemoglobin.Iron supplementsBoth studies indicated that the prevalence was comparatively lesser in lower socio-economic groups.This may be owing to iron and folic acid supplementation through peripheral health centres and government schools that were better utilised by lower socio-economic groups, the studies conclude.Similar patterns are being found in clinical practice too. V. Girija, gynaecologist at the rural centre of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences at Njarackal, said incidence of anaemia among pregnant women visiting her the clinic was less.Smithy Sanel, gynaecologist at Sree Narayana Institute of Medical Sciences, who sees a cross-section of rural and urban women, said there could be about 20% pregnant women who were anaemic.The problem is our carbohydrate-rich diet, said Dr. Sanel.We have little iron in our diet, she added. Jaggery, which was a source of iron in traditional diet, had been replaced by sugary snacks, she said.Green leafy vegetables were a good source of iron, but phytates made them less absorbable, Dr. Sanel said.Milk-based diet had been found to be good to increase the iron and calcium levels in blood, she said.There was a rise in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in adolescents that could be a cause for anaemia, said gynaecologist Shirley Mathen of Aster Medicity.Dietary factors could be responsible, but the causes are largely unknown, she said.The issue was major topic of discussion in the Gynaec-Gastro Interface meet held here recently, she added.The Ettumanoor study points out that poor dietary pattern followed by members of the higher socio-economic group with more of snacks and junk food, which lack micro-nutrients, is the cause of higher prevalence of anaemia among them.It had also concluded that prevalence of anaemia was higher among the obese (37.5%), followed by those who are overweight (26.1%), normal (21.4%), thin (16.1%), and severely thin (7.7%).This may be owing to certain imbalances in the body metabolism that hampers iron absorption. Both studies also point out how fruits do not make a major portion of the diet in children in both higher and lower socio-economic groups.Shyama Rajagopal"

The result will be what it will be, but the Indian team might perhaps be already looking ahead to its next destination, the West Indies. Its a short tour, five one-day internationals and one Twenty20, with stopovers in just three of the cricket-playing Caribbeans many magnificent islands, Trinidad, Antigua and Jamaica. The West Indies team is a yet-more-pale shadow of its old fiery self, having lost the first of this months three ODIs against Afghanistan, and then drawing the series 1-1 when the last match was washed out, leaving the hosts hopes for a direct entry for the 2019 World Cup in doubt.But the West Indies will remain crickets most special destination as long as the game continues to be played in these islands. Much is said about the international entity cricket has woven in bringing together independent territories into one team  but as Indian cricketers island-hop over the next few weeks, its intriguing to consider the wider region too as one entity. The inquiry is prompted by a recent encyclopaedic book, Island People: The Caribbean and the World , by Joshua Jelly-Schapiro, an American geographer who has travelled over the past decade all across the region  from Jamaica to Montserrat, from Cuba to Barbados  to understand Caribbean-ness.Each island is its own delineated self, as even a causal visitor on the cricket trail will find upon visiting, say, Barbados and Antigua. But the claim that Jelly-Schapiro makes is this: that the Caribbean islands are places where phenomena we think of as belonging to our own age  mass migration and mass industry and transcontinental trade  have been facts of life for centuries. One of the biggest political questions of our time, he argues, was birthed in the Caribbean, with the Haitian Revolution, more than 200 years ago: How universal, really, are human rights?Cheerful tourism pamphlets mostly gloss over the dark history of slavery  Jelly-Schapiro points out that the Caribbean received six million African slaves, compared to the four lakh who reached the U.S. Along with people from almost every other part of the world, including India from where indentured labour started moving to the sugar plantation colonies in the mid-19th century, they built island societies, finding selfhood in a multicultural ethos, and setting up, in the most difficult circumstances, the big ideas of what it meant to be free, to be equal, to be a society.Search for rootsThat pursuit, the search for roots, in its deepest political iteration, suffuses every enterprise in the Caribbean: music, sports, literature, spirituality. Take Trinidad, from where C.L.R. James, historian of the Haitian Revolution, crickets greatest writer and much else, came and whose spirit guides this book, no doubt because he was Jelly-Schapiros first big intellectual crush.It became a Spanish colony after Christopher Columbus claimed it in 1498. In the centuries ahead, the Spanish gave land rights to French Catholic planters. The British took the island in 1797, and after slavery was ended in 1835, indentured labour was brought from India to work on the sugar cane estates.In an aside, Jelly-Schapiro then adds a little known detail, that after the Second World War, American soldiers brought along with them 55-gallon oil drums, which local musicians used for the steel pan drum, famously the only acoustic instrument invented in the twentieth century, and whose sounds you may be lucky to hear during telecasts from Port of Spains Queens Park Oval if the commentators just quieten down for a few minutes. Explaining Trinidads reputation for extreme literacy with the unique ways in which, say, calypso and the steel band were encouraged by post-independence governments as intrinsic to the nation, he suggests that Trinidad is a place where the emergence of C.L.R. James makes sense.Its also the place where the emergence of V.S. Naipaul makes sense, even though he went on underplay the Trinidadian influence. Writes Jelly-Schapiro: But what bonds him to Trinidad, as lettered Trinidadians all know and one suspects he does on some level, too, is the truth that though he produced as huge and varied an oeuvre as youd expect of a Nobel winner, with books set all over the world, the books he wrote about growing up in Trinidad  The Mystic Masseur (1957), Miguel Street (1959) and A House for Mr. Biswas (1961) in his early phase; A Way in the World (1994) later on  have remained in many ways unexcelled both in their vivid rendering of a societys audible surface and in their grip of its internal dynamics.The West Indies is a place, if it may be called that, without which cricket cannot be truly embraced. Jelly-Schapiro is not really cricket literate. (He puzzles for a while at the meaning when someone in Antigua complains that as great a batsman Viv Richards was, you cant forget that man Roberts: he took five wicket.) But, being a James devotee, he knows its importance. As we watch cricket from the Caribbean, its valuable to read this account of travels and the regions great musicians and writers to be reminded of the Jamesian truth: What do they know of cricket who only cricket know?"

He said that he has been raising banana in his 1.5 acres of land for the past fifteen years and he was not familiar with any other crop. Left with no option, I chose to dig a new well at a deeper depth of 120 feet, against my old well of 70 feet, he said.Evaporation loss was a major problem during the current summer season.

Mr. Simha said the party leaders had launched a mass contact programme across all the districts of the State seeking loan waiver and this has forced the government to bow to its demands. Though the farmers in the State had suffered crop failure owing to drought for three consecutive years, the government had turned a blind eye to their fate and the mass contact programme launched by the BJP forced it to bow to the demands, Mr. Simha said.Kurubur Shanthakumar, President, Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said it will be fully beneficial only for a small section of farmers who may have availed a loan below Rs. 50,000. The governments move will provide only partial relief for most farmers as invariably a majority of the cultivators have loan amount in excess of Rs. 50,000, he added.Mr. Simha said it was disappointed that the partys demand to waive loan up to Rs. 1 lakh was not met."

Vijayan Memorial at Thasrak near here on Sunday morning to plant a thousand palmyra saplings in the vicinity, it became a rich tribute to the legendary writer who used the tree as a key motif in his novel Khasakhinte Ithihasam . It was also part of an ongoing effort to bring palmyras back to Palakkads landscape again.At the joint initiative of environmental collectives Koodu and Marasena, a few participants sang Sufi music and read chapters from Vijayans novel.They also took an oath to safekeep them till the saplings mature.Two days ago, National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers of Government College, Chittur, had planted 1,000 palmyra trees on a vast stretch near the institution, sourcing the saplings from environmental activist Syam Kumar Thenkurissi. The local community has agreed to protect the saplings for the next five years.We initiated such a programme as palmyra trees are fast disappearing from Palakkad because of massive changes in land use pattern. Farmers are shifting to other agricultural activities which promise more returns. Urbanisation is also contributing to the situation, says K. Pradeesh, programme officer of the NSS at the college.One lakh treesNoted environmentalist S. Guruvayurappan, who took up the task of coordinating with socio-cultural groups to plant at least one lakh palmyra tress this monsoon, says the trees are the best protection against escalating heat in the region. Ashrayam Rural Development Society at Chittur has initiated the task to plant palmyra on both sides of the Gayathripuzha, a major tributary of the Bharathapuzha. Sahyadri, another nature organisation, will plant 20,000 palmyra trees this season.Fuel no moreThe organisations are also initiating a campaign against using palmyras as a source of fuel at brick kilns. Known scientifically as Borassus flabellifer , palmyras used to be a major source of revenue for farmers in Palakkad.Known for their survival in extreme weather conditions, the trees can live up to 100 years. Relatively disease-free, they demand little or no maintenance and grow up to 30 metres. Worldwide, scientists promote it as a key species to fight climate change and global warming.There is a huge demand for palmyra-based products such as toddy, akkani (a sweet drink made from the processed sap), nongu (palmyra nut) palm sugar, and palm jaggery. Value-added products like jaggery, colas, sugar, syrup, candy, and confectionery can be manufactured from it."

It requires eight months of growth and the tuber grows on vines and underneath the soil.With low sugar content and high calories, it is advisable for diabetics too. It can be kept for a year and its taste appeals to children, says Peter. A single plant yielded 12 kg adathappu last year, he says, pointing to a sapling in front of his house.Like many endemic tuber species, adathappu too was on the path of oblivion. Peter then started cultivating them with other traditional vegetable varieties that too faced extinction.Among them were native brinjal, ladies finger, chilly and tomato varieties.It was his interest in conserving native plant varieties and animals that led Peter, an instructor at an engineering college, to take up farming as a vocation.He liberally shares the seeds of crops and vegetables with farmers. Only if other farmers too grow them can our vast traditional species be protected, he says.Pest-resistantThe traditional species may not be highly profitable for farmers but they score on pest resistance and adaptability to climatic changes when compared to hybrid varieties, he says.Peter collected his plant and animal wealth over a decade of search, most of them from tribal settlements.Some tribes and traditional agriculture families still protect their seed wealth, which is the only reason for their survival. With the change in food habits, many vegetable varieties have disappeared from the culinary table, Peter says. One can spot native varieties of cattle such as High Range Dwarf, Vechur Cow, goat species of Malabar, and nadan kapri and karinkozhy chicken species at his farm.An important feature of our animal wealth was its adaptability to the topographical condition of a particular area like the High Range Dwarf.

The Tamil Nadu government has planned to allow Forest Department personnel to cull the wild boar for a limited period of time, say one year.While acknowledging the problem faced by farmers, environmentalists, however, warn that any attempt to declare the animal as vermin would result in irreparable damage to the biodiversity of forests.We have to make a detailed study before going ahead with the plan. On the one hand, the wild boar remains an important prey for carnivorous animals and, on the other, through their furrowing wild boars ensure germination of seeds in the forest area. Also, by scavenging on dead animals they clear the forests. The wild boars disappearance or reduction in numbers will affect biodiversity, said Mr. Kalidasan, President of Osai, an environmental organisation, who was one of the members of the committee constituted by the State government a few years ago to study the wild boar menace.He said that in many areas in Erode, Coimbatore and Sathyamangalam, wild boars had moved out of the forest and taken refuge in sugarcane fields. In Courtallam forest areas in the Western Ghats, they have taken permanent residence in irrigation tanks covered with invasive species, he said.Ravage farmsWild boars are among the most significant causes of losses that farmers face. They devour tapioca, bananas, rice and oil seeds. Since they are on the list of scheduled animals we are not able to do anything as it will result in action against farmers under the Wildlife Protection Act, said S.T. Sheik Mydeen, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association in Kadayanallur-Shencottah area.We make noise, burst crackers and use dogs to chase them away. But they come in such vast numbers that our efforts often fail. Sometimes forest officials take away our dogs if they find us chasing wild boars, said Mr. Mydeen.Mr. Kalidasan said if the government issued orders for shooting, it should be limited to areas where the threat is major. The carcass of the animal should not be allowed to be consumed by people. Mr. Mydeen also agreed that people should not be allowed to eat the meat of the hunted animal."

P. Ayyakannu, the farmer-leader who recently led a series of protests against the Centre and the State demanding drought relief, said, It has been six years since the dams gates were opened on time, and you can see the state of the river for yourselfand pro-Kannada organisations are calling for a bandh demanding two more dams in their State to tap the rivers water. Where are we to go then?The Cauvery irrigates eight districts in the main in Tamil Nadu  Erode, Karur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam  and it journeys eastward towards Nagapattinam district, where it finally drains into the Bay of Bengal. Following two consecutive years of failed Northeast monsoon, Tamil Nadu suffered its worst drought in 140 years in 2016-17. The entire State was declared drought-hit in January this year.Six months on, little appears to have been done by the State to remedy the situation. In six badly-affected districts, The Hindu found that farmers were beginning to grow tired of the blame Karnataka strategy adopted by the government every time there is a water crisis. Farming operations have come to a virtual standstill, and only those with deep borewell irrigation or those cultivating on the riverbed could be seen carrying on with regular cultivation. While Karnataka has already built adequate dams on the Cauvery to tap its water upstream, farmers in Tamil Nadu are angry that the State has done little in terms of implementing similar measures.Inadequate rainfall during the Southwest monsoon in 2016 affected the upper riparian state of Karnataka as well, resulting in its inability to allocate to Tamil Nadu the 2,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day as mandated by the Supreme Courts order of 2016. As on June 21, the inflow to the Krishna Raja Sagar dam in Mandya, Karnataka, was only 1,275 cusecs (as per government figures), most of which goes towards meeting the drinking water requirements of major cities in Karnataka.If you look at the total amount of water allocated for Tamil Nadu by the Cauvery Water Tribunal, Karnataka is only to provide 192 tmcft [thousand million cubic feet]. The remaining 227 tmcft is to be gained from Tamil Nadu. So the State too needs to do its bit to tap into the Cauverys potential for irrigation, said P.K. Deivasigamani, who heads the Tamil Nadu Joint Farmers Association, based in Erode. In 2014, Rs. 400 crore was allocated for building a check dam across the Kollidam River on the Nagapattinam-Cuddalore border, which could help meet the drinking water and irrigation requirements of the region, but the State government has not taken any action till date, he said.S. Janakarajan from the Madras Institute of Development Studies told The Hindu that across several districts in the State the problem of mining water was beginning to surface. Mining water refers to the stage when withdrawal of groundwater reaches a point where it is beyond replenishment. This was especially the case with the non-Cauvery delta irrigated zones such as Madurai, Theni, and Ramanathapuram. In coastal areas, sea water intrusion has resulted in the water turning saline. Half of Tiruvarur district now has saline water, he said.Even in the Cauvery delta regions, the groundwater table has fallen sharply, and the area under crops has come down drastically. In Thanjavur, kuruvai cultivation is only 1 lakh acres as against 4.5 lakh acres in a usual year, Prof. Janakarajan said, adding: Even samba cultivation is very uncertain due to low water levels in Mettur reservoir.Sand mining rampantSand mining is rampant in the Cauvery and its distributary, Kollidam, affecting its water retention capacity and quality of groundwater in nearby areas. While driving down the Karur bypass road from Tiruchi, we came across a 5 km-long queue of over 300 trucks on the side of the road waiting to extract sand from the Cauvery near Lalapet.A casual enquiry with one of the drivers revealed that trucks had lined up for 2-3 days outside the mine, near Pettavaithalai, and the quarry had dug deep into the riverbed such that a man could be buried in it standing upright. The same could be witnessed at Thiruvasi on the Tiruchirapalli-Namakkal Road where over 10 such sand quarries operate within a 10 km stretch. Inquiries with the police stationed outside the quarries revealed that about 350 trucks operated at each of these quarries every day. Sand mined from here fetches about Rs. 1,150 - Rs. 1,300 per truck load locally and was supplied across Tamil Nadu and to nearby states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka too. In the cities, the sand is purchased for a rate of Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 14,000 per truck load and sellers thus make a killing.N. Ramachandran, a block coordinator for the Tamil Maanila Congress, and owner of a banana plantation in Uraiyur, Tiruchi district, said that due to the quarrying operations from Thiruvasi onward, fields within the 10 km radius have been severely affected by falling groundwater levels. The miners use earthmovers to dig deep into the riverbed, sometimes going up to 20 feet deep. If they hit on some water stream beneath, the miners use a motor to drain the water off, before beginning to extract sand again. This has left red blotches on the surface of the riverbed, he said.When it rains on such a surface, the clayey soil beneath the sandy upper layer of the river mixes with the water to form mushy puddles, with none of the water percolating below to recharge the river naturally. It also leads to accidents, with goats grazing the riverbed or people crossing by slipping into the pits left behind by miners, residents say. As one drives towards Karur from Tiruchi, the coconut trees in groves on both sides of the road begin to wilt and disappear as the sand mines approach.In spite of the drought, the Cauvery and the Kollidam rivers continue to supply drinking water to 20 out of the 32 districts in Tamil Nadu. The Community Drinking Water Schemes, run by the State government, have caused great resentment among local residents in Thanjavur district, where many of these projects operate.In Anaikudi, a village in Thiruvaiyaru taluk, Thanjavur, a sugarcane farmer S. Selvaraj reportedly committed suicide last month after attempts to extract water for his farm using a bore well failed. He had spent a large sum of money installing it. His wife Rasathi told The Hindu that her husband had lost all his investments in agriculture and the sugar mill to which he supplied sugarcane had not settled his dues. He had a debt of nearly Rs. 4 lakh and was unable to repay the bank. The family hasnt received any compensation from the government.About a kilometre away from here, a long pipe carrying drinking water under a government community drinking water scheme from the Kollidam River, goes to Pattukottai. At the pumping station, where a trial is currently underway, two motors were running, each pumping out 6,000 litres of water per minute. Villagers who protested the drawing of water from here say false cases were foisted against them to suppress local dissent.Deepening distressMany farmer families and agricultural labourers have begun to seek wage labour outside their villages out of desperation. In Thiruvalarsolai, near Tiruchirapalli, we saw farm labourers working in brick kilns to make ends meet.P. Periyasami, who owns 2 acres of land in Thanjavur district, migrated with his family comprising his wife, two daughters and a son to this place to bake bricks after his paddy field failed to yield for three consecutive years. We get paid Rs. 1-1.50 per brick and earn about Rs. 100 per day. The money is better in farming, but with no water available we have no choice but to work here, he said. He pointed to a tiny, straw hut on the corner of the road, Thats where we live.If this is the case in Thanjavur district, a relatively prosperous agricultural belt, the situation is worse in places that lie outside of the Cauvery irrigation zone. In Peragambi, near Siruganur, Tiruchi district, lemon farmers are buying water for Rs. 4,000 per tanker load to irrigate their withering fruit-bearing trees. The trees arent eligible for crop loss compensation from the government. C. Selvaraj, who had been growing the trees for the last six years, said, Its only this year that the trees started bearing fruit and theres no water. Half of them have withered. Im trying hard to keep the rest alive spending Rs. 30,000 per month watering them thrice.Not very far from Peragambi and Vazhaiyur is the Sanamangalam eri , a lake that stretches over 8 acres. While driving down the Chettikulam-Peragambi Road, we came across this lake that was covered entirely in thorny bushes. No one would identify it until someone told them that this was a lake! Less than a kilometre down the same road MNREGA workers sat resting under the shade of trees. They had just completed digging a small canal for irrigation here.When we inquired as to why the eri was not taken up for clearing as it would help store water, the workers said that it came under the PWD and the village panchayat could not commission any clearing work in it. Farmers in Nagapattinam district had complained to us that work on dredging silt from a major irrigation canal, under PWD supervision, was progressing slowly. They say with some irritation that the officials seem busy overseeing sand mining operations with police protection.Farmers growing Bt. cotton in Peragambi, Vazhaiyur and border areas of Perambalur district had mortgaged all their family jewellery and now risked losing them to bank auctions. A source in NABARD told The Hindu that a majority of farmers in Tamil Nadu had taken crop loans against gold jewellery.Most often when the farmers failed to repay the loans, the banks recovered it by auctioning the jewellery. In spite of the Madras High Court direction to waive off loans and RBI (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas Affected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2016, asking banks to restructure loans of farmers affected by drought, banks have continued to send notices for loan repayment to farmers who failed to return crop loans borrowed last year.In Kadichambadi village, Kumbakonam taluk, Thanjavur, we met Aruljothi Murugan whose father Rengasamy, 78, died last month unable to bear the shock of crop loss. His total outstanding loan amount was Rs. 32, 263. The family continues to get notices for repayment from the bank.Three days after his death we received Rs. 10,000 as crop loss compensation from the government. But can we bring the dead man back? his wife Amisham, 65, asked.Usually, in times of distress such as these, farm animals provide some back-up for income generation for farmers. But with the agrarian distress deepening, maintaining livestock has become a challenge. G. Ravi of Panchanadikkulam, Nadu Setti in Vedaranyam taluk, Nagapattinam district, says he lost his father due to crop loss last year. He owned two cows given free of cost by a charitable organisation a few years ago. Feeding and maintaining them required Rs. 100 per day. But the 2 litres of milk he got from the cow fetched only Rs. 50 when sold. He owes Rs. 3 lakh to a private moneylender and Rs. 25,000 as bank loan.What should I do, he asks, Feed the cows or keep myself alive?"

5a0616009855b76bf13c3983,Dispirited wine industry struggles to stay afloat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/dispirited-wine-industry-struggles-to-stay-afloat/article19143605.ece,2017-06-25,"Excitement about reds and ross ran high when the wine industry took roots in India three decades ago. But the industry wears a pallor now, with many among the 100-odd wineries across the country  mostly in Maharashtra and Karnataka  either struggling to stay afloat or shutting shop.In Maharashtra, of about 75 wineries, a majority of which were started after the government offered subsidies to encourage wine production, only a few remain robust. About 12 to 15 small-size wineries are surviving on local wine tourism, and boutiques or bulk sale of wine. The rest, mostly saddled with loans, are closed or on the verge of closure, multiple sources in the industry confirmed.On paper, around 50 wineries could be working. In fact, those that are not in the market are also keeping their licence active by paying the licence fee, which is meagre, a winery owner said.In Karnataka, where 17 wineries are registered, the pressure has started showing. Unable to weather the cut-throat market conditions, a winery on Bengalurus outskirts recently merged with a top winery that has a nationwide presence. According to industry sources, at least three more wineries in the State are up for sale and more may follow suit. One winery has stopped production. Some have reduced the quantity of grapes crushed. In fact, the Karnataka Wine Board, the first of its kind in the country set up to promote wine, has not received any application to start a winery in the last three years.It is difficult for small players to sustain in the industry. Wine production has become an expensive affair, with labour becoming scarce. At the retail end, it becomes very difficult for the small wineries to sell their wines, said Bengaluru-based Heritage Wines producer P.L. Venkatarama Reddy, who is merging his business with the countrys largest wine brand, Sula. Only companies with deep pockets can survive in the wine business, he added.The managing director of Bagalkot-based Elite Wineries D.V. Guraddi also acknowledged the precarious condition of the wineries. It is a very tough industry working on meagre margins. Most wineries are making losses.A small pieA large part of the problem is the small size of the wine market in a country where consumption is restricted to a few large metros.Though the volume of wine sold has more than trebled in the last 15 years, industry estimates peg the current per capita consumption of wine to be a meagre 10 ml to 15 ml per annum, when compared with the global per capita consumption of around four litres per annum.The wine market, which is currently estimated to be around Rs. 500 crore (including domestic and imported wine), forms a tiny fraction of the liquor business in the country, but remains crowded. While the total volume of sales in the Indian liquor industry is pegged at around 560 million cases annually, the combined sales of wine in the country is pegged at just around 1.5 million to 1.6 million cases. The four biggest wine makers  Sula, Grovers, Fratelli and Big Banyan  together have nearly 80% of the market share. Market leader Sula alone has more than 60% of the market share, industry veterans say.Though figures show a nearly 25% growth annually, it is mainly the cheaper wine segment, and not the premium wines segment, which is growing at 2-3%, said Parag Kamat, the chief operating officer of the Nashik-based Charosa Wineries, which is backed by Hindustan Construction Company. According to him, the selling and marketing cost of wine is very high. The cost is also high in the production of good wine, he said. To add to this, the industry has not seen an exponential growth. The industry, which was hit badly by recession in 2008-2009, has been seeing only an incremental increase. Unless the business has sound financial backing, wineries cannot sustain in market in the long run.Different rulesDifferential excise rules across the country have also put wine makers in a quandary, especially prohibiting smaller players from accessing these markets. Currently, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa and Delhi continue to be big markets for wine consumption.There are different rules applicable in 36 States and Union Territories, and high fees limit the spread of wines in these States. The volumes from each winery under each brand is low compared to the liquor business, which is limiting the growth of the wine industry. It is not sustainable, said Neeraj Agarwal, executive vice-president (Operations) Sula Vineyards.In fact, in some States, it is easy to register an imported label without even selling a single bottle in any other State, he added. However, local wineries need to show that they have sold a minimum number of cases in other States. This is a ridiculous rule for domestic wineries, he argued.Wineries have also been affected by policies in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the market potential is huge. In a bid to protect their own wineries, both Maharashtra and Karnataka have imposed high fees on wines brought from outside their States. While this has limited the access to small wineries, the bigger wineries have bought or tied up with local wineries to sell their brand, wine and logistics consultant Robin Somaiah said.Unreasonable discounts sought by the retailers to push wine has been another bane. Sometimes, the discount sought is so much that it does not even cover the production cost  it can go up to 50%. How can wineries be expected to hold margins and reinvest to improve quality of wines? Mr. Somaiah asked.Farmers affectedThe problems plaguing the wineries have had a cascading effect on the farmers in the last few years. Vineyards developed on contract farming have shrunk, with many shifting to cultivation of table grapes or sugarcane.In and around Bengaluru, where wine varietal cultivation started in the late 1980s and where brands like Grover and SDU have their wineries, the real estate boom has also triggered the uprooting of vineyards by farmers who saw a better return in real estate.While the Karnataka Wine Board claims the State is having nearly 2,000 acres under wine grapes cultivation, industry estimates say the figure could be around 500 acres. Many farmers under contract farming have shifted to other crops. I also shifted from wine varietals in a portion of my land, said viticulturist V.G. Patil, who has been a consultant to many wineries in Karnataka. Wineries which were unable to sell their stock stopped buying grapes from farmers with whom they had a contract. Wine varietals of grapes  unlike the table variety  cannot be sold to consumers. So farmers had to shift, said Mr. Guraddi. He estimates that about 40-45% of vineyards may have been uprooted in the wine regions of north Karnataka.On a more optimistic note, Mr. Agarwal said that though the area under wine varieties reduced after the global recession in 2008-2009, re-plantation had started in the last couple of years. Approximately 600-800 acres of plantation is happening annually in the last three years, more than 50% of which has been added by Sula alone, he added.Enquiries with other wineries also suggested that more area is being brought under cultivation only by companies as farmers are wary of their income being dependent on the fortunes of wineries.Only companies with deep pockets can survive in this businessP.L.

5a06171f9855b76bf13c3a3f,Loan waiver: What does it mean to farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/loan-waiver-what-does-it-mean-to-farmers/article19143716.ece,2017-06-25,"K.T. Range Gowda (right) of Kudurugundi in Hassan taluk says unless loans borrowed from nationalised banks are alsowaived, farmers like him will not benefit from the government announcement.Prakash HassanChief Minister Siddaramaiahs crop loan waiver announcement, ahead of the 2018 Assembly elections, has led to a flurry of activity in political circles. There are predictions of early elections and all political parties seem to be getting ready for polls.But what does waiver of farm loans of up to Rs. 50,000 taken from State-run cooperative banks really mean to farmers who are to benefit from it? The Hindu spoke to a cross-section of farmers whose responses were mixed. While some farmers, especially those with small holdings and small loans from cooperative banks, have welcomed the move, others with big loans and from sources outside the cooperative sector are sceptical.Partial reliefA farmers problems are varied and never ending, but this waiver is a relief, but only partially, said Vijaya Kumar, who cultivates sugarcane and red gram in his 4.29 acres of land at Kumsi in Kalaburagi taluk.He had borrowed Rs. 33,000 from local cooperative society apart from borrowing Rs. 80,000 from relatives and local moneylenders. He has a debt of Rs. 1.1 lakh in State Bank of Hyderabad which has remained unpaid for 10 years. He has been in severe distress ever since his two bullocks that he had bought for Rs. 80,000 died. He is now expecting around Rs. 1 lakh from red gram crop and around Rs. 2 lakh from sugarcane. If I succeed to control wild boar menace in my sugarcane field, I will be hopefully debt-free this year, he said.No impact on himThe loan waiver announcement has brought no relief to K.T. Range Gowda of Kudurugundi in Hassan taluk, as he had not borrowed from any cooperative bank. He grows vegetables on eight acres of land. Cooperative banks do not lend loans to all in need. They offer a few thousand rupees, which is insufficient. Only those who are influential get the amount they want. After my attempts to take loan from cooperative banks failed, I approached Cauvery Grameena Bank and borrowed Rs. 4 lakh, he said. The interest at which he got the loan is 7% and he gets a rebate of 3% if dues are cleared within the deadline.Most of people in the village have borrowed from nationalised banks. Unless loans borrowed from nationalised banks are also waived, we will not be benefited, he said.A huge reliefAs he was unable to sustain himself on 3 acres of land in the drought year, Manjunath of Kurubarahalli in Sira taluk of Tumakuru district has over the last few months been working as a gas delivery boy with a salary of Rs. 6,000. Even ragi, a drought-resilient crop, has failed now. He had borrowed Rs. 30,000 from Vyavasaya Seva Sahakara Sangha Niyamita, Bukkapatna, in Sira taluk.The Rs. 30,000 means a lot to me as I was finding it difficult to get two meals a day, he said, and added that the waiver has come as a huge relief. Getting even a single rupee is difficult as there are no jobs and agricultural activities have come to a standstill in this region, he said.Of losses and court caseFifty-year-old Venkatesh, a farmer from Jarnahalli in Srinivasapur taluk of Kolar district, has been wandering to courts over the last few years during which he has faced severe losses owing to drought. State Bank of India has filed a suit against him on the grounds of failing to repay the loan he had taken from the bank.I had taken Rs. 3.6 lakh, including Rs. 1 lakh as farm improvement loan, in 2006. I have repaid Rs. 1 lakh and I am unable to pay the rest. Now the outstanding dues have gone up to Rs. 8.5 lakh. The waiver announced by the State government will have no impact on Venkatesh, who attributes continuous drought situation, coupled with variation in the prices of farm products, for the inability of farmers like him to repay loans taken from commercial and nationalised banks.Will we be reimbursed?One of the influential farmers in his village, Prakash Kulkarni of Solapur in Hukkeri taluk of Belagavi district feels that the government is encouraging dishonesty by waiving loan. I repaid all my crop loans before April 1. Is the State going to reimburse all what I have paid? he sought to know.Mr. Kulkarni, a sugarcane grower who has irrigated land, is a member of the board of directors of the primary agriculture credit cooperative society. He claimed that his society and the other cooperative society in his village had seen 100% repayment of farm loans before April 1. Some have even got new loans now. What is the use of a waiver in June? he said. According to him, the proportion of farmers approaching cooperative societies for farm loans is reducing with regional rural banks and nationalised banks offering more farm credit.(With inputs from Kumar Buradikatti in Kalaburagi, Sathish G.T. in Hassan, Bhuvaneshwari S. in Tumakuru, Vishwa Kundapura in Kolar, and Rishikesh Bahadur Desai in Belagavi.)"

The river is also a habitat of many rare aquatic species too.The volunteers, divided in four teams, took up cleaning of Virpapurgadda (island) in Koppal district and a reserve forest.Cleaning up the river and the forest land would be a continuous process by involving students of various colleges and volunteers, Takat Singh Ranawat, Deputy Conservator of Forest, Ballari division, said.Developing tree parksThe Forest Department has laid emphasis on developing tree parks by planting as many as 6 crore trees all over the State to improve the green cover and ensure good rainfall, Mr. Sugara said.In Karnataka, 54% of the area is drought-prone and has only two major rivers to meet the water requirement. Therefore it is very essential to protect forests by improving the green cover, he said, adding that the department was planning to develop tree parks in urban and rural areas. Mr. Sugara expressed concern over the rivers getting polluted by way of dumping plastics and other waste materials.Mr. Reddy said that preventing rivers from getting polluted would help retain the flora and fauna and bio-diversity of the area and aquatic life.Samad Kottur, a scholar and wildlife activists, explained the bio-diversity in and around Hampi World Heritage Site."
5a061a2c9855b76bf13c3c53,Farmers’ delegation meets Pawar,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/farmers-delegation-meets-pawar/article19153003.ece,2017-06-27,"A delegation of eight farmers from Puntambe village in Ahmednagar district met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar at Y.B. Chavan Centre near the State Secretariaton on Monday to demand more benefits for farmers who regularly repay their crop loans..The farmers, hailing from the village which was the epicentre of the recent agrarian protests in the State, said Mr. Pawar assured them that he would look into their demands. The farmers are planning to meet Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday. The BJP-led government on Saturday had unveiled a Rs. 34,022-crore farm loan waiver scheme to write off debts up to Rs. 1.5 lakh and give relief to about 89 lakh farmers.However, a steering committee of farmers leaders rejected the mega loan waiver scheme on Sunday saying there should be no upper limit for the waiver. Under the scheme, farmers who regularly repay loans get 25% relief on the amount paid, which is capped at Rs. 25,000.Abhay Chavan, a farmers leader from Puntambe, said, We regularly repay our crop loans. The governments loan waiver scheme helps us up to Rs. 25,000 only. Those who have outstanding loans up to Rs. 1.50 lakh are going to benefit more. We think this is unfair to us.Mr. Chavan added, Most of us grow grapes, sugarcane and soyabean. Our crop loan limit is quite high compared with farmers growing foodgrains. When our loan turns bad, the amount is more than that of farmers growing cereals and pulses. We are not going to benefit much from such loan waiver schemes.Dattatray Dhanwate, another member of the delegation, said, We met Mr. Pawar because he understands our issues thoroughly. Our demand is that we should get benefit up to Rs. 50,000 because many farmers would not benefit from the existing scheme. If a farmer gets Rs. 25,000 in return under the scheme, it is quite less. Mr. Dhanwate added, Some senior farmers from Puntambe village are going to meet Mr. Fadnavis on Tuesday. The loan waiver scheme announced by the State government is not satisfactory,Amol Teke, another farmer, said, The State government should withdraw all cases against the farmers without any condition. Early this month, several parts of Maharashtra witnessed large-scale protests by farmers demanding a loan waiver and remunerative prices for their produce. The protests started from Puntambe and spread to other regions in the State."

Yenkanna, an old farmer said.Date palm (phoenix dactylifera), or khajoora pandu is an edible fruit rich in sugar, calcium, iron and potassium. Experts believe the plant originated near Iraq-Mesopotomia in 4000 B.C.Each tree costing about Rs. 3,500, Mr. Rao experimented with Barhi variety trees four years ago believing the tree is disease resistant, has a life of about 40 years and would ensure returns in the long run. Appreciating the efforts of the farmer for going for an unusual crop and sending an inspirational message to the farming community, Commissioner of Horticulture L. Venkatram Reddy said all the agro-climatic conditions of the region are suitable for commercial cultivation of dates. A rough estimation shows a single crop of this size can yield about Rs. 3 lakh for a farmer, he said. In addition, the crop doesnt require intense labour, prevents animal menace on farms, and always has market value.Mr. Reddy also said the department would request Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to conduct research studies to understand the feasibility and propagation of the crop in the State. He also hinted that 60 date palm trees per acre could be given to farmers on a pilot basis.Farmers, big and small, sharing their learnings and apprehensions about the crop said healthy competition could be maintained among the community only if they go for inter-cropping, tap technological innovation and follow best farming practices.Progressive farmers said, Date palms are simple to grow, even possible in ones backyard, while traditional and small farmers wanting to learn more said, It is still not for us, how can we wait for four long years when it would start bearing fruits. Farmer Agaiah, who bought this farm from Mr. Rao, is reaping the second crop this year and estimates the yield to be more than the first time. Situated between two important offices of the village, an electrical sub-station and the ZPH School, the date farm is the new landmark of Narsing Batla."

Shoria has been up for hours making the traditional delicacy of vermicelli, sugar and milk, known as sevian in these parts but shai mai in her home back in Myanmar.A few hours later, after prayers in the nearest Idgah, her husband Sabeer and their three-year-old son Rafiul join her in their dark and dingy room, still filled with smoke from the stove.There are some fruits but no meat or spicy food for this family  out of cultural choice but also because they cant afford it.Though Shoria tries to follow traditions, Id in exile is just another day for this Rohingya Muslim family in south Delhis Madanpur Khadar.Rohingya Muslims from the Rakhine State of Myanmar are the most persecuted minority in the world, according to the United Nations. Alleged ethnic cleansing by the majority Buddhist community in the neighbouring country has forced over 11 lakh Rohingyas to take refuge in different parts of the world. Of these, about 14,000 Rohingya Muslims are in India.In Delhi, Sabeer is one of the nearly 900 Rohingya refugees in camps at Shaheen Bagh, Madanpur Khadar, Okhla and Vikaspuri. While some work as ragpickers and sweepers, others find small-time jobs in NGOs and private offices. They fast but do not feast.Not at easeHow can we celebrate Id when our family members and relatives are living in such danger? said Sabeer. He fled to India in 2004 and has not been home since.Sabeer met his wife Shoria, also a Rohingya, at a refugee camp here.His neighbour Jaffar, another Rohingya who escaped violent clashes in 2011 in Rakhine, is in no mood to celebrate either. His nephew was stabbed back home last week after being accused of using a mobile phone to provide information to foreign agents.We meet and greet people. We distribute sevian to each other but at the end of the day we are refugees, says Jaffar.Sense of hopelessnessAccording to Ali Johar, a Rohingya working for the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) here, the Indian government allows Rohingyas to stay in the country, avail healthcare and educational services but they need to get their refugee cards renewed every year. On humanitarian grounds, we continue to reside here but there is not enough assurance from the government, Ali says.While Jaffar, Sabeer and others remember their homeland with a certain sense of hopelessness, their children keep the excitement alive, punctuating the gloom with their laughter. Wearing new clothes and getting Idi , the gift given by elders, is enough to make them happy. Only our kids are happy because they dont know about the situation in Myanmar, says Sabeer, who works for an NGO for Rs. 12,000 a month. This year, however, he found it difficult to get new clothes for his son Rafiul.Our prayers are for returning home. What is Id away from home, without the presence of loved ones? said Shoria."

Nagendra told the media here on Sunday. He attributed the high migration of dealers to the continuous efforts of the officials, who were constantly pursuing the issue with the individual dealers and helping them in switching over to the new system.The department opened two Help desks with computers in each of the eight circles to assist the dealers in the migration process. He said GST registration was Permanent Account Number (PAN)  based unlike in the past. There were errors in the names of the dealer or the establishment in some of the PAN cards.Window opened againThe Deputy Commissioner said there was no cause for worry among the dealers, who have not migrated to the new system so far. The GST enrolment window was opened once again from June 25 and they could login in to the GST network and register their details.The login IDs would be sent to the e-mails of the dealers.The first step would be to login and upload the documents with their digital signature. Once they get the Application Reference Number (ARN), they could download provisional registration certificates from the GST website from June 27. The dealers, whose annual turnover was less than Rs. 20 lakh and do not come under the purview of GST, could also register as once their business grows they could avail of credits.Simple processMr. Nagendra said registration was simple and dealers could either login with their IDs and register or contact the CTOs concerned for assistance. He allayed apprehensions that GST would lead to a steep hike in prices of various commodities. The amount of tax on agriculture-based and essential commodities has either decreased or there was no change. Service-related taxes would go up marginally from 15% to 18% while sugar and cloth would be taxed more. Similarly, there would not be any change on entry level automobiles but taxes on luxury vehicles would go up.To a query, he said action would be initiated against erring dealers."

He read out item by item, the increases the prices of commodities such as rice, sugar and pulses had registered between the time the United Democratic Front (UDF) relinquished charge of the government and now. The prices of food commodities had gone up phenomenally during the three-and-a-half years of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government.Mr. Mohammed accused the government of not lifting the full allotment of subsidised rice from the Centre and, at the same time, selling an allotment of wheat to flour mills.Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy, who anchored the discussion for the UDF, also repeated the wheat-related charge and said it was strange that the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation should aim for profits through the sale of wheat given at heavily subsidised rates by the Union government.Charges deniedFood and Civil Supplies Minister C. Divakaran denied the charges. He placed on the table of the House letters from the Centre to maintain that the said allotment of 40,000 tonnes of wheat was meant for sale under the Union governments open market sales scheme.

5a06343e9855b76bf13c4324,The great avocado show,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/the-great-avocado-show/article19201494.ece,2017-07-03,"You know a superfood has gained serious traction when it makes news, rages across Instagram, and has restaurant menus dedicated to it. The avocado, once happily married to onion, tomato, cilantro and lemon juice, in the humble guacamole, is the latest to get upwardly mobile. It has found its way from the first course in swanky eateries to the last. You can have it smashed, pulped, frozen, charred, tossed in a salad or blended into a shake.Hip millennials have raised its demand to the point where the avocado has become hot rather than humble, and its price point in India is comparable to anywhere in the world.In Mumbai to showcase the versatility of this ingredient is Australian chef Scott Pickett. In two varied techniques, Pickett shows that the avocado can be made to obey any instruction. It can excite your palate and fuel taste buds when simply charred and served with olive oil and salt or sugar. Conversely, it can cool you off at the end of a meal when whipped into a chocolate mousse and served with berries and cherries. Says Pickett, When you use it to make ice cream, you are replacing milk-based fat content with avocado.With great power comes talkThe avocados status as a superfood has made it a talking point over the last year, and not just in Australia alone.As Pickett observes, With the world being so much closer, thanks to social media and the Internet, superfoods that are popular become a simultaneous trend the world over.This is why, there are at least two avocado-themed restaurants worth mention. Amsterdam has locals and tourists mad for The Avocado Show, while Brooklyn, New York, has the Avocaderia. Both restaurants serve up avocado halves in place of burger buns in their burger, while the former even pairs it with hummus and toast, in a nod to the popular smashed avocado on toast. Theres avocado in side dishes as well  trussed up with truffles and oils, served with salmon and caviar, and even married into a burrata.Much as Pickett loves avocado, he isnt keen on forcing it into every bite you take at any of his four Melbourne restaurants.Reining in the fad, he says, I think there is a place for everything. It can definitely be part of a meal, but Im not sure if I would like everything avocado.Experimental muchSpeaking of how chefs and foodies are playing with their food in Australias foodie state of Victoria, where Pickett is from, he says that the lack of an established culinary history (like India has) means that the treatment of ingredients is always under scrutiny.Whos to say what ready means when it comes to avocado? We are actively developing ways to cook and use the fruit at different stages of readiness. If its firm, charring works great, and served as a side with the main meal.A ripple set off in Australia last year made waves all the way to the front pages of western media when Australian columnist Bernard Salt wrote that millennials were unable to afford homes because they were spending $20 on avocado on toast. The furore this generated across oceans simply had more people lining up to see what the fuss was all about. Smashed avocado gained street cred in kitchens everywhere. Now, the time is right, feels Pickett, to take the interest into creating dishes beyond his beloved smashed avocado on toast.Trend mentalityHe wouldnt go as far as the avo-latte though, which is a regular latte served in the skin of an avocado. It was created as a joke in Melbourne before cafs around the world sincerely followed suit. They missed the joke, grins Pickett. Doctors in the UK  where sales of the fruit shot up over the last year  have even coined a new condition called avo hand for the injury sustained from cutting avocados.While the most popular variety of avocado sold is called Hass  named after the American postal worker Rudolph Hass  the latest variety that everyones excited about is the Teeny Tiny Avocado, developed by Trader Joes. Its lime-sized, ripens faster than your regular avocado, and is a perfect single serving. However, it hasnt made its way to your local grocerToo much of anythingAs for that fat content some people worry about, says Pickett, too much of anything is bad. And that is why the avocado too must be only one of the many things you eat. Its health benefits also outweigh the perceived negatives. Meanwhile, people who have had enough of the avocado are calling it the over-cado. Of course, here in India, we havent even got started, not really.Game of numbersOver four billion avocados were consumed in the US in 2016 alone."

Its also largely unnecessary. Even when you travel. And for fervent fashionistas, theres a bright side to this eco-warrior mode. Its never been more stylish to be green.Cold-pressed juices, fair trade coffee, coconut water with a conscience, are now being eclipsed by the latest beverage du jour: water. Sure, its calorie-free, gluten-free and sugar-free. But more importantly, its free. All you need is your own bottle.Enter the new age of designer water bottles.Before you dismiss this as yet another vacuous trend, here are some essential statistics. According to the Plastic Pollution Coalition (a global alliance of individuals, businesses and policy-makers working toward a world free of plastic pollution), Americans alone discard more than 30 million tonnes of plastic a year, out of which only 8% gets recycled. The rest ends up in landfills or becomes litter.Single-use plastic is the most problematic. At the rate we are going, PPC reckons there will be more plastic than fish by weight in the oceans by 2050. It contaminates ground water, poisons the food chain and threatens wildlife.So, think again. Do you really need to buy a bottle of water at the airport, drink one more during the flight and then buy multiple bottles at your destination? Instead, here are some of the worlds most stylish alternatives.DopperThe company declares that their goal is not to make a profit, but instead make a positive impact for a better world. They emphasise on recycling and recently relaunched their popular Dopper Steel.Dutch founder Merijn Everaarts was inspired to start the company after seeing a documentary about the huge amount of plastic in our oceans. He says, I also noticed how many plastic mineral water bottles are thrown away every day, even though in many countries, the best drinking water simply comes from the tap. This certainly made me feel uncomfortable. I just had to do something about it!In January 2010, Merijn launched a design competition to find the perfect reusable bottle for drinking water. Out of about 100 entries, Delft University of Technology alumnus Rinke van Remortels design was chosen. The design enables you to use it as both a bottle and a glass. Colours are fresh and sassy: popsicle red, sunshine yellow and oceanic blue.BkrMiley Cyrus has a red one. There are photos of Charlize Theron flaunting her blue bkr post yoga class. Its also been spotted in the hands of Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman and Gisele Bundchen. So its not surprising that this glamorous glass bottle has been marketed as a beauty essential. After all, as their website declares, Your skin is 90% of your selfie.Pronounced beaker (in hipster millennial fashion, theyve dropped half the vowels to create the brand name), it was launched in 2011.The admittedly bombastic mission statement on their website declares that bkr has been proving that beauty will change the world, with water bottles so beautiful that drinking from them becomes a joy. Founded by Tal Winter and Kate Cutler, bkr proclaims its the antidote to cheap, disposable plastic bottles, and the key to skin that glows from the inside.The glass bottles have small mouths and bright silicone sleeves inspired by fashion, photography and even contemporary art. With names like Tutu, Lala and Naked, bkr comes in various avatars.Watch out for the spiked version, reportedly inspired by a youth spent walking on Melrose Avenue in the 80s, with its blocks of new wave, goth, mod, diehard punk, rockabilly and sleaze  and by rockstar editorials marrying Chanel with spiked latex bodysuits.CorkcicleThe brand makes Whiskey Wedge glasses that ensure your drinks dont get watered down, wine chillers and what they call the coolest bottle cap opener ever. So, not surprisingly, their new Canteen has been a hit.With triple insulated steel, it promises to keep your drink cool for a whopping 25 hours. Prefer carrying around hot tea? The Corkcicle canteen is designed to keep it warm for up to 12 hours.Since looks are all-important with these modern handbag accessories, the Canteen comes in a slew of candy bright colours. This includes Hawaiian Blue, Caribbean Green and a mysterious colour called Sea Foam.There are four sizes, ranging from a teeny 9-ounce version (which is about one glass) to 60 ounces.An unexpected plus? The 25-ounce is ideal for a bottle of chilled wine. After all, you cant be expected to live on a diet of water alone. Especially given how tough it is out there on the Instagram battlefield.THE OTHER CONTENDERSVitaJuwel ViA Wellness Bottle:Crystal-infused water. Need we say more. The brand even makes stone-sipping practical. Cherry-pick your reason from their menu. Theres Inner Purity, Beauty and Love. As the website says, All you need is water.

5a0636f29855b76bf13c44c4,Eccentricity on full throttle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eccentricity-on-full-throttle/article19190931.ece,2017-07-01,"If your first exposure to this Edgar Wright film is its title, then you would probably be wondering if its a two decade late sequel to Babys Day Out (1994) or one too quick of Boss Baby (2017) (either way, it ought to be a slapstick comedy with a baby in it). But once you give this film a shot  irrespective of its misleading title  youll find yourself drawn irrevocably into a thriller thats carved out of classic Hollywood charm. But Baby Driver is a refreshingly young and edgy narrative of a universally loved motif: the struggle of an underdog.Music is at the core of Baby Drive . The film not just introduces you to some groovy tracks (if you Shazam your way through this one, it could be a rewarding experience) but also explores the rhythms in gun shots, grenade blasts, bolting cars and police chases. For the films protagonist, Baby (Ansel Elgort), music is not just therapeutic and motivational, but also an obsession. The film, in several ways, is about various obsessions  of money, love, revenge and music. Wrights style of filmmaking aligns with its characters insanity and absurdity, making the film seems like an experience similar to a sugar rush. But be prepared for a massive glucose crash once the curtains fall.For a movie centred around car chases and hot pursuits, its imperative to be deeply invested in the motivations of the protagonist. Baby Driver excels in that department by convincingly fleshing out  and constantly revisiting  Babys back story. He survived a car accident as a child but lost his mother, who was a singer and a victim of domestic abuse. Now as an adult, Baby has earphones plugged in perpetually, makes hilarious yet creepy mixtapes by recording everyday conversations, and falls in love with a waitress, Debora (Lily James), who reminds him of his mum. His plan to break free from the past and the clutches of an evil mastermind (Kevin Spacey) is to elope with Debora, but not before he is forced into one last crime.Wright layers Baby Driver with the same dose of teenage eccentricity and quirkiness as he did with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), but this time cloaks his British sensibilities with everything Hollywood, including classic American diners, cars and humour.The casting of the villainous characters is spot on with impeccable performances byJon Hammand Jamie Foxx, who bite into their meaty roles like hungry sharks. Ansel Elgort, known best for playing the terminally-ill boy in The Fault in Our Stars (2014), essays Baby with appropriate amount of teenage angst and reticence.For every adult, who has been bullied or intimidated as a teen or a kid, and has found recourse (and make-believe superpowers) in a parallel and wild world of fast cars and imaginary races, this movie will be as much of an escapist affair as it is for its protagonist."
