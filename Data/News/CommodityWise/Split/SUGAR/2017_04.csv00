He said: We want to assure the people that the government has taken initiatives needed to put the State on the path of development.With the promise of transformation and development, we took the oath of office on March 19. One hundred days are a brief period. The resources were limited, but we took up the challenge. And at this point of time, I am satisfied. In a jibe at his rivals, he said the State did not develop because of corruption and nepotism in the past.The CM said 2017 would be observed as Garib Kalyan Varsh. Uttar Pradesh is associated with Jan Sangh leader Deen Dayal Upadhyay. It is his birth as well as work place. The 100 days of the government are devoted to fulfilling the objectives of antodaya [ensuring that benefits reach the last strata of society].He said over Rs. 22,517 crore in dues were paid to sugarcane growers after he assumed office. He also highlighted the decisions taken by the Cabinet on farm loan waiver and law and order."

But give this film a shot  irrespective of the misleading title  and youll find yourself drawn irrevocably into a thriller thats carved out of classic Hollywood charm.But Baby Driver is a refreshingly young and edgy narrative of a universally loved motif: the struggle of an underdog.Music is at the core of Baby Driver. The film not just introduces you to some groovy tracks (if you Shazam your way through this one, it could be a rewarding experience) but also explores the rhythms in gun shots, grenade blasts, bolting cars and police chases. For the films protagonist, Baby (Ansel Elgort), music is not just therapeutic and motivational, but also an obsession. The film, in several ways, is about various obsessions  of money, love, revenge and music. Wrights style of filmmaking aligns with its characters insanity and absurdity, making the film seem like an experience similar to a sugar rush. But be prepared for a massive glucose crash once the curtains fall.For a movie centred around car chases and hot pursuits, its imperative to be deeply invested in the motivations of the protagonist. Baby Driver excels in that department by convincingly fleshing out  and constantly revisiting  Babys back story. He survived a car accident as a child but lost his mother, who was a singer and a victim of domestic abuse. Now as an adult, Baby has earphones plugged in perpetually, makes hilarious yet creepy mixtapes by recording everyday conversations, and falls in love with a waitress, Debora (Lily James), who reminds him of his mum. His plan is to break free from the past and the clutches of an evil mastermind (Kevin Spacey) and elope with Debora, but not before he is forced into one last crime.Wright layers Baby Driver with the same dose of teenage eccentricity and quirkiness as he did with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010), but this time cloaks his British sensibilities with everything Hollywood, including classic American diners, cars and humour. The casting of the villainous characters is spot on with impeccable performances by Jon Hamm and Jamie Foxx, who bite into their meaty roles like hungry sharks. Elgort, known best for playing the terminally-ill boy in The Fault in Our Stars (2014), essays Baby with appropriate amount of teenage angst and reticence.For every adult who has been bullied or intimidated as a teen or a kid and has found recourse (and make-believe superpowers) in a parallel and wild world of fast cars and imaginary races, this movie will be as much of an escapist affair as it is for its protagonist."

Mohankumar, district unit Convenor of Tamil Nadu Pazhangudi Makkal Sangam.The problem of wild boars is no longer confined to the hilly areas.In Sathy taluk for instance, the wild boars have very much found habitat in sugarcane fields, even in places such as Shembagaputhur located many kilometres away from the forest, Mr. Mohankumar said.Shooting of the wild boars, categorising it as vermin, is expected to be on the lines of the procedures adopted in Kerala, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh.The Forest Department had completed the wild boar abundance survey in the district last year, as part of a State-wide exercise, as a preparatory step for the animals categorisation as vermin.Farmers have been facing huge losses due to destruction caused to the sugarcane, maize and tapioca crops in villages spread over Sathy, Athani, and Anthiyur areas close to the hills by the animals that Forest Department officials themselves acknowledge have multiplied phenomenally.Public hearingThe department had even conducted a public hearing on the issue a few years back at Sathyamangalam.The farmers say that the menace is already unmanageable in the area and that letting the problem to fester would lead to disastrous situation of letting agricultural lands in forest fringes fallow."

5a06405f9855b76bf13c4b44,Globalised approach to theatremaking,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/globalised-approach-to-theatremaking/article19158671.ece,2017-06-28,"The past weekend witnessed the culmination of a global theatre project at Theater Freiburg, an independently owned cultural space in Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany, with a provenance that dates back two centuries. Since the autumn of 2015, the Human Trade Network, which is supported by the German Federal Cultural Foundation, has facilitated a creative consortium of theatre companies from three continents to research perspectives on human trafficking and modern slavery worldwide.One of the collaborating teams is the prolific Indian Ensemble from Bengaluru, which operates under the stewardship of the multifaceted Abhishek Majumdar. The four theatrical productions that emerged from this exploration were showcased at an event, dubbed The Meeting, that commenced June 21 at Theater Freiburg. Apart from the performances, it featured a packed itinerary of talks and interactions, and concluded with a joint lecture-cum-performance at the Kammerbhne (the chamber stage) involving all partners, a theatrical try-out they have been working on since coming together in Germany.Majumdars presentation was the play #supernova , performed in Hindi and Bhojpuri, which had its Indian premiere earlier this month, with two shows at the Max Mueller Bhavan, Bengaluru. Written by upcoming playwright Rahul Kumar Rai, and performed by Avneesh Mishra and Sandeep Shikhar, it recounts the tale of a young boy from eastern Uttar Pradesh who is sold to the flesh trade in Dubai. There, he acquires the online persona of #supernova, a so-called exemplar of sexual virility, an identity that sends him inexorably spiralling down the rabbit-hole of sexual subjugation.Although India has the most trafficked children in the world, Majumdar had never imagined that he would ever work on the subject. As his team researched further, they realised how the world of cyber trafficking of children is more ruthless than other conventional modes of human trade. In an interview with the Human Trade Network, Majumdar said, The morality of the Internet, the ethics of communicating online, the possibilities of every changing persona were all discoveries for me in this project. Poverty is no longer the only marker. Gullibility and susceptibility are themselves equally dangerous.Common causesThe international partners of the Human Trade Network worked in tandem with each other. This took the Indian Ensemble to Western Africas Burkina Faso in July last year, to collaborate with Ouagadougous ThtrEvasion, whose presentation is titled Adjug! . In this play, an employee in a sugar plantation is dismissed before he is entitled to a pension. He starts working as a daily wage labourer, sinking into debt. Hopes for a better life for his children soon recedes from view as the sceptre of child labour raises itself. The Romanian contribution, called Do you speak Silence? / Vorbii tcere? is a performance by Gianina Crbunariu, widely regarded as the enfant terrible of the contemporary Romanian stage. Its blurb reads, Dignity and freedom of decision - do these things play a role in buying and selling labour? What defines us apart from our strength? A game with identities, perspectives and deceptive conclusions.Also set in Romania is the German production, For Sale . Director Clemens Bechtel, who also serves as the artistic director of the Human Trade Network, has collected varied stories with a team in Bucharest, which illuminate the subject of child trafficking from myriad perspectives. On their research trips, they dealt with construction workers, butchers, caregivers, harvest hands, adoptive parents, and prostitutes. As Bechtel said, The fact that in all these cases human trafficking plays a vital role, was not clear to me beforehand. Either it was how easily I too am part of this system, or how easily I can become a human trafficker or human buyer.Cross cultural focusIt was on Bechtels invitation that Majumdar came on-board. Sometimes when the subject is so vast, and the group so rigorous, it makes absolute sense to begin ones journey on someone elses impulse, he said. Bechtel had earlier served as the artistic director of the Hunger for Trade project, which provided a similar international setting for theatre research and experimentation, to which the Indian Ensemble had contributed Thook in 2014. That play was written by Irawati Karnik and Shikhar, and focused on the effects of neo-liberal reforms on the Indian economy. This globalised approach to theatremaking, and the negotiations that ensue, brings about dialogue and a nuanced understanding of the complex issues at hand. Bechtel said, I am interested in the way people from other cultures look at such a topic, what approaches they choose in their theatrical approximation during their analysis. I want to get to know people from the countries of the south as agents, not just as victims or a surface for projections of myself.This is echoed in Majumdars prophetic words, We are heading towards the era of transience. More people would have moved home in this century than ever before in the history of mankind. We are also potentially the swan song generation of somewhat homogeneous identities and in the future we will be more mixed than ever before. [Thus] it makes absolute sense to open our vision and dialogue within a global present and not the global absent of wealthy corporations whose presence is only felt on advertisements and shelves. The possibility of a pure relationship with someone far away is crucial to humankind discussing anything at all in humanities."

Further, it is resorting to GST now, he charged. Those evading taxes and hoarding black money are being left scot-free while common man is being punished with tax up to 28%.Farmers of the country are already under severe stress due to increased costs and faulty government policies.Imports of commodities such as sugar have increased, which were being exported from here earlier.Mr. Reddy attributed the policies to governments intentions to promote corporate farming. He questioned about the BJP manifesto where it had promised an MSP with 50% over the production cost, and pension for farmers.The organisation has announced that it would hold demonstrations at mandal headquarters from June 30."

Weather forecasters predict the relentless downpours could start to ease in coming days.Xiangjiang, a major tributary of the Yangtze river, has exceeded its record flood level in the Hunan capital of Changsha. Floods in the city have swamped houses, uprooted trees, damaged cars and submerged roads.Across Hunan, the flooding has forced hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate, damaged crops and destroyed houses, causing a total direct economic loss of 8.26 billion yuan ($1.22 billion), the provincial civil affairs office said.In Guangxi, 16 people have been confirmed dead and 10 are missing after a flood hit the southwestern region after a storm, the official Xinhua news agency cited authorities as saying.Southern provinces produce some of Chinas major crops.Guangxi is Chinas top sugarcane-growing region, while Hunan is its third-largest hog-farming province. Rice is grown south of the Yangtze.China will take steps to ensure sugar reserves are safe during the rainy season, the Sugar Reserve Management Centre said.China Southern Power Grid reported an extensive blackout in Guangxi. Electricity to half of the affected area was restored by Monday morning.The state post bureau warned of courier delays in parts of the central, southern and southwestern provinces.By contrast, stifling heat has settled over Beijing, Hebei, Henan and other northern provinces since last week, with temperatures forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius in some areas on Monday, the meteorological bureau said.Cities in Shaanxi province issued alerts, saying temperatures could exceed 35C in coming three days.Many residents in the province have ordered food to be delivered rather than cook at home in the heat, a Shaanxi newspaper reported.In Beijing, many residents stayed indoors over the weekend due to the heat.In the Inner Mongolia region, more than 200 firefighters are battling a grassland fire that has crossed over to northern China from Mongolia, Xinhua reported.The blaze has spread quickly in the heat, dry conditions and strong winds.The heat wave is expected to ease by mid-week."

His arms and legs were bent and broken just as someone breaks a sugarcane before eating it, said the top official who saw the video of Pandiths lynching.The official, who saw the video, said they had to work overtime to source and destroy the video for a financial consideration.

Bengalis have been worried for a while because now a 5% GST will fall on rosogolla and sandesh. Clearly even a spoonful of sugar is now not available to make the bitter medicine go down. Sweets with a saffron or silver coating will now have to bear a 18-20% GST tax: theres very little meetha with the khatta. Not that theres much khatta available either for those keen on namkeen. With a 12% GST on snacks, the chips are down and the dhokla is khokla.From tryst with destiny to tryst with tax, its now been seven decades of filling applications for a better India. On August 14, 1947, Nehru gave his famous speech saying While the world sleeps India awakes to life and freedom. Of course, Chacha Nehru got his clock slightly wrong in that famous speech because according to GMT, it was actually early evening in London and the former imperialist rulers were wide awake when India woke to new life.Moving along from Nehrus Discovery of India, we now have Narendra Modis New India where event management will soon become a government ministry. Freedom at midnight circa 2017 was designed to be an event marked by band baaja baarat complete with fairy lights draped on Parliament, flower arrangements and choreographed moments. Quipped the internet wag, is GST a Government Self-promotion Tax?In these taxing times, we still dont know how many MPs will disclose their real assets if not their real estates, but that did not stop them from lining up to celebrate their freedom at midnight moment even though they all looked uniformly gloomy.The Congress of course chose to miss the party because party vice-president Rahul Gandhi likes to party in Europe on his birthday rather than muck in with the sweaty hordes in hot and humid Delhi. But spare a sympathetic thought for the amiable Dr Manmohan Singh. Key architect of the GST, he too was forced to fall in line with his party and miss the GST party.

He wants to be a doctor. For the 17-year-old, a degree from one of the top medical colleges is the sure-shot way to a secure job in government-run hospitals, which in turn will ensure upward social mobility for him and his family.Determined as he is, Raunak an above average student, also knows that mere school education may not help him achieve his dream. He also knows that the key to admission in MBBS and BDS courses in the best medical colleges of India is a good ranking in the national eligibility entrance test (NEET).It was to gain that cutting edge needed to crack the NEET that Raunak, a resident of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, decided to head to Kota, the district in Rajasthan that is now known as coaching capital of India.Gupta is one of the nearly 1.25 lakh students who have made Kota their temporary home while preparing for two of the countrys toughest examinations --- NEET and IIT-JEE.Stories behind storiesKota, with its coaching centres selling the success dreams, represents the perennial struggle of the Indian middle class and its aspirations to escape the life of mediocrity. Every time results of competitive exams are declared, the coaching centres come out with full page advertisements in newspapers highlighting their success stories. The ads invariably have stories written by successful candidates who detail how they wouldnt have made it to the top without the help of the coaching centres.Town situated on the Chambal bank is home to 40 institutes. (HT Photo)The ads, however, dont tell the full story. They dont tell about the thousands who fail to crack the exams. They dont tell about the students who didnt turn out to be good enough to escape the life of mediocrity, and will live hating it. They also dont tell stories of those who couldnt cope with the competition and the pressure to perform and gave up, taking the extreme step of committing suicide.Suicide hub?More than 60 students took the extreme step in the past six years owing mostly to pressure or failure. Last year, 17 students killed themselves. At least 12 students have already committed suicide in Kota in 2017, the last being a medical aspirant from Bihar who killed herself days before NEET results were declared.The suicides have naturally led to apprehensions among parents. When Raunak told his parents in April that he wanted to shift to Kota to prepare for the NEET, his father put his foot down.The moment I said I wanted to go to Kota, my father refused. He said there are a lot of cases of students going into depression and committing suicide in Kota and he suggested that I go to Kanpur instead, says Raunak.It took days of persuasion to convince his father, who owns a drug store in Gorakhpur, to let Raunak go to Kota for a year. He now has taken up a room in Kunhadi area, where a mini city has come up with tall, glitzy hostels and paying guest accommodations catering to the coaching institutes.In six years, 60 students have killed themselves in Kota. (AH Zaidi/HT Photo)The citys Indra Vihar area, home to the countrys biggest coaching institute with 79,000 students on rolls in Kota alone, bustles with activity on a summer afternoon, even as temperatures soar 40 degree Celsius.Youngsters, entering their second growth spurt, walk hurriedly and purposefully, in greyish-blue uniforms, the colour of the trousers only a few shades darker than the colour of shirts. The teachers, all of them males, with six-figure monthly salaries, drive around in their swanky vehicles.Newcomers to the city, usually couples along with their children, clutching handbags, ostensibly with money for coaching fee that is generally around Rs 1 lakh for a year, take breaks from the heat at roadside stalls offering sugarcane juice and mango shakes.No full stop hereKotas competitive atmosphere attracts people from all parts of the country. The student deaths, however, has gained it some notoriety too.For those who have been living in Kota for more than a year, a suicide and the subsequent media report means a frantic call from home. And most of the parents, according to students, have a standard way of addressing the concern  he or she need not have committed suicide...you must not take any stress.The concern is always there. My father tells me not to worry if I am unable to crack the exam, says Vandana Bharti, a native of Saharsa, Bihar, a Class 12 student at a school in Kota. She is also preparing for the NEET.Prabhat Kumar has reached Kota from Muzaffarpur in Bihar. He says his son wanted to come to Kota immediately after Class 10 examinations to prepare for IIT-JEE. But I told him to wait for two years. One reason was the reports of depression and suicides that emanate from here, says Kumar, an advocate at Muzaffarpur civil court.Kumar adds that he would have been fine with his son pursuing a graduation degree and that his son was free to come back home anytime he felt he was unable to handle the pressure.Antaryami Kaushik, a resident of Sri Ganganagar is in Kota to get his 16-year-old son admitted to a coaching institute. Kaushik says his wife will stay with their son as he prepares for IIT-JEE. The son of a close friend is also staying here with my son. My wife and my friends wife will alternately come and stay here with the children, says Kaushik, a teacher in a government college.Celebrations at a coaching institute after one of its student was declared the topper of JEE MAINS 2017. (AH Zaidi/HT Photo)Kaushik adds that the main reason he wants his wife to stay with the children is the disquiet caused by the reports of suicides.Life moves onWhile the fears do encroach upon the hearts and minds of parents, it has not deterred them from sending their children to Kota. Incidentally, none of the students HT talked to said that they were forced into the competition by their parents.Kota has six to eight major coaching institutes, apart from some 35 minor ones, according to district administration.The coaching industry in Kota has grown consistently in the past decade, both in terms of enrolment as well as the number of coaching institutes. Many a times, a group of teachers defect from a major institute and establish their own setup, so the number keeps growing, says Rajeev Jain, professor of management studies at University of Kota.Allen Career Institute, the biggest player in the coaching industry, has 79,000 enrolled students. The number was 60,000 three years ago.Another major institute, Resonance has some 25,000 students at its Kota centres.

(File photo)Benami assets worth Rs 300 crore of NCP leader Chagan Bujbal and his family have been attached by the Income Tax Department, which has slapped charges under a newly enacted criminal law against them. The department said the assets were allegedly created by them using a maze of about four dozen shell companies.In fresh trouble for the jailed former deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, the I-T department has issued notices for provisional attachment of assets of Bhujbal, his son Pankaj and nephew Sameer Bhujbal, and has identified them as beneficiaries of the alleged benami assets.The attachment notice, accessed by PTI, has been issued under Section 24(3) of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 2016 (where the taxman thinks the person in possession of the property held benami may alienate the property).The immovable assets attached under the order include Girna sugar mills in Nashik valued at over Rs 80.97 crore and multi-storeyed residential building Solitaire in Mumbais Santacruz West area valued at more than Rs 11.30 crore.While the mills are in the name of Armstrong Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, the house is in the name of Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd.The attachment also includes the Habib Manor and Fatima Manor building in Bandra West area of the Maharashtra capital valued at over Rs 43.61 crore (benamidar: Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd) and a plot of land in Panvel in Raigad valued at over Rs 87.54 crore (benamidar: Devisha Infrastructure Pvt Ltd).While the total cost of the attached benami assets has been valued at over Rs 223 crore, the department has said the market value of the assets is more than Rs 300 crore.The department has identified a total of 44 shell companies which invested funds in two of the three firms identified as benami in the order. Violators of the law, enacted in 1988 but implemented from November 1 last year, attract a rigorous imprisonment of up to seven years and fine up to 25 per cent of the fair market value of the property. Benami properties are those in which the real beneficiary is not the one in whose name the property has been purchased.The order, issued after over four months of investigations by a special I-T team, said the probe clearly shows that the properties were acquired out of unexplained funds of the Bhujbal family, which was routed in guise of share at high premium in the group of companies of the Bhujbals, through a web of shell companies based out of Kolkata, Mumbai and other locations.The department has held that the source of funds of these companies of the Bhujbals is fictitious and unexplained cash credit under sections of the Income Tax Act, 1961.The order has also relied upon the statements recorded by the ED, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), of dummy operators and Chartered Accountants of the Bhujbal Group to establish the benami assets charges.Chagan Bhujbal, the MLA from the Yeola assembly constituency in Nashik, and Sameer are at present lodged in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai after they were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) last year in a money laundering case.The I-T department will now move for confiscating these assets after getting approval from the Adjudicating Authority of the Act. The Act allows for prosecution of the beneficial owner, the benamidar, the abettor and the inducer to benami transactions.It also says that the assets held benami after final prosecution are liable for confiscation by the government without payment of compensation. The tax department, last month, had charged six family members of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, including wife, son and daughters, under the benami assets law in connection with its probe into land deals worth Rs 1,000 crore.As per official data till May 23, the I-T Department had identified 400 benami transactions in the country and provisional attachment of assets was done in about 240 cases.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sugar Commissioner and MySugar Managing Director J C Prakash, along with his wife Anupama Patil, launched the works after performing a simple puja. A power generating unit too was inaugurated on the occasion.Somashekar of Sathanuru village, the first farmer to enter the factory with loads of sugarcane, was accorded a warm welcome. The crushing activities were kickstarted by Prakash who fed a bunch of cane into the machine.The factory stopped its operations from April 21, 2015, due to various reasons. The government, administrative board, workers and farmer leaders had made all efforts to restart the factory. Former minister Ambareesh and District-in-charge minister M Krishnappa ignited the factory boiler on April 14 and announced the reopening of the factory in the first week of July.Official inaugurationThe factory will be officially inaugurated in a grand manner by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on July 11. Speaking to DH, Prakash said that with the machines being operated, it will enable us to give exact status to the chief minister during his visit next week.The governments have released Rs 435 crore since 2002 for the rejuvenation of the factory. The Congress government has released Rs 175 crore and extended necessary help to reopen the factory which has a history of its own. The factory management has entered into an agreement with farmers to procure 1.80 lakh tonnes of sugarcane, he said.All preparations have been made so that the factory does not face any trouble for the next three years. Around 60,000 tonnes of cane is ready for harvest in the factory limits. With Pandavapura sugar factory stalled, the sugarcane grown there will be transported to MySugar, he said.Power unitThe power unit generates 30 mega watts everyday whereas the factory requires only 8 mega watts. The surplus power will be sold to Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (Cesc). The factory management has decided to share 70% of the profit with the farmers. The factory is ready to pay Rs 2,550 per tonne of sugarcane, he said.Congress district unit president M S Atmananda, factory officials and employees were also present.Extend advanceRaitha Sangha district unit president Shambunahalli Suresh said that the reopening of the factory has come as a good news to farmers. However, an advance of Rs 3,000 should be paid for every tonne of cane supplied before crushing. The arrears amounting to Rs 32 crore should be settled otherwise farmers will not supply cane, he said."

But the newly-introduced GST is going to put an extra burden of over Rs 10 crore on this socio-religious activity at the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar and other gurdwaras, temple officials say.With purchases made for the community kitchen coming under various slabs of the new GST, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the mini-parliament of the Sikh religion that manages Sikh shrines (gurdwaras) in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, including the Harmandir Sahib (popularly known as the Golden Temple), is expecting an additional burden of Rs 10 crore from this year.Besides the Golden Temple, the SGPC runs the langar services in other famous Sikh shrines like Takht Keshgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib (where the modern day Khalsa Panth was established on April 13, 1699, by Guru Gobind Singh), Takht Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district and scores of other gurdwaras under it.The ""Langar Sewa"" (community kitchen) is a socio-religious activity that is part of the Sikh religious ethos from the time of the first Sikh Guru, Nanak Dev (1469-1539). The langar was started to emphasise equality in society regardless of religion, caste, colour and creed.With the new GST slabs likely to hit the SGPC 's purchases with an additional financial burden, Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has written to Finance Minister Arun Jaitely to exempt all purchases made by SGPC for ""langar sewa"" from the GST Act.""The Punjab government had earlier exempted all items purchased for langar by SGPC at Sri Darbar Sahib Amritsar, Sri Keshgarh Sahib Anandpur and Talwandi Sabo Bathinda from VAT. The SGPC spends around Rs 75 crore to purchase desi ghee, sugar and pulses. Now, it will have to bear a financial burden of Rs 10 crore on these purchases as they come under the 5 to 18 per cent GST bracket,"" Badal pointed out.SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar has also sent a communication to the GST Council, which decides on the tax structure and exemptions, to exempt the Sikh body from the GST slabs.""Sri Harmandir Sahib runs the world's largest mega kitchen, offering free meals throughout the year to hundreds of thousands of people. (It is funded by) offerings made by people,"" Badal pointed out.""The central government should immediately withdraw the GST on purchases made by the SGPC and other religious institutions that are doing community service of this magnitude,"" Prithipal Singh, a devout Sikh who has been doing voluntary service at the Langar Hall of the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar for the past nearly a decade, told IANS.Under the new GST Act, there is provision for exemption to institutions/businesses on the recommendation of the GST Council.Hundreds of people volunteer on a daily basis at the Golden Temple complex and other gurdwaras to prepare and serve food and wash used utensils at the langars. The volunteers include scores of women and children as well. People partake langar while sitting on the floor in the langar halls of gurdwaras.The langar service is funded from donations made by people at gurdwaras. The SGPC has an annual budget of over Rs 1,100 crore to manage the gurdwaras under it.""Anyone coming to the langar is offered food. No one is ever turned back. It is part of the Sikh ethos,"" volunteer Gagandeep Singh pointed out.Hundreds of tonnes of wheat flour, desi ghee, pulses, vegetables, milk, sugar and rice are used, along with millions of litres of water, annually at the Golden Temple complex and other gurdwaras to prepare langar.The langar is completely vegetarian."

The special team will verify documents submitted to the banks. We will submit a report to high court, detailing the action we have taken, said Bipin Bihari, additional director general of police (law and order).The scam came to light in August 2016, when Maruti Pandurang Rathod, an agriculturist from Gangakhed in Parbhani, needed money to treat his ailing father. After villagers, district central cooperative banks and Marathwada Gramin Bank refused to lend him cash, he approached the UCO Bank branch for an agricultural loan.However, the UCO bank manager told Rathod that he had already availed a loan worth Rs1.84 lakh from Andhra Banks Dharampeth branch in Nagpur, and as such, he was not eligible for another one.As Andhra bank refused to give him more details, Rathod could not find the beneficiaries of the loan. When Rathod went to the Nagpur bank, he found out that the loan had been repaid. The bank refused to give him more information, said advocate PD Bachate.Only after Dhananjay Mundhe, the leader of the Opposition in the legislative council, intervened, Andhra Bank revealed that Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Limited, a sugar factory, had siphoned the money without farmers knowing.The Nagpur-based factory had applied for a loan in Rathods name without submitting an application. The loan account prepared by the bank had been forged, said Bachate.Bachate said farmers in Marathwada rarely take loans as their crops depend on the rainfall. He added that Andhra Bank disbursed Rs39.17 crore; UCO Bank, Rs47.78 crore; UBI, Rs76.32 crore; BOI, Rs77.59 crore; Syndicate Bank, Rs 47.27 crore and Ratnakar Bank, Rs40.20 crore.The factory had given a corporate guarantee to all the farmers. The loan amount was first deposited in a current account that the company opened in the farmers names. It was later transferred to the companys account, added Bachate.Such a big scam could not have been carried out unless the factory had the banks support, said Bachate.The allegations are politically driven and are baseless. The dead farmers were alive when the account were opened. All gave us their consent. No notices have been served to anyone in connection with the case. We will file a reply on July 25th , said Madhav Nagargoje, advocate for the sugar factorys owner, Ratnakar Gutte."

I admit that we took loan to pay sugarcane farmers dues but that amount was nowhere close to the amount loaned by BJP regimes of past nine years. Their president Ajay Bhatt accused us of illegal mining but is mum when I said what has raised the cost of river bed materials from Rs 38 per quintal to Rs 120-150 per quintal, former chief minister Harish Rawat said.He added that the BJP speaks lie and presented a wrong picture of the economy in the Budget session.They said that per capita income was Rs 1.40 lakh but didnt tell the people that it was for fiscal 2015-16 whereas it was Rs 1.68 lakh in 2016-17 . This government intentionally skipped the figures for 2016-17, Rawat said.Rawat appealed the Congress workers to protest every falsehood of the BJP and the government with tri-colour in their hands. We have to open a front against their falsehood at every platform from roads to Facebook and other social media. platforms. Its a long battle but the Congress will win.Earlier, Congress state president Pritam Singh alleged that BJP government was anti-farmer and anti-poor as its every decision deprived the downtrodden of their dues. Farmers have started committing suicide in Uttarakhand but the government remains ignorant. The Congress party will not sit quiet and reach out to the people for exposing lies of the BJP and its government, Singh said.Others who addressed the protest gathering included Leader of the Opposition Indira Hridayesh and AICC state co in-charge Sanjay Kapoor.Congress demo on farmers issues political drama: BJPThe ruling BJP on Thursday dubbed the daylong dharna organised by the Congress here to protest the state governments alleged failure to waive-off farmers loans, as a political drama.The demonstration organised by the Congress here to highlight the farmers issues is nothing but a political drama, said BJP state unit president Ajay Bhatt. He questioned the Congress for not waiving off the farmer loans when it was in power.This party (Congress) is politicising the issue of farmer loans It had been in power for five years Why didnt the Congress government waive off the farmer loans? Bhatt questioned accusing the Congress of raising a hue and cry over the issue when the BJP government had been in power for just 100 days.The Congress has been regularly protesting against the government after three farmers allegedly committed suicide owing to their failure to pay bank loans.Bhatt, however, claimed that it was still not clear whether those farmers committed suicide as none of them had left behind suicide notes.Our government has ordered magisterial inquiries into the farmer deaths. Whether they ended their lives or died natural deaths would be known following the completion of the inquiries, Bhatt sought to clarify while alleging that 10 lakh farmers committed suicide across the country during the rule of the Congress led UPA government.This party (Congress), therefore, has no right to speak on farmers issues, he said, adding that the BJP government is not in a position to waive off the farmer loans because the previous Congress regime left the coffers literally empty.As a result, the (BJP) governments income today is just 7,000 crore whereas its expenditure is about 70,000 crore, Bhatt said.Besides, he said efforts were on to augment the government receipts by initiating measures like checking leakages in revenue from mining of rivers and other sources. Once the exchequer permits the government will start initiating public welfare measures like waiving off the farmer loans, Bhatt told HT."

(Source: File) The annual tennis tournament, considered to be among the most traditional of sporting events, certainly has its customs and peculiarities. (Source: File)Green grass, tennis whites and big red strawberries. It can only be Wimbledon even though nobody really seems to know how the seasonal fruit became ubiquitous at the All England Club.The annual tennis tournament, considered to be among the most traditional of sporting events, certainly has its customs and peculiarities. And strawberries with or without a layer of milky cream are one of them.I love it, said CiCi Bellis, an 18-year-old American player who made her main draw debut at Wimbledon this week. Theres kind of a vibe that comes off when people are eating it. I think its definitely one of the main attributes of Wimbledon, for sure.The link between strawberries and Wimbledon, a tournament that started in 1877, is muddy. But the main theory has to do with timing. We suspect that, in the early years of Wimbledon, the strawberry season was very short and it just happened to coincide with The Championships, said Robert McNicol, the librarian at the All England Club. So thats how the connection probably started. And over the years it just grew into a tradition.Whatever the origins, its taken on a life of its own just like the grass surface the game is played on and the rules obligating competitors to wear all white while on court.Around the grounds, its obvious that the tournament and the fans take their strawberries seriously. At the official shop, you can buy Wimbledon coffee mugs with strawberries on them, or even keychains and magnets. If youre going swimming, how about a Wimbledon beach towel decorated with different colored strawberries?You can even get strawberries and cream-flavored ice cream, a big seller this week. If somebody says Wimbledon, people think of strawberries, Steve Clayton, the father of British doubles player Scott Clayton, said as he walked by No. 1 Court with a plastic tub filled with strawberries and cream.The fruit is sold all around the All England Club, and on Day 1 there was even a mobile water seller that this year had strawberries for sale. That seemed to be a good idea. Maybe too good.We couldnt keep up, said 20-year-old Dom Corbett, who was working behind the counter and charging 2.50 pounds (about $3.20) per serving of about 10 strawberries. We were running out of strawberries before they could come to the front of the queue.Wimbledon gets its strawberries from a farm in Kent, a county in southeast England. They are picked at sunrise every morning and shipped to Wimbledon. The cream comes from a farm in Lancashire in northern England.The freshest strawberries you can get, said Anthony Davies, the head of food and beverage at the All England Club. Fresh indeed, but not all of them seem to make it to the shelves. If a strawberry isnt shaped to perfection, the people hired to cut off the flowery green stem are told to throw them away. That doesnt always happen, though.We eat them, a pair of young women, almost in tandem, said sheepishly while working behind the counter at one of the food stops.Davies said the club goes through about two tons about 4,000 pounds of strawberries every day. The club sold 28 tons during last years two-week tournament. Marion Regan of Hugh Lowe Farms, however, said late last month she feared Britains exit from the European Union could affect her workforce in the future most of the farms strawberries are picked by workers from eastern Europe.The All England Club refused to comment on Regans concerns. Back at Wimbledon, the club might be able to eclipse last years mark of strawberries sold if it can get the mobile sellers stocked up again.They were very, very popular on Monday, Davies said. Were just working through some technical, logistical bits to try and get those back on sale.Most people at Wimbledon seem to like the tradition of the strawberries, but not everyone can agree on the cream part. You have to (have it). Strawberries and cream, said Bellis, who also played in the junior tournament at Wimbledon in 2014.Another American competitor, Donald Young, took the opposite view. Love the strawberries. Cream? Not so much, said Young, who lost to Rafael Nadal in the second round. It tastes like condensed milk to me. Ill do strawberries and sugar, though. Id have a bunch of that.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The police started to probe the allegations after a Bombay high court orderThe matter came to light after some farmers approached the UCO Bank in Gangakhed, Parbhani district for crop loanGutte said,There is no connection between the allegations made against me and the movie. My son is an independent person and I dont get involved in his professional work as I have no knowledge of film-making.He clarified the allegations against him are false and he is ready to cooperate with the investigators. The charges of loans disbursed in the name of farmers diverted to a sugar mill are superficial in nature, Gutte said.Barus book gave a detailed account of the tenure of Dr Manmohan Singh in his first term as PM. It had sparked a controversy when it was published ahead of the 2014 general elections.It was alleged that Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Private Limited, a sugar mill owned by Ratnakar Gutte and others, used names of 2,298 farmers from the village in Parbhani district, some of whom were dead, to apply for loans worth Rs328 crore from six banks including five nationalised and one private one. The police started to probe the allegations after a Bombay high court order.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said this shows the link between the film makers and the BJP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). There have been deliberate attempts to malign our partys image. After the BJP came to power, there has been a rise in such attempts, Sawant told HT. Considering this, I have doubts whether the matter will be seriously investigated and the culprit of such a serious crime will be punished, he said.Sharad Pawar-led NCP too believes that BJP is also involved in the matter and the enforcement directorate should take up the probe. Nawab Malik, partys spokesperson, said, We suspect many ruling party members are involved in the scam, which cannot be done without backing of those who are in power. The police should immediately arrest the accused and the case should be handed over to ED for investigation.Ratnakar Gutte, also leader of BJP ally Rashtriya Samaj Paksha (RSP), refuted the allegations saying his son is an independent person and the charges are politically motivated.BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said Gutte has no relation with his party and he was originally from the NCP.The allegations are far from fact. He [Ratnakar Gutte] is not related to the BJP in any way. Moreover, he is a former NCP politician and was close to Ajit Pawar, former deputy chief minister and energy minister. Guttes name also surfaced in some coal deals made by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) in which irregularities were found, Bhandari said.Read more: Anupam Kher to play Manmohan Singh in a film based on Sanjay Barus book?"

It had sparked a controversy when it was published ahead of the 2014 general elections.Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Private Limited, a sugar mill owned by Ratnakar Gutte and others, allegedly used names of 2,298 farmers from the village in Parbhani district, some of whom were dead, to apply for loans worth Rs328 crore from six banks including five nationalised and one private one. The matter came to light after a few farmers approached a bank for crop loans and found that they already had loans in their names.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said this shows the link between the film makers and the BJP, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Since the BJP is in power, I doubt whether the matter will be investigated seriously and the culprit punished, he said.Nawab Malik, NCP spokesperson, said, We believe many ruling party members are involved in the scam and the money was siphoned for making the movie.

One of the people in the picture is Florida Senator Marco Rubio.The rest is meme and tweet history.Pence sent out a tweet Friday in which he said he was sorry -- a blurb with a President Donald Trump-esque exclamation point at the end -- and joked that he, Pence, was not really to blame for ignoring the sign, which his hand almost touches.""Sorry @NASA ... @MarcoRubio dared me to do it!,"" Pence wrote.NASA put out a tweet saying it was no big deal, that the hardware -- a big piece of metal roughly the shape of a nuclear reactor cooling tower and part of a spacecraft-in-the-making called the Orion -- needed to be cleaned, anyway.Pence put out another light-hearted tweet saying it was the not the first this happened: it featured his photo of NASA ignominy but with a porcupine -- not the space gear -- graced by his hand.Of course, the original photo went viral and many social media users were scathing in their criticism of Pence. Pence supporters said the former were making a big deal out of nothing.""Good to know our vice president has the self control of a sugar charged 3rd grader on a field trip,"" wrote someone with the handle @KentoTFH.""Again administration blaming someone else,"" wrote @PatStevens2, referring to Pence's fingering of Rubio.To wit, some of the things Trump has blamed others for: Barack Obama for not acting more forcefully against Russia's election meddling, which Trump has even not fully acknowledged; ""the generals"" who he said ordered a US raid in Yemen in February in which a US Navy SEAL was killed.In the NASA flap, others recalled Pence's reputation as being famously straight-laced and conservative, to the point where he has said he would never dine alone with a woman who is not his wife.""This is an example of why you don't eat with women, correct?,"" wrote @squidlace."

The Forest Department is launching this scheme to revive dried-up water bodies to mitigate the acute water crisis faced by wild animals in deep forests.The project, costing `10 crore, will be funded under corporate social responsibility schemes while the deficit amount will be raised through the major works scheme.A few solar-powered pumps have already been set up in Nagarhole and Bandipur where partially dried-up lakes and tanks were recharged. In Bandipur, the pumps were set up in collaboration with WWF-India. Working 7-8 hours a day, a solar pump can refill a partially dried-up watering hole with almost 50,000 litres of water while allowing the excess water to flow downstream.Each solar pumping unit costs `10 lakh and has been installed in Southekere and Kundakere in Omkar range of Bandipur National Park and Antarsanthe Range of Nagarhole National Park. According to park officials, this initiative has benefited big carnivores and herbivores as more than 50 per cent of water bodies had gone dry.Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Head of forest force) K S Sugara explained that wild animals usually come out of the forests during the summer season or during droughts in search of water. If this new technique is utilised in protected areas, then water could be pumped to the lakes in the forest areas.However, criticizing the scheme, wildlife activists add, If this project is initiated, borewells can be drilled in protected areas. In the long run, it will not only adversely affect the habitat but also disturb many species. Moreover, drought is a natural phenomenon, some animals may die while some may survive.This is how nature balances the wild animal population. Why should we interfere with nature? they asked.Wildlife activist G Veeresh added, This has been installed in Nagarhole Tiger Reserve and is totally unscientific - if the forest department is providing water to animals then will they provide food too? If the population of wild animals increases, this will again cause an imbalance in the food chain. Such schemes and programmes are a sheer waste of precious resources."

They found that weed or pot usage among students has increased substantially in recent times. The findings came as a surprise as psychotropic, synthetic and recreational drugs such as heroin, brown sugar or mephedrone (MD) were thought to have replaced weed in campuses since 1990.It has been decades since we came across instances of marijuana abuse among college students, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), ANC, Shivdeep Lande told HT.The plan to crack down on college students, code-named drug free campus, was conceived by Mumbai police commissioner Dattatreya Padsalgikar a week ago, as part of the polices drug-abuse awareness campaign, which was launched in colleges on June 26.During the awareness drive, we received complaints that drugs were being peddled and abused within and outside colleges, sources said. Based on this information, the police commissioner ordered the top-secret crackdown.Undercover ANC sleuths fanned across campuses and peddlers were identified. A college in Kandivli (West) was the first to be raided. On Wednesday, four drug peddlers were rounded up from there and 1.10 kg of weed recovered.This was followed by raids near a college in Ghatkopar and another in Worli, where a kilogram of the banned substance was found and two were arrested. In the final raid, near a college in Bandra (West) on Thursday, two more peddlers were caught. Of the eight peddlers arrested, three are women.ANC sources said peddlers at most colleges had only marijuana, while the Bandra peddlers also had 60g of heroin.ANC veterans attribute the recent increase in weed abuse among college students to several factors.The all-out crackdown against mephedrone  including the ANCs raids on two manufacturing units in January  led many clandestine units in Mumbai to shut in haste, said a senior ANC officer, who did not wish to be identified. The arrest of a few key members in the supply and distribution chain had spread panic among middle-rung conduits and street peddlers. Many of them are suspected to have fled to Bangkok to avoid police detection or possible arrest.Simultaneously, the Narcotics Control Bureau and customs department have cracked down on the smuggling of synthetic drugs, such as LSD, into the city via airports and ports. This has dealt a severe blow to the supply of the imported contraband.This has also led to a surge in the popularity of weed among students, as the drug is easily available and cheap.DCP Lande said the cannabis seized at the college campuses had been sourced from Ganjam district in Odisha, where the contraband is available freely.The peddlers carry small quantities of the drug, about 10g, in small polythene sachets, which are sold for Rs300 each. They deliberately carry small quantities to minimise losses and evade harsher punishment, Lande added.Interestingly, students who tried weed for the first time told police they had mistaken the grass-like drug for herbs. Most of them were introduced to the drug [packed into cigarettes or rolled in papers] by former students, who are the key members in the supply chain , an ANC officer said."

The village is currently in the limelight as the farmers have restarted their demand seeking hiked land compensation and have launched an indefinite fast from Sunday.Tyagi was detained near the Delhi border and brought to the Harsaon police lines on Sunday afternoon, but said that a delegation of Parliamentarians will soon head to Mandola.He said that he is already in talks with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh, Sharad Yadav of Janata Dal (United) and CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechuri over the issue of Mandola farmers.The farmers want hiked compensation as per the new Act. The state government and the district administration have shown a stepmotherly treatment. During the recent agitation, the farmers, including women, were beaten up by the police and denied them medical examination. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assumed power in UP highlighting the issues of farmers, but their conduct is not appreciated in Mandola, Tyagi said.There have been nearly a 45% increase in farmer suicides in the last three years and a payment of Rs 2,335 crore to sugarcane farmers in UP is still pending. We still appeal to the state government and the district administration to look into the demands made by Mandola farmers. Otherwise, a major agitation will be launched and the state government will have to take the responsibility, he said.Ahead of Tyagis visit, the district magistrate on Saturday had promulgated prohibitory orders. During earlier meetings with farmers, the district administration has clarified that the issue of compensation hike can only be directed by the Supreme Court as the petitions of the farmers were already dismissed by the Allahabad high court.Ghaziabad police detained Tyagi along with nearly 100 supporters and politicians who sympathised with the farmers in their bid to demand a hike in land compensation.The Mandola Housing Scheme, estimated to construct nearly 12,000 affordable housing units, is under construction in Loni near Delhi border. The project, pegged at Rs 3,000 crore, is already facing delays. According to UP Housing Board officials, only 4,000 flats got occupied till now; another 4,000 were being constructed and bookings were reduced due to unjustified demands by the farmers. The board is in possession of nearly 2,300 acres of land, out of the total 2,610 acres planned for the scheme. For the land it acquired, it has paid a compensation at the rate of Rs 1,100 per square metre.We detained the Rajya Sabha member and others near Sonia Vihar border. They were trying to proceed to Mandola, but prohibitory orders are already clamped. They were later taken to police lines and detained. In case the farmers want more compensation, they must move Supreme Court. They have disrupted construction activities and are causing delay to the project, said Gynendra Singh, additional district magistrate."

But the dry spell wilted germinated seedlings and forced Mujalge to plough land and prepare it for re-sowing.""I want to sow again once we get rainfall, but I don't have money to buy seeds,"" he told Reuters by phone.Indian farmers had initially rushed to sow seeds after ample rains, bringing total planting levels to 40.43 million hectares by July 7, up 9 percent from a year ago.""In two days rainfall is likely to revive in central India that badly needs rains,"" said a Pune based official with IMD.A drop in output of summer-sown crops could lift overseas purchases of edible oils and pulses by India, the world's biggest importer of both, while limiting its rice and cotton exports.""Due to the consecutive droughts and demonetization farmers income was curtailed in the last three years. This year they badly need good rainfall,"" said Kotak's Hudani."

But the police said they had no such information and it could be a diversionary hoax.The check-in, which did not have any photo, was posted from Sugar Club on his Facebook page that he uses to deliver messages. The accompanying text was a rebuttal to his rival gang, the Sukha Kahlwan group, whose men on July 8 posted a video on Facebook in which they thrashed one of Gounders purported associates who says he is in India and only creating a hoax about escape to Bangkok. Gounder in his post denied any links with the man.Meanwhile, additional director general of police (ADGP), law and order, Rohit Chaudhary said, As far as our information is concerned, gangsters have left Punjab for the time being after the state governments special drive against them. There is no information as such about any of them reaching Bangkok. All these can be hoax posts just to divert our attention.Gounder has been on a roll after the jailbreak and reportedly murdered three men from rival gangs in Gurdaspur in April. Last week, he posted on Facebook that the police planned to eliminate him in a fake encounter.As for the Bangkok check-in, this is not the only social media post that says hes abroad. An announcement of Gounders purported escape to Bangkok was made by one of his associates, Shera Khubban, at 2am on July 8. He congratulated friends and declared that Gounder has reached foreign.Gounder has been on roll ever since he fled from Nabha jail. He murdered three persons in Gurdaspur in April this year as they belonged to the rival group of gangs.In the video posted by the Kahlwan group, a man having a Facebook profile with the name Moge Wala Brar declares that he is a close associate of Gounder. He is forced to hurl abuses at Gounder and his associate Prema Lahoria while being beaten up.Gounders post in Punjabi says, Leave aside phone calls, I have not even a chat (over messages) with Moge Wala Brar. He is one of my followers on Facebook and often likes my posts. He was kidnapped by Sukha Kahlwan group by laying a honey trap...

Badungar said, The Union government has not responded to our first letter yet. We have written another letter to the PM and FM seeking their time to explain our case. SGPC will face Rs 10-crore financial burden due to the GST. He added, We are not any profit-making organisation.

All these exemptions came to an end once the Goods and Services Tax came into force. Now, the state government has no power to exempt SGPC from paying any kind of tax.Hence, Harsimrat Kaur has shot off a separate letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to resume the old exemptions under the new tax system controlled by the Centre.Explaining the impact of GST on community kitchen, Golden Temple manager Sulakhan Singh said, Earlier, there was 4 per cent tax on desi ghee. We were exempted from paying this tax. Now, tax on ghee under GST has been increased from 4 per cent to 12 per cent. It means now we will have to buy 50 kg ghee by paying Rs 600 more. He added, We were spending around Rs 75 crore annually on buying ghee, pulses, sugar, vegetables, spices, wheat, rice and other items to run the community kitchen, where more than 50,000 devotees have langar every day on an average. Now, we are being made to pay tax which is even higher than the old system.SAD (Badal) has been an alliance partner at the Centre and there would not only be financial but also political ramifications if SGPC failed to convince the Centre to grant exemption from paying GST.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

To boost domestic supply, the government had in April this year allowed import of 5 lakh tonnes of raw sugar at zero duty to boost domestic supply. The annual domestic demand is 24-25 MT.However, the government does not want any further import as this would put pressure on domestic prices and affect the sugar mills' paying capacity, leading to pile up of cane arrears to farmers.A food ministry official had earlier said that some traders were keen to import sugar in view of fall in global prices of sugar. There were some reports that additional 3 lakh tonne of sugar has been contracted from Brazil.""If there are more supplies, then sugar prices will come under pressure,"" the official said.Sugar prices in the retail market are at Rs 40-50 per kg. The wholesale price of sugar is above Rs 32, which is viable for mills.Welcoming the move, National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd (NFCSFL) Managing Director Prakash P Naiknavare said: ""This will help stabilise domestic prices and help mills make cane payments to farmers on time."" At today's global price of raw sugar at 14 cents per pound and 50 per cent import duty, it is unviable to import, he said."

But the dry spell wilted germinated seedlings and forced Mujalge to plough land and prepare it for re-sowing.I want to sow again once we get rainfall, but I dont have money to buy seeds, he told Reuters by phone.Farmers had initially rushed to sow seeds after ample rains, bringing total planting levels to 40.43 million hectares by July 7, up 9% from a year ago.In two days rainfall is likely to revive in central India that badly needs rains, said a Pune based official with IMD.A drop in output of summer-sown crops could lift overseas purchases of edible oils and pulses by India, the worlds biggest importer of both, while limiting its rice and cotton exports.Due to the consecutive droughts and demonetization farmers income was curtailed in the last three years. This year they badly need good rainfall, said Kotaks Hudani."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, June 13: Excise officials seized brown sugar worth Rs 20 lakh and arrested one person from Thengahata in Khurda Town police station limits today. The excise sleuths have also seized a pistol and two rounds of live ammunition along with cash worth Rs 2 lakh from one Somanath Bhujabal, 27. He had allegedly procured around 110gm brown sugar from someone at Jaleswar in Balasore district. The market value of the seized brown sugar is estimated at Rs 20 lakh. ""He has been doing this business for past few years and used to earn huge profit. The money that we found from his possession was generated through selling of the contraband. He has been forwarded to court today. We are trying to find out the involvement of his associates,"" said excise inspector, Khurda, Sapana Pradhan. Another senior excise official said that they were also probing the Balasore link of the accused, as Balasore is a major source of procurement of brown sugar in the state. On June 7, Balasore police had seized brown sugar weighing 1.2kg from one Sainara Biwi from Arada Bazar in Sahadev Khunta police station limits. The market value of the seized contraband was more than Rs 1 crore. Excise officials had also seized 930gm brown sugar from the same area in Balasore recently. ""Most of the drug peddlers in Balasore procure brown sugar from Bengal and sell it to other vendors across the state. The vendors often mix powdered milk, sugar, talcum powder and incense stick ashes with the contraband to increase its volume and fetch more profit,"" said an excise official.

5a06b7dd9855b76bf13c69a4,Pre-monsoon rain cheer for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170601/jsp/bihar/story_154462.jsp,2017-06-01,"Bihar has received around 50 per cent more than normal pre-monsoon rainfall between March 1 and May 31, which should be good enough reason for farmers to cheer as it would help kharif crops in a big way. Patna office meteorologist Sandeep Kumar said the normal rainfall for the pre-monsoon season in Bihar is 77.6mm against which the state has received 124.3mm. Most of the districts, including Patna, received above normal rainfall (see chart) heralding a favourable condition for the farmers who are gearing up for the kharif season. Agriculture department deputy director Anil Kumar Jha said: ""A good pre-monsoon rainfall would lead to early preparation of nursery for paddy plants and their timely transplantation in the field."" Normally, it takes around 20 to 25 days for a paddy plant to get ready in the nursery for being transplanted to the field. The ideal time of paddy nursery preparation is from May 25 to June 15 and timely and more-than-sufficient rainfall in the pre-monsoon period has ushered in relief. Farmers are otherwise forced either to take help of irrigation means, which involve cost, or have to start preparing the nursery work late waiting for the rains, which adversely hit the paddy crop. ""A paddy plant requires something between 100 and 155 days to get matured depending on the kind of variety being sown. Timely transplantation helps in proper growth of the plant and it does not need to be delayed till the advent of winter, as cold is detrimental to the paddy crop,"" said a rice scientist associated with Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa. Apart from paddy, which is the main kharif crop of Bihar, other crops like vegetables, sugarcane, maize, arhar and finger millet, too, would benefit from the moisture content in the soil added because of the good pre-monsoon rainfall. The Bihar government has also promoted cultivation of green manure ahead of paddy transplantation, as it adds to the bio-mass content in the soil, which enhances crop productivity. ""Normally, farmers have to irrigate their fields for proper growth of the green manure. Good rainfall in the pre-monsoon season would save this cost,"" Jha said. The maturing period of green manure is 30 to 40 days and after getting ready, this crop is ploughed back in the field for adding to its fertility. Flood measures The state disaster management authority (SDMA) is planning to introduce special provisions in its standard operating procedure for floods so that proper care could be taken of transgenders in Bihar during the calamity. SDMA vice-chairman Vyasji shared the information on Wednesday and stated that the details for it would be discussed on Thursday when a state-level workshop would be organised in Patna to mark the beginning of the flood safety week in Bihar. The SDMA has been made the nodal agency for organising special programmes from June 1 to 7 during the flood safety week. Reshma, a transgender from Bihar, who thanked the SDMA for taking the initiative said: ""Transgenders face several problems during natural disasters and during the Chennai cyclones many of them had been raped and harassed. It is good that the Bihar government is showing us sensitivity."" According to the 2011 census, Bihar is home to 40,827 transgenders."

No GST is applicable on such food supplied free.Earlier, on July 2, Union food and processing minister and Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal had urged finance minister Arun Jaitley to exempt all purchases made by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) for langar sewa or service at the community kitchen from the GST.Lagar being orgnaised at Golden Temple. (HT File Photo)The SGPC spends around Rs 75 crore to purchase desi ghee, sugar and pulses, all used in the preparation of food served in the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Citing this, the minister said the committee would have to bear a financial burden of Rs 10 crore on purchases, as they come under the 5-18% GST bracket.However, the ministrys statement said some of the inputs and input services required for making prasad would be subject to the GST. These include sugar, vegetable edible oils, ghee, butter and service for transportation of these goods.The ministry said most of these inputs, or input services, have multiple uses. Under the GST regime, it is difficult to prescribe a separate rate of tax, for say sugar, when supplied for a particular purpose.With the GST being a multistage tax, end use-based exemptions or concessions are difficult to administer, said the ministry. It would, therefore, not be desirable to provide end use-based exemption for inputs or input services for making prasada or food for free distribution by religious institutions."

Picture by Saidul Khan Ampati, June 21: Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma today urged the people of the state to create opportunities for youths in the fields of entrepreneurship and business. ""Jobs in the government sector are limited. We should create enterprises for the next generation. We have to engage our youths in productive activities,"" he said, while addressing a gathering comprising wholesale dealers, civil society organisations, and village chiefs at Ampati in South West Garo Hills. He stressed the need to learn the act of entrepreneurship by running fair price shops. ""Meghalaya will prosper if its people are engaged in successful business ventures. This would help the government generate revenue. It is an incumbent on the government to create hope for its people in partnership with various communities,"" he said. The government has been sensitising the people to make Garo hills a business hub and tap the potential in neighbouring Bangladesh and in the rest of the country with the new road connectivity, which is being developed via Dhubri in Assam to Bengal, the chief minister said. Talking about the poor pass percentage in matriculation examination in Garo hills, the chief minister said youths are being lured into insurgency. ""Identifying the ground situation and the problems faced by the youths, the government has simplified the education criteria for recruitment in police so that youths have an opportunity to compete for the low-rank services,"" he said. While speaking to the wholesalers and dealers of fair price shops, Mukul said the government, by an act of Parliament, has been able to ensure food security in the country to eradicate poverty and hunger. ""The state government had several challenges in terms of distribution of essential food commodities but has been able to deal with the issue with the support and partnership of different stakeholders, particularly the wholesale and fair price shop dealers,"" he said. The government had faced several constraints to reach out to the grassroots in terms of handling and transportation of essential food items. ""The consistent support of the wholesale and fair price shop dealers have created an enabling environment for the effective delivery of the programme in the state,"" Mukul said, while handing over appreciation certificates to the wholesale and fair price shop dealers for their cooperation in the successful implementation of the National Food Security Act. ""The price of essential commodities are increasing. But the act ensures that the vulnerable and marginalised sections of the society receive the essential food items at a rate fixed by Parliament,"" he said. The chief minister said Meghalaya was the only state in the country to provide packaged sugar under the programme that has been recently withdrawn from the component by the Centre. ""The Centre asked us to discontinue providing sugar under the act. But we have decided to work out modalities from our own resources and continue providing sugar along with rice and other foodgrains. But instead of providing 3kg sugar, we will continue to provide 1kg from the state government's resources,"" he added. The chief minister said the government is promoting different livelihood activities under the flagship programme Integrated Basin Development and Livelihood Promotion, which encompasses sectors like agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fisheries, apiculture, sericulture, industries and tourism. The government is also facilitating financial and bank linkages, besides offering to set up enterprises from different business incubation and entrepreneurial facilitation centres, he added."

Head coach Mickey Arthur, thus, urged his players to buck up, put their best foot forward and book a ticket for London in order to play Sunday's decider. He wants players to avoid the feeling of having done enough just because they made it to the semi-finals. ""Look, we won ugly against Sri Lanka. We can't sugar coat that fact. Yes, we've got nothing to lose, but we've always said we're in it to win it. ""When we chatted last night at the end of the game, the last thing I want is for us to go away now thinking that we got to a semi-final, so we're okay since we've achieved a lot. Because, that would be a cop-out in my mind. ""We certainly want to come out and put our best game forward and win. That's been our mantra right from the start of this competition. ""We were in Birmingham and have come to Cardiff. But we want to end up in London. That's something we've spoken about and worked on. Again, we certainly didn't want to be just making up the numbers in this competition and we've shown that we weren't... ""Now we need to go one step further and never be satisfied. That's a mantra of ours. We want to keep improving every day. So, our job is far from over,"" Arthur said on Tuesday, the eve of Pakistan's semi-final clash versus England in Cardiff. Arthur seems pretty impressed with the work ethics of youngsters in the form of Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam, Fahim Ashraf and Hasan Ali. ""Fakhar, particularly, has been fantastic. ""I guess it's a breath of fresh air when you see a young player come into the side and take the game on. And the good thing for us is the young players that have come into the side came in with a really good spirit. ""You look at Fakhar, you look at Fahim, Babar and Hasan when they all came in. So, the young guys coming in have taken it as a duck to water, which has been great. ""They've come in with a great attitude and they want to learn. They want to work hard and we're getting some results out of them, which is fantastic news,"" Arthur said. Admitting that the Pakistan middle order looks fragile, captain Sarfraz Khan and senior pro Shoaib Malik may be promoted up the order, Arthur suggested. ""Our middle order has been exposed just a little bit. Ideally, we'd like to probably get Sarfraz and Malik maybe in a little bit earlier, but that's something that we need to discuss."" With the comeback Pakistan have launched since their forgettable loss to India, they really have shaken up the tournament, feels Arthur. ""Yeah, we probably have shaken up the tournament. We were written off totally and probably rightly so, after the clash versus India because we were shambolic. We were terrible. ""But the recent results have just shown the resolve the players have had and certainly the belief that I as coach have had in our boys. I'm incredibly proud of how we pulled ourselves off the canvas after the loss to India."""

These include sugar, vegetable edible oils, ghee, butter, service for transportation of these goods and so on.Most of these inputs or input services have multiple uses. Therefore, under the GST, it is difficult to prescribe a separate tax rate for such items, when supplied for a particular purpose.Further, the GST being a multi-stage tax, end use-based exemptions or concessions are difficult to administer. Therefore, the GST does not envisage such exemptions. It would, therefore, not be desirable to provide similar exemption for inputs or input services for making prasadam or food for free distribution by religious institutions.Earlier, on July 2, Union Food and Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had urged Finance Minister Arun Jaitely to exempt all purchases made by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) for 'langar sewa' or service at the community kitchen, under the GST.The SGPC spends around Rs. 75 crore to purchase desi ghee, sugar and pulses, all used in the preparation of food served in the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Citing this, the Minister said the committee would have to bear a financial burden of Rs. 10 crore on purchases, as they come under the 5 to 18 per cent GST bracket.The GST, which was rolled out at midnight on June 30, is expected to benefit all the stakeholders namely industry, government and consumer as it will lower the cost of goods and services give a boost to the economy and make the products and services globally competitive, giving a major boost to 'Make in India' initiative.Under the GST regime, exports will be zero-rated in entirety unlike the present system where refund of some of the taxes does not take place due to fragmented nature of indirect taxes between the Centre and the States.However, the GST will make India a common market with common tax rates and procedures and remove economic barriers.The GST is largely technology driven and will reduce the human interface to a great extent. The GST is expected to improve the Ease of Doing Business in India.In a majority of supplies of goods, the tax incidence approved by the GST Council is much lower than the present combined indirect tax rates levied [on account of central excise duty rates/embedded central excise duty rates/service tax post-clearance embedding, VAT rates or weighted average VAT rates, cascading of VAT over excise duty and tax incidence on account of CST, Octroi, Entry Tax] by the Centre and State(s)."

Titled Usamadheel Bibtya (sugarcane leopard).In the last four years, Junnar region has seen a significant rise in cases of man-leopard conflicts. According to Junnar Forest Department officials, at least one case of man-leopard conflict is reported every 10 days. To highlight the safety measures to avoid such attacks, the department has made a documentary.Titled Usamadheel Bibtya (sugarcane leopard), the film was released last week and has been shot in Junnar region over the last one year. Through this documentary, we want to raise awareness about the nature of leopards and why they have made sugarcane fields their home. The documentary also aims to apprise the audience about what measures one can take during a man-animal conflict. We have been creating awareness through various mediums, such as brochures, lectures, workshops. But an audio-visual medium has a stronger impact, said Arujun Mhase, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar Forest Department. Mhase added that though the problem of leopard-animal conflict started from 1999, it has increased in the last four years, with growth of sugarcane farming.He added that there are various reasons why leopards have left the forests and come near the human settlements.Sugarcane fields come across as secure and safe shelters for leopards. They prey on local animals, such as goats, dogs, hare, etc. Also, water is readily available near the fields. Female leopards find the dense sugarcane fields a safe place to give birth. Spotting newborn cubs in sugarcane fields is a common sight for the villagers here, said Mhase.The documentary will come in handy in reaching out to people during awareness programmes. We aim to screen it in schools, colleges, among other organisations. Besides, since the documentary has been converted into a DVD, we will share it with forest officials in Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Nashik, Ahmednagar and Mumbai, which are facing similar cases, he added.Sharing excerpts from the documentary, the official discussed the shy nature of a leopard and why it runs away after seeing a human being. It attacks only when provoked or threatened, he said.The documentary, Mhase said, also suggests measures villagers can take to avoid a conflict with the big cat. For instance, while stepping out alone at night, one should intentionally make noise to alert the animal  either by whistling, playing a song on the cellphone, singing a song, or merely carrying a torch. Hearing any sound will alert the animal and it will run away. Children should not be allowed to pass through a secluded area unaccompanied.The film further advises people to keep their livestock properly locked during the night. Keep your surroundings clean and ensure that no carcass is lying around. If a leopard is hungry and does not find a prey, it may stray into the nearby area for food. On seeing a leopard, the villagers are advised to inform the forest department or the local police official immediately, said the official.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Praveen Khanna)Naseem Khan and Pinki Kumari got married in the summer of 2015, two years after communal riots in their district of Muzaffarnagar killed at least 50 people. Scared for their lives, the couple relocated to Visakhapatnam, where their son, Abdullah, was born on July 17 last year. Last month, they returned to their village to celebrate Eid.On Monday afternoon, Naseem, 22, was returning home with a birthday cake for his son when he was attacked, allegedly by his in-laws. He was beaten up with sticks, and then shot twice  in the stomach and forehead. He died at 1:15 pm, minutes after he was shot.Naseem and Pinki used to be neighbours. We studied in the same school. A few years ago, my parents came to know about us.They locked me in the house and my brother beat me up. They wanted me to marry someone else, said Pinki.In the summer of 2015, Pinki, then 18 years old, fled from her parents house and went to Visakhapatnam, where Naseem was earning a living by selling clothes. The couple returned to Muzaffarnagar and got married.Its been barely two years since they got married. It was a court marriage. There were no ceremonies. Soon after they got married, they returned to Visakhapatnam, said Naseems cousin, Nazar Mohammad. Pinki converted to Islam and changed her name to Ayesha.For the last two years, they did not return home. Initially, my parents and brothers used to threaten my in-laws. They would send messages through other villagers. We celebrated all the festivals away from home, said Pinki.But as the months passed, the threats stopped. So, this year, the couple decided to celebrate Eid in their village. We arrived here a day before Eid, on June 25. We were supposed to return to Visakhapatnam within a few days. But we decided to celebrate our sons first birthday here, so we extended our stay. We would have left for Visakhapatnam today, said Pinki.Nazar Mohammad claimed that he was with Naseem at the time of the attack. Naseem and his 14-year-old brother were on his motorcycle. I was on a motorcycle behind them. We had gone to make arrangements for his sons birthday, and Naseem had got a cake, he said.At around 1:10 pm, a man who was hiding in the sugarcane fields attacked Naseem with a stick Three others rushed to the road and threw a cycle to stop Naseems motorcycle. They beat him up first. When a crowd started gathering, they fired at least three-four shots at him. They were coming towards us, but when they saw that people had gathered, they fled from the spot, he claimed.Police said an FIR, under IPC sections relating to murder and rioting  302, 147, 148, 159 and 506  against Pinkis father Rajesh, brother Pradeep, cousin Sonu, and another relative Nitu has been registered.The FIR has been registered on the basis of the complaint filed by Naseems cousin against four persons. The accused are absconding but we are conducting raids and they will be nabbed soon. A post-mortem has been conducted and the body has been returned to the family, said Muzaffarnagar SP Ajay Kumar Sahdev.About 2 km from Naseems house in Bhokarhedis Pathan colony, his in-laws new house has been locked since Monday. Pinki claimed she spoke to her brother on Monday afternoon, after she heard of her husbands death.I asked him why he had killed my husband. It was not my husbands fault. I had run away from my parents house. I asked him how could he not think of my one-year-old son while killing my husband. My brother said he would kill me and my son I want them behind bars. How can the police not find them? They must be at some relatives house or hiding in the fields, she said.Residents of Bhokarhedi area of Muzaffarnagar district said such incidents have rarely taken place. Bhopa police station, where the FIR was registered, has a temple on its right and a mosque on its left. Even during the Muzaffarnagar riots, this area was not affected by communal tension, said Atiq Khan, a resident.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo Kamleshwar Singh)Terming it as a case of gross misuse of authority and conflict of interest, AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Friday accused Irrigation and Power Minister Rana Gurjit Singh of concealing the fact that [one of] his (Ranas) company and Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) are [locked] in a litigation in Supreme Court.Addressing a press conference here, Khaira said he had been told by top authorities of PSPCL that Rana Gurjeet Singh is using his official position and pressuring PSPCL to either withdraw the petition from the Supreme Court or accept the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity passed in favour of his company.Khaira said Rana Sugars Ltd had set up a 12 MW capacity co-generation power plant in 2001 to supply 10.2 MW power to PSPCL for 20 years at a base rate of Rs 3.01 with an annual escalation clause of 5 per cent up to financial year 2004-05 and thereafter no escalation was permitted as per the agreement. Khaira said the plant was synchronized with the grid on March 1, 2002, and power purchase agreement was signed on May 4, 2005.Alleging violation of the agreement, Khaira said ministers company filed a petition in the Punjab State Regulatory Commission in 2010 to seek redetermination of tariff for supply of power to PSPCL. The State Commission rejected the petition on June 24, 2013, and Rana Sugars Ltd approached the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity in Delhi to challenge the order. The Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeal on September 19, 2014, and remanded the matter back to Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission for reconsideration and to redetermine the tariff after duly considering the actual fuel cost of bio mass, Khaira said.He added, The PSPCL filed an appeal in the Supreme Court under section 125 of the Electricity Act 2003, challenging the judgment of Appellate Tribunal of Electricity, Delhi. Khaira said the next date of hearing in the case was September 8.Alleging that minister was pressuring the PSPCL to withdraw the petition from the Supreme Court and accept the judgment of the Tribunal passed in favour of his company. Is Rana Gurjit Singh that indispensable? It is a test of Amarinder Singh. I ask Amarinder Singh that if an iota of ethics or morality is left in him, he should sack Rana Gurjeet Singh from cabinet, Khaira said, also mentioning the sand mining row and purchase of deh shamlat land in Seonk village involving Rana.Rana refutes charges, calls Khaira a failed and frustrated man Sukhpal Khaira is a failed and frustrated man, too desperate to stay in limelight and in the process has gone delusional about me, Rana said in a statement, refuting the charge that he was trying to influence the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to withdraw its appeal in the Supreme Court.I have challenged him in the past and I am challenging him now to bring evidence against me, he said while advising Khaira to stop burning in jealousy as it will prove to be self-destructive. The minister said it was self-explanatory from Khairas statement that his family-owned company Rana Sugars had not committed any wrong and had only followed a legal course to get justice.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

To make this possible, the key action point under the PFA is to bring down the UPPCLs power purchase cost that constitutes 80% its overall expenses, says the corporation in one of the notices served in respect of the Bajajs Barkhera thermal plant.In the same notice, it has been pointed out that the UPPCL purchased 354.52 million units of power from this plant during 2016-17 for Rs 8.04 per unit which was among the highest and around 111.58% higher as compared to average power purchase cost of Rs 3.80 per unit.Meanwhile, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Avadhesh Kumar Verma has urged the power regulator (UPERA) to accordingly revise the UPPCLs annual revenue requirement (ARR) proposal to minimize tariff hike.Verma said states consumers were facing the heat since the UPPCL was passing the burden on them through the tariff. He said the UPPCL in its ARR had proposed to buy power worth Rs 1773 crore at an average rate of Rs 7.22 per unit from the Bajajs five plants during 2017-18.Now when, the UPPCL has terminated the PPAs for costly power, the ARR should be revised accordingly so that consumers get relief when the tariff is revised in September-October, Verma demanded.The UPPCL had earlier terminated the contracts for setting up nine power plants under the MoU routes on the Yogi Adityanath governments directives after it was found that the private developers that had bagged the contracts during the Mayawati regime had not done sufficient work on the proposed sites despite getting time extensions during both Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav regimes."
5a0718ea9855b76bf13c794e,Of charming towns and cobbled streets,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jul/15/of-charming-towns-and-cobbled-streets-1628812.html,2017-07-15,"HYDERABAD: Travelling in the Philippines, I realised that each region gives a different perspective with its distinct culture. In Luzon, the provinces of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur surprised me pleasantly: rich heritage structures that stood the test of time and traditions that are still in vogue. Long before the Spaniards came to the Philippines, settlements already existed along the coves in the northwestern part of Luzon. This region was a progressive trading post renowned for its gold mines, familiar to the ancient Japanese, Chinese and Malay traders.As I journeyed northwards, the jeepneys (initially made from the US military jeeps left over after the Second World War, since been developed into colourful public service transport, ubiquitous throughout the country) got smaller and the tricycles (like tiny auto rickshaws) even tinier. Zaza Santiago, my guide complained jokingly, Our tricycles are so small, we find it hard to squeeze into them. Especially after shopping, the tomatoes roll out from my bags and no place for more people.Zaza picked me up from Playa Tropical Resort Hotel to take me to Vigan, a fascinating town (also a Unesco World Heritage Site) in Ilocos Sur, the second Northernmost place in the Philippines. One of the new seven wonder cities of the world, Vigan is one of those few towns left in the country whose old structures have mostly remained intact, and the place is well known for its cobbled stone streets and the unique architecture - a fusion of Native Philippine and the Colonial Spanish styles. Vigan Heritage Village (Kamestizoan District) is replete with ancestral houses that date back to the 18th century, with ancient tile roofs, massive hardwood floorings, balustrades and azoteas in varying Spanish- Mexican-Chinese architectural designs.The Bantay Church features both baroque and gothic influenced architecture. The statue of Our Lady of Charity is an old treasure, made of wood and ivory. Its belfry, a few metres away was used as a watchtower for approaching enemies. There was a horse drawn cortege standing in front of the church, with the picture of a deceased lady: it was decorated with white balloons and flowers.Listening to the sacred music at the funeral service, I joined the line, paid respects to the departed soul, and received the Holy Communion. It didnt matter to me that the departed was a stranger.Neither did it matter that I am a staunch Hindu - what mattered to me was respecting a tradition/faith.A quick look at St Paul cathedral was followed by a visit to Pagburnayan, the traditional earthen jar-making industry in Vigan that was introduced by the Chinese in the 14th century. They were used for fermenting vinegar, wine, salt etc. A buffalo was going around in circles, stamping the clay. The potter turned the wheel and produced some lovely pieces of art. I bought some pots as souvenirs and a paper mache Kalesa, which is a horse drawn carriage, a popular mode of transport.Syquia Mansion belongs to a wealthy Chinese - Filipino family in Vigan. It was the residence of the former president Elpido Quirino. Turned into a museum, it showcases the lifestyle of the rich and the famous in the early 1900s. The floors are made of huge stone slabs called piedra, which came all the way from the Chinese merchants who used them to weigh down their empty ships before loading in the goods coming from Vigan City.The opulence of the family is seen through the numerous paintings hanging on their walls, foot-wide hardwood planks, antique furniture, glass chandeliers and draped capiz windows. The whole mansion wraps around a central courtyard found, not on the ground floor, but at the second floor of the house.After a lovely ride in a Kalesa through the cobbled streets of Vigan, we had lunch at Cafe Uno where the Vice President of Philippines also was expected that day. We had avocado shake, tilapia fish, garlic rice, fried chicken and halo halo for dessert which consists of evaporated milk, ice cubes, cheese, lots of sugar, grated coconut, kaong, gelatine etc.Post lunch we travelled to Ilocos Norte to see the imposing St Augustine Church in Paoay, with its picture perfect faade and the three-storey coral bell tower. The church is famous for its Earthquake Baroque Architecture that is an interpretation of the European Baroque adapted to the seismic condition of the country through the use of enormous buttresses - there were 24 in all. A wedding was underway - bridesmaids of all ages fully decked up and eagerly waiting for the ceremony to start. Zaza was keen to show me the Sinking Bell Tower that is located in the busy centre of Laoag City, close to the public market. It is believed that the historic tower is sinking at a rate of an inch a year, though no one is completely sure why.I headed home the next day, with rich memories of my travel to a country that has so much to offer, and with such a warm heart!

(Express Archive) Among the crops that could be hit are sugarcane (both in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) and maize (Haveri, Davangere, Chitradurga and Bellary districts are major producers). (Express Archive)If Maharashtra, particularly Marathwada, was the epicentre of drought in 2014 and 2015, that has now seemingly shifted deep southward to a stretch covering the old Mysore region and coastal Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.In 2016, south interior Karnataka recorded 22 per cent deficit rainfall during the southwest monsoon season (June-September), while it was minus 21 per cent for coastal Karnataka, minus 34 per cent for Kerala and 20 per cent for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. The numbers were even worse  at minus 70, minus 63 and minus 62 per cent each, respectively for the four meteorological subdivisions  for the northeast or retreating monsoon (October-December), which brings significant amount of rain, especially in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.A repeat scenario looks to be unfolding this year as well. While India as a whole has received an average area-weighted rainfall of 343.4 mm during the current monsoon season until July 19, one per cent more than the historic normal of 338.4 mm for this period, rain has so far been below-normal in south interior Karnataka (minus 33 per cent), coastal Karnataka (minus 11 per cent), Kerala (minus 24 per cent) and Tamil Nadu (minus 19 per cent).The result can be seen in water levels in the dams. The four major reservoirs of the Cauvery basin in Karnataka  Krishna Raja Sagara or KRS in Mandya district, Hemavathy (Hassan), Kabini (Mysore) and Harangi (Kodagu)  currently have less water than they had at this time in 2016.Last year, the Karnataka government was forced to release water from the KRS and Kabini reservoirs to the Mettur dam across the border in Tamil Nadus Salem district, following a Supreme Court directive. It triggered violent protests in Mysore and Mandya, spilling over to even Bengaluru. Traffic along the Bengaluru-Mysuru expressway came to halt as vehicles with Tamil Nadu registration plates were burnt by pro-Kannada groups who also targeted Tamilian-owned shops and eateries.This year too, theres great worry. Reservoir levels in the Cauvery basin have fallen lower with back-to-back monsoon failure and Karnataka is headed to Assembly elections in barely eight months. Political temperatures have already been raised, with pro-Kannada groups demanding removal of Hindi signage in all Bangalore Metro stations and the Siddaramaiah-headed Congress government constituting a committee to examine whether Karnataka could have a separate flag for the state.If this were not all, the rainfall forecast for the next one week at least is not very optimistic. There is possibility of some scattered rainfall in south interior Karnataka and Kerala over the coming two days, but it will not be enough to compensate for the current deficit in this area, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, head of services at the India Meteorological Department.The reservoir position is equally, if not more, precarious in Tamil Nadus main dams  Mettur, Bhavanisagar (Erode), Vaigai (Theni) or Aliyar and Sholayar in Coimbatore district. The rain hasnt been good in either the Nilgiri (the catchment area for Bhavanisagar) or Anaimalai hills (for Aliyar and Sholayar) of the Western Ghats.While Mettur gets water from the KRS and Kabini, the latters catchment is mainly in Keralas Wayanad district. Similarly, the Mullaperiyar dam in Idukki (Kerala) irrigates Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts of southern Tamil Nadu, with its waters also feeding the Vaigai dam in Theni. The same goes for the Parambikulam dam, which, while located in Keralas Palakkad district, largely caters to the Coimbatore-Erode belt in western Tamil Nadu. The Parambikulam and Mullaperiyar dams are both, in fact, owned, operated and maintained by the Tamil Nadu government  thereby also lending themselves to inter-state disputes with Kerala.What this also means is that the rain failing in one part could impact water levels in dams and reservoirs elsewhere. The effects are cumulative when the monsoon turns out bad in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern as well coastal Karnataka  that too, for a second successive year.I havent seen anything like this. Sadly, it is not receiving adequate attention from the powers-that-be. Even the protests by Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi do not reflect the real intensity of the crisis, said M Manickam, chairman of the Coimbatore-based Sakthi Sugars Limited.Among the crops that could be hit are sugarcane (both in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) and maize (Haveri, Davangere, Chitradurga and Bellary districts are major producers). Milk output could also suffer; the bulk of procurement by cooperatives in Karnataka is from the Mysore-Mandya-Bangalore-Kolar belt. Dairies in Tamil Nadu, too, are reporting near-flat procurement, with farmers struggling to arrange both fodder and water for their animals.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0719db9855b76bf13c79f3,Badam ki jali: The delicate almond cookies from Hyderabad,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jul/15/badam-ki-jali-the-delicate-almond-cookies-from-hyderabad-1628808.html,2017-07-15,"HYDERABAD: While Hyderabad is known for biryani and haleem, traditional sweets and desserts are also no less appreciated here. Apart from the ubiquitous Qubani Ka Meetha, Kaddu Ki Kheer and Double Ka Meetha, a host of other sweets like Jauzi Halwa from the twin cities have started getting some limelight. Badam Ki Jali is another sweet which was comparatively lesser known  but in recent times this almond and cashew based sweet found in the bylanes of Old City is making waves among the discerning food lovers.The baked sweet, which gets its name from the lace like designs on it, has originated from the Navaithas, an Urdu speaking Muslim community in old Madras and Arcot areas. Through inter-marriages the recipe has been adopted in Hyderabad about a century ago, and especially found popularity at wedding dinners. Prepared from ground almond and sugar the jali comes in different shapes and sizes depending on the mould used.Sometimes cashew is also used as an ingredient and silver varq is added for a nice look. The sweet is presented in different and attractive designs, such as stars, flowers, betel leaves and even fruits. A variant is the ashrafi where the dough is pressed between two Nizami coins, to get the traditional Nizami inscriptions on the round golden coloured sweet resembling a gold coin.Badam ki Jali can be procured only from a few places in the old city. The recipe differs a bit from place to place and is a closely guarded secret. However, the basic process is the same  almonds or cashews are first ground into flour and made into a dough with sugar, and then rolled into a large roti-like shape. Moulds are then used to create the various shapes in which the sweet is available. Next these are baked for some time to give it the finish. Badam Ki Jali tastes very different from other almond or cashew based sweets  it is harder and more delicate. The soft Ashrafi is of a different texture altogether, which unlike the Badam Ki Jali are not baked.While there are a few home chefs who supply these sweets for weddings, Badam Kaju ki Jali is a home-based outlet near Darulshifa which is exclusively making Badam Ki Jali and Ashrafi. Nasreen Hussaini, who runs this place says that the recipe has been passed on through generations and she learnt it from her mother-in-law. While earlier they used to supply only for weddings, they went into retailing a few years back, and now even offer a sugar-free version of the sweet.Hameedi Confectioners at Nampally, who are known more for their Jauzi Halwa, and Almond House are some other places where this sweet is available. One can also get the sweet delivered at home through Snackisq, an online ordering portal.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast who blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

(Representational image) In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. (Representational image)Just 18 months ago, Jalna farmer Chandrakant Kshirsagar sold the couple of quintals of tur (pigeon pea) he produces at Rs 8,000 a quintal. This year, after waiting months for prices to rise, he finally sold his produce at Rs 4,000 a quintal, making exactly half last years earnings even as his input costs have grown.Other farmers who sold at Rs 3,200 a quintal had fared so much worse, he reasons, explaining why pulse producers, all habituated to volatility in pulse prices, are still the angriest among Maharashtras farmers this year. Many of them small and marginal farmers especially in Marathwada where Latur and Nanded districts produce tur, urad and moong in large quantities, pulse farmers fully anticipated a bumper crop in 2016-17.An excellent monsoon had followed two consecutive drought years, prices were sky-high last year, and there was a government-induced increase in acreage of pulses. Everybody knew we would have an excellent output. And still, we now have a glut of imports, so much so that the oversupply will not end any time soon, says Rajan Kshirsagar, a farmer and Left leader from Parbhani in Marathwada, a mostly dryland farming region that produces much of Maharashtras approximately 1.5 million tonnes of pulses annually.Current wholesale rates for tur are still approximately Rs 3,700 a quintal. And to add to farmers woes at having to sell way below the MSP of Rs 5,050 a quintal, there are allegations that cartelised traders abused the governments procurement process by selling to government centres at the MSP, at huge profits. Maharashtra is a major pulse-producing state, among the top four.While pulse farming across India is largely unirrigated, the problem is more acute in Maharashtra, where only 8.7 per cent of land under pulses is irrigated, making the 16 per cent share of Maharashtra in Indias pulse production especially vulnerable to monsoon shocks. (In Uttar Pradesh, 35.1 per cent of area under pulses is irrigated).It follows naturally that the plentiful monsoon of 2016-17, and government policy promoting pulse production, saw area under pulses in Maharashtra grow from 20,06,000 hectare in 2015-16 to 25,57,000 hectare  a 28 per cent rise. From 6,11,000 tonnes last year, output ballooned to an estimated 17,51,000 tonnes, a 187 per cent rise.In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. But everybody is unanimous that the reduction in acreage will not help tackle the existing oversupply.Maharashtras farmers are sowing less tur because of crashing prices, but supply will not come down so soon. The rains are going to be good, so it is a reasonable assessment that prices will remain depressed, says Dr Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.Also, price volatility in pulses, a cyclical problem, is neither peculiar to Maharashtra nor unusual. Dr Joshi says the massive volatility in pulse prices has been a constant phenomenon over the last 15 years or so. Every third year there is a price spike and then a crash, and the volatility is directly linked to production. Farmers look at experience of high prices and sow more, so prices fluctuate.Dr Joshi believes a 10 per cent price increase annually is good incentive from farmers perspective, but a mechanism needs to be devised to smoothen prices. Firstly, you have to de-risk agriculture from rains  irrigation is key. Alongside that, better food management can ensure that volatility is kept under control, through buffer stocks and other measures.That import arrivals of pulses continued even as it became apparent that there is a bumper crop locally contributed to the glut. Structural solutions are needed from a long-term perspective, but in the short term, various devices on imports, buffers and so on are needed.Nitin Kalantry, one of Laturs larger pulse traders, says imports from Africa are at about Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,300 a quintal and from Burma at Rs 3,400 a quintal. So prices will definitely not rise dramatically in the near future, he says. In addition, Kalantry says, theres a 1.10 million tonne buffer stock with the government at the all-India level and traders are wondering how and when this will be disposed of. Also, he says farmers continue to hold about 15 per cent of their stocks, hoping prices will rise.Also, while government buyouts themselves will not suffice to tackle the oversupply, many say the procurement process itself should have been better streamlined. Kshirsagar, the Parbhani leader, says there was negligence and poor planning in procurement. First there were only 17 procurement centres, and too few were added later. Then farmers were first told to bring their produce, and they waited there while incurring rent for the vehicles, then they were told to take a token and make deliveries later, he says, adding that thousands of farmers also received delayed payments.MahaFPC, a consortium of Farmer Producer Companies, which demonstrated a procurement intervention in the 2016-17 season in parts of the state with a transparent system for farmers, says there are many policy interventions needed to improve the procurement process. Inadequate warehousing and procurement infrastructure in the producing states, unpreparedness of the state nodal agencies and political interference in procurement operations created mismanagement and failed to stabilise the markets, says Yogesh Thorat, MD of MahaFPC, adding that a huge majority of pulse farmers may have sold below MSP.Thorat adds that while commodity futures markets are in an infancy stage, they may help reduce market risks for pulse farmers despite fears that trading in futures may be highly speculative, without any actual delivery of the commodity. Recently SEBI allowed NCDEX to launch chana futures. Presently these trading platforms are in the hands of middlemen, hence neither farmers nor consumers are benefitted.Farmer Producer Companies are coming forward to participate in these markets for physical delivery of commodities, a good sign, and futures can be a crucial instrument to regulate price trend. All kinds of marketing avenues should be open for better price realisation and price stabilisation in pulses, Thorat says.Tuesday: Sugar, not sweet for farmersFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: AP) It was Bhullars heroic knock of 171 runs in the semi-final against Australia earlier this week which helped India march into the final. (Source: AP)IT WAS a heartbreak for the Indian womens team and the cricket fans in the Tricity as the Indian team lost by nine runs against England in the final of the ICC Womens World Cup at Lords Cricket grounds in London on Sunday. While Indias semi-final record scorer Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar scored a half-century and stitched together a 95-run partnership for third wicket with Poonam Raut, India lost the final for the second time.We will take a lot of positives from the final. Harmanpreets knock of 51 runs was as important as her century against Australia but it was unfortunate that India lost the match. Harmanpreet has been my favourite cricketer since she led Punjab senior team. The Indian team showed that they can perform at the world level. Reaching the final after playing the qualifiers and dominating the matches will mean good for Indian cricket. I hope that BCCI also launched IPL for women cricketers, said Chandigarh cricketer Taniya Bhatia, who plays for Punjab and was also part of Indian women camp in Mumbai before the World Cup.It was Bhullars heroic knock of 171 runs in the semi-final against Australia earlier this week which helped India march into the final. The Indian team had played their first final in World Cup in 2005 and Sundays final in the World Cup was their second final in the last 12 years. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced a cash award of Rs 5 lakh for Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar. Singh spoke to Bhullars father Harmandar Bhullar on Sunday and appreciated Harmanpreets performance in the World Cup.Later, Singh also said that the Punjab government would review its sports policy to induct players like Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar into government service and she would be offered the post of DSP in Punjab Police. At Bhullars hometown Moga, trainees and her coach Kamaldeesh Pal Sodhi watched the match at the Gian Jyoti Academy, Tarapur village.More than 30 trainees at our academy played a match in the morning and later watched the match. Harmanpreet showed that she can play a big knock in the final too. It was disheartening to see her depart just after completing her half-century. This World Cup brought her in the limelight and she will only improve from now on. Trainees at our academy train without any support from state government and to produce a World Cup finalist is a huge achievement for us, said Sodhi.Harmanpreets long-time teammate and Punjab player Parveen Khan, who belongs to Moga and will be attending a coaching camp at IS Bindra Stadium, Mohali, this week, too, watched the match. After her knock in the semi-final, all of my friends want to meet her. We talked on Friday and she was eager to give her best in the final despite suffering injury scare in the semi-finals. She was looking set for a big score today but fell at a crucial moment in the match. We hope there are more centuries to come from her bat, said 26-year-old Khan, whose father works in a sugar mill at Moga.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a071bcf9855b76bf13c7b1c,Tracing the history of ‘honeyed urine’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2017/jul/13/tracing-the-history-of-honeyed-urine-1628354.html,2017-07-14,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Did you know that diabetes is one of the oldest diseases known to man? Of course, it was not known as diabetes in ancient India but as madhu meha or honeyed urine. As early as 1,500 BC, physicians noticed that ants were attracted to the urine of certain patients who had complained of frequent urination, fatigue and thirst. They observed that this urine was sweet or honeyed. Interestingly, the ancient Greeks believed that frequent urination, which was one of the symptoms of the disease, was caused by flesh that was melting down and being converted into urine. Further observations by Indian physicians, Charaka and Sushrutha around 400 to 500 BC added to our knowledge of madhu meha. They identified two types of madhu meha, and categorised the first type as being associated with youngsters and the second type as affecting obese older people.The word diabetes itself was coined in 200 BC by a Greek physician, Appollonius of Memphis. It means to siphon or pass through. The name was first recorded in English in a medical text written around 1425. It was in 1675 that Thomas Willis added the word mellitus - meaning honeyed or sweet - to diabetes, and today the disease is known as diabetes mellitus.The first test for diabetes was the urine taste test. In ancient times, people known as water tasters diagnosed diabetes by tasting the urine of people suspected of having the disease. If you ask me, it was a rather unpleasant way of earning a living! It was only in the 1800s that scientists developed chemical tests to detect the presence of sugar in the urine.By the twentieth century, tests for blood glucose- the term used for the sugar present in your blood- were developed. In 1964, a drop of blood was placed on a paper strip and then washed off. Comparing the colour to a standardized colour chart gave the doctor a rough indication of the level of glucose in the blood. Today, there are different tests for diabetes. FBS is a test that has to be performed by drawing a blood sample from a vein, after twelve hours of fasting.It measures the fasting blood sugar levels. After giving a blood sample to determine FBS, the patient consumes a heavy meal. Approximately between 11/2 to 2 hours after eating, a second blood sample is drawn from the vein for testing. This is known as the Post Prandial Blood Sugar test, or PPBS test. A third test is the Glucose Tolerance Teat or GTT which is performed after consuming a concentrated amount of glucose dissolved in water.If you have been confirmed as being diabetic, your doctor will probably ask you to have a test called HbA1c done as well. Why is this test considered an important diagnostic tool for diabetes?To understand this, let us backtrack a little. Haemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells. It gives your blood its red colour and carries oxygen to different parts of the body. When the glucose in your blood builds up, it binds to the haemoglobin, to make a glycosylated haemoglobin molecule. This molecule is called haemoglobin A1C or HbA1C. The more glucose there is in the blood, the more haemoglobin A1C or HbA1C will be present.The HbA1c test identifies a three month average of glucose concentration in the blood. The reason a three-month average is taken is that after four months, red blood cells begin the process of decay. For people without diabetes, the normal range for the haemoglobin A1c level is between 4 per cent and 5.6 per cent. Haemoglobin A1c levels between 5.7 per cent and 6.4 per cent mean you have a higher chance of getting diabetes. Levels of 6.5 per cent or higher mean you have diabetes.FBS and PPBS levels give us information about the present, while HbA1c levels give us to give a picture of blood glucose control over a long period of time. In fact, HbA1c is the only proven indicator of a persons risk of developing complications. Both tests are important in order to get immediate, as well as the long-term information that is needed to make decisions about managing the disease. search of honeyed urine!The author has a PhD in Biochemistry from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and retired as Head of the Food Technology and Enzyme Engineering Division of the Bhabha Atomic Research centre, Mumbai."

Her mother Scarlet Blanco is from the South American country and Muguruza holds dual Spanish-Venezuelan nationality. Father Jose is a Spanish-Basque.French OpenMuguruza won the French Open title in 2016 but her defence ended in tears and controversy this year after she accused the Roland Garros crowd as being ""disrespectful"" for their behaviour towards her as she lost to home star Kiki Mladenovic. While she conducted a tearful news conference, coach Sam Sumyk described the Paris fans as pathetic.Coaching rowMuguruza was accused of being illegally 'coached' from her player's box by vanquished quarter-final opponent Svetlana Kuznetsova. ""It was pretty clear because we all speak Spanish here. She was talking to her all the time. It's her physio. I mean, I know she acts like this all the time. I don't think it's appropriate,"" said the Russian. Muguruza said it was all something of nothing. ""Honestly, they were just cheering for me. I like when my team is behind me. But nothing really tactical or specific.""Been there, done thatMuguruza has enlisted the help of 1994 Wimbledon champion and fellow Spaniard Conchita Martinez for her All England Club campaign.

""Anything with sugar, not with salt. Cakes and cookies. Oreo brownie is the best one,"" she said. However, her time in the kitchen while at Wimbledon this year almost ended in disaster. ""Every time I come to Wimbledon, a lot of things happen in the house. I love red meat. We were doing nice steaks but there was so much smoke that the fire alarm was, like, under where you cook. I'm like, 'Why do you put a fire alarm there?'"""

However, the CAG said, the CTD did not have any system in place for the collection of third party data.Further, the report mentioned that the failure of the CTD to implement the GO issued by the Industries Department resulted in non-realisation of deferred tax of Rs 1,637.61 crore from January 2007 to September 2013. The Commercial Taxes Department failed to institute a well-established system of collection of data from various work awarders in the State, read the report. This resulted in contract receipts escaping assessment.The CAG said that a separate wing, the Business Intelligence Unit (BIU) was formed for the collection of data from various sources only in August 2014. It said that the BIU did not efficiently carry out its duty as several sources of third party data remained untapped. Further, the data that was gathered was not utilised by the Assessing Authority (AA).No TNPCB consent for thermal plantsNorth Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTPS) Stage I and Tuticorin Thermal Power station (TTPS) are operating without the consent of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, according to a report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India.The report said that TNPCB has yet to give its consent as the two plants did not revamp existing pollution control systems like Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs) and have not installed and connecting online continuous effluent monitoring systems with TNPCBs server. It also stated that the thermal plants of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) are functioning without adhering to the norms for air, water and noise pollution as the Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) levels and carbon emissions remained high due to non-usage of clean beneficiated coal. It is learnt that 69.58 million tonnes of ash remained in the ash dyke in the three power plants which was against the norms of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.Chennai Corp also faces issuesThe performance audit of Greater Chennai Corporation also wasnt that impressive. Against the requirement of D9,228 crore for Chennai Mega City development mission, Tamil Nadu government sanctioned only D2,500 crore, thereby limiting the scope of the project. Storm-Water Drains were constructed without considering topographical, meteorological and hydrological data resulted in wasteful expenditure.Panchayat Raj schools poorA compliance audit of Panchayat Raj Institutions by CAG of India revealed that Panchayat Union Schools located in rural areas lacked basic infrastructure. Some observations were incomplete compound walls, dysfunctional classrooms causing classes to happen in corridors, Inadequate provision for toilets and poor kitchens.What judicial infrastructure?The narrowing down the gap in judge-population ratio could not be achieved even after sanction of 48 additional judge posts, as the sanctioned strength was only 1,150 as against the norm of 3,605 judges. The recommendation of 13th Finance Commission for having morning and evening special courts was not implemented. CAG report stated that 121 evening courts, proposed to be constituted in 32 districts, werent installed.Tamil Nadu failed to contain revenue deficitTamil Nadu has not only failed to achieve the projected revenue surplus but has also failed to contain its revenue deficit within the target proposed in the budget during 2015-2016, found the audit undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) tabled in the Assembly on Wednesday.The States revenue receipts stood at Rs 1,29,008 crore, constituting 10.64% of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). The audit report mentioned that the growth of revenue receipts that showed a decreasing trend from 2011-2012 dropped to a five-year low of 5.38% during 2015-16. The poor growth rate of the States tax revenue and grants-in-aid were cited as reasons. The growth rate of own tax revenue of the state, which was 24.56% in 2011-2012, had declined to just 2.31% in 2015-2016.Of the total expenditure of Rs 1,62,319 crore during 2015-16, revenue expenditure Rs 1,40,993 crore accounted for 86.86%. Out of the expenditure, 74.06% (Rs 1,04,415 crore) was incurred on the non-plan component. The committed expenditure Rs 83,817 crore stood at 64.58% of the total revenue receipts Rs 1,29,008 crore of the State during 2015-16, as against 61.54% during 2014-15. The capital expenditure of Rs 18,995 crore during the current year increased by Rs 1,192 crore (6.7%) over the previous year.Another concern highlighted in the audit was the increase in the outstanding fiscal liabilities from Rs 1,91,847 crore during 2014-15 to Rs 2,23,030 crore during 2015-16.The State could, however, contain the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GSDP to 2.69% during 2015-16, which was within the target of 3% of GSDP as envisaged under the TN Fiscal Responsibility Act, projections made in Medium Term Fiscal Policy and Fourteenth Finance Commission target.Public sector losses grow to D8,000 crore, driven by TANGEDCO & STUsEven as they registered all-time record in revenue, the State-run Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) in Tamil Nadu, especially the power and transport utilities, are continuing to pile on losses, revealed report by Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) that was tabled in the Assembly on Wednesday. Although the State PSUs had an all time record turnover of D99,850.38 crore for the year ended March 31, 2016, the losses, too, have kept on increasing.They have posted an accumulated loss of D80,925.82 crore, the report said. This figure stood at D59,636.87 crore in 2011-12, steadily rising during the subsequent years. In total, there were 68 working PSUs and 6 non-working companies, which employed 2.91 lakh employees in total. Giving out specific details, the audit has found while 41 PSUs earned a profit of D811.27 crore, it was dwarfed by the D15,684.69 crore loss recorded by 21 companies. In particular, heavy losses were incurred by Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (D12,756.59 crore).D1,095 Cr loss in Co-operative sugar millsHigh cost of production coupled with interest burden has led to a lossof D1,095 crore during 2013-14 to 2015-16 for the Co-operative SugarMills (CSM) leaving them financially weak, according to the report of the CAG of India on Economic Sector (for the year ended on March 2016). Tamil Nadu is the fourth largest sugar producing State in the country with an annual sugar production of 13.08 lakh metric tonnes during 2015-16 crushing season.There are 43 sugar mills in the state of which only 16 are registered as CSMs. A loss of over D1,000 crore was recorded in only these 16 mills which contribute to 21% of total sugar production. The status of the rest remains unknown. The interest burden of the CSMs over three years rocketed to a D963 crore on borrowings making them financially weak. The report attributed the loss to, The measures recommended for attaining financial self-sustainability were not effectively implemented... including utilisation of over aged cane for crushing, non-adherence to prescribed norms.City police faces shortage of vehicles & communication equipmentIf you dial 100 and seek police assistance, immediate help is likely to be delayed as most of the police stations across the state dont have four-wheelers or two-wheelers, according to a report by Comptroller and Auditor General. The modernisation of the TN Police Force has taken a hit due to the shortage of vehicles and communication equipment.Quoting a report by Bureau of Police Research and Development, the CAG report said that mobility could be achieved only when a well-equipped police force has the ability to move the entire force at once, hence, every police station should be equipped with two four-wheelers and three two-wheelers. According to the report, 194 of 487 stations in the 10 test-checked districts do not have four-wheelers and 227 police stations do not have two-wheelers.Expenditure of F13.37 croreDelay over printing, storage and disposal of samacheer kalvi textbooks has resulted in an avoidable expenditure of Rs 13.37 crore, noted the CAG report on general and social sector released on Wednesday. In 2011, the government led by late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa dropped Samacheer Kalvi (Uniform System of School Education) brought in by the DMK regime, alleging it of being substandard and promoting DMKs agenda.Report makes a case for delivery of citizen servicesHigh-security number plate registrationIt emphasised the need for the implementation of the High Security Registration Number Plates (HSRP) to secure owners against theft of vehicles. The amended CMV Rules in 2001 made it mandatory to fix HSRP plates for newly registered vehicles and existing vehicles.Testing tracksThe report went on to state that the State Transport Authoritys website said 69,059 accidents took place in 2015 of which 94% were due to the fault of drivers. Hence, the CAG recommended that the Government put in place adequate testing tracks to ensure conducting of quality driving license tests by the Department.Accident victim fundsIt said the State Transport Corporation had a liability of D435.07 crore as compensation to accident victims as on March 2015. Of this, D207.72 crore was accepted by them. However, the report stated at the end of March 2016, corpus of D59.10 crore alone was available. As a result of this insufficient corpus, there was a delay in settling claims of accident victims. The CAG suggested that the Government may initiate action to increase the corpus fund every year to meet claim of accident compensation awarded to victims.AutorickshawsIt spoke of two important points. It said steps need to be taken without further delay for the conversion of petrol driven autos into LPG ones. It said failure of the department to initiate necessary action and failure of ELCOT to finalise the tender for procurement of GPS meters for autos in Chennai metro area.Hand-held devicesThe lack of hand held devices for field staff of the Transport Department was pointed out. These devices would improve the efficiency of the enforcement work and revenue collection and would reduce the waiting time of the public in obtaining driving licenses, fitness certificates and for registration of new vehicles.Nirbhaya fundsIt said the Nirbhaya Fund set up in September 2013 for safety of women in public places was not being utilised. The report said that according to the Census of 2011, four cities  Chennai, Thiruchirapalli, Madurai and Coimbatore have a population of more than one million and therefore, qualified for utilisation of the funds under the scheme. However, TN had not set up any control rooms for monitoring public transport through GPS devices, nor had funds been sought under the Scheme.Pollution normIt spoke of how during the period of 2010-11 to 2014-15 indicated that Fitness Certificates were given without production of Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC). The report further stated that almost 20% of teh vehicles were issued FC every year without PUCC. Further, the report stated that there are about 188.08 lakh vehicles plying in the STate of which 359.83 lakh PUCCs were issued during 2014-15. However, 12.69 lakh PUCCs alone were issued, which indicated that only 3.5% of the vehicles had fulfilled the requirement of obtaining a PUCC every six months. Thus indicating that 96.5% of the vehicles plying in the State did not adhere to the mandatory provisions of obtaining emission certificates every six months."

It occurs frequently with tight control of blood sugar that is needed to prevent future complications like blindness, kidney failure, and amputation. On the other hand, hypoglycemia causes a lot of inconvenience in day-to-day life and if severe, it can even be fatal.The challenge for parents with Type 1 diabetes children is how to maintain diabetes control and avoid hypoglycemia at the same time.It is important for the parents to have a comprehensive understanding. Hypoglycemia occurs when there is a mismatch between insulin absorbed from the injection site to the glucose available in the body. The glucose level in the blood is affected by the type and quantity of food consumed. Childrens blood glucose targets are often kept slightly higher than adults to take into account their unpredictable eating and exercise.Initially, symptoms of hypoglycemia are mild, but if it is not recognised and treated properly it can lead to coma and seizures. It could lead to significant decline in verbal abilities, memory skills, and ability to organize and recall information. Frequent occurrence of hypoglycemia can also lead to increased worry and poor sleep. As a result, the insulin dose is often reduced and blood glucose is kept high which leads to worsening of subsequent diabetes control.As per Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines 2009 Compendiumpublished in International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, studies have shown an association between hypoglycemia and decrease in cognitive functioning in children with Type 1 diabetes, particularly those diagnosed before the age of 56 years.Nighttime dipsAnother severe form of hypoglycemia is Nighttime hypoglycemia that occurs when your child is asleep. It is characterized by night sweats, headaches, and nightmares. Night time severe hypoglycemia can lead to lowering of blood potassium level that leads to abnormal heart rhythm and even death. This is thought to be the cause of deaths (while sleeping) among many young Type 1 diabetic with good control over their condition. The key is to inject the right amount of insulin at the right time which matches with the food and activity to ensure that your child maintains a healthy blood glucose level throughout the night.Though you cannot prevent hypoglycemia, you can prepare yourself and your child to take simple measures mentioned below:Children with diabetes should learn to test blood glucose and recognize the symptoms for treatment.They must always carry an immediate source of glucose or sugar.In case of hypoglycemia at home, immediately dissolve 4 teaspoonful of sugar in juice or water and let your child drink it. Do not force it if they are unconscious as there will be a risk of chokingIn the event that your child loses consciousness from severe hypoglycemia, call for emergency help and give your child an injection of glucagon. Do not inject insulin. Glucagon is a hormone that triggers the rapid release of sugar into the blood.After the child comes round make sure they eat carbohydrate like biscuit, bread, roti so that their blood sugar level is maintained.The author is Dr Satyan Rajbhandari, group medical director at Diabetacare"

(REUTERS)Ferrara Candy Co, the owner of candies such as Lemonheads and Now & Later chews, is preparing to participate in the auction for Swiss food group Nestle SA's U.S. candy business, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.A potential deal would add chocolate brands such as Butterfinger and Baby Ruth to Ferrara's array of gum and soft-candy offerings.Nestle said in June it would explore strategic options, including a possible sale, for its U.S. candy business, whose brands also include Nips, SweeTarts and Raisinets. Analysts at Jefferies peg its value at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.Nestle, the world's largest packaged foods maker, has been acting to shed underperforming businesses. U.S. activist shareholder Third Point LLC, which has a $3.5 billion stake in the company, is pressuring Nestle to boost returns as demand for its products weakens.The business for sale has annual sales of 900 million Swiss francs ($923 million). It is the No. 4 player in the U.S chocolate and candy industry market, behind Hershey Co, Mars Inc and Lindt, according to Bernstein Research.Ferrara and its private equity owner, L Catterton, declined to comment. Nestle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois-based Ferrara's origins date back to 1908 when Salvatore Ferrara started selling Italian pastries and sugar-coated candy almonds. It was sold to private equity firm L Catterton in 2012, after the founder's son, Nello Ferrara, died.Under L Catterton's ownership, Ferrara merged with another of the buyout firm's portfolio companies, Farley's & Sathers Candy Company, owner of sugar-coated jelly brand Chuckles and other candies.Ferrara had explored a sale earlier this year that it hoped would value it at more than $1.3 billion, but terminated the sale process after disagreements over price.The U.S. sweets industry has become more challenging as consumers shift their preferences to healthier items. Still, many consumers who eat sweets increasingly prefer chocolate to sugar candies.Scale has also become increasingly important to the industry, as candy owners look for cost efficiencies and heft in negotiating retail placement and distribution. Drive for scale has driven deal-making, such as Lindt's 2014 acquisition of chocolate company Russell Stover Candies Inc for $1.7 billion."

No, it’s time to worry",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jul/23/eat-drink--be-merry-no-its-time-to-worry-1632299.html,2017-07-23,"CHENNAI: Cigarette smoking is injurious to health but so is the sweetened soft drink, processed foods like noodles and chips with loads of salt and fried snacks that are part of any normal evening. Over the years, the harmful effects of consuming tobacco in any form have become clear to the masses and there has been a fall in the number of people taking up smoking. However, there is an alarming lack of awareness about the effects of fat, sugar and salt on the body, or the addiction that they lead to.We thus have parents who are mortally scared of their children getting addicted to smoking due to peer pressure, but do not hesitate before putting on an extra spoonful of chocolate spread on their toasts; buying them another bottle of cola or its supposedly healthier alternative, packaged fruit juice; or packing noodles and chips for lunch. This high intake of fat, sugar and salt  FSS, as the deliciously deadly trio is commonly referred to  has a significant long-term impact on public health, but there has not yet been any study or survey conducted on the Indian population in this regard.There are, however, enough indicators that reveal worrying details. According to the World Health Organisation, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are estimated to account for 60% of total deaths across all age groups in India. Now, the country has one of the largest number of people with diabetes, figures that shot up from 11.9 million persons in 1980 to 64.5 million in 2015 (study by Lancet released in 2016). Experts say the excess intake of fat, sugar and salt are the main causes for the rising incidence of NCDs like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension  these three alone cause an alarming 40% of deaths in India. Much of these are preventable. For instance, the WHO says that as many as 1.7 million deaths worldwide could be prevented every single year if salt consumption is reduced to the recommended level of fewer than 5 grammes a day.From a health perspective, salt, doctors say, is a needless ingredient, as sodium is present in almost everything that we eat. From vegetables to meat and fish, sodium is there in everything we eat. We may add a little for enhancing flavour but most people add a lot more than required. For instance, salt is added while cooking rice in Tamil Nadu, said Dr Milly Mathew, senior consultant nephrologist, Madras Medical Mission Hospital. This extra sodium can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, stroke, diabetes and many other complications, she said. Diet plays a major role in preventing NCDs, added Dr Mathew.This excess is at its worst when it comes to processed food. In most cases in the West, says WHO, the excess quantity of sodium comes from salt in processed food. This could be true in the case of most in urban India as well. A few food items that Express checked left little for doubt. The smallest packet of instant noodles has 1.424g of sodium. That is about 60% or a third of the daily allowance from just one tiny, 79g packet of noodles that can be termed single-serving only. Similarly, a 100gm pack of potato chips has 0.742g of sodium, while it is 0.946g in the case of another popular potato based snack, aloo bhujia.Processed food, savouries, pappad, pickles, nuts, pizza and other bakery foods are also packed with a high content of sodium, said Meenakshi Bajaj, head dietician at Government Multi Super-Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate, Chennai, pointing out how most people end up consuming much more than a days allowance of sodium by eating these foods.The WHO strongly recommends that sodium intake should not exceed 2g (equivalent to 5g of salt a day). Remember that this quantity is for an adult; it is correspondingly less for children based on energy requirement. That is where a small pack of noodles pumps enough sodium into your child, making even the natural sodium in regular food excess. Put another way, this is the equivalent of nicotine tar inside the lungs but without the dark and sticky poisons repulsiveness.Equally dangerous is sugar. There are no studies here to prove that high consumption of sugar has a direct effect on diabetes. However, sugar, both in the form of plain sugar and mixed in food, is harmful to those in pre-diabetic stage and children, said Dr V Mohan, director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. The normal diet  vegetables, fruits, milk, and carbohydrates in chapati, rice etc  have the necessary amount of sugar required for the body. Anything above that could be excess, more so in the case of aerated drinks.One cup of coffee or tea will not harm anyone, but consuming soft drinks that are loaded with sugar is dangerous. A 330ml drink of the popular cola contains 33g of sugar. This is one of the leading causes of obesity in children, added Dr Mohan, who is also the chairman of Dr Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre in Chennai.This is particularly significant in Tamil Nadu where the incidence of diabetes is alarming. In the State, 10% of adults in the rural population are diabetic. It is higher  15%  in urban areas excluding Chennai. In Chennai, 25% of adults above the age of 20 years are diabetic, and about 40% of diabetics are under 50 years old, said Dr Mohan, adding that the number of pre-diabetic persons would be double these numbers.The prescribed limit as per the basic calculation is that a person should consume about 30 calories for each kg of body weight, explained Dr K Kannan, president, Chennai Chapter Cardiology Society of India. A teaspoon of sugar is about 5g, which would give you 20 calories.It thus is no wonder that the bottles of cola that you drink are firmly deposited around the belly, leading to obesity, diabetes and heart diseases before long. Among the FSS trio, fat is an exceptional one as recent research has shown. There have been studies about the dangers of fat, and there is also better awareness when compared to sugar and salt. But what research has proven now goes beyond this layman understanding.When researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle added sugar to different types of dairy products ranging from skimmed to heavy cream mixed with safflower oil, the test subjects preferred the skimmed one the least. It had little or no fat. When mixed in the right measure with sugar and/or salt, fat becomes the X factor that takes the combination to the next level, the bliss point, the palate version of hitting the spot. It also creates an effect similar to any narcotic addiction.Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country. While there is a ban on advertising tobacco and liquor, there is no such restriction on advertising these FSS-rich foods that primarily target children.There is enough anecdotal information as well as direct conjunctures that raise concerns. But in the absence of scientific data, a policy decision cannot be taken, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).We in India lack good data on the dietary pattern of consumption of fat, salt and sugar, and there is no data available on trans-fat consumption or its level in the blood. This is really a risk, she added. The council is moving towards surveying the dietary pattern of the population for a better understanding of the effect of FSS. That would be the starting point.Death by fats Death by fats Death by fats Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country.

Partha Paul On way to Kupup. Partha PaulJust over 60 km east of Gangtok and 13,025 feet above sea level, lies the hamlet of Kupup. With a population of about 550, Kupup stands close to the trijunction, tucked in between the mountains of the eastern Himalayas where India, China and Bhutan meet.South of Kupup lies the popular Elephant Lake, its tail pointing towards the village and its tapering trunk towards the Dolam plateau, barely 5 km in a straight line on the other side of the rain-drenched hills. Located near Nathula at 14,400 feet, this 89 sq-km pasture land, to which Bhutanese shepherds take their yaks for grazing, has been at the centre of a standoff between Indian and Chinese troops for more than a month now.But for the people of Kupup, a 1.5 sq-km patch, the India-China tension is not of paramount importance, its the Gorkhaland agitation and the frequent landslides thats disrupting their lives. As for China, they say, its business as usual. We go to Rinchengang, 9 km ahead of Nathula in Tibet, where we trade with the Chinese. The market is open from Monday to Thursday, from 10 am to 4 pm. We are still going. The trading hasnt stopped, says Chunzey Bhutia, 38, who owns and runs a small shop with her brother, a registered trader permitted to trade with the Chinese.While Bhutias family lives in Gangtok to ensure a good education for her children ? the only government school in Kupup shut in 2005 without enough students ? she travels to Sikkims capital every month, ferrying Chinese goods. Her shop stores stacks of Chinese blankets, shoes, umbrellas, jackets and other goods. The blankets are the most popular, says Bhutia.Kupup residents say this informal trade between India and China operates for seven months every year ? between May and November, when heavy snowfall brings the shutters down. There are five families who trade with the Chinese. Most others in the village work as labourers with the Border Roads Organisation. The road to Kupup is being widened. The roads are constantly getting either repaired or widened, says a resident.In this cluster of far-flung villages ? Kupup, Gnangthang, Lungthung, Zuluk ? road construction and repair is the main source of employment. With heavy rains and soft soil, landslides are common, and a road worker makes Rs 440 a day for an eight-hour shift. These days, the shortest route to Kupup from Gangtok via Changu lake is closed as a part of the highway has caved in after a landslide. Its the longer route that remains open.A stones throw from Bhutias shop is another, run by Dola Sherpa. Sherpa, 51, says the landslides have slowed trade, with less goods coming from Gangtok. Most of the traders belong to Gangtok, and its not easy to get here now, he says.It is also difficult to make phone calls. The government recently set up a cell phone tower here, but its restricted. Only 30 people can make calls, and they belong to the Army. We cant. We get reception intermittently, says Sherpa Business has been hit, he says, not by the border tension with China but the Gorkhaland agitation in Darjeeling that has shut down the region for over a month. The tourists have stopped coming. The shops clientele now mostly comprises Army jawans, says Sherpa.However, despite the claims in Kupup that trade between the two countries continues unabated, the general secretary of the Indo-China Border Trade Association Rajesh Rai says the Chinese have halted business in the last two weeks. They (the Chinese) told us its because their road drainage system, he says.There are 1,000 registered Indians who trade with China. But in reality, there are around 250 active traders. These traders mostly belong to Gangtok, and a handful to the surrounding villages here. We have a border haat (market) at Sherathang on the Indian side where Chinese traders come the Indian traders go to Rinchengang in Tibet. The Chinese goods are taken to Gangtok, our goods are taken to Lhasa, he says.We dont want the trade to be formalised as most of the traders are small-time, especially from the villages. If big players enter, these people will lose their income, says Rai.The trade occurs in Chinese currency, he says, and the going rate is Rs 9.3 per Yuan. Indias exports to China is more than its imports in this region, with traders selling rice, flour, wheat, Dalda, sugar, biscuits and matches to small-time Chinese businessmen. Rice is the most popular item for the Chinese, so much so that prices have risen steadily, from Rs 900 for 25 kg several years ago to Rs 2,200 now. We dont have any border haats with Bhutan, says Rai.Unlike Indias other international borders, the relationship between people in the villages between India, China and Bhutan is almost unemotional, with little connect. Bhutia says there is no interaction with neighbouring Bhutanese villages, and with the Chinese its one of trade. The language is different. And so is the culture, she says.A 32-km descent from Kupup leads to Zuluk, at 9,400 feet. Here, 51-year-old Gopal Pradhans wife, who died earlier this year, was the gram panchayat head. Pradhans daughter is married to a Bhutanese national. There is a point on the hill from where I can see her in-laws village, says Pradhan.But marriages between Bhutanese and Indian nationals are rare, and virtually none between Indians and Chinese, says Pradhan. With barely 85 homes and a population of 326, tourism is the main source of income at Zuluk, with as many as 32 homestays.People laughed at me when I started (the first homestay in 2008). They couldnt imagine that tourism could be a viable income. There is a high rate of unemployment here, but with these homestays, everyone has a good income, says Pradhan.Like Sherpa, Pradhan says it is the Gorkhaland agitation and not the India-China tension which has hit the village. We havent got any tourists this season. I had to make a number of cancellations. Lets see what happens in October, our next tourist season, he says.This was a part of the Silk Route, till the time Tibet was a separate country. The Silk Route began from Kalimpong and ended in Lhasa. My father would carry kerosene oil, HMT watches, food and spare parts to Lhasa, and bring back silk thread. He would trek for 25 days to get to Lhasa and would be paid 75 paise a day for it, he says.In Kupup, Bhutia points to the hazy outline of a structure on a hilltop in the distance. Its a Chinese watchtower, she says. I keep hearing reports of this so-called tension when I get calls from relatives or friends in GangtokSometimes they get alarmed, as if there are bombs dropping on Kupup. As you can see, there is nothing of the sort here, says Bhutia.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File photo) Maharashtra produces 36 per cent of the countrys sugar stock. (File photo)Well over two years since the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party lost power in Maharashtra, the states sugar barons are still coming to terms with the loss of political patronage for the sugar sector. Known for their political significance during the previous regime, while the major sugar millers with deep-rooted networks in the cooperatives and farms now find themselves isolated from the power centres, they say the sector  with a Rs 50,000 crore annual turnover in the state  is suffering on account of political neglect.Sugar has been a historically important commodity in Maharashtra, given its socio-political relevance. The state produces 36 per cent of the countrys sugar stock, making it the largest producer of the sweetener in the country. India is the second largest producer of sugar in the world and is the largest consumer as well.The sugar sector in Maharashtra, besides its huge annual turnovers, is also a major employment generator in rural areas. Naturally, the position of sugar in the states economics cannot be overstated  any distortion in production gets planners in a tizzy.On paper, the state has 175 cooperative and 72 private erected mills, but the number of mills that actually participate in a season have been fewer. In fact, sugar production in 2016-17 fell considerably, with back to back droughts leading production to fall to only 42 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar as compared to the 84.1 lakh tonnes in the previous season. For the coming season, the state is projected to produce around 70 lt of sugar, still much lower than the 100 lt mark the state reached a few seasons back.Historically, the sugar sector in Maharashtra has always been close to power. Sugar barons  barring a few  have been inclined towards the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party, with the latter holding sway over the sugar-rich western Maharashtra region through a close relationship with the rural elite, this political patronage bringing growth to the region but also pitfalls.In drought-prone parts of western Maharashtra itself where there is plenty of cane cultivation, such as in Solapur, and in large pockets of Marathwada too, sugar cultivation is at the centre of a controversy for the sheer quantum of water needed for these stretches of farmland.What ails the farm sector part-1: Maharashtra farmers angry despite bumper pulse harvest, prices crash on oversupply | Click here to readThe district of Solapur is a classic case of the growth of sugar sector in an otherwise drought-prone area. Annually, the district receives barely 550-650 mm of rain. Yet, the district has 38 installed mills  the most for any district in the state. In its report on Pricing Policy of Sugarcane: 2013-14, the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Pricing (CACP), Ministry of Agriculture, draws some harsh truth about the states cane group. It says for production of 1 kg of sugar, Maharashtra requires 2,068 litres of water whereas Uttar Pradesh requires about 1,044 litres, making the water stress caused by the crop in drought-prone regions a serious problem.Adding to the imbalance is that while barely 20 per cent of Maharashtras farm lands are irrigated, almost 80 per cent of existing irrigation facilities in the state are concentrated in cane-growing areas. This anomaly, for a crop that occupies just about 10 lakh hectares of land, means that one single crop has cornered the major portion of irrigation facilities. Water experts including Indias waterman Rajendra Singh, as well as multiple reports of the CACP, have discussed the option of mandating drip irrigation for cane.Amid the intensifying debate on the inequitable water distribution in favour of sugar, the state has recently made it compulsory for cane growers to install drip irrigation systems. Despite the efforts, until now, only 30 per cent of Maharashtras cane-growing area has come under drip irrigation, with growers complaining of difficulties in raising finance for the project. Subsidies are hard to come by, say farmers.Environmentalist Vishambhar Choudhari points to the water-intensive nature of cane and says a compulsory drip system is a good move. The cane crop doesnt add much in terms of soil nutrients but the fixed returns lure farmers to it, he says. The only way farmers can be weaned away from cane, he says, is to ensure equal and better returns for other crops such as pulses.Simultaneously, the changes in the political landscape have meant sugar barons are no longer assured of a sympathetic ear in the government. For millers, for example, easy access to finance from government institutions has disappeared. Minister of Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, whose family runs three private mills under the Lokmangal banner, has repeatedly talked about the need for millers to spruce up their act. To cite one example, millers have been asking for the last two years for a restructuring of the soft loan extended to them to pay growers from the 2013-14 season, but the government has not accepted their demand. Millers are at present repaying the Rs 3,000 crore extended to them by the state and central government.Shivajirao Nagawade Patil, president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, says the market for the states sugar has shrunk over the last two years. Earlier we used to send sugar to Kolkata but the transport costs have made that uneconomical, he says. Uttar Pradesh, Nagawade Patil says, has captive markets in Rajasthan, Delhi and other states that continue to elude Maharashtras millers. We have been asking for restructuring of loans but the government is yet to respond, he says.Congress MLA and director of Latur-based Manjara Cooperative Sugar Mill Amit Deshmukh cites the state governments refusal to execute a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the mills as another example of official apathy towards the sector. The state government has consistently refused to accept the Rs 6 per unit rate quoted by the millers to sell excess power generated through cogeneration plants. A special committee has been formed to look into the matter now.For growers, cane is almost akin to a salaried crop  assurance of a fair and remunerative price (FRP) by the mills at the end of season is one of the most important reasons that growers opt for it. However, rising production costs now pose a challenge for growers as well. Prahlad Ingole, a farmer from Ardhapur taluka of Nanded taluka, says that for an acre of cane the costs of inputs come to almost around Rs 50,000 this year. With increasing water stress it is becoming difficult for us to make our ends meet, he says. Overall the situation for the sugar sector, the sweetness appears to be missing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Archive) Cotton remains the most popular choice for farmers in Vidarbha, Marathwada and parts of middle Maharashtra. (Express Archive)IN April 2010, raw cotton prices had zoomed close to Rs 7,000 per quintal, its highest peak till date. As a result, the cotton area in Maharashtra saw a record jump from 33.91 lakh hectare in 2009-10 to 39.42 lakh hectare in 2010-11. The event bears uncanny similarity to its intercrop arhars story in 2016, when the pulses price skyrocketed to a record over Rs 9,000 per quintal, leading to the area of the crop going up by over three lakh hectare in 2016-17. And it was cotton area that took the hit dropping from 42 to 38 lakh hectare. But with arhar (pigeon pea) prices crashing to less than Rs 4,000 per quintal and cotton prices touching a high of Rs 5,700 per quintal, cotton is set to regain its lost ground in 2017-18. Also, over the past ten years, soybean and cotton crops competed with each other in Maharashtra, with the area being influenced by prices and pests.Despite being seen by some as a problem crop for farmers, cotton, however, remains the most popular choice for farmers in Vidarbha, Marathwada and parts of middle Maharashtra (Khandesh), thanks to the advantages it provides like no other crop does. Its sturdy and withstands harsh weather conditions better than other crops, its non-perishable, farmers can hope to get extra flushes from extended rain spells and, more importantly, prices have generally remained stable if not very remunerative. Moreover, cotton has always had a demanding market in the textile industry and hence was seen as a cash crop by farmers. Clearly, agrarian distress in general and farmers suicides in particular in regions like Vidarbha do not relate to cotton so much as many have reasoned as far as the farmers steadfast choice for the crop goes.Says farmer Dilip Pohane from Hinganghat, the biggest cotton mandi in the state, in Wardha district, I had stopped sowing cotton for past three years due to lopsided cost benefit ratio and had switched over to arhar. But since arhar prices have crashed, I am switching back to cotton this time. And if you take a look at the entire stretch of 50 km from Hinganghat to Wadki, you will find 75 pc of farmers have gone for cotton since it fetched up to Rs 5,700 per quintal last year. Pohane agrees that cotton provides advantages even if its not hugely profitable. In situations like the one created by arhar, cotton is the only viable option, he says.

Click hereAccording to government statistics, cotton sowing in the state is complete up to 93 pc of the average area till July 21, which is already 108 pc of last years sown area. Arhar sowing, meanwhile, has fallen 13 pc. The rise in acreage could impact prices, some feel. According to cotton trader Pankaj Kochar from Hinganghat, there has been 40 pc increase in cotton area in the Hinganghat belt. With the kind of rain at this juncture, production will go up by 1.5 times and is likely to suppress the prices this time round, he says.But Keshav Kranthi, former Director of Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) and now with Washingtons International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC), says many countries have seen a drop in area under cotton. And with China also likely to import this time, the prices are expected to remain at the same level as last year, he says.MSP and cotton prices in Maharashtra MSP and cotton prices in MaharashtraSome activists have also blamed the advent of genetically modified Bt cotton as an aggravating event in farm distress. But increase in area, production and productivity in cotton over the years do not bear it out. Even going by the farmers suicide numbers over the past ten years, Bt cotton is difficult to blame for distress. What most have missed is a very substantial drop in suicide numbers from 1449 in 2006 to 805 in 2013 in the six main cotton growing districts of Vidarbha viz Wardha, Amravati, Akola, Buldana, Washim and Yavatmal. These are known as the most suicide-prone districts in not only Vidarbha but also anywhere in the country. Interestingly, Yavatmal, that had registered the maximum 360 suicides in 2006, recorded 231 suicides in 2013. Coincidentally, this was the period when Bt cotton picked up in a big way to cover over 95 pc of the cotton area in the state. The area under cotton also rose from 31.07 lakh hectares in 2006 to 42.07 lakh hectares in 2016, averaging an increase of more than one lakh hectare per year.The productivity levels have also gone up from 253 kg lint per hectare in 2006-07 to maximum of 361 kg lint per hectare in 2013-14. The average market price has also risen from Rs 1,955 in 2006-07 to Rs 4,751 in 2015-16. Read: What ails the farm sector part-2: Politics brings bitter turn for sugar barons, drip irrigation for cane still to catch up. Click hereThe problem for Maharashtras 20 lakh cotton farmers, however, has been low productivity. In states like Gujarat, the yields are more than double that of Maharashtra. The difference between cost of production and average market price has always been very small. In 2006-07, according to statistics provided by Kranthi of the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC), the cost of production in 2006 was Rs 2,052 per quintal against the average market price of Rs 1,955 and the minimum support price (MSP) provided by the government Rs 1,990.Incidentally, the MSP factor was virtually rendered ineffective since 2005 when the state government virtually ended the Monopoly Cotton Procurement Scheme (MCPS), where it would buy the entire cotton produce of state farmers by paying a bonus amount above the MSP. The scheme, launched for thirty years in 1973, ran on extensions for two years till 2005 with no further extension being granted due to over Rs 8,000 crore losses piling up and continued default on payment of bonus. Since then, the open market prices have mostly been above the MSP, barring 2008, when then Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar hiked the MSP by a huge 42 pc from Rs 2030 to Rs 3000. The market didnt respond to the government move and kept their offers low, forcing the state government to buy about 70 pc of the produce. But except for 2008-09, farmers have been selling their cotton in the open market.Low productivity itself is because about 90 pc of the states cotton area is non-irrigated and about one-third of the state area is in Vidarbha (about 15 lakh hectares), where irrigation is a far cry. Of late, in the Khandesh region, the yields have gone up handsomely, attributed to use of drip irrigation.Though productivity has increased after the advent of Bt cotton, it has kind of plateaued over the past ten years. Resurgence of sap sucking insects and emergence of Bt-resistant pink bollworms. Sap sucking insect pests such as jassids, mealy bugs, mirid bugs, thrips and whiteflies, which are not controlled by Bt-cotton, increased over the past ten years and caused serious damage despite heavy use of insecticides, says Kranthi. Pink bollworms, which can feed only on developing cotton seeds and almost nothing else, developed high levels of resistance to Bt-cotton. More than a thousand private Bt-cotton hybrids were released during the five year period after 2006. Majority of these were very susceptible to the sap sucking pests thereby leading to the problem of sucking pests. Non sowing of refuge crop surrounding Bt, as prescribed in the Bt technique coupled with extending the crop by a few months, led to rapid development of pink bollworm resistance to Bt-cotton only in India and nowhere else in the world, he adds. Whiteflies in Punjab and Pink Bollworm in Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh had hit national headlines last year. Whitefly had blown up into an election issue in Punjab.Successive governments have rhetorically pushed cotton to cloth slogan doing virtually nothing on the ground to turn it into a reality. A value chain beginning with cotton and ending in cloth has kept hanging fire with no textile units coming up in and around cotton growing areas.Tomorrow: Resolving Maharashtras Irrigation crisisFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

There are also several loopholes in the cross-LoC system that needs to be taken care of to ensure that no illegal activities take place through the cross-LoC trade.We had demanded installation of full body scanner at the trade facilitation centre to prevent drugs smuggling via cross-LoC trade. We had taken up this issue with State government and Union home ministry but to no avail. The full body scanner has not been installed yet, he said.Turki said the government should form a committee comprising representatives of cross-LoC traders to work out fool proof mechanism for the trade between two parts of Kashmir. We will give our suggestions to the committee for smooth conduct of cross-LoC trade.He said the government has to take the initiative and traders will support whatever measures are taken by the authorities for smooth conduct of the cross-LoC trade."

It is clear that he (Rana Gurjit) has vital stakes in Rana Sugars Ltd, so much so that even during the financial year 2016-17, the said company received payments of over Rs 46-crore from PSPCL.

The forest department has sought Rs 10-lakh bailout to finance the ongoing search that was ordered to avoid any tiger attack on villagers.Such attacks have already killed 15 people in a year, drawing sharp criticism from locals.Three teams of the forest reserve with two elephants and back-up teams are camping near Tandola village of Kotwali area of Pilibhit in search of a tiger, which was spotted by villagers at least five times last week.Though officials claim that the tiger is still in sugarcane fields outside the PTR, they have run out of cash to carry on their search.Most part of the funds goes to the farmers as compensation whose crop is ruined by the elephants during the search. This, coupled with other minor costs, makes the search economically demanding, said Kailash Prakash, divisional forest officer, PTR. We have asked for the money to bear all these costs, he added.The PTR has to pay Rs 2.9 lakh as compensation to 16 farmers whose crop was destroyed. An equal amount is to be paid as other expenses.I have written to seniors in the forest department and asked them to ensure availability of funds at the earliest, said the DFO.While forest officials are searching for the tiger, which they intend to relocate to another part of the forest, villagers have been asked to avoid visiting their farms.We have not visited ours fields since last Tuesday when the tiger was seen. The forest officials are not allowing us to go there, said Mulak Chand Verma, a farmer of the village."

At her flat in Santacruz (West), the number of theplas  a spicy Indian flatbread  vastly outnumber the number of people sorting through them on Wednesday evening. There are 3,371 packets, each containing 25 theplas, to be sent to Gujarats flood-hit Banaskantha district. And only 25 people.Still, they make quick work of the task, scrutinising packets they collected from residents of 41 localities across the city between 8am and 5pm that day. Theplas that are stale, undercooked or too oily will be set aside. The rest will be packed in cartons and sent to Ahmedabad via tempo, where the district collector and her team will distribute them, assisted by the National Disaster Response Force and the Border Security Force on Thursday evening.Response was overwhelming Food Army members expected 30,000 theplas to be donated on Wednesday. They got 54,250 more.As many as 41 centres were set up for the drive, including eight in south Mumbai and 22 in the western suburbs.The response was overwhelming. We set aside just one of 3,371 packets as the theplas were burnt, said Rintu Rathod, founder.The group also received 65 gunny bags of clothes, 130kg sugar and 30kg jaggery.Ive been a donor since the beginning. I had sent a packet to the collection centre at Santacruz (West) and was happy to hear that the turnout was good, said Renu Raniwala, who works for a manufacturing firm.The practised ease with which the group works tells you that this is not the first time they have undertaken such a mammoth challenge. In 2014, they got Mumbaiites to donate 35,000 theplas, which were sent to flood-hit Kashmir residents.I read about the floods and decided to do something to help those who were suffering. I realised that whenever there is a calamity, the Indian army is the first to reach the spot. However, army members usually distribute biscuits and other dry items. I wanted Kashmir residents to enjoy a hot meal instead, said Rathod.She texted 10 of her friends, asking them to contribute 25 freshly made theplas each. Why theplas? Its a nod to Rathods Gujarati roots.Her friends, in turn, forwarded the text to everyone in their phones contact lists, and soon the original message  which included a step-by-step recipe  went viral. With the help of her friend, who runs an NGO in Kashmir, Rathod ensured that few locals went hungry that night.The success of this mission encouraged the group to undertake several more. During the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the group sourced a staggering 1 lakh theplas, which they vaccum-packed to ensure a longer shelf life. In December that year, they sent 30,000 theplas to Chennai residents affected by the floods. Both times, they roped in NGOs to help them with distribution.When we started out, we planned to transport the theplas via flight and even offered to pay airline officials for the excess baggage. However, they were touched and told us this was the first time they had heard of such an initiative. They have been transporting our theplas for free since then, said Rathod.Theplas loaded onto the tempo, which started for Ahmedabad on Wednesday night. (HT Photo)Now, the group has 1,000 members across the city. New ones sign up daily, many of whom were among Wednesdays donors. There were several familiar faces at the collection centre in Ghatkopar. We collected around 3,200 theplas, 10 bags of clothes, one bag of toys and one of shoes, said electrical engineer Yogesh Zaveri, who has been a member of the group since its inception.Homemaker Neetu Singh, in charge of the collection centre at Bandra (West), said the turnout there was lower, which she attributes to a lack of awareness. We usually send out mass text messages, listing the collection centres and their addresses, two to three days before the drive. However, this time, we sent the texts a day before. Still, I estimate that I collected around 600 theplas and two boxes of clothes, she said.By the time you read this, the cartons will be well on their way to Banaskantha and thousands will be comforted by Rathods good home-cooked meals once more."

Thomas Isaac has convened a meeting of hoteliers on Wednesday to apprise them of the benefits of the new system. The prices of about 85% items being sold in the State such as cooking oil, tea, sugar, chicken, toothpaste, soap, bottled drinking water, cotton textiles, air-conditioners, refrigerators, and so on are bound to come down following the migration to the new system. Even the cost of insulin drugs has come down by 1%.But a section of traders and hoteliers obstinately jack up the prices and refuse to extend the relief they enjoy to the public. It is in this context that the government has decided to crack down on erring traders and eateries.Finance Department sources told The Hindu here that the exorbitant rates being levied under various premises after the introduction of GST were unjustified. Traders would get input tax credit and it should reach the customers as well.Hoteliers claimHoteliers claim that the expenses incurred on labour and other components have not come down and they are not entitled to relief on all goods used for preparing food. The government refuses to buy the argument and says that though labour and such other components may not have come down, the traders are due to get input tax credit for a number of products, including sugar, atta, maida, tea, cooking oil, chicken, water, LPG, rent, and even advertisement and hence could definitely slash the prices. Dr. Isaac would flag the issue at the meeting on Wednesday.InspectionsThe Legal Metrology Department too had started inspecting shops at random to find out whether retail prices had been scaled up on any ground, sources said. Despite Kerala arguing for enforcing the anti-profiteering clause, the Centre has not allegedly acted on the demand. Dr. Isaac had taken up the issue at the GST Council and had also written to the Union Finance Ministry to enforce the anti-profiteering clause. Now, it was for the Centre to act, sources said."

The Deputy commissioner of Income Tax (Benami Prohibition) Unit I, Dependra Kumar in Mumbai had on June 20 issued an order of provisional attachment as well a show cause notice on the properties.A copy of the order seen by TOI stated that investigations by Enforcement Directorate had revealed that the ""Bhujbals and their associates had acquired the immovable properties by investing his ill-gotten money through a web of shell companies based out of Kolkata, Mumbai and other locations.'' ED had earlier filed a complaint against Bhujal, his son, nephew and 30 others including and Parvesh Construction pvt ltd and their associates under Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The IT notice found that Armstrong Infrastructure Ltd as the benamidar which owned the Malegaon sugar factory worth about Rs 80 crore. The Parvesh Construction Pvt Ltd has been identified as benamidar of Solitaire Building in Santacruz West, Mumbai worth about Rs 11.30 crore. The same shell company also owned Habib Manor & Fatima Manzil in Bandra West estimated to be worth about Rs 43 crore. The Devisha Infrastructure Pvt Ltd owned land at Rohinjan village in kharghar worth about Rs 87.60 crore.Bhujbal's advocate Sajal Yadav said, ""ED had already attached all the four properties and there is a stay by PMLA tribunal in Delhi on the Solitaire attachment.

These kitchens are run on donations from devotees.Badal said SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar had already made a representation on the issue, and the same could be examined.Based on representations from the UP government, the GST council had exempted puja samagri.Similarly, intense lobbying by industry led to lower tax on agarbattis. The council has, however, refrained from exempting several institutions despite demands."

The panel is expected to submit its report in a month.As first reported by TOI, Lokayukta Justice (retd) N K Agarwal recommended criminal action against Faridabad DC Sameer Pal Srow, MD, Haryana Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills Mohammad Shayin, Kurukshetra DC Sumedha Kataria and director, women and child development department Renu Phulia.Rather than registering an FIR against four IAS officers and investigating the matter as per the recommendations of the Lokayukta, the state government has chosen to constitute a committee. In the 45-page judgment, the Lokayukta raised questions on chief secretary D S Dhesi's way of handling the matter and said, ""Even after receipt of notice from the office of this Authority, the chief secretary only proposed to call for explanations of the aforementioned officials and no appropriate enquiry was initiated against them.""After receipt of the detailed vigilance inquiry report dated November 16, 2012, the state government did not take action against the officers. The lokayukta stated in the judgment, ""It is only on 21.01.2015 that action against the (nine) forest officials in terms of the aforesaid enquiry report was proposed by the chief secretary, which was immediately approved by the present chief minister (Manohar Lal Khattar). However, that matter of IAS/HCS officials named in the report was not considered till the receipt of the notice from the officer of this authority (lokayukta).""Srow and Shayin were deputy commissioners of Ambala while Kataria and Phulia were additional deputy commissioners during the scam period.

They have further observed that the soil in many mandals in the district are deficient in these two minerals and noted that for long farmers have been oblivious to the fact that both their crop as well as their yields have suffered due to the lack of these two minerals.Assistant professor M Bharata Lakshmi of NG Ranga Agriculture University, said, ""Many farmers refuse to understand the importance of zinc and sulphur as soil and crop enrichers. They do not know that these two minerals help the planted crop respond to fertiliser application by not only becoming pest resistant but also by growing in a healthy way and finally resulting in the increase of yield by 30%.""Regarding the requirement per hectare, Prof Lakshmi said on an average 50 kg of zinc-sulphate can be used every year. She noted that such large quantities of the minerals is required to replenish deficient and alkaline soils.However, scientists at the Agriculture Research Station (ARS) in Anakapalli as well as officials of the district agriculture department have pointed out that things are looking up now, especially after the sample survey was conducted following which the department itself is providing farmers with the micro-nutrients at a subsidised cost."

Social entrepreneur Sheela Balaji has been instrumental in bringing heritage rice  almost seven varieties that were regularly consumed till a few decades ago  back into the market. Having set up a 40-acre farm in Manjakkudi, in Tiruvarur district, she grows these ancient grains  each of which comes with its own distinct flavour when cooked, and interesting names and stories related to it. Sheela throws more light on these non-hybrid varieties. ""Annam is so important in our tradition. Starting from when one is just born, to when they give rice kanji to old people, to being used in weddings for blessing the couple, till you die, rice plays an important part in all stages of our life. It is only lately that rice has been getting a bad rap for containing carbs, etc. Fact is, rice is the oldest grain one can remember, and people are still eating rice,"" says Sheela.While there have been numerous varieties, the knowledge surrounding it is less among people. ""Most of them only know about raw, boiled and Basmati rice. Today, most of us consume only polished rice from which all vitamins and nutrients have been washed away, leaving only starch and sugar,"" says Sheela.Food traveller and musician Rakesh Raghunathan, who has been associated with Sheela in this, adds, ""Earlier, they used to treat ailments using food. And rice, has several medicinal properties. There is a popular saying, 'unnave marundhu, marundhe unnavu'. But unfortunately, people have very less knowledge about it."" And the sad part is, he says, ""Most of these speciality rice varieties are not available in your regular mandis.""And this is one of the reasons why Sheela decided to throw more light on the ancient grains. There is illuppai poo champa, kaatuyaanam (a crop that grows eight feet in height, where even an elephant can hide), mappillai champa (a tradition in Tirunelveli , where the newly married groom will be served a meal using this rice), karuppu kavuni (black rice), kalajeera (rice from Orissa), thooyamalli (resembles jasmine buds) and kichili champa (small grain rice).""People have several issues when it comes to food. They can't visualise any other colour apart from white. But karuppu kavuni has so many health benefits. Initially, people were used to eating white bread, but now, they have brown bread. So, I hope there will be a change,"" says Sheela, adding, ""Each of these has varied health benefits. The kind of manure which is being used is natural. I visit the farm every month to see the progress of these crops.""But when there's so much unrest revolving around farmers' issues and Tamil Nadu under a near-drought situation, how does she see the future for such crops?""It's been years since the government checked on the canals and dams. Other states have been upgrading it, but here, there has been a slow growth. Things can be better with regular cleaning and proper use of rain water harvesting. We need a proper political will to sort this issue,"" she notes. Having said that, Sheela avers there won't be a decline in the demand for crops or rice among farmers."

They kept beating me and tore every piece of my cloth. When the beating continued, I had no choice but to run for life. I reached my house without my clothes on, said the 35-year-old woman who was thrashed after being stripped in Hiremasali village of Indi taluk on Monday.Speaking to The Hindu from her bed in the District Government Hospital, the woman said that the family members of Moulali Mundodagi thrashed her and tore her clothes off.The husband of the victim, Dundayya Godyal, said that he was an agriculture worker and he came to know about the incident only at around 10 p.m. when he retuned home.To earn a living, I go to work in the fields every morning and return only at night. At home, I have an ailing and aged mother and my two children go to school, he said.Refuting the allegations that the woman had had an illicit relation with Moulali Mundodagi, the victims elder sister, Shivaleela, who was at the hospital, said that her sister had gone to seek money she had lent Moulali Mundodagi and his family.About five years ago, Moulali Mundodagi borrowed Rs. 30,000 from my sister, and since then, she has been asking for the money to be returned. The family kept refusing. On Monday, when she went to ask for the money again, the family members got angry and thrashed my sister, she said. However, some villagers said that the victim and Moulali Mundodagi were indeed in a relationship and despite warning from the family members, the two continued it.We are investigating from both angles  the monetary and the illegal relationship. However, since a case has been registered against nine persons for outraging the modesty of a woman, we have arrested six, including a local resident who filmed the victim on his mobile phone while she was being stripped, said Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Jain.He said that Sugara, wife of Moulali Mundodagi, and her other relatives Shabana, Farida, Sikandar and Islamil, are among the arrested. Subhash who filmed the incident on his mobile phone is the other arrested person. District in-charge Minister M.B.

He is also a director of Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Private Limited, a sugar mill, where the loan was diverted. The loans were obtained in the names of farmers, who are the sugarcane farmers and the members of the factory.The scam came to light after one of the petitioners approached the UCO Bank in Gangakhed to obtain a crop loan. It was revealed that some loan amount has already been obtained and is outstanding against him, allegedly borrowed from Andhra Bank, Dharmapeth Branch in Nagpur, said the court order. It was further revealed after checking the CIBIL record that crop loan amount has been disbursed through the said sugar factory.It further stated, After conducting further investigation, it was noticed by the petitioners that the loan amount has been disbursed in the name of dead persons through sugar factory by the concerned banks.A total of six banks, including five nationalised banks  Andhra Bank, UCO Bank, United Bank of India, Bank of India, Syndicate Bank  and a private bank, Ratnakar Bank, have disbursed loan amount worth Rs. 328 crore in a similar manner. It was revealed after farmers themselves decide to investigate the matter with the help of local MLA Madhusudan Kendre.It is alleged that in most of the cases, the amount has been borrowed by tendering fictitious, false and fabricated documents to the bank. The concerned agriculturists have not consented nor tendered application forms for disbursement of the loan and that the benefits of crop loan have not been extended to those in whose name the amount is allegedly borrowed and deposited in the account of the factory. The same was highlighted in the internal audit report of the Syndicate Bank, which was obtained by the farmers in the course of investigation.Hearing the case, the division bench of A.M. Dhavale and R.M. Borde has asked the Director-General of Police, Maharashtra to conduct an inquiry by the EOW and has also asked other banks to submit all details regarding the loans.When contacted, Mr. Gutte said that the allegations are politically motivated. Look at the nature of allegations, these are frivolous in nature. But I would not comment on it since the matter is sub-judice, he said."

Each FIG will have 20 members, located in broadly contiguous areas and cultivating the same crop in a season.Without changing the ownership of land, small and marginal farmers of FIGs can consolidate their holdings through agreements. Resources such as cattle and machinery can be combined to start collective cultivation for realising the benefit of-large scale farming.Financial supportInitially, 10,000 FIGs will be formed. Five FIGs will constitute one FPG. Each FPG will include 100 small and marginal farmers. The plan is to establish 2,000 FPGs this year with two lakh farmers. Each FPG will get a sum of Rs. 5 lakh. Ten FPGs, belonging to a contiguous area, will form one farmer-producer organisation (FPO). A sum of Rs. 100 crore has been set apart for the current year. If everything goes well, the government wants to cover 40 lakh farmers in five years.Apart from motivating the farmers to share knowledge on better practices and cost-effective agricultural technologies, the objective of the scheme is to enable improvement in the livelihood of farmers. The financial assistance can be used for different purposes including the purchase of farm implements. The scheme will seek to remove hurdles faced by farmers in accessing credit and markets. The provision of fertilizers will not be covered under this measure, a senior official in the Agriculture department explains.Appreciating the idea behind the scheme, S. Venkatesan of Karmangudi in Cuddalore district, who raises paddy and sugarcane, wants the government to educate farmers properly and give enough time to field officials for implementation. It should not try to carry out the scheme in haste, he said.Referring to the concept of joint liability groups (JLGs) promoted by cooperative bodies about 10 years ago, Mr. Venkatesan says no one in the government talks about the JLGs these days. So, it is for the authorities to instill confidence among the farmers that the new scheme will not be discarded after some years, he adds.Samba lossesMeanwhile, a release of the government stated that crop insurance companies released about Rs. 216 crore more for farmers who lost their Samba crop last year. With the latest tranche, the total amount of compensation will be around Rs. 1,282 crore, benefitting about 4.1 lakh farmers in 25 districts."

From refineries to iron foundries, industrial houses are gearing to do their bit for the environment.For instance, sugar manufacturer EID Parry that has been using air-cooled condensers instead of cooling towers in its factory in Pudukkottai since 2013 has brought down its water consumption by one-fifth. Coca-Cola India, which faced a temporary court gag on drawing water from Tamirabarani river, is working in Cheranmadevi panchayat, Tirunelveli district on water replenishment projects. Startups like Greenvironment are also helping households and industrial houses recycle kitchen/sink water.As refinery systems can reach temperatures as high as 120oC, they use significant quantities of water  about 2.5 gallons  for every gallon of petrol they produce. To optimize use of water, Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd has tied up with Chennai Metro Water for supply of semi-treated sewage water. ""The sewage is further processed and turned into grey water before it is run as a coolant or absorbent in our systems,"" says Gautam Roy, managing director, CPCL.Other industries prefer harvesting rain water. An artificial pond spread across five acres stores nearly 60 million litres of water at the Saint Gobain factory in Sriperumbudur. While the water caters to half of the factory's water requirement, the company is now digging a bigger pond which will store another 80 million litres to take care of its future requirements. ""For us a rain water storage pond is strategic and not an expenditure,"" says B Santhanam, the company's president. The glass maker is targeting to save 210 million litres of water from the plant roof where 80 million litres of water has already been saved.Another industry that has been trying to minimise water consumption are the foundries. The state has more than 1400 iron, steel and aluminum foundries, which normally consume large quantities of water in production of pig iron, cast iron and stainless steel. The average water consumption for a mid-sized foundry that consumes about 5,000kW to 9,000kW of power and produces 2,400TPM-5,000 TPM of iron castings is 640 cubic sq ft to 1,130 cubic sq ft.Earlier, foundries would convert waste slag to granules for dumping at landfills. ""But that technique used huge quantities of water. So we've now started giving our slag to cement makers, who mix it with portland cement to make pozzalano bricks. The slag can be used with ready-to-mix cement or other pozzolanic materials to make durable concrete structures. They can also be used in buildings as bricks or on roads instead of tar,"" says Dr Nityanand Devaraaj, member, Institute of Indian Foundrymen. Accoring to city-based Greenvironment Innovation and Marketing, which works with IT parks, export units, hospitals and large residential complexes, nearly 70%-80% of water at IT parks can be reused. Varun Sridharan, director of Greenvironment says they are trying to bring down the average consumption of water per person at IT parks from 40 litres per person to 20 litres per person by using tech solutions like Internet of Things. ""Our sensors collect data over a month on the quality of water being treated. This helps us maintain the same standard for the quality of reused water,"" says Sridharan.The startup recently bagged a grant from the Karnataka government to test a real time monitoring (RTM) system for the operation and maintenance of fresh and recycled water treatment plants. Greenvironment has also helped hospitals, which utilise 100 litres per person/bed and cut their water usage by 20%-30%. At food processing units, Greenvironment offers 100% recycling and reusing of effluents.Another such startup, ProKlean Technologies, which develops natural, non-toxic and biodegradable products for industrial houses, is currently working with several garment export companies in the Tirupur belt to reduce their water consumption.""We have many formulations  soaking agents, dispersing agents, neutralisers, anti-grease and fixing agents  that reduce water consumption and toxicity of released effluents. Our product for the Tirupur textile industry for instance reduces water consumption by 30%, reduces effluent toxicity by 25%-50% and is 100% bio-degradable,"" says Sivaram Pillai, founder, ProKlean.ProKlean also has similar solutions for the tanning process in the leather industry and effluent treatment  a biogradable process that could avoid incidents like the Bellandur lake, which is currently covered in snow-white toxic foam and catches fire at regular intervals."

Ponraj, president, Thoothukudi District Salt Workers Association, affiliated to the CITU, told The Hindu here on Wednesday.The average annual production of salt in the district was 25 lakh tonnes, most of which went to other countries in the past. Thoothukudi had maintained a constant export market with Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, but of late the exports slowed down, M. Gnanadurai, secretary of the association, said.Many exporters were unwilling to continue in the field owing to high labour levy on port handling charges collected here. To boost the morale of salt exporters, the levy should be reduced, he stressed.S. Petchimuthu, a local salt producer, said before 2000, a zonal scheme was in place to benefit Thoothukudi salt traders, who had an assured market in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Odisha apart from other parts of the State, by curtailing the influx of salt from other places.A.R.A.S. Dhanabalan, secretary, Thoothukudi Small-scale Salt Manufacturers Association, pressed for measures to bolster overseas exports. Currently, 10 lakh tonnes of manufactured salt had accumulated, and to check the trend, traders should focus on exports. But, the higher port handling charge for shipments of salt  higher than in Kandla Port in Gujarat, the largest salt producer in India  was discouraging shippers, he said.Exports are not growing the way they were expected, according to B. Prabakaran John, a Thoothukudi-based exporter.The labour levy for handling one tonne of salt at Thoothukudi port was Rs. 83, whereas the levy for high-value cargo such as cashew nut, sugar and wheat was Rs. 69. Hence, Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP) should bring down the labour levy on port handling charges for salt, keeping in mind the future of salt industry, he said."

Though officials said no deaths had occurred since April, they conceded that delay in having samples tested or in getting results of the samples in a timely manner could have proved costly to patients. According to the data shared by the department, there was a delay in 10 of 15 cases. In one instance, the gap between detection of symptoms, sample collection and the outcome of the test for a patient in Haveri was as long as 20 days.In some cases, if it is a Saturday or Sunday, lab technicians were not available. Results of the samples collected are supposed to be out in a minimum of 24 hours. But in some cases, it took three to four days. We will have to rectify this, said Mahamood Shariff, Research Officer, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. However, hospitals, more so the private ones, have not been taken to task. Instead, surveillance teams have been pulled up and have been instructed to collect the samples early and ensure that the treatment was started soon after.We have also been telling hospitals to take samples of suspected cases immediately because if that is delayed, there will be delay in sample collection, results and treatment. We have also instructed that lab technicians should be present even during weekends if there is a sample test to be done or results to be given, Dr. Shariff added. Apart from this, family members, relatives and caregivers of patients with confirmed cases of H1N1, who run the risk of contracting the disease, should also be treated immediately, at least within 24 hours, if they show symptoms, he said.However, the delay could happen at any stage, said doctors. Sudarshan Ballal, chairman, Manipal Hospitals, said in general, if the hospital gets serious H1N1 cases, treatment is started even before the samples are sent for tests. Based on the result of the test, treatment is continued or discontinued. In extremely mild cases, sometimes no tests are done. Secondly, treatment, for H1N1 in particular, is not be-all, end-all. In a lot of instances, the patients may not realise the seriousness of the situation and end up going to smaller places, later being referred to bigger hospitals, he said. Dr. Ballal also said unavialability of lab technicians was not a problem in major hospitals, as they had 24/7 lab facilities.The good news, however, is that there has been a marked decrease in H1N1 positive cases since April. Health Department officials said it was only in coastal regions such as Mangaluru and Udupi that currently, prevalence has been reported. The peak in temperatures during April is said to have contributed to the dip in number of cases, as chances of the H1N1 virus spreading is higher in temperatures between 15 and 30 degree Celsius.Comorbid conditionsThe H1N1 deaths in 2017 pointed to a major factor: a majority of deaths were of people in the age group of 20 to 55, and many of them suffered from comorbid conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes with high blood sugar levels. This, Dr. Shariff said, was because anyone with low immunity has a greater chance of contracting any disease. We have advised doctors to take more precautions to treat such people by keeping them under supervision and giving treatment immediately, he said."

The farmers sold potatoes for as low as nine paisa per kg in Kurukshetra and were forced to feed tomatoes to their cattle as they did not get the right price, he said.The former CM said both the farmers and the consumers had suffered as the fall in prices of agricultural products had not reflected in the prices of the end-products.He said the prices of wheat, potatoes and tomatoes had nose-dived, but there was no change in the prices of flour, chips and the sauce, adding that the farmer was silent but not dumb."

The standard supplies through PDS earlier included essential commodities such as sugar, oil, red gram, tamarind and kerosene, apart from rice.During the previous Congress regime under N. Kiran Kumar Reddy in the unified State, the bag of rations was raised to include nine commodities, though a few among them were offered at market price. Even after Telangana was formed as separate State, the commodities offered through the PDS at subsidised prices included rice, sugar, kerosene and pulses for about a year. The governments decision to raise the monthly ration of rice to 6 kg per person, and do away with the limit of 20 kg per family, eventually resulted in cutdown on other commodities. With the Central government doing away with levy of rice through Food Corporation of India, and also scrapping the subsidy on sugar, things have worsened for the beneficiaries. For the last three to four months, sugar has been stopped, and kerosene is issued only occasionally.At 2.74 crore, the State has 85 lakh beneficiaries more than specified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), for whom the government is bearing the burden of additional rice subsidy to the tune of Rs. 1,700 crore. Further, while the Central government is allowing subsidy on only 5 kg of rice per person, the State government has been bearing the cost of the extra kilogram, which amounts to Rs. 400 crore. Bogged down by the cost, the State government is reluctant to restore the supply of commodities other than rice, an official source said on condition of anonymity. There has been tremendous pressure on the government to restore the commodities, but Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao is reportedly not willing to budge. The Civil Supplies Dept. too is facing wrath of the public for shedding its responsibility.Suggestions have been reportedly made by various sections for cutback in the quantity of rice supplied, to accommodate other commodities without additional cost, but Mr. Rao is apparently in no mood to dump his pet scheme.Only rice shopAt 2.74 crore, Telangana has 85 lakh beneficiaries more than specified under the National Food Security Act"

5a075dbe9855b76bf13c9a62,Rain time is ghevar time!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/rain-time-is-ghevar-time/article19237989.ece,2017-07-08,"Like Pavlovs dogs, I react instinctively on some matters. When it rains, for instance, I instantly think of ghevar. Now thats a sweet I have often written about. Its eaten mostly in the north in the rainy season. I am greatly fond of it, though I find that not too many share my view on this.So, the moment the sky turned grey a few days ago, I went looking for ghevar. The closest stop was Kaleva, which used to be my favourite sweet-and-savoury eatery at some point of time. I used to be a regular there, but hadnt been to the sweet shop in Gole Market for quite a while. So I decided I would buy my ghevar there, and have a quick lunch of bedmi sabzi (Rs. 62 for a plate with two bedmis) and dahi vada (Rs. 75).This is a great place for a 15-minute lunch if you are in a hurry. Though the place is always crowded, especially at lunch time, food comes in minutes. And you cant linger in any case to contemplate life because Kaleva  unlike similar eateries in places such as Bengali Market  has no seating area; you have to stand at a counter and eat.I enjoyed my bedmi sabzi. The freshly fried bedmis were large and fluffy, and the potato curry it came with was spicy and nicely mashed. What disappointed me was the dahi vada, which I used to love once upon a time. Either my taste buds have changed since then, or their cook has, for I found the vada so hard that I had to leave half of it uneaten.They have the usual lunch menu that you find in north Indian vegetarian fast-food eateries  puri sabzi, chholey bhaturey, chaat, pao bhaji, special thhalis  consisting of dal makhni, shahi paneer, mixed vegetable rice, raita, sweet, salad and pickle  and rice combos (with chholey, sambhar, dal makhni or shahi paneer). There is a small south Indian section, with dosa and vada served with sambar, and you also get the usual vegetable chowmein, hakka noodles and chilli paneer gravy and so on. Their snacks have always been good. You get various kinds of kachoris (khasta, with peas and so on), pakoras, including green chilly ones, and dhoklas.Deliciously crispWhat I really enjoyed was the ghevar, which had just come off the stove. It had a soft malai layer, which added style and substance to the poor old ghevar. Actually, the dish  essentially a mix of ghee, maida and sugar  has to be prepared with great care for the right thickness and its honeycomb-like form. The ghevar that I carried back with me  and it was demolished before I could say rain  was deliciously crisp, despite the humid weather and the malai.Kaleva is essentially known for its sweets. I used to love their fruit kulfis  creamy kulfis frozen in fruits such as mangoes and apples. We were also very fond of a sweet called chak-a-chak  a light, lemon-coloured rasmalai, with tiny rasgullas in it.Despite all these years, Kaleva remains more or less the same (if you forget about the dahi vada). I shall go back for the ghevar the next time it rains. And the sooner, the better."

RMA shall continue to be paid to officers of defence forces posted in peace areas. The cash shall be credited directly into the bank accounts of officers, the gazette notification issued by the government on allowances said.Panel recommendationThe RMA is expected to be notified shortly, sources said. The SPC had recommended that the provision of free rations and the grant of RMA to officers of defence forces posted in peace areas should be withdrawn.However, the government has rationalised that and retained the allowance.The rations consists of various food items like vegetables, fruits, butter, milk and sugar, etc. based on the recommended dietary intake as fixed. This move is expected to reduce the administrative and logistical load on the Army Service Corps and equivalent establishments and help in better manpower optimisation.In the past, military cantonments were far away from cities, so it made sense to have daily ration. But now, most cantonments are in cities. So what is the need for delivering them? This will help better utilise the officers put on this for other duties, an officer said."

At the same time, the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) set up a fully-equipped bakery on the prison premises as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. Through this initiative, the prison department hopes to equip inmates with life skills that will help them when they are released. The Central Prison for Women houses around 200 inmates, both convicts and undertrials. The initial plan was to train them in basket-making and weaving, but these skills were thought to be outdated. Baking, on the other hand, is a lucrative business. It will help the women find employment when they leave, and is part of our rehabilitation programme, said Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) D. Roopa. The first batch of 21 women trainees can now whip up cakes, biscuits, puffs, and a local favourite, the dil pasand (a fresh bread with a sweet stuffing of cherries, dry coconut and sugar). Once more women are trained, there are plans to expand their reach.To begin with, we have asked the help of government authorities such as the office of Superintendent of Police, the Deputy Commissioner, and the zilla panchayat, to buy the products. They have agreed to help us, Ms. Roopa added.This scheme is the first of its kind in Karnataka, after the now-defunct bakery at the central prison in Parappana Agarahara, which began a few years ago and grew to be popular for the baked items it used to sell from an outlet inside the jail.If the Tumakuru prison bakery model is a success, the Karnataka Prisons Department would like to develop bakeries across prisons in the State.Owing to a shortage of funds, the project cannot currently be extended to other prisons. However, the plan could be successful if more companies come forward to help under their CSR commitments, said Ms. Roopa."

Paramanandam, representing the association for idly batter manufacturers, pointed out that there was no clarity on tax slab for idly batter under GST. The list of Harmonised System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes released for GST for a variety of goods does not include idly batter. Hence, we fear that it will come under 18 % slab, which is the standard rate for non-listed items. Such a rate will be high for perishable goods, he said.Pointing out that the business was an emerging sector with the participation of a large number of micro and small scale players, he appealed to Ms. Nirmala Sitharaman to recommend GST Council to provide tax exemption to the product irrespective of whether it was branded or not.N. Pandi, president of Candy and Biscuits Manufacturers and Sellers Association, alleged that the GST Council had put the small-scale candy manufacturers and big brands with turnover of hundreds of crore on the same footing. All of us are asked to pay 18 % tax. We want it to be brought down to 5 % for small scale and cottage industries, he said.Similar concern was raised by S. Anburajan, secretary of Indian Bakers Association, regarding the uniform tax slab fixed for small-scale players as well as top brands manufacturing cakes and biscuits. Top brands have fully automated manufacturing, which give more shelf-life to their produce. Ours is not, he said.Concerns were also raised by entrepreneurs dealing in recycled plastics, gunny bags, incense sticks, pickles, camphor, palmyrah sugar and others about high tax rates. K.R.

No GST is applicable on such food supplied free"".However, some of the items and services required for making prasadam would be subject to GST, including sugar, vegetable edible oils, ghee, butter, service for transportation of these goods and so on.Under the GST regime, it is difficult to prescribe a separate rate of tax for sugar, etc, when it is supplied for a particular purpose. GST, being a multi-stage tax, end use-based exemptions or concessions are difficult to administer. Therefore, GST does not envisage end usebased exemptions, the ministry said. ""It would, therefore, not be desirable to provide end use-based exemption for inputs or input services for making prasadam or food for free distribution by religious institutions,"" the statement added."

Also, most pilgrims in the Indian contingent are senior citizens.A team of Indian doctors studied health complications and mortality rate among Indian pilgrims to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Media in the last three Haj seasons -2014, 2015 and 2016 -and came out with many recommendations to reduce morbidity and mortality in the 2017 Haj season. About 1.5 lakh pilgrims from India perform Haj every year.The research study by experts from the Army College of Medical Sciences and Base Hospital, New Delhi, among other research institutions revealed that the crude mortality rate for Indian pilgrims in Mecca and Medina is about 12 per 10,000.""This is slightly higher when compared with other countries,"" Dr Inam Danish Khan, the corresponding aut hor of the research study , told TOI. The study was published in the latest issue of the Journal of Infection and Public Health (JIPH).The researchers obtained data about Indian pilgrims from the various medical and health camps organised by the Indian government during Haj. Data was also obtained from secondary care and referral hospitals during AugustOctober, 2016.According to the study , diabetic pilgrims from India ""largely presented with pneumonia and cellulitis foot. There was inadequate glycemic control at presentation due to poor medication and precautionary compliance despite prescriptions of insulin and oral antihyperglycemics from India"" Dr Khan suggested that diabetics should carry their medicines, their own glucometer and medical record to avoid complications. ""Diabetics should use protective footwear and avoid exposure to intense sunlight during the Haj. Poor blood sugar control may cause problems related nerves and lungs. Their immunity levels are relatively compromised,"" Dr Khan added."

But rainy season is also the time when there is maximum spurt in bacterial and viral infections  for example, common cold , flu, typhoid, Hepatitis A, dengue and chikungunya among others.Doctors say kids and elderly are most vulnerable. Good personal hygiene and avoiding 'risky' food and water is advised to keep diseases at bay.""Humid weather is conducive for bacterial growth. Vectors are also in abundance. This leads to spread of infections. Simple things like washing hands regularly, eating fresh food and keeping the surroundings clean can help keep us healthy,"" said Dr Anil Arora, gastroenterologist at Sir Ganga Ram hospital.Doctors say elderly and those with weaker immunity should be administered with preventive influenza vaccination to avoid serious consequences of viral illnesses. ""Eating healthy also helps boost immunity and thus reduces risk of infection,"" said a doctor.According to Dr K K Aggarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association, stagnation of water is a common sight during rainy season. ""It is important to clear them to prevent mosquito breeding,"" he said, adding that malaria, dengue and chikungunya pose public health crisis, and are a major cause for morbidity and mortality in the country.Those with pre-existing illnesses like diabetes and cancer need to take extra care, because infections that are self-limiting for others may cause prolonged illnesses and fatality in them due to compromised immunity.In rainy season, high levels of humidity and perspiration can lead of severe dehydration of the fluid intake is not maintained. Diabetics, skin experts say, are prone to foot infections during the rainy season. They should keep their feet dry and sugar control is important.""People who have undergone surgery, those who are on diuretics or prolonged medicines for chronic health condition like renal failure or Tuberculosis are more likely to catch infection,"" said a doctor."

He has been kept in the most secure suite in the entire planet. ""His suite is secured against bomb attacks, chemical attacks, everything,"" said Sheldon Ritz to TOI. Ritz is the director of operations in King David Hotel and has been in charge of the entire PM's visit. ""If the entire hotel is bombed, PM's suite will be untouched, will come down in a pod.""Ritz said they cleared out 110 rooms of the hotel to accommodate Modi and his delegation. ""We have hosted every US president in this century, from Clinton, Bush, Obama and, three weeks ago, Trump. And now we are."" In respect to Modi's ""vegan"" food habits, the hotel made sure the cookies in his suite are eggless and sugarless. Even the flowers are what the Indian delegation wants.Modi's suite has its own kitchen just in case his valet is asked to rustle up something for him at the last minute. ""I believe he is eating Gujarati food,"" Sheldon Ritz said. ""We got a list of food ingredients necessary to cook Indian food for the Prime Minister. The ingredients are all kosher, because in this hotel all food has to be kosher."" They got almost all the stuff except just a few items which were probably not kosher.The kitchens are being ruled by Rina Pushkarna, who is cooking dishes that are suitable for Modi's palate. ""Its all very spicy,"" Ritz said, ""Our hotel has been filled with the aroma of spices these last few days. Wonderful,"" he breathed.Ritz himself has been downing Indian food, remembering his childhood in Durban, where he went to an Indian-run hotel management school. Sheldon Ritz said there is very good reason for the King David hotel suite to be so secure.""Our hotel is part of Dan Hotels, and one of the owners is Michael Federmann, whose company, Elbit Systems makes the drones and the avionics. We are the best,"" he said with evident pride. The first Dan Hotels in India is coming up in Bangalore, though probably not nearly as secure."

A sum of Rs 111 crore has been withdrawn from the fixed deposits for paying salaries to the employees. It reflects a complete collapse of administration at all levels. I urge the governor to dismiss him,'' Munde said.Alarmed by rampant irregularities, particularly in the examination system, Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao had convened a special meeting to take stock of the state of affairs in the Mumbai University . He set July 31 as the deadline to declare the results of all exams. Munde urged chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to probe all the decisions taken by the former chief executive officer of the Slum Redevelopment Authority (SRA), Vishwas Patil. ""A week before his retirement, Patil cleared 450 files. Many files were brought to the SRA office on the day of his retirement on June 30. All decisions taken by Patil and proposals cleared by him should be stayed and a high-level probe should be conducted,'' Munde said.Following a tip-off, acting SRA CEO Milind Mhaiskar, who is also managing director and vice-chairman of Mhada took possession of all the files. Vishwas Patil said that he cleared less than 120 files a week before his retirement and that he was prepared to face probe by any agency. Fadnavis has taken the view that most of the files were routine, however, he has asked the new CEO to scrutinize all the files cleared by Vishwas Patil.Munde has demanded a probe by the CBI and Enforcement Directorate into the transactions of Gangakhed Sugars, a factory controlled by Ratnakar Gutte. ""Loans were obtained by Gangakhed Sugars without the knowledge of farmers. They have received notices for repayment. The total debt stands at Rs 650 crore,"" Munde said."

For ages, the Nepali-speaking population in the Hills have relied on a unique ""exchange plan"" of sorts to tide over tough times  when in need, people don't hesitate to approach their neighbours for cereals or flour, only to return the exact quantities when things improve. Now, they have moved a step ahead and turned to barter.Biju Rai, who runs a stationery shop near the old TV station in Darjeeling, had stacked four crates of biscuits along with other items two days before the strike. When the shutdown began, he had ample resources but hardly any vegetables or cash.""Biscuits have become extremely prized in these circumstances. So, I have started trading the biscuit packets for vegetables like tomatoes, watercress and pumpkin from a local vegetable seller, who grows vegetables in her own farm,"" Rai said.Another stationary shop owner in Chawkbazar, who requested anonymity, said locals regularly knock on his doors after dusk  his home is adjacent to the shop  to ask for daily requirements like salt, sugar and flour.""Over the past two days, people have started running short of cash. Yesterday, I gave away a kg of salt and sugar each to a local for four apples and six bananas. I think I made a good deal since fruits have disappeared from the market,"" he said.A woman who continues to sell momos, thukpas and homemade breadsticks near the Darjeeling Sadar Hospital as her establishment is out of the purview of the strike as she caters to patients and their relatives, said how an elderly woman came to her with an ailing grandson and little money to pay and offered her some beans, green chillies and bitter-gourd grown in her kitchen garden. ""I didn't take the vegetables though and told her to pay later for the food,"" she said.Liquor outlets in the Hills were shut down by the administration well before the indefinite bandh started as officials felt liquor could be used as a bait by Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leaders to mobilise mobs. But the locals have found a way to procure liquor bottles from Sikkim or the plains and these are selling at a premium.""I had stacked a few bottles of liquor last week but had to trade a bottle of Old Monk rum for five litres of petrol from a pump owner who had no liquor stock. He has promised me more fuel if I can continue to supply liquor,"" said Prakash Thapa, who ran out of fuel for his bike.A regular face at the motor stand in Darjeeling, Ratna Maan, who sells milk and watercress said he is accepting nutrition bars and chocolates from those who don't have cash. ""I have brothers at home, who love chocolates and nutrition bars. Since, they are hard to find now, I accept them,"" he said.GJM leaders said they are aware of the barter system and called it a form of ""improvisation"" on the part of residents. ""Hills people are always ready to improvise. They are helping each other by exchanging goods of daily use. But they are also determined to continue with the strike and endure sufferings to attain the larger goal - Gorkhaland,"" said Kalyan Dewan, a senior GJM leader and convenor of Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee."
