On Monday, the rainfall recorded was 1.69 mm with the highest rainfall of 11.50 mm recorded in Gaganbawda taluka.The IMD report states that Konkan and Goa region will receive normal rainfall. After July 13, the intensity of the rains will increase. From July 14, southern Maharashtra will receive medium intensity rainfall.Farmers in the district are waiting for the rains as they have completed sowing Khariff crops. They include groundnuts, soyabean, sugarcane and other crops which are water intensive and rain dependent.An official of the district agriculture department said, ""Sowing of rice and maize is complete. Irrigation facilities are in place at most of the parts of the district. However, in hilly and high altitude areas, farmers are completely dependent on rains for growing Khariff crops. The chances of re-sowing are low at present and we are monitoring the advance of monsoon to ensure that all measures such as procurement of seeds and providing additional water to the farms are in place.""Since June 1, the total rainfall recorded in the district is 4,222 mm. Blocks such as Hatkanangale, Shirol, Karvir, Kagal, Gadhingalj and Ajara have gone completely dry in the last three days.""Ghatprabha and Kode dams are full while other dams such as Radhanagari, Warana, Kadvi, Chikotra have been filled up to 50%.

It has also decided to stop distributing palm oil, sugar and salt.During the scheme's launch in 2013, chief minister Siddaramaiah had announced 30kg of rice per Below Poverty Line (BPL) family. Over the last four years, demand for variety , spike in black-marketing of rice and efforts to capture people's imagination drove the government to reinvent the scheme.In 2015-16, the government began publicizing that it'd add 2kg of ragiwheatjowar, based on regional staples, and cut down on the quantity of rice being supplied. It also promised a kilo of salt and sugar with a litre of palm oil.Beneficiaries of the scheme were getting all of these till early this year. However, now these add-ons have all been scrapped. Just a kilo of tur dal has been added to seven kilos of rice for every BPL card-holder.Food and civil supplies department officials claimed the government stopped lifting jo whar or ragi as there was no ""demand"" for them.Confirming that the government has decided to scrap ragi and jowar, minister U T Khader said: ""We have stopped supplying ragi and jowar to BPL families. We have also stopped providing some of the other items due to factors such as low price and non-availability of central government subsidy ."" The only other foodgrain which is available under Anna Bhagya is wheat, which, the minister said, is being provided on demand only in north Karnataka districts.So, has this move helped the government save money?Khader says though the state government might have saved on these add-ons, it'll have to bear the cost of increased quantity of rice (from 5 to 7kg), apart from the cost incurred on Anila Bhagya, a new scheme to provide free LPG connections and gas stoves to BPL families."

Whether it was his favourite plate of bhajiyas or the frequent cups of chai, he didn't care much about the effect it could have on his health and his waistline. But that's not the case anymore. Harikrishna has now realised the importance of a proper diet and he is not the only one. Cops across the city, from the top rank to the constabulary, have started keeping track of what they eat like never before.This positive change has come about in recent times after Police Commissioner Datta Padsalgikar initiated workshops for the Mumbai Police force that focussed on eating right and staying healthy.Life has changed a good deal ever since, not just for the men in uniform, but also for their families. As constable Nitin Bhosle says, ""There's a huge difference in the way we cook food at our home now. It has very little oil and my mother and wife both understand why it's necessary to eat right.Our families are supporting us to maintain our fitness levels.""The women in the house have taken it upon themselves to help their husbands stay fighting fit. Inspector Sadanand Mane 's wife Sailee, who is into fitness herself, makes sure that her husband eats at regular intervals. ""I pack several tiffins for him. The idea is to make sure that he eats nutritious food through the day. They do a hard job and their timings too can be odd, so it's important that they don't skip their meals."" Her husband agrees. ""Our jobs are hectic and we tend to eat at any time. I know of many cops who used to skip breakfast; they would just have a cup of tea and set out for work. But things are changing for the better now and people are realising that erratic food habits can have an adverse effect, not just on our weight, but also health,"" says Mane. The emphasis is a lot more on veggies andsalads, fruits and juices in many police households.Meanwhile, the canteen at the Police Commissioner's Office in Crawford Market smells different now, what with the cooks being given some serious instructions. ""Earlier, we didn't have fruit salad in the canteen, but now, we do and that's a hot favourite among the cops,"" observes Assistant Police Inspector Feroz Patel, adding, ""The workshops have helped many policemen make simple changes in their eating habits, which are showing positive results. Around 50,000 booklets on healthy eating were also printed and distributed among the policemen.""Dietician Rujuta Diwekar , who conducted the workshops for the policemen, says, ""What has made this project a success is the fact that the commissioner is so hands-on. We first held workshops for the cops, after which he suggested that we conduct them for their families as well. And that really worked. Little changes in one's diet can go a long way. Like I have told them, they could start their day with a banana instead of tea, have a wholesome meal between 4 pm and 6 pm, and instead of having many cups of tea throughout the day, they could opt for sugarcane juice, coconut water or kokum sherbet.""Another big change that has taken place is when the cops go for their bandobust duty. Says Rujuta, ""Earlier, they were served chai and biscuit. Now, it's poha, kokum sherbat and rajgira chikki. There's a change taking place in the system; it is a good beginning and I'm sure it will only get better from here."""
5a077da69855b76bf13ca8d7,Sugarcane cultivation leaves bitter aftertaste,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sugarcane-cultivation-leaves-bitter-aftertaste/articleshow/59538056.cms,2017-07-11,"Once known for being a major sugarcane producer in the country, Tamil Nadu has witnessed a substantial drop in cultivation of the cash crop in the past decade. The area of sugarcane in the state has fallen from 39, 12,000 hectares in 2006-2007 to 23,73,000 hectares in 2016-2017, registering a 41% dip. While the shrinkage in cultivation area has been attributed to drought and poor rainfall , farmers and researchers say unsatisfactory sugarcane price fixed by the government, falling yields and rising labour costs have also contributed to it.Tamil Nadu now has less than 5% of its arable area under sugarcane cultivation. Data recently released by the Union ministry of agriculture shows that sugarcane cultivation in the state has been consistently falling since 2006-2007, except in 20122013 when the area increased by 10,000 hectares. The acreage registered a fall the very next year. The severe drought that hit the state last year is expected to have worsened the situation.A survey conducted by the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in February , estimates the area under sugarcane cultivation to have come down by 30%-40% across the state. ""One of the main reasons is the gradual decrease in the amount of rainfall,"" says Bakshi Ram, director of Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore. ""The quantity and quality of the yield has also been deteriorating because a majority of the farmers continue to use only the CO86032 variety (of sugarcane) that was released in 2000. Using a less disease-resistant variety increases the incidence of diseases in the crop, leading to a low cultivation rate,"" he adds. ""While farmers using drip irrigation have survived, others have incurred losses."" Tamil Nadu's average yield is around 108 tonnes per hectare, but many farmers do not achieve it, he adds.Farmers say the cost and complications in cultivating sugarcane have also escalated. ""In western Tamil Nadu, the labour costs are higher than the southern part,"" says Ambikapathy , a farmer who supplies sugarcane to Amaravathy Sugars and now to Bannari Amman Sugars.""It costs us around `700 to harvest one tonne of crop which is exclusive of maintenance costs, fertilisers and electricity. We are hardly left with `40,000 per acre in a year when the rain is good,"" he adds.Another menace are wild boars who often destroy crops, says Ambikapathy. Due to recurring losses many farmers took to cultivating short term crops like pulses, millets and even banana last year, he adds.Unsatisfactory minimum fixed price of sugarcane has also discouraged many farmers from cultivating the crop. ""The advantage of sugarcane cultivation lies in the fact that it gives us an assured market and promises us that prices will not drop sharply . But many companies do not give us the whole fixed price, which is what prompted me to set up my own sugar crushing factory and sell sugar in the market instead of cane,"" says Karuppusamy, a farmer from Sathyamangalam."

However, not in the fashion of a side accessory, but as a filling. The godd lonchem thus adds a wonderful dimension to chapatti, pao and even sandwiches, if you will.""In the pre-liberation era, before the wheat chapatti was introduced, Goans consumed the godd lonchem with the local 'polle' made from rice flour,"" said food-expert, Amita Salatri ""This simple but finger-licking delicious pickle served as a popular evening snack among senior citizens or as a breakfast option among fussy school-going children during that time,"" she said.For the sweet pickle, fresh ambade are peeled, cooked in sugar and tempered with basic spices, which give it a sweet and sour taste. Its flavour offers a counterpoint to the bold pungency of the mango pickle.Stored in sealed glass jars in a cool, dark place can give this pickle a shelf life . The relish can also be refrigerated.Recipe:Preparation Time:15 minutesIngredients:10 tender ambade of small sizeOne teaspoon mustard seedsHalf teaspoon hingOne teaspoon tumeric powderTwo teaspoon chili powderQuarter kilo jaggerySalt to tasteMethod of Preparation:Take tender ambade and skin them.

It is a wild animal and needs to be in the wild. Anyway, even if we think to keep it in confinement, the expenses will be huge. A separate staff of 4-5 people will require for its care and separate expenses worth thousands of rupees will have to be shelled out,"" said Shukla.He added that later this month he will be heading to Karnataka to meet with forest officials to find out the possibility of relocating the tusker.When asked about the possibility of more than one tusker in the region, Shukla said, ""We have carried out a survey in the month of May, wherein it was confirmed that there is only one tusker.

Girvarsing Devda, who used to work at a sugarcane stall of the victim's daughter, had decamped with jewellery, and currency notes and coins amounting to over Rs 3 lakh.A liquor shop-owner, to whom the accused had handed over part of the booty of Rs 1,100 in coins, as payment for liquor, turned out to be a key witness who helped nail him in court. The coins were recovered from the witness.Chetnaben Vora, daughter of the victim, Nirmala, went to her stall at about 11.30am on November 4, 2012. She said she called her mother in the evening and chatted with her. She further said that at 9.30pm, her mother did not answer her calls. Chetnaben said that when she returned home at 11.30pm, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood, with a deep injury on her neck . She recalled that two cupboards in the hall were open, their drawers were pulled out, and clothes were scattered around. After she screamed for help, neighbours arrived at the scene and called doctors and cops.Cops suspected the accused, after he did not return to work at the stall the day after the incident. He was traced to Udaipur, Rajasthan, where he had absconded. Besides the statement of the liquor shop-owner, the court also relied on the statement of Rajkumar Chaudhary, who had seen the accused near the house on the day of the incident. Chaudhary, who worked with a supplier of sugarcane, said he had gone to the victim's house to deliver sugarcane at 5.30pm.The court pointed out that jewellery and other articles were recovered from the house of the accused. ""All these proved facts are sufficient to fully establish that only the accused had committed the charged crime. All these facts are inconsistent with innocence of the accused,"" the court held."

Not every change need be drastic, nor every decision life changing. It is in little changes that true magic lies. And it is these that are more sustainable.Internet overflows with articles suggesting how you need a major life change and the steps to achieve it. You are told you need a big changeover if you are undergoing a major upheaval, or feeling depressed, or going through a bad relationship! And how do you go about that? You are exhorted to recruit your inner warrior, develop a compelling vision, and forgive self-judgement or to follow your passion.Easier said than done. The very idea of upturning and changing your life completely sounds ridiculous and scary enough never to be attempted. But, what if you were to understand that no big changes are needed? All one is looking for after all is some happiness and peace and a measure of recognition. There is no need to overhaul your life or to chuck your present lifestyle for a new one. You just need to make small adjustments to realign your lives on the desired path!Think of the little things you can easily do in order to make yourself feel better. Start small, and the sense of achievement you feel in meeting the small goals will prod you along to the next goalpost, and the next, till without realizing you have arrived!For instance, if you are convinced that you need to be more outgoing, do not panic and enroll for personality grooming classes! Just practice to smile, chat more and show interest in people. Feeling stifled in a relationship? Talking about it may resolve the issue. Irritated because you have no time for yourself? Just a small change in your routine may do the trickAdvised to go on a diet and exercise? Dont jump to the other end of the spectrum and starve yourself! Weight lost through drastic measures has an uncanny ability to jump right back. Try the smaller stuff. Go slow on sugar, white flour, bread and rice and give up fried food. Start eating smaller meals at regular intervals.For exercise, do not start a punishing regimen that you will never be able to keep up. Start walking even if for just 20 minutes a day. Make sure you move around as much as you can. Make your own bed every morning; it gives you a surprising sense of purpose and a boost to the rest of your day. Get up from your desk every few minutes just to stretch, take a short walk or even just stand around. Get off the elevator a floor earlier rather than attempt the entire flight of stairs.These little changes in your everyday routine will seem easy to adopt. Soon you will start feeling lighter and more alert, and this in itself will be incentive enough for you to figure what needs to be done next. All you need to do is set the ball rolling in the right direction and it will soon pick up enough momentum to propel you to the desired goal. However, focus and dedication are critical.The idea of meditation always scared me because I thought of it as a one-hour exercise trying to chase away recalcitrant thoughts. Till I realized that even a few minutes of zoning out and focusing on a symbol or a sound achieves the desired effect. And I needed to just make a small adjustment in my routine!The same principle can be good at work too. Rather than fretting about the bigger goal, break it into smaller goalposts and focus on one at a time. Quit trying to please everyone; focus on work and ensure the key person knows it.It does indeed make sense to sweat the small stuff rather than run scared of bigger changes! What is most important is to know what you want and then focus on the small change that will help you get there!"

There are fears that if rains are insufficient, 25-30% of the total area under cultivation may have to be resown, said an official from the agriculture department.Officials say Gondia, Amravati, Bhandara, Buldhana, Akola, Washim, Beed are some of the worst-affected districts, which have received barely 50-75% of the average rainfall.Sowing has been completed on nearly 65% of the 139.64 lakh hectares of cultivable area in the state  which adds up to 82 lakh hectares.""There has been an issue with sowing due to the long, dry spell and crops like soyabean, moong, tur, rice and sugarcane will be hit. Cotton which is grown on a large scale in the state will not see a lot of problems as it sustains on the moisture of the soil, but if the dry spell continues then cotton too will be affected,"" said a senior official.Resowing, if required, will increase the grower's input costs on seeds and labour and have a bearing on financial planning for the season ahead.Principal Secretary, Bijay Kumar said field officials are undertaking surveys to ascertain the damage. Relief measures will be undertaken based on their findings. ""We have ample supply of seeds ready. Whenever there is a requirement for resowing, the cost of the seeds are borne by the government. The same policy will be applicable in this case too,"" said Kumar who will himself undertake a statewide tour starting on Thursday.Officials said the state government has sent out advisories to farmers asking them to start sowing only next week and wait for clarity from the Indian Meterological Department.The agri department is also trying to convince farmers to sign up for the state's crop insurance scheme. ""After a good monsoon last year and with prediction of surplus rainfall this year, the tendency to pay premium for the insurance scheme is not there. And if rains fail this year and if they have not signed up for the insurance then they will not get anything,"" said another official."

However, with the implementation of the new tax regime, SGPC was now liable to pay GST on those purchases.Badungar said the amount received towards 'karah parshad' was also subjected to GST. SGPC is apprehensive that with GST, an extra financial burden of Rs 10 crore a year would be put on it. SGPC chief secretary Harcharan Singh said the procurement bill of langar items like desi ghee, sugar and pulses came to around Rs 75 crore annually.With the shift from VAT to GST, a tax of 12% would be levied on desi ghee, 18% on sugar and 5% on pulses, increasing the financial burden by Rs 10 crore annually, he said.Badungar said all purchases made at these Sikh shrines should be exempted from GST and requested the Union government to consider it. In the letter, the SGPC said, ""It will become impossible for the SGPC to carry out these services which are being rendered to the needy without any considerations of caste, creed and religion.""He said he was quite hopeful that the request made by the SGPC would find favours with the Union government and it would soon be exempted from paying GST to run the langar sewa."

The assets surfaced when the Panama Papers leak last year revealed that they were managed through offshore companies owned by Sharif's children.The six-member JIT which probed the issue submitted its final report to the Supreme Court on July 10. It said the lifestyle of Sharif and his children was beyond their known sources of income, and recommended filing of a new corruption case against them.Sharif has dismissed the report as a ""bundle of baseless allegations"".According to the report in Pakistan's Dawn newspaper, the JIT has asked the court to reopen 15 old cases, including five cases decided by the Lahore High Court, eight investigations and two inquiries against the prime minister.Of these 15 cases, three were filed during the 1994 and 2011 tenures of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and 12 were prepared during the tenure of Pervez Musharraf , who toppled Sharif's government in October 1999 in a military coup.The case relating to the Sharif family's four London apartments was also among the eight investigations started by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in December 1999.In its April 20 verdict, the Supreme Court asked the JIT to investigate the money trail for the London flats.The court's other 12 questions were related to the sale and purchase of the Gulf Steel Mill, the Qatari letter, offshore companies and other matters.In addition to the 18-year-old investigation into the London properties, the JIT has also recommended reviving cases such as three NAB references and two FIA cases that were quashed by the Lahore High Court.The JIT even found anomalies in the cases quashed by the high court. The report noted ""that these cases have also been quashed without conducting a proper trial and without giving evidence a chance to come on record"".The JIT also recommended reopening of another case the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) registered the same year of the same nature.Its report pointed out that the LHC had quashed an NAB reference filed against Sharif and Saifur Rehman related to the purchase of a helicopter, allegedly through unfair means, and said it was a ""case of further investigation"".Discussing the LHC verdict on the Hudabiya Paper Mills reference, the team opined: ""It was very well investigated reference which could not get a chance to go under trial and was quashed mere on technical grounds.""Regarding the Sharif family's assets reference quashed by the LHC in 2014, the JIT insisted that there was strong evidence against the accused individuals. The team recommended that the SC direct NAB to appeal the acquittal of the Sharif family in these cases.The JIT also recommended that NAB be directed to complete its investigation into the London properties.The JIT also recommended that the SC resume investigations against the prime minister for recruiting 42 employees in the FIA in the late 90s, the forced acquisition of land in and around Raiwind, the construction of a road to Raiwind, receiving funds for the Sharif Trust, assets beyond known sources of income and illegal plot allotments.The SC was also recommended to direct the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to reopen the investigation into alleged money laundering by the Chaudhry Sugar Mills, owned by the Sharif family."

My family-owned company Rana Sugars has not committed any wrong and has only followed a legal course to get justice. We, like any other citizens of the country, have every right to seek legal recourse and remedies and we have precisely done that,"" said Gurjeet.Gurjeet's family-run firm Rana Sugars Limited had set up a 12 MW capacity co-generation power plant in 2001 to supply 10.2 MW power to PSPCL for 20 years at a base rate of Rs 3.01 per unit with an annual escalation clause of 5% up to the financial year 2004-05 and thereafter no escalation was permitted.However, Gurjeet's company approached the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) and sought re-determination of tariff for supply of power to PSPCL. While the Delhi-based appellate tribunal allowed appeal by Rana Sugars, the PSPCL moved Supreme Court in 2015. The matter has since been pending before the apex court.""I have now been conveyed by the top authorities of the PSPCL, that he is misusing his official position. The modus operandi adopted by the tainted minister in this case is similar to his gross misuse of position to grab costly mines through benami e-auctions and to acquire 142 kanal (71,000 sq yards) of deh shamlat (common village land) of Seonk village, despite stay issued by Punjab and Haryana high court,"" Khaira alleged.Gurjeet hit back at Khaira, saying he is desperate to become the leader of the AAP legislature party in Punjab. ""I really wonder whether he does anything else other than try to find faults about whatever I and my family do,"" said Gurjeet."

This is only 14% less than the 1,543 cases recorded till June-end last year. The state had announced a limited loan waiver on June 3 and a Rs 34,022-crore loan waiver on June 24.Significantly, farmer suicides have actually risen in both Vidarbha 's Amravati region and the sugar belt of Western Maharashtra compared to last year. Amravati-the epicenter of farmer suicides in the staterecorded 503 cases compared to 483 last year. Western Maharashtra recorded 50 cases compared to 45 last year.The Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, continues to record the highest number of farmer suicides (629). While the Amravati belt saw a rise in cases, the Nagpur division with126 cases saw a 33% decline compared to last year.The arid region of Marathwada recorded 459 cases, a decline from 568 cases last year. North Maharashtra, epicenter of the recent farmer protests, recorded 223 cases, a slight decline from the 257 last year. The Konkan region has recorded only two cases so far this year.Besides the loan waiver, the state has also announced a Rs 10,000 loan advance for the kharif season. However, not much has trickled down to beneficiaries owing to procedural delays and stringent eligibility norms.Farm activists blame state policies for the continuing farmer suicides. ""We would have expected a sharper fall in the number of cases this year since last year saw a water crisis till May. The state needs to provide better prices for crops and also hike import duties to protect the domestic market,"" said Kisan Sabha's Ajit Nawle.The intermittent rains across the state have also led to the prospect of repeat sowing especially in the Vidarbha region. ""This will significantly hike the input costs for farmers,"" said farm activist Vijay Jawandhia.Farm groups are pressing for higher prices for crops, without which farm incomes are unlikely to rise. ""The support price for soyabean is Rs 3,050 per quintal but farmers are selling for Rs 2700 in the market. How will they break even?"" Jawandhia said."

There are fairies in Mumbai and not just the ones that are part of dreams. These are real men and women, who you may brush past on your way to work in the mornings, or if you are lucky enough, you may just spot one while going home in the amber twilight. They may not wave a wand, but they still have some magic to offer  in the shape of a book that's likely to pop up right next to you in a rickshaw, at a bus stop, in a nook by a leafy road or even on your seat in the local train! Mumbai's very own neighbourhood book fairies are leaving paperbacks at public spaces in the city for people to read. Why? To enlighten, educate and make the world a better place to live in.The book fairy movement came to light on International Women's Day, when 'Harry Potter' actress and feminist Emma Watson began leaving books on women empowerment at public spaces  in the subway in New York, on the Tube at London and at iconic locations in Paris. Since then, it has generated an army of 5,000 book fairies across the world  who leave paperbacks, hardcovers, adult colouring books, children's tomes and more on park benches, at bus stops, in libraries and on public transport. Mumbai is not far behind. Luxury professional Mahek Sareen decided to act on her desire to be a book fairy on her return to Mumbai after her studies in France. ""I'm inspired by Emma Watson and when she started the concept, I thought it was fantastic! It's already caught on in Paris and it was so nice to see it happening in Mumbai as we have voracious readers back home,"" she says.Today, the Mumbai book fairies are a steadily growing community, spearheaded by book fairy Kadambari Mehta . She and her little coterie have left books on travel, empowerment, love and romance, self-help, poetry and fiction at places like the David Sassoon Library, Mani Bhavan, little corner coffee shops, behind pillars and more. Much like a public library system, the finder is supposed to pick up the book, read it and share it again with someone else and keep the chain going. Says Kadambari, ""I have even left a book on a seat during a flight and at Mahabaleshwar, too. The whole idea is to encourage reading."" So far the books placed have been in English. ""Mumbai, being a cosmopolitan city, we see a huge potential for books in Marathi, Hindi and Gujarati. We also have had had a demand for books in Bengali,"" she adds.Each book carries a sticker instruction to take a picture with the book, hashtag it #IBelieveInBookFairies and post it on Instagram . Mahek Sareen, resident of Kandivali, left a Stephen Hawkings book in Mount Mary Church, Bandra. ""It was picked up by two girls, who took a photo with it and shared it with the hashtag. It feels good to know how far the book has travelled,"" she smiles."" Malad-based marketing professional Jaita Guha left a book on geishas in a rickshaw near her home. ""I left the book as I alighted from the rickshaw. Later I was elated to see a post with the book. Turned out that the person found the book a day after her birthday, so it made for a nice gift,"" she informs, adding that she also left a book at Aksa Beach on 'Book Fairy Biography Day' recently. ""I left a biography on a yogi at a sugarcane stall at the beach as it was raining."" Did she see who took it? ""No, I never wait to see who's picking the books as I am a fairy and have to stay out of sight,"" she smiles.Bhavika Govil, a book fairy-in-waiting, is planning to place a few books around Bandra so you might get one if you are lucky! ""I'm thinking of leaving the books behind a cushion in a cafe for people to find. I also want to leave a few detective books on a local train,"" she grins. ""The very idea of someone picking up the book, reading and appreciating it, feels great. It feels like a personal recommendation to a stranger,"" she admits.There are no rules to be a book fairy. Adds Kadambari, ""Anyone can take on this role. The books can be from your personal collection, ones you've read and loved. We have got requests from people who want to give away books to us, too. I got 30-40 books from donors around Mumbai in this week alone, so the kindness bug is certainly biting them,"" she says. What's more, men have also signed up as fairies. ""We have male book fairies too, which is so heartening,""she adds."

Farmers are being sent back by the PACCS authorities stating that they cannot generate bills with GST.Considering the low water storage in the Mettur reservoir, the state government has announced Rs 56.92 crore as kuruvai package to enable farmers to take up short-term crops during the month of June. The government has taken the decision to increase the total coverage of paddy considerably to compensate the previous year's paddy harvest which was affected owing to severe drought.In Trichy, district farmers have taken up kuruvai paddy cultivation wherever the ground water is available such as Lalgudi, Mannachanallur and some parts of Anthanallur union in the district. As farmers are busy with transplantation of paddy nursery, this is the time to apply urea and potash. But they are not getting the required fertilizer from their respective PACCS, they alleged.""Farmers from Lalgudi taluk alone have carried out kuruvai paddy cultivation on 10,000 to 15,000 acres, apart from sugarcane and banana cultivation on around 5,000 acres. This is the time to apply urea and potash for paddy crops and also for cane and banana,"" said N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam.Farmers hailing from various villages in Lalgudi taluk including Neikuppai, Nagar, Aangarai and Lalgudi could not get fertilizer for their crops. Whenever they approached PACCS, authorities keep saying that due to non-generation of GST number they could not sell fertilizer. For the same reason the authorities from TANFED - where PACCSs purchase fertilizer, refuse to clear their order, he added.In some other places, though PACCSs have already got the number, the concerned employees were not yet trained to calculate GST. So, they have temporarily stopped selling fertilisers, said Puliyur A Nagarajan, state organiser of the farmers' wing of Tamil Manila Congress.""We have applied to the concerned tax department for the GST number. Since we have not yet received the same, we could not sell fertilizer to farmers. However, we have the required volume of stock. Once the GST issue gets cleared, there would not be any confusion on the sale of the same"", sources from the societies said.When contacted, joint registrar of cooperative department K C Ravichandran told TOI that he has so far not yet received any such complaints. ""I will instruct the officials to look into the matter and ask the concerned PACCSs to distribute fertilizers,"" he further said."

Nothing of this has been reaching Darjeeling town for the last three weeks.And, with ration shops closed since June, 670 ration dealers in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts have their entire June allocation of 9,550 tonnes of foodgrain stacked in their now-shut stores. ""Some of the dealers tried to open ration shops but stopped after they were thrashed by bandh supporters,"" a worried state food and civil supplies minister Jyotipriya Mullick said in Kolkata on Thursday. ""This crisis is entirely man-made,"" he added.It's not that food supplies have stopped entirely. But the response of residents to the trickle that is reaching the Hills reveals their desperation: there was a stampede-like situation when small trucks laden with vegetables reached Darjeeling over the last weekend. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, now spearheading the demand for a separate state, arranged for the vegetables to be distributed among people, well aware that a section was running out of patience. People mobbed these vehicles and GJM supporters had their hands full controlling the crowds.Susma Giri ran behind a truck, holding on to her two-year-old daughter tight in one hand and having a carry-bag in the other. The truck, laden with sacks of cabbage, reddish and squash, came to a halt in front of Darjeeling Municipality, where more than 200 men and women were already in the queue. Giri grudgingly took her position right at the back and waited for her turn.""There is no food at home. Give me some more vegetables,"" Sarita Lepcha , a homemaker who had queued up for two hours, cried out to the men on the lorry handing out the vegetables.The business community in Darjeeling is too scared to speak out but traders confirm not a single lorry containing edibles has been allowed to come up from Siliguri, the primary feeder to the Hills, since the GJM-sponsored total shutdown started on June 15. ""Every single shop is shut in Darjeeling and other towns. Trucks are not being allowed to cross Darjeeling More in Siliguri. There is no stock of food in Darjeeling,"" a senior office-bearer in the association of rice wholesalers of rice in Beech Gali said.The administration says it is monitoring the situation but there is very little it can do. ""Darjeeling has a monthly requirement of 9,550 tonnes of foodgrains, which caters to 8.75 lakh people. This translates to 11 kg of rice or wheat per head every week. We supplied the entire June-July quota by July 11. We have 52,000 tonnes of foodgrains stored in over 50 warehouses in Siliguri to meet further requirements. We have ensured that supplies have reached the three warehouses off Darjeeling,"" minister Mullick said in Kolkata. ""But there is very little we can do if the agitators are bent on inconveniencing the very people on whose behalf they claim to speak,"" he added.Chowkbazar near Darjeeling railway station is the main hub from where vegetables and edibles reach smaller towns like Sonada, Ghum, Tung Sung, Singmari, Aluabari, Patleybas and Dali. But the indefinite shutdown has cut off the entire supply chain and the food shortage in kitchens is gradually reflecting on the streets in the Hills."

We are told that sightings of candyfloss or cotton candy vendors have become rare these days. Recently, we spotted one at Connaught Place.But today, we will tell you about Rajpal Singh, who is usually seen in south Delhis Green Park. All day long, the elderly Mr Singh cycles around the area with a cotton candy machine that he purchased in his hometown Aligarh for Rs 4,000.Wrapped in a red cloth to grab the attention of passersby, the machine consists of a blackened aluminium tray with a small metal bowl in the centre. The bowl has minute pores on its side walls and there is a burner underneath. The whole contraption is attached to a wheel.A large cloud of cotton can be made within five minutes.First, Mr Singh fills the bowl with grains of sugar and some food-grade colour. He then turns the burner to low flame. In a few moments, he begins to rotate the wheel and the tray begins to spin. Within seconds, the tray is cobwebbed with a thin film of barely perceptible threads. The melted sugar cools down and solidifies into what looks like cotton.Finally, Mr Singh pulls out a wooden stick and twirls the cotton around it. The strands bunch around the twig and, lo and behold, you have a sugar cloud of your own.The candy feels hairy and sticky in the mouth and melts instantly. Mr Singh charges Rs 20 for his magic show."

It is intended to show whether the person is in touch with reality and the problems people face - not everyone manages to pass the test.If the leader is a woman, the male-dominated British news media expects her all the more to know such prices, besides issues of policy, as Margaret Thatcher knew only too well. Her advisers gave her a helpful list of prices during the 1987 election, in case she got caught out.New documents released by the Margaret Thatcher Foundation include one that lists the then prevailing prices of milk, beer, eggs, sugar and newspapers and the average fare on Londons Tube network.Not surprisingly, the list begins with milk, the favourite item to throw leading lights off-balance. Across the pond, in 1992, US President George W Bush admitted he did not know the cost of a gallon of milk, and in 2007, presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani didnt know it either.Thatcher was given the list in 1987, but in more recent years, leaders are known to try to be up to speed on the latest on television and trends in music, in case they are asked about such matters in high-pressure live television debates.Among the documents released was Thatchers 1976 recipe for what she called Mystery Starter, whose ingredients included 1 flat teaspoon of curry powder. Some who tried it were left perplexed.Recipe for Mystery Starter by former UK premier Margaret Thatcher. (Margaret Thatcher Foundation)Food writer and chef Rosie Sykes wrote in The Guardian: Having knocked it up myself, the biggest mystery I could find was: why would one concoct such a dish? It makes for a very uninspiring cream-coloured mousse, a dish with a tiny bit of spice as an end note. Soft and unchallenging, it would no doubt appeal to lovers of boarding-school food.On the plus side, it is the kind of thing Lady T could have knocked up in her nightie at 5am if she knew she had people round for dinner that evening, since it takes five minutes to make but several hours to set.The tranche of documents provides new insights into one of Britains iconic prime ministers, who was in office from 1979 to 1990.

On Monday, the agriculture department said that 32 farmers died because of pesticide. This is the third such probe in Vidarbha region ordered by the state government. The government had not announced details of the probe till late on Tuesday.Addressing the media, Fadnavis added that a case of culpable homicide will be registered against the pesticide manufacturers and dealers for circulating non-certified pesticide in the region. State agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said, A culpable homicide case has been registered against Gharda Chemicals Ltd for selling a pesticide that is not recommended. We are in process of registering a case against Syngenta  an agro chemical company  under similar section of the Indian Penal Code.Gharda Chemicals Ltd. manufactures a pesticide with trade name Police, while Syngenta makes a pesticide called Polo, Fundkar said. Hindustan Times had reported on Tuesday that the state agriculture department had detected that Police a pesticide recommended for sugarcane crop  was sold in Yavatmal, Akola, which primarily cultivate cotton.Cases against Krishi Seva Kendras or agro-input centres have also been filed under the Insecticide Control Act 1968 for selling non-certified pesticides and selling pesticides without mandatory license. Apart from the death of the farmers, around 25 farmers have reportedly lost their vision and close to 800 farmers have been admitted to state-run hospitals after they complained of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc.Meanwhile, the findings and the recommendations of the probe that was headed by Sudhir Kumar Srivastava, additional chief secretary (home), were discussed in the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The probe was set up after complaints of negligence and to inquire whether more than the prescribed level of chemicals has been used.According to Fundkar, the district administration failed to report the matter to the state government. The report has suggested that SOPs were not followed and there were lapses in the system to report the incident. Medico-legal cases should have been registered, Fundkar said. The state government has suspended the Yavatmal district agriculture officer.A senior bureaucrat added that Srivastava recommended that farmers who employ labourers to spray pesticide should also be made accountable. One of his recommendations was that the farmer has to provide the labourer the safety kit--gloves goggles. He (farmer) will also be responsible to take him to a doctor in case there are any issues with his (labourer) health due to spraying of pesticide, the official who was part of the Cabinet meeting said. The minister added that there are about 25,000 labourers, mostly from Telangana, that are employed for spraying pesticides in the state.

On Thursday, his mother was also attacked by an elephant in the same area.Apart from this, seven elephants have died in the Kumaon region in the last six months due to natural reasons and electrocution.The three major elephant corridors of Golapar, Fatehpur-Lamachaur and Lalkuan near Haldwani have seen mushrooming of human settlements, cutting the age-old path of the elephants, Dhakate said.The Surai- Kilpura elephant corridor near Khatima is also witnessing an increase of human settlement, which is a cause of worry, he said.There are11 functional corridors in Uttarakhand, but human activities are increasing around the age-old corridors.Elephants are distance migratory animal with sharp memory, Dhakate said.An elephant goes into a state of shock on seeing people around, apart from this, many people are venturing inside the jungles to collect firewood and this increases human-animal conflicts, he said.Planting of sugarcane in fields around the forests also attracts the elephants.Mukesh Padiyar, a farmer in Devla Talla village, said people in Golapar live in constant fear of the elephants and the forest department has done little to bring respite to the people. We want proper patrolling and measures to keep elephants at bay.Dhakate, however, denies that the forest department does not conduct proper patrolling.We have drawn up plans for patrolling in the areas that are prone to human-animal conflicts and the work is on, he said."

The SSS council will take a final call on Khot next week.The agriculture minister is considered a strongman in the organisation and has clout in the farmer community in the region.Political analyst Prakash Pawar said, ""Khot failed on the expectations of the farmer community. Shetti is disappointed over Khot's inability to address concerns of farmers, for which he was given the ministerial berth. Shetti's image as a leader of the farmers will improve if Khot is removed from the party. But Shetti is in dilemma over whether to support the state government or not.""Shetti and Khot parted ways with Sharad Joshi's Shetkari Sanghatana over 15 years ago. The constant agitations by SSS for higher price for sugarcane resulted in the party creating a political base in south Maharashtra.The BJP has now made inroads where SSS was strong, as could be gauged from results of elections to local governing bodies.Pawar said since farmers from various parts of the country were uniting against the government, Shetti has a great chance of regaining lost ground. ""In the next two years, farmers' agitations will increase, which will boost Shetti's political prospects.

Liquor trade in Tamil Nadu is fully controlled by state-owned Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac), which raked in nearly `27,000 crore in sales last year. The state, which accounts for nearly a fifth of national liquor sales, has been a closed market for distillers from outside the state, with an influential local cartel enjoying monopoly for decades. We are in talks, but nothing has been finalized,"" a se nior Kals official told TOI while Imperial sources said nothing was firm yet.""There was speculation in 2014 that we will sell out. We didn't. Even now there is nothing concrete on the table. We will not comment,"" they said.Pudukottai-based Kals sells nearly six lakh cases a month to Tasmac, and owns regional brands like Magnus Choice, Black Pearl and La Martin, none of which is available for sale outside TN. Its strength is in mass market consumption.On the other hand, Imperial which counts Thilaknagar, Johns and Kyndal as its clients, bottles limited quantity . It is learned that Lighthouse Funds , the PE investor in Imperial, is pressing for a transaction that could pave way for its exit. Imperial has its distillery in Coimbatore and its promoters are related to Sakti Sugars group.It is not known if Imperial's Nethravathi Distilleries is also part of the transaction. Nethravathi owns a distillery in Tumkur, Karnataka. Imperial also has a unit in Goa and its Palakkad unit does contract bottling for United Spirits.The acquisition, if it comes through, could propel Kals into the top slot in the liquor hierarchy with a capacity to bottle more than 1.2 million cases a month in the state. The other big players in the state, V K Sasikala family-controlled Golden Midas and Balaji Distilleries, have a capacity of nearly a million cases each.The close nexus between lo cal liquor satraps and politicians has been a thorn in the flesh for global liquor giants.For example, Diageo-controlled United Spirits stopped directly dealing with Tasmac, fearing potential violation of anti-graft laws. Global liquor giant Pernord Ricard, owner of Seagram's, does not have a Tamil Nadu presence for similar reasons.""It is a tough market to do business but too big to ignore.Price increases do not happen often and unless you have local muscle power, business can get messy ,"" industry officials said.While liquor trade in India has been under severe strain with a court ban on liquor vending on state and national highways, the April 15 Supreme Court order dealt a death blow for several liquor markets. Tamil Nadu, however, does not seem to have been affected.In June, Tasmac placed orders for 46 lakh cases of IMFL and 24 lakh cases of beer; and 47 lakh cases of IMFL and 24 lakh cases of beer in April."

Interrogation by the Erwadi dargah police revealed that he had travelled across the country and had used two duplicate copies of Aadhaar cards to book rooms in lodges.According to police sources, Mohammed Yunus, 65, from Karachi, was a narcotics dealer though he projected himself as a nuts trader with business connections in Sri Lanka. Three months ago, he arrived in the island nation on a smuggling trip and impressed his Sri Lankan agent with his ability to speak multiple languages like Tamil, English, Gujarati, Urdu and Sinhalese. Subsequently, he was assigned the task of collecting two cases of brown sugar from an agent at Ahmedabad in Gujarat.The Sri Lankan agent collected his passport, handed him US $ 400 and sent him out on an illegal ferry. He reached Ammapattinam beach in Pudukottai district on May 2 from where he embarked on a long journey. He travelled to Ramanathapuram, Madurai, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Ajmer in Rajasthan. ""The Ahmedabad agent could not deliver the narcotic consignments as promised and asked him to return. So he called the Sri Lankan agent asking him to arrange a ferry back to Sri Lanka"", said a Q branch official who interrogated him.The agent in turn got in touch with some people in Keezhakarai to arrange an illegal ferry. Meanwhile, Yunus reached Erwadi dargah on July 13 and managed to book a room in a lodge named Jamruth Mahal. Based on a tip-off from an informer, Erwadi dargah police nabbed him on Saturday. Initially, he was suspected to be a Sri Lankan and Q branch help was sought to unravel the mystery. Further investigation by the Q branch revealed that he was actually a Pakistani narcotics dealer.Intriguingly, Yunus managed to get two duplicate Aadhaar cards made, one with a Bihar address and another on Keezhakarai address. In the Keezhakarai address he was identified as Jamal, son of Kulkarni, while the Bihar address had his name as Tamannah. His photograph was found pasted on another person's Aadhaar card and he had photocopies of it, the sources said.During the arrest, he was in possession of Pakistani currency worth Rs 2,660, Sri Lankan currency for Rs 2,520 and US $100. Two mobile phones and six sim cards were also seized. ""Although he was innocent by his looks, he was a hard nut to crack. He was not giving away information and police had to grill him to get each word. It was an experience we used to have while investigating hardened criminals,"" a police officer said.Upon securing him, Erwadi dargah police booked Yunus under Indian Penal Code 465 and 468 for forgery, 471 for fraudulently forging a genuine document, 419 for cheating and impersonation and 420 for cheating. Section 14 of Foreigners Act 1946 and 3 (a), 6 (a) of passport entry to India rules 1950 for illegally entering the country were also slapped on him. He was produced before Judicial Magistrate Paramakudi who is in-charge of Ramanathapuram JM and has since been remanded. The magistrate has sent him to Ramanathapuram prison but he may be shifted to Puzhal after obtaining the necessary documentation, police said. Along with Yunus, Syed Abutahir, 23, and Abdul Ajees, 26, from Erwardi were also arrested for assisting him with illegal ferry. They have been booked for criminal conspiracy and abetment of 6 (a) of passport act, police said."

He has asked that a team of wildlife scientists be sent to study the situation and offer suggestions on how to send the feline back to Pilibhit tiger reserve (PTR).The tiger, say forest officials, was recently spotted just 500 meters from Pushp Institute of Sciences and Higher Studies and 1.5 km from the campus of the district and sessions court. They fear the presence of the tiger poses a great threat to the safety and security of the residents of Tandola village and also people passing through the area. So far, it has not harmed anyone.The foresters fear that tiger, which is about six years old, may make Tandola village its permanent home just like the Amaria tigress and its cubs which had strayed from PTR in November 2013 but then the pride made its permanent habitat in the agricultural belt of Amaria block.The forest deparment officials have been tracking the tiger ever since it strayed out of PTR on July 15 into the sugarcane fields of Mewatpur village. The same day, the big cat moved to the nearby village Tah and finally reached Tandola on July 20.According to conservator Singh, it appears that the tiger is settling down at Tandola and may not retreat to PTR on its own. ""In the present situation, the tiger is feared to have made the cropped belt of Tandola its permanent habitat and territory as the sugarcane stalks provide shelter to the big cat, has ample prey like neelgai, jackals, wild boars besides a reservoir for drinking water and a giant peepal tree (ficus religiosa) for a cool canopy,"" he said. In the absence of any other wild cat, the tiger faces no competition for territorial dominance, he added.But the continuous presence of the tiger is posing a great threat to the life of the villagers. In case they come face to face, the tiger may kill or injure humans, the forest officials said.Earlier, forest department tried to persuade villagers to allow elephants into their cropped fields to locate and tranquilize the tiger. However, villagers declined outright saying they did not want their crops to be trampled upon and destroyed. The forest officials had to bow to their wishes as there is no provision to compensate them for damaged crops.Singh said under the circumstances, he had sought WII's help. ""As the team of WII is believed to be much more experienced in analyzing the big cat's nature, it will be capable in helping the department to a find a solution,"" he added."

The bid to broadbase voting rights, coming on the back of a massive loan waiver, is the second significant outreach by the regime in the agriculture sector.Currently, elections for the board of directors are held every five years and only a select few nominated members cast their vote.These voters are nominated from village level rural co-operatives like the primary agriculture credit societies (PACS), primary milk collection centres, sugar co-operatives and animal husbandry institutions. These have presence in almost all the villages and act as agents of all the district level co-operatives.For years, Congress-NCP leaders have been running most of these co-operatives, be it the sugar mills in western Maharashtra or the milk co-operatives which procure farm produce. This has created a system of patronage for farmers. ""People managing these village-level institutions are also close to political parties and the people they nominate as voters are also linked to the party in some way or the other and the monopoly never seems to end,"" said an official. ""The idea is to increase the number of voters, as a small set of voters can easily be manipulated and controlled,"" said another official. On an average, one DCC bank covers 1,500-2,000 villages, and the number of voters for one bank is nearly 4,000-5,000, while the number of farmers who take loans from a DCC bank are around 1.5-2 lakh. That's how small the group of voters is, explained an official.Senior officials said that this will also help the farmers in a big way, because it is a known that getting a crop loan on priority also requires good relations with the people managing the bank.The state government had formed a committee under the additional commissioner of co-operation department to study the framework of the new rule. The committee has submitted a positive report and implementation will begin soon, said sources from the department.This will be the BJP 's second attempt to snatch control of key institutions from the opposition, it has already made ammendments in the act to allow farmers to vote in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC)."

Development should be taken up depending on the conditions of each village.""Pointing to some of the government's schemes such as Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, which were geared towards bringing about improvement in rural areas through formulation and delivery of development programmes, Mani added, ""These schemes must be utilized.""Although a number of programmes have been rolled out, and implemented, since 1952 for the development of rural India, Mani asked if the objective had been achieved. ""In my opinion, the objectives have not been met. This is because of poor participation from people, the indifferent attitude of officers implementing government schemes. Moreover, the support extended to these programmes by local representatives is also open to debate,"" he added.Mani said that development schemes had taken on different forms and names. ""Initially, they were referred to as rural development schemes, then they were called community development that involved the residents. Now, it is being called sustainable development, where a place is developed using the resources available there, and preserving them for the next generation,"" he added.'Resources not used properly'""In Israel, farmers cultivate crops throughout the year even though annual rainfall is just around 600mm, while in my state, Tamil Nadu, farmers are struggling to sustain for one season despite the rainfall being more than 900mm. This suggests that we have to learn how to utilise our resources,"" said Mani, adding that growing water-intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane led to depletion of resources."

And the medical certificate for an 84-year-old is issued.Outside a clinic near the RTO in Anna Nagar , staff from various driving schools queue up. The man inside doesn't look up as each person comes forward and drops bundles of medical fitness certificates for examination, concerned only with the `100 submitted for each application. A few hundreds are enough for driving schools to get physical fitness certificates for clients who want to renew their licences without the paperwork.The result: ""At least 10% of road accidents happen because the driver isn't medically fit,"" says senior neurosurgeon Dr K Ganapathy who has conducted studies on road safety.A recent 10-city road safety survey by SaveLIFE Foundation, NGO, showed that more than half of the respondents from Chennai did not take a test to get a licence. And it is anybody's guess how the renewal requests are processed.Ganapathy recalls details of two of his patients who were admitted after an accident. ""I was shocked to discover that one of them was epileptic. He used to have convulsions at least twice a day,"" says the doctor. The other was a 77-year-old man, who was completely blind in one eye. ""Both of them were clearly not fit to drive, and the authorities had no business giving them a medical certificate,"" he adds.According to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, those applying for a non-commercial licence have to fill a self-declared fitness certificate. However, those wanting to renew licences will have to furnish a medical certificate issued by a registered doctor. ""At the learner's level, we also ask for a copy of a lab report of the applicant's blood group,"" said a senior transport official, adding that RTOs have also been asked to insist on fitness certificates for renewal requests above the age of 50. When TOI spoke to driving school owners and RTO officials, no one seemed to know the exact age group under scrutiny.Doctors say any disease that over time affects sensory, motor, or cognitive ability can influence driving ability. ""Even if they have a heart problem, they pose a danger to themselves and people on the road,"" says Dr Prithika Chary, a senior neurologist who recently came across a case where a driver lost control after his sugar level dropped. Medical examination, doctors say, should go beyond just preliminary vision tests. ""The doctor should go through a person's medical history, check for episodes of epilepsy, heart attack or any other condition that could affect mobility. Only then provisions must be made for an annual licence,"" says Dr Chary, adding that examination must be more rigorous for senior citizens."

While we must keep politics and politicians at bay, the best thing we can do at present is to make the Cauvery Family functional again,"" said Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president, All-India Sugarcane Growers Association, a member of the body.Shanthakumar, who represents the peasant community from Old Mysuru prov ince, said plans are afoot to organize a farmers' meet under the aegis of the Cauvery Family in September. The meet to be attended by farmers from the riparian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and Puducherry would mark the family's revival. The leaders would chalk out a plan of action to reach out to both governments and farmers of the stakeholder states.Irrigation expert Captain Raja Rao sees the development as significant as it comes in the wake of the Supreme Court hearing on the water-sharing dispute, while the political scenario in Tamil Nadu is changing from what it used to be in the J Jayalalithaa era. ""The SC judgment expected at the end of the ongoing argu ments will supersede the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal's award, and hence it will have a ramification on the political and social scenario in the riparian states. The role of social organizations will be significant in that context,"" said Rao.S Janakarajan, founder of the Cauvery Family, said the group will wait for the SC verdict before firming up plans to bring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers together. Farmers can be convinced if the court's formula is agreeable to both sides and politics is kept aside.""Farmers from the two states are friends and politicians are trying to make them enemies. I am sure, we can keep the enmity at bay,"" Janakarajan said.Janakarajan, former economist from Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) and president of South Asia Consortium for Inter-dispute Water Resources Studies, attributed last year's violence in Bengaluru to the political chauvinism of both states. ""The focus of the Cauvery Family is not just on sharing of water, but groundwater depletion, river water management, pollution load on the river and the requirement to change crop pattern,"" he said."

They were working in a sugarcane farm owned by one Pushparaj at Keelathur village in Alangudi when a team from the district administration led by sub collector R Jeyabarathi rescued them.Among the rescued were 27 adults  16 male and 11 females  besides seven children  four girls and three boys. None of the children goes to school and have access to medical facilities or proper food. They will now be taken back to Villupuram from where they were brought by an agent named S Kumar hailing from Vikramapandi to work in agricultural farms in various districts.They were taken to a farm in Trichy 18 months ago on the promise of good salary and were given Rs 3,000 as one-time payment. Thereafter, they were not paid anything and made to work day and night. Striking a deal with agricultural land owners, Kumar used to take them in a vehicle and make them toil. Made to live in makeshift arrangements, they used to be shifted from one place to another and Pudukkottai was their fourth destination after Trichy, Tirunelveli and Sivagangai. ""They were treated in the most inhumane way possible,"" says secretary general of National Adivasi Solidarity Council K Krishnan. ""It was shocking to know that among the rescued was a 20-year-old woman pregnant for eight months. She was not allowed to visit hospital and hasn't taken even a single vaccine so far,"" said Krishnan. ""Beaten up by Kumar and his associates when asked about salary or permission to return, many a days they were forced to live on porridge and gruel,"" he said.They were not allowed to return to attend even funerals of their relatives. Krishnan, who met relatives of these people in Villupuram as part of creating awareness on RTE act, was informed about the group taken by Kumar for agricultural work . The accused, hailing from Villupuram and who has been acting as an agent to these people, is absconding. Sub collector Jeyabarathi assured that strict action would be initiated against Kumar who had forced these people into bonded labour.

The Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture has developed a hybrid of Lucknow's Dussehri and Chausa varieties, which it says is a perfect mix of both. Named CISH-M-2, the hybrid ripens at the end of the Dussehri cycle and just before Chausa hits the market. It is shaped like the 'mother' Dussehri but the taste is a blend of both, the institute said.The hybrid will now be tested in other labs of the country to assess its commercial viability. CISH said the hybrid's shelf life is comparable to Dussehri and it is easy to grow without any specific culture or precautions, they said. The institute has also crossed Dussehri with Florida's Tommy Atkins mango and the fruit it bore had low sugar content and red tinge on the skin while retaining the shape of Dussehri. Another cross between Neelam and Tommy Atkins matures when the mango season ends.These hybrids are among 6,000 varieties CISH has developed in 33 years of its mango hybridisation programme. These include mangoes with exotic names like Eldon, Bride of Russia and Sensation, which resulted from crossing varieties from Brazil with those from Lucknow and Varanasi, such as Dussehri, Chausa and Langda. After rigorous evaluation, the institute has been able to release two varieties for farmers to grow. Ambika is a hybrid of Amrapali (from Lucknow) and Janardan Pasand (from the south), and Arunika, a cross between Amrapali and Vanraj (from Gujarat), are grown by farmers and are being sold at premium prices. Both varieties can adapt to different climatic conditions in the country. The focus of the programme is on regular varieties with reddish peel, suiting the preference of the export market, hence the crossing of local mangoes such as Neelam, Vanaraj and Janardhan Pasand with mangoes from Brazil and US. One of the hybrids has a paper-thin stone.""Some of these hybrids are high on beta carotenoids (pro vitamin A) and leupol in the pulp while some others are about 15% sweeter than the sweetest Dussehri,"" said CISH director Shailendra Rajan.Strangely, one of the most popular and highly exported variety, Alphonso, finds no place in the programme. ""Hybrids of Alphonso as male or female parent are not successful in the north, given its poor yield and moderate quality in this climate. In Lucknow, Alphonso is a shy bearer and matures late during rainy season and is not as attractive as the Ratnagiri Alphonso either,"" said Rajan.The product is heavier when Langda, Chausa, Kensington and Bombay Green as female parents are crossed with Rumani, Totapuri, Eldon and Vanraj. Similarly, hybrids of Surkh Burma and Tommy Atkins and Eldon, Vanraj and Tommy Atkins and Eldon and Vanraj have red peel like no other. Mango hybrids take more than two decades to reach the market because tonnes of the fruit are required for developing a variety that is feasible."

The area under pulses went up 6.9% y-o-y to around 1.15 crore hectares during the timeframe. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a normal monsoon for 2017-18. Monsoon showers have been well-distributed so far with cumulative rainfall at 102% of the long period average. Interestingly, the sowing for cash crops such as sugarcane, which see extensive use of fertilisers, has shot up during the current kharif season. While the area under sugarcane increased 8.7% y-o-y to 49.15 lakh hectares, cotton sowing jumped 20.8% y-o-y to 1.12 crore hectares, data showed.But some market experts are advising caution given the steep increase in prices of these scrips.

Agricultural loan waivers in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh will also put more money in the hands of farmers, the agency said."

The long dry spell in the first half of July could have had a long term impact on total sugar output.The district has been receiving heavy rain since last week after the dry spell of more than 15 days. Continuous rain filled major dams in the district up to satisfactory levels. Sugar experts have called the week long spell a major boost for crushing in the upcoming season.As per the information of regional sugar joint directorate, the district has cultivated sugarcane on 1.42 lakh hectares. The long dry spell could have had an impact on tonnage. But good rain has assured farmers and millers about their estimates for this crushing season.Sugar expert and executive director of Shahu Maharaj cooperative sugar industry Vijay Autade said, ""The monsoon spell has provided a big relief to farmers and millers. The situation was critical only a fortnight ago. The long halt in rains could have impacted the final output. Now major dams have reached satisfactory levels. Therefore we can expect to reach estimated output for the upcoming season.The regional sugar directorate has estimated 173 million tons as a primary figure for 2017-2018 season. However, a good monsoon could further increase crushing.Another sugar expert P G Medh said, ""The three months June, July and August are important for sugarcane growth. Many farmers cultivate sugarcane in June and July to take advantage of natural irrigation. But the long dry spell had scared farmers and stakeholders in the sugar sector. Diseases were appearing on the crop due to fluctuations in temperature. But good showers since last week brought a smile on farmers' faces.""Medh further added, ""Two years ago, the district administration had put restrictions on water pumping due to poor monsoon. It affected sugar output in 2016. But we will not face a similar situation this year.""The district is known as the sugar bowl and has the highest sugar recovery in the state due to an abundance of water for irrigation."

So far, six have succumbed to the virus in the state and more than a dozen are under treatment across private hospitals. A 37-year-old man from Behala, who died at the CMRI Hospital on Tuesday evening, was the last victim.Once a contagious virus like H1N1 infiltrates a thickly populated city like Kolkata, it is difficult to get rid of it, said microbiologists. ""It has mutated and become a permanent member of the city's viral load. Now, it will be difficult to contain its spread during the season since H1N1spreads very easily through droplets. In a city like Kolkata, any crowded place is potentially dangerous. But swine flu is not a fatal infection, so there is no need to press the panic button,"" said Irfaan Akhtar, consultant microbiologist and infection control officer, Fortis Hospital.The Behala resident, who died of swine flu on Tuesday, had been admitted to hospital on Sunday . He had all the symptoms of H1N1, including a severe breathing disorder.He had been kept in an isola his condition didn't improve. The death was confirmed by the health department on Thursday . ""We have just received a report from the hospital.It will be checked,"" said BS Satpathy , director of health services.Even if symptoms are severe, they can be easily controlled with paracetamol or Tamiflu - a dedicated swine-flu drug - unless the patient suffers from low immunity. ""Children and the elderly are vulnerable. Also, people suffering from diseases like asthma, blood sugar or COPD are at risk. So are pregnant women. But if you take drugs early enough and prevent dehydration, then you should be safe,"" said Debkishore Gupta, head, infection control unit, CMRI Hospital.A few hospitals like CMRI and Fortis have set up isolation wards for swine flu patients. ""It is a very infectious virus, so patients must be quarantined. We already have a unit in place,"" said Gupta.The prevailing weather condition in Kolkata is ideal for the H1N1 virus to thrive, pointed out microbiologists.""Intermittent rainy and dry spells lead to temperature fluctuations. Over the last fortnight, the maximum temperature has been jumping from 28-30C to 34-35C. This is ideal for H1N1 to thrive and spread. What is more alarming is that the virus transmits very easily,"" said Akhtar."

The meeting was held under the the name of 'Vivasayiyai Vazhavidu' (let the farmers to live).A resolution stated that minimum support price (MSP) was the right of every farmer and that it should not be at the mercy of the rulers. MSP should cover all their expenses including education, health and price hike and formulated with the participation of farmers. The outfit stressed the need for the formation of a broad federation to lead the struggle for writing off crop loans, sugarcane dues, hike in 100-day employment scheme, minimum support price, uninterrupted free power supply, irrigation facility and rights on Cauvery river, another resolution added.The conference also blamed the ruling BJP-led government for betraying Tamil Nadu on constituting Cauvery Management Board (CMB) as the Union government had defied the Supreme Court directive to do so.

5a0b2b129855b76bf13cd08a,"Fruit for thought: To pay less for tomatoes, can prejudice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/fruit-for-thought-to-pay-less-for-tomatoes-can-prejudice/,2017-07-16,"Whether you pronounce it to-may-to or to-maa-to (or tamaatar), there is nothing very Indian about the tomate, as Spanish Conquistadors called the fruit (yes, it is a fruit) that grew wild in the Andes. The word tomato itself comes from the word tomatl, its name in the Aztec language Nahuatl. Anglophones likely corrupted it to rhyme with potato. The French, trust them, called it pommes damour (love apples), believing it had aphrodisiacal properties.Stop right there if you are reaching for one. Even without libidinal attributes, the price of this squishy everyday companion to cooking (along with onion) has already hit a new high in India, arousing ire. At Rs 70 a kilo last week, it surpassed the price of mangoes that are on their way out of the market. By this weekend, it had raced into record territory at Rs 100-plus a kilo.Famously, the rising price of tur daal and onion  our meat and potatoes  is something governments are leery of. But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

Nephrologist Dr Shivnarayan Acharya was the key note speaker.While addressing the patients, Acharya said, ""Rainy season is the most vulnerable period for patients post kidney transplant as infectious diseases are on rise and immunity of patients is low due to the medicines after transplant.""""After the transplant, for some time body rejects the newly installed kidney for which medications are given. These decrease immunity in human body. So patients must take extra care in rainy season and try to use umbrellas if they go out,"" added Acharya.Expressing concern over infectious diseases, Acharya said, ""Post-transplant patients must use face masks for at least six month and avoid going to crowded places. They must be more careful in body sanitization and wash hands regularly and definitely before eating anything. They should bath regularly as after transplant skin diseases are frequent.""Acharya also suggested patients to increase diet of food items with high fibre. ""Food items with sugar and fat must not be consumed by the patients because the post-transplant medicines have steroids with high sugar. Thus excess of sugar in such a way can lead to diseases like diabetes and cause complications,"" added Acharya.""Patients must live in airy rooms, with cross ventilation, openings for sunlight and with minimum furniture. Keep a handkerchief and sanitizer constantly with yourself,"" said Acharya.Dr Rajesh Soni president and Dr Shailendra Mundhada , secretary of CIKT were also present during the programme."

However, guar is another animal that destroys sugarcane crops.The forest department provides subsidy to community field solar fencing. The department has also received various complaints from farmers whose fields are located near jungles. Taking into consideration the demands of the farmers, the department has sent a proposal to the ministry of forest.""The forest department has taken several measures to minimise crop damage and reduce deaths due to animal attack. The state government gives community level subsidy for field fencing. There are many issues with community solar fencing like raising funds and consensus for fencing. Therefore, farmers ask for individual subsidy for solar fencing to save their fields. We have sent a proposal demanding subsidy for individual farmer. It could increase demand of solar fencing,"" said Shukla.He added, ""To prevent deaths due to animal attack, we distributed 2,500 cooking gas to fringe villages in the district. It will help us save wood in the jungles.""Asked about what is being done to deal with wild elephant, Shukla said, ""We have formed a committee of three persons. The state government has given its nod for capturing the elephant. But we don't have the permission for its relocation. Earlier, we were planning to relocate the elephant in Tillari forests, but we have not received any permission. Therefore, we do not have any option at the moment.""Sampat Patil, a farmer, said, ""Many farmers are not ready for community solar fencing due to lack of money and other reasons.

We have all been there, haven't we? However, studies show that one of the easiest ways to get your body fit and into shape is by walking for half an hour to 45 minutes daily. Walking is known to improve brain activity and helps a person relax and regular walkers in Bengaluru swear by it. We spoke to a few people to find out how walking has benefitted them.Sibi G, an associate professor at a city college, who has been walking for 10 years, now says that ever since he chose to walk, he has noticed a considerable change in his health. ""I have always been health conscious and I used to visit the gym and exercise. But I felt that brisk walking on a daily basis has had a greater impact. I feel fit, fresh and energized all day long,"" he said. Samdeep Soman, an entrepreneur, also says that brisk walking has improved his health considerably. ""I have been walking for over a year and feel that brisk walking on a daily basis not only helps me stay healthy, but also addresses other problems such as breathlessness,"" he adds.Regular walkers feel that the city's weather and the ample number of parks help them to stick to their fitness schedule. Sibi adds, ""When you go for walks, especially in the mornings, you get to meet like-minded people and you make friends. It is usually a pleasant experience."" However, not everyone feels the same. Samdeep says that the uneven roads here sometimes make it difficult for him to take his walk. ""If you walk on the roads here, it can be a challenge, especially for elders. And usually in the mornings, most of the parks can get a tad crowded,"" he adds. Mary Violet, an admin executive at a city college who walks daily, says, ""Bengaluru is blessed with amazing weather. So that makes it easier for me to walk. But there have been times when I have encountered street dogs. And since you cannot walk on the main roads, I usually prefer walking within my locality, in the by lanes where there is no vehicular movement.""""Walking not only kick starts your day on a positive note, but it also helps you tone your muscles, maintain your body weight and improves your posture,"" says Dr Mallinath, a city-based orthopedic surgeon. When you walk on a regular basis, it controls your sugar levels and blood pressure and also reduces chances of fractures as it increases bone structure, he adds.For a person, who leads a sedentary lifestyle , walking is the best way to start exercising that too at zero cost, says triathlete and ultra-runner Deepa Bhat. So at what pace should a person walk, we ask? ""You can walk at a pace at which you can talk, that's what I tell people. If you can talk while walking without losing breath, that is fine,"" she says adding that the pace can vary from one individual to another. ""Walking gets your metabolic rate going. Once you get out of the house, you have more oxygen supply, you eat better, you eat healthier and in turn you sleep better. It is a complete cycle,"" says Deepa.Busting some myths, Dr Mallinath says, ""Contrary to the notion that walking increases arthritis and related problems, walking in fact reduces chances of arthritis."" ""When you start walking, you set bigger targets and higher goals for yourself,"" Deepa sums up."

Medha and the others on fast were arrested and admitted to hospital.With drones hovering overhead, NDRF personnel stationed on boats on the Narmada, and a dozen ambulances on standby, police waded into the crowd of agitators at Chikalda in Dhar district. Swinging their lathis to break up resistance, they pushed through the NBA protesters but could reach Medha only after an 80-minute tussle.Just before she was led away by police, Medha told reporters: ""This action has been taken by the Modi government and Shivraj Singh Chouhan 's government without detailed dialogue. We believe this use of force is murder of Mahatma Gandhi's dreams in this country.""Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that Patkar was shifted on doctors' advice. ""Doctors advised immediate medical attention for Medha ji and her colleagues due to high ketone and sugar levels that posed a threat to their lives,"" he tweeted. ""Moving them to hospital was required to ensure their well being and long life. We had to take this decision in their best interest.""""We have taken Medha Patkar and others in preventive custody and admitted them to hospital for treatment since their condition was deteriorating,"" divisional commissioner Sanjay Dubey told TOI. Police said about 19 persons, including seven cops, were injured in the melee. NBA activists said that 47 of their own were injured, claiming that around 20 are minors. Protesters smashed the windscreens of four vehicles, including an ambulance.While Patkar and four others were brought to Indore (she is in Bombay Hospital), five were admitted to Bhoj Hospital in Dhar. Two of those fasting with Patkar refused treatment and went on their own, said Dubey.Patkar and 11 others were on fast since July 27 alleging irregularities in rehabilitation of Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) oustees in Chikalda. The government has been trying to persuade her to call off her fast but in vain. Patkar rebuffed chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's tweet to end her fast, calling it 'surface-scratching'.Monday  Raksha Bandhan  began with Dhar collector Shrimant Shukla meeting Patkar at 8.30am to try and convince her. She stood her ground. He returned three hours later, but Patkar again refused, insisting that she wanted to meet delegations from the state and Centre, say officials. At 1pm, Shukla made another attempt. He called Patkar and spoke to her for nearly 16 minutes, but she snapped the call after saying that she will continue the fast even if dialogue is initiated.Around 2pm, police put their plan into action. Preparing for a possible showdown, police had recalled their personnel from Rakhi leave. Forces began to be deployed in Barwani, Dhar, Khargone and Alirajpur districts, in areas that would come under submergence. Pickets were created on Rajghat bridge, which leads to Chikalda village.Finally, camera drones were deployed to keep tabs on the movement of protesters and 12 ambulances were moved into Chikalda. The sight of the ambulances alerted NBA activists that something was afoot but before they could react, police moved in around 5.30pm. Clad in riot gear, they tried to push through to where Patkar has been on fast. NBA activists resisted and scuffles erupted. ""They brutally baton-charged protesters, causing injuries,"" said activist Amulya Nidhi.It was only around 7.50pm that police closed in on Patkar's protest site. As she was being led away, she said: ""Those who are at the helm don't believe in the Constitution written by Babasaheb Ambedkar. Now we will have to take the agitation to a peak. They will have to answer to society."" Nidhi said the NBA fast will continue. ""The remaining six persons who were fasting with Medha ji will resume their protest,"" he said.Stones were hurled at the police convoy as it left but no one was hurt. Tempers soared and protesters raised slogans again. Police forces from nearby areas were rushed to Chikalda to prevent any flare-up."

The state government with the help of 2030 Water Resources Group (2030WRG) has decided to save and divert a large quantity of water, going surplus to perennial crops such as sugarcane , to water-starved rabbi crops like jowar and tur. Maharashtra 's sugarcane cultivation covers less than 4% of the cropped area but uses 70% water for irrigation in command areas. The government hopes to reduce water use in the sugarcane sector by bringing 50% sugarcane cultivation under drip irrigation in two years. Agriculture uses 80% freshwater in the state.The state and 2030WRG on Monday launched the Maharashtra Water Resources Multi-Stakeholder Platform, which will have six members each from government, private and civil society. C A Birajdar, secretary of state irrigation department, said while diverting 50% sugarcane water to rabbi crops, such as gram and other vegetables, the use of the remaining water for sugarcane will also be optimized to ensure greater sugarcane production over 1.5 million hectares.Studies show Maharashtra faces a high risk to climate change with longer dry spells, more frequent droughts and high-intensity rainfall. Already, farmers in rain-fed areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha are hard hit by recurrent droughts. However, a recent 2030WRG's hydro-economic analysis shows Maharashtra can achieve 6% agricultural growth in rain-fed areas by shifting to higher value crops, and through better and more efficient water use and management.Bastiaan Mohrmann, co-lead, Asia, 2030WRG, said the project will improve the livelihood and strengthen the resilience of marginal and smallholder farmers in Maharashtra. ""We are developing a project proposal for $270 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund, a body which aims to scale up climate change adaptation in rain-fed agricultural areas to be implemented across Marathwada and Vidarbha to make them drought-proof,"" he said."

His brother whispered that he had an accident after he and a few friends set out on their bikes in Bengaluru, where he was studying at the time.Doctors told Sujith's parents that he only had a 40% chance of survival; the spine had a T6 level injury while the skull had 18 fractures. Even if he survived, they warned, he would not be able to see with his right eye; he would only have a poor memory and would never walk again. ""They were wrong about the first two. And I am still trying to prove them wrong about the third,"" says Sujith, five years later, over the phone from his home in Mavelikkara. He is on a short visit from Dubai where he lives and studies. ""Because, the power to change any circumstance lies not with the doctors or other people but with the person himself.""The battle with fate continues even though the wheelchair-bound young man of 25 knows that as things stand today, modern medicine has no cure for his condition.He may be hoping against hope but he says that if he were to accept his 'fate', ""then I am done and would not progress"". ""Yes, there are moments when I think, 'Oh man, it is a spinal cord injury and nobody has discovered anything' and it does break me down. But I tell myself, there is a way, there has to be a way.""The thing about accidents is that while it happens in a flash, the full impact on a person's life unfolds bit by bit. ""It happened two weeks before my final B Com exams,"" he remembers. After about five weeks in the Bengaluru hospital where he had to undergo two major surgeries, he was moved to Vellore for rehabilitation. After a month there, Sujith and his mom came to their Mavelikkara home as the doctors said there was nothing else left to be done.Someone then told them about a vaidyan who was supposed to have worked wonders on many and they decided to give it a try. ""Just 20, I was into boxing and so active. I simply refused to accept that I was paralysed and was ready to do anything to get back on my feet."" But what followed was not massage but four months of daily torture. The vaidyan would apply oil and virtually hit him all over, promising that he would be alright soon. The pathyam (restrictive diet) was equally punishing; he was allowed wheat dosa and sugar in the morning and rice and bindi curry for lunch and nothing else.Not only did the diet sap him of all his strength but he also started developing pressure sores which turned septic when the quack applied oil on them. When he started shivering uncontrollably, they called in a nurse who was aghast at the infection level after doing a blood test. He was back in the ICU and the doctors then did a series of plastic surgeries to heal the wounds.""This was a big blow, to say the least. I recovered but had to face a lot of sympathy and negativity from everyone around me who kept saying that I can't do this or that while I wanted to be independent,"" he says. For instance, he wanted to sleep in his room upstairs but nobody liked the idea. But after wheeling himself to the steps, he climbed the 18 steps one by one before getting on to another wheelchair on top and went to his room. This routine was followed every single day of his stay in Kerala.His life brightened after his dad took him to Dubai. In one of the most crucial decisions, he signed up at a nearby gym and started exercising regularly though many were sceptical that he wouldn't be able to do much training. As his upper body gained strength, he got back his confidence too. If his mom took him there initially, he soon started going there all by himself. ""Today, I take the metro and go on my own,"" he says, proudly. He has even taken a plane journey without anyone to assist him. In 2015, he passed his B Com and is now studying for CFA and aspires to be an investment banker.Life took another turn when a radio jockey called Kris Fade saw one of the gym videos that he has been posting on Instagram and invited him to his show. Later, Kris also made him share his experiences at an event and the video got shared by many. He has already been invited by several corporates to speak to their employees.Is he on his way to become a motivational guru? ""Honestly, I do not know. But I tell people that if I can do what I have been doing from a wheelchair, for instance: fitness, they have no excuse not to do it. I also talk to them about the importance of not giving up,"" Sujith says.That's no empty boast. Besides hitting the gym every day, he also gets on to his cycle and his standing table where he tries to reactivate his legs. He has already tried acupuncture and chiropractic but in vain. ""Twenty years down the line, if I am alive and still on a wheelchair, then I'll know I have at least tried my 100%. Actually, I have just started."""

Among the officials who faced action are four doctors who have been absent from duty for long.The CM said a probe had been ordered against the doctors. Salary of four months will be deducted from their account.SDM, Nautanwa, Girish Chandra Srivastava, SHOs of Punderpur and Pharenda Vinod Kumar Rao and Chandresh Yadav, casualty medical officers Dr Shailesh Kumar and Ravi Singh, ADO, basic, Mohammad Muzammil, assistant agriculture officer BN Joshi and XCN, PWD, Arshad Kamal were among the officials who faced action.Yogi, who held a Janta Darbar at Gorakhnath Temple before leaving for Maharajganj, also attended a sahbhoj (community feast) with 90 members of Dalit community at a slum area in Chainpur village of Maharajganj.The chief minister was served vegetarian food in pattal (plates made of leaves).He asked the people to keep social harmony intact by ending the practice of untouchability. He also inaugurated a school in Ghooghli area.Earlier, addressing a press conference after inspecting Gorakhnath Hospital run by the temple trust, Yogi said his government aimed at providing 10 lakh houses to the poor in rural areas and two lakh in urban areas under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.The government is also planning to promote agro-based industry in UP. The new industrial policy will open the doors for industries in the state, especially in east UP, which has lagged behind in terms of industrialisation, Yogi said.He said the government was planning to create second generation ethanol from agriculture waste which was burnt by farmers. The idea will also help in complying with the orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) which has raised objection over burning of agro-waste as it causes pollution, he added.Replying to a query, Yogi said the new government was focussing on the revival of sugar industry. Out of the five closed sugar mills, the ones in Pipriach and Munderwa will be reopened soon, he said.Speaking on AIIMS at Gorakhpur, Yogi said work was in progress and the government was trying to start an OPD and classes from next year.Replying to a query on encephalitis, the CM said he chaired a meeting with principal secretaries of health, medical education and other departments in this regard. ICU facilities for affected children have been made operational in 20 districts for treatment of encephalitis. Doctors have been directed to ensure no deaths take place in the absence of treatment, he said."

He said the SGPC would take up this matter at the next meeting of its executive and chalk out detailed plan to hold protests against the Union government.""The SGPC anticipates an additional tax burden of Rs 10 crore per annum for running its langar sewa, with further Rs 3 crore tax levy on langars being run at various charity institutions such as Pingalwaras,"" said the president.Badungar said the SGPC was born after a long Sikh struggle, and if the need arises, it would not desist taking to struggle against 'unfair tax.'Reiterating that the GST was 'God Service Tax', Badungar said, repeated pleas before the Prime Minister and the Union finance minister had failed to yield desired results. The Union government was working against the hopes and aspirations of the Sikh community, he alleged.In his letters, the SGPC chief had requested that it be granted the GST exemption on langar purchases the way it was granted an exemption from the VAT. He said under previous tax regime all langar items purchased at Sri Akal Takht Sahib, Sri Amritsar Sahib, Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, Shri Anandpur Sahib and Takht Sri Damdama Sahib were exempted from VAT.He said the SGPC was involved in spreading the message of universal brotherhood, tolerance and respect for other religions and was engaged in noble and charitable deeds and thus no tax should be imposed on offering these services to the society.Badungar said annual costs for langar items such as desi ghee, sugar and pulses comes to around Rs 75 crore. With the shift from VAT to GST, the tax of 12 per cent will be levied on desi ghee, 18 percent on sugar and 5 per cent on pulses, taking the costs up by Rs 10 crore per annum, he added.Meanwhile, the SGPC will take up the issue at the next meeting of the executive which has been scheduled to be held at Kurukshetra on August 18. Besides, the GST issue, the committee will also discuss the issue related to appointment of the officiating Jathedar of Takht Shri Kesgarh Sahib."

Khot, however, refused to step down from the ministry, saying chief minister Devendra Fadnavis would take a call in the matter.""Khot has not performed his duties as a member of the party and has also used objectionable language against workers. His loyalties towards the farmers are questionable and hence we have decided to sack him,"" said Dashrath Sawant, head of the four-member inquiry committee appointed by the SSS to take a call on Khot's removal. Sawant was speaking to reporters in Pune.Sawant said, ""The SSS has a minister of state berth in the Fadnavis government. Since Khot has been ousted from the organization, he must quit as minister.""Asked whether the SSS would withdraw support to the state government, Sawant said, ""A call will be taken by the state executive.""It may be mentioned here that the SSS has no elected member in the state legislature. Khot was appointed as a minister through the BJP quota. The SSS has an MP in its president Raju Shetti. The BJP feels the need to keep an alliance going with the Swambhimani Paksha because the SSS has a strong presence in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra.Khot had recently appeared before the SSS inquiry committee which was mandated to probe his ""anti-party"" stance and other activities since he joined the state cabinet. Shetti has been expressing displeasure over Khot's growing proximity with the BJP.Interestingly, SSS had a pre-poll alliance with the BJP and it was Shetti who insisted on Khot being included in the cabinet. However, Shetti and Khot fell out over various issues including the latter promoting his son in politics.Speaking to TOI after his sacking, Khot said, ""I have toiled day and night for the farmers. I have made every possible effort to take decisions for their welfare. Shetti has formed an alliance with different parties at different levels and takes decision without consulting anyone. He is an opportunist politician and takes decisions based on what he can get for his benefit.""Asked whether he would join the BJP or float a new party, Khot said, ""I cannot speak on this issue now. I will have to talk to my followers before announcing a future course of action.""Meanwhile, Shetti said it was up to the state government to decide on retaining Khot as a minister. Speaking to reporters in Kolhapur, he said, ""Our inquiry committee worked for more than a month and held discussions with several party officials before deciding to expel Khot. As per my information, there were several complaints from party activists regarding his style of functioning which might have resulted in his removal.""Shetti said, ""Our party has already given an ultimatum to the state government over the issue of loan waiver. We will soon hold a meeting of party workers to discuss continuing support to the government.""Meanwhile, senior BJP leader and cabinet minister Chandrakant Patil told reporters, ""This is an internal issue of the SSS and I don't think it is appropriate for me to comment. The chief minister has the right to take a call on Khot. His decision will be final."""

5a0b46389855b76bf13cda78,The think tank and the ashram,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-think-tank-and-the-ashram/article19255050.ece,2017-07-11,"Anniversaries often become moments of rhetoric and hypocrisy rather than a space for recollection, a crossroads about future strategies and debates. One needs to rethink them. The more literally charismatic the person, the greater the attempt to embalm him in mothballs. The Gandhian idea suffers most from it as the regime plays officially Gandhian, even moving into the Khadi and Village Industries Commission calendar. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the centenary year celebrations of the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad. Between the official rhetoric of Gandhi and the disturbing silence of the civil society lies a huge void that one needs to talk about, discuss openly, if Gandhi needs to come alive as he did in Desmond Tutus Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa.The ashram and GandhiThe relevance of Gandhi is not in doubt. What is in question is the way we articulate that relevance. The ashram as an idea, as a way of life, becomes central to this exercise. The ashram was not just the home of prayer, it was the crystal seed of ethical inventions from weaving to a dream to liberate scavenging. Gandhis experiments on the body had implications for the body politic which ranged from work, walking, consumption to compassion, where the ethical and the political wove together to create a theory of resistance as invention and of democracy as caring. At a recent meeting, the physicist and eco-centric technologist Ashok Khosla put it matter-of-factly. He said Gandhi was no Luddite, but a framework for the future. It is the regime, babbling about climate change and corporate social responsibility, that needs to catch up, linking lifestyle and livelihood. Gandhi was a huge catalogue of inventions where prayer, walking, weaving, writing, bhajans all had to be reworked so that the neighbourhood and the cosmos, swadeshi and swaraj , were in consonance. Central to it all was the ashram as a mode of thought and as a way of life. The futuristic implications of the ashram have not been grasped. Ask yourself, what is the ashram as an act of trusteeship?The ashram was not a place to pickle Gandhi into potted jars of consumability. It was a centre for ethical invention, where spirituality met everyday life to enhance democratic creativity. Think of a few possibilities where civil society rewrites Hind Swaraj to answer the challenge of climate change. A Gandhian trustee would understand that responsibility needs polysemy, that sustainability is a provincial idea till it combines with plurality, justice and peace. For this, one has to go beyond odd ideas of Make in India and the vision of a national security state.The new-age think tankAt a policy level, what is challenging the ashram, vying for cognitive space, is the think tank. There is something brutal about the idea, of knowledge in a Darwinian world, where fang and claw marginalise violence. A think tank technocratises knowledge into a domain of strategy and expertise. An ashram opens up a question to issues of ethics and cosmology. There is a Promethean hubris about the think tank, a conviction that knowledge is subject to problem-solving. An ashram understands the modesty and the limits of knowledge. A think tank invites you to a machismo of power, speaking strategy to power. With a decline of the universities and the debates on knowledge, the think tank has acquired a touch of machismo, hypothecating ethics to the margins. To policy, ashram offers prayer, an understanding of the limits and complexity of knowledge. When one watches think tanks from Observer Research Foundation, Carnegie, Vivekananda, one senses an obsession with security has dispensed with satyagraha . Non-violence is for the laymen and the illiterate. Bad ethics hide behind patriotism and expertise. Each promotes a myth  the first of the nation state, the second of the value neutrality of knowledge. One cannot think of a single think tank which has a clear-cut idea for peace. By specialising in information and expertise, the think tank has lost out on the ethics of epistemology of knowledge. Even war is seen as an act of plumbing, of balancing interests.When one looks at a think tank and compares it to the great social movements of our time, one sees the difference between the new imaginaries of peace, democracy and the conventional ideas of policy. I remember the social scientist Rajni Kothari laughing at the idea of think tanks. He said that ours is the hospitality of democratic theory; a think tank sugar-coats knowledge in secrecy. A think tank commoditises knowledge. He told me if the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies was a think tank, it would not have challenged the Emergency. Only the combined wisdom of the chowkidar, the gardener, the senior fellows, the visitors allowed for the courage of that solidarity. For Kothari, a think tank is too seduced by power to be truly ethically autonomous. Sadly, as political scientists like him disappeared, the lack of a democratic imagination got solidified into the current fetishism about think tanks. The Gandhian ashram has to challenge the alleged efficacy of think tanks.Revitalising the ashramThe Gandhian ashram, without playing partisan politics, can be the centre of the dissenting imagination. It can emphasise that dissent as an act of caring and conscience is always plural. The marginal, the minority, the displaced, the defeated, the informal, the alternative imagination, the subaltern in every sense represent a festival of knowledges rarely represented in constitutional law or a democratic forum. The ashram becomes trustee of the silences, the margins realising that the margin in India is huge, a continent of suffering and survival in its own right. It realises that trusteeship  unlike a bound membership  is not a comfortable chair to speculate on retirement. It is a perpetual summons to conscience and whistle-blowing. Third, it links ideas to lifestyle and livelihood so that one lives for ideas, not off them. Fourth, trusteeship cannot put that memory in mothballs but realise that memory, like language, is a perpetual source of invention. To soak Gandhi in the formaldehyde of nostalgia will not do. A Gandhi lives so long as he is reinvented by every citizen. If trustees even become a think tank, then the Gandhian idea becomes a form of secondariness ready to be museumised. Trusteeship in that sense is the ethics of memory, prayer, invention and goes beyond any official committee. Every citizen becomes a trustee and the ashram a commons for the new experiments in ethics from Irom Sharmila, the woman of Kashmir to the battle of the Narmada dam to the new controversus in agriculture, where experts look on agriculture as a twilight industry.In fact, for me and many others of my generation, one of the greatest ashrams was a science laboratory, the photosynthesis research centre (Shri A.M.M. Murugappa Chettiar Research Centre) in Chennai under the late C.V. Seshadri dreaming dreams of alternative energy, of a poor mans science which was not poverty-stricken in terms of ideas. The slum around the laboratory became a compost heap for ideas of fishing, wind tunnels, ventilation, waste, algae. It was probably the only science lab where the worker, the cleaner and scientist shared a patent, where work, not only science, had a dignity. Seshadri dreamt of an India where Gandhian truths collaborated with scientific truths, where knowledge and lifestyle followed collaborative strategies.Seshadri and Kothari were intellectuals who saw the public more as a commons for ideas, not a space to be hypothecated to experts. He created an ascetic science, not dismal in its morality, but playful in its possibilities. One wishes ashrams today would reinvent that confidence.Rethinking the ashram as a part of the future is one of the great Gandhian challenges, as civil society fights to link swadeshi and swaraj which the current regime  playing to a second-rate nationalism  has disrupted. Reinventing an ethics for the 21st century is a task for the ashram, where spirituality does not lose its sense of the sacred, or ethics its quest for a new sense of science. It is a search for new paradigms and exemplars and Sabarmati Ashram is a true heritage site because it both made history and is futuristic. On its 100th anniversary it is time to retune it, so the great rituals of freedom, faith and inventiveness can begin again.Shiv Visvanathan is Professor, Jindal Global Law School and Director, Centre of Study of Knowledge System, O.P.

Rafeeks extensive lunch menu at the ongoing Ananthapuri Chakka Mahotsavam at the Sooryakanthi grounds in Kanakakkunnu in Thiruvananthapruam.Rafeek of Idichakkaplamoodu has become a familiar face for foodies in the city who flock to the fete each time in the hope of some novel dish made from jackfruit.This year, Rafeek has planned a menu with 101 curries for the sadya served in the afternoon and another 101 snacks. Ninety per cent or more of each dish comprises jackfruit, he says.So be it Chakka Thoran made of the thorns or sweet Kichadi made of the ripe bulbs, one can be assured that there is ample jackfruit in them. Rafeek says the 20 curries served each day will not be repeated the next day. He makes sure that the jackfruit experience does not get limited to tucking into sambar, aviyal, erissery, pulissery, and pickle. Chakka Perattu, fish curry, beef fry, and biryani are all aimed at giving chakka a twist by incorporating non-vegetarian flavours, but keeping the dishes vegetarian.SnacksHe also dishes out snacks that include Chakka Pazhampori, Ada, Uniappam, Bajji, Therali, Modakam, Madhura Chilli, Vada, Puttu, and so on.Besides Chakka Aravana Payasam that he claims will not get spoilt for six months, Rafeek serves Chakka Payasams made of jaggery and sugar. The food court at the festival has a number of stalls selling Unniappam, halwa, cutlets, sweet cutlets, biryani, Chakka beef and chicken, jackfruit and bamboo Payasam, Navara rice payasam, bonda, and other eats."

Sneha, a resident of Srikakulam district, is Rs. 2,000. However, this month she had to cut down on the list of items bought at the retail store as the total bill amount exceeded Rs. 2,400.Earlier, the monthly essential commodities never crossed Rs. 2,000 but this time I have to reduce the quantity of certain products such as butter packets, ghee, dry fruits and sugar syrups and place them back on the shelves after checking the final bill amount, as the tax component has gone up on these products, says Ms. Sneha.Price-conscious buyers who entered the supermarkets to refill the shelves with kitchen staples find it difficult to figure out item-wise price variation.While several outlets are trying their best to get familiarised with the GST structure, consumers heading to the retail outlets ended up staring at the bill for a longer time to figure out which items turned out to be costlier.Comparison not easySince the tax levied on each item varies, it is difficult to identify the expensive stuff by merely looking at the bill copy without having the last months invoice that features similar products, says S.P. Thakur, a naval employee.Those who stick to the strict monthly budget say it takes time for them to assess how much they have to set aside extra to meet their expenditure.This is primarily because certain essential commodities such as puffed rice and bread are tax exempted and some like cheese attract extra 6% tax (earlier 6%). Unless we get into a regular pattern of purchase, its hard to explain the actual difference and plan accordingly, reasons B. Raju, a resident of MVP Colony.With some of the retail stores offering cash back vouchers and special discounts on a range of products, not many are able to trace the variation between the earlier rates and the existing ones.Its business as usualEven in the daily transactions, we dont find any big change and its business as usual across the branches. With respect to the impact on GST rollout, I think it takes a while to get the real picture in terms of business volume, states K. Bhanu Prakash Reddy, store manger of Big Bazaar."

Not even a single hectare of paddy cultivation has been done as of Thursday, according to statistics available with the Department of Agriculture.Various reasonsThere are several factors that have kept farmers from commencing sowing. They are non-release of water into canals; poor monsoon; Cauvery dispute; and the fear of losing crop, say Agriculture Department officials.Speaking to The Hindu , an official added: We had set a target of sowing paddy at 60,067 hectares during the current season and had stocked 1,000 quintals of seeds. But, the achievement is 0% and over 700 quintals of seeds have remained unsold.Cultivation of sugarcane is yet to gain pace. But, the farmers have cultivated ragi, jowar, toor dal, maize, onion, black gram, green gram, horse gram, cowpea, chilli, sesame, red gram, other pulses and oil seeds on around 32,000 hectares, the official said.Generally, sowing operations come to an end by the third week of July in this region.Chances of releasing water to canals are weak as the State has to release 40 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu in July, official sources said.

Though one-third of the water has not filled up the dam, water is being discharged to the river, maintained Mr. Shanthkumar in a press statement.He said farmers in the Kabini command area had suffered losses due to the non-availability of water for standing crops, especially paddy, last year.Mr. Shanthkumar threatened that farmers will be forced to lay siege to the Kabini dam if their demands are not considered."
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

The dealers, in turn, used to put the blame on those manning the MLS points.Their claim was that they were getting lesser quantity thus forcing them to adjust the same among the beneficiaries.Win-win situationThe interlinking of the ePoS machines and the weighing machines at the MLS points, however, brings in transparency in the entire supply chain and minimises the scope for pilferage . It is going to be a win-win for the dealers and to the public as well. It gives scope for transparency in the civil supplies system, says Joint Collector A. Mallikarjuna, who has formally inaugurated the new system at the MLS point at Jaggampeta.Now, the weighing of commodities will be done in an accurate manner at every level. Be it the MLS point or the ration shop point, we will get the electronic data and review it periodically, he said.It may be recalled that East Godavari district pioneered the linking of Aadhaar to the Public Distribution System way back in September, 2012, and the success of the pilot project enabled the Central government to replicate the same in the rest of the country.This is going to be another milestone project in the civil supplies, as we are aiming at supplying the right quantities to the end users by curtailing the pilferage, points out Dr. Mallikarjuna."

Annadurai in the chair, members of Nasuviniyaru Bed Dam Aycutdars Association led by its president V. Veerasenan demanded action on the part of State government to get water for saving the kuruvai paddy crop. They alleged that they were not getting water for the past six years due to which crops had withered.Many farmers purchased and stored paddy seeds in the hope that they could raise paddy during this kuruvai. But their hopes are being dashed due to lack of water. Rats and rodents are consuming the seeds and hence they have no option but to throw them like sowing, not on the fields but here in front of the Collectorate, they said and showered the area with paddy seeds.Kakkarai R. Sukumaran, vice-president, Federation of Farmers Associations of Tamil Nadu, complained that the Centre and State governments, without taking any action, were blaming one another for the fiasco on issues such as crop insurance compensation, Cauvery waters and farm loan waiver while the farmers continued to suffer. To highlight that situation, his followers held each others ear lobes and did sit-ups in front of the officials before staging a walkout.Shortly, members of the Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association led by its secretary Swamimalai S. Vimalnathan assailed the State governments appeal in the Supreme Court against the Madras High Court order on farm loan waiver and demanded its withdrawal. He also wanted the Chief Minister to get water from Karnataka and open Mettur dam for irrigation as soon as possible.Also he slammed the delay in payment of arrears to the tune of Rs. 1,500 crore due to sugar cane growers from the mills and to show their opposition, he and his followers staged a walkout from the meeting."

A drought year is considered as criteria for waiving off loans. The years 2012 to 2015 were drought years, so outstanding loans up to June 30, 2016 were included in the waiver. The deadline for repaying loans over Rs. 1.5 lakh was June 30, 2017 for those who have been repaying regularly, which has been extended for one month.He said farmers can avail fresh loans after being dropped from the of defaulters, and loans will be available according to the rules for different crops. Currently, loans as per fixed parameters are Rs. 30,000 per acre for tur dal, Rs. 40,000 for soybean and cotton crops, Rs. 45,000 for rice, Rs. 70,000 for orange and mosambi (sweet lime), Rs. 90,000 for sugarcane, Rs. 1.1 lakh for pomegranate and Rs. 1.2 lakh for banana.

According to government estimates, 60-70% of the water available in the State is used for irrigation, in which sugarcane has the highest share, of around 25,000 cubic metre water per hectare. Using drip irrigation is estimated to save 7,500 to 12,500 cubic metre water per hectare.Agriculture Minister Pandurang Fundkar said, We will bring 1.50 lakh hectare farmland under drip the irrigation scheme in 2017-18, and 1.55 lakh hectare in 2018-19.

Pramod Kumar, Amit Kumar alias Billu, Sohanveer, and Nepal alias Goverdhan were arrested following a shootout, while four others, including the cab driver, are still at large.Preliminary interrogation and investigation have revealed absconding siblings Sushil and Anuj, both residents of Dadri village, as the main accused. They allegedly roped in their neighbours Gaurav Sharma and Vivek alias Modi for the abduction, said the police.The victim, a native of Telangana and resident of Delhi, works with Metro Hospital. Dr. Goud had booked a cab around 11 p.m. on July 6 from Preet Vihar to Gautam Nagar, where he lives on rent.The driver assigned to him was one who had joined the cab aggregator just three days before the incident and Dr. Goud was his first customer.

She is illiterate and uses a thumb impression for bank transactions. She has never been issued a cheque book, said the officer.Lapses in verificationOn lapses in verification, a cab aggregator source said the abductor had tried to associate himself with the company four time earlier and managed to get in the fifth time. This clearly implies criminal intent, he said.Interestingly, the ransom call for Rs. 5 crore was made to the company instead of the victims family. The abductors had called the customer care helpline stating that they had kidnapped the passenger.They were absolutely certain the company would pay the ransom for the sake of its reputation. They also felt that the cab aggregator had the capacity to pay the huge amount, said Mr. Yadav.Calls from across UPRansom calls from different locations in Uttar Pradesh made using the doctors phone, which the accused would switch off immediately after the calls, made it difficult to trace their location. Mr. Yadav said several teams were formed and they camped in difficult conditions to crack the case.The teams camped in villages, fields, canals and jungles to ensure the doctors successful recovery. The areas covered by them included Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Baghpat, Hapur, Meerut, Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Haridwar, he claimed.The police also spoke to disgruntled Ola drivers to analyse their profile for clues but in vain. The police finally nabbed the four accused with help of technical surveillance and human intelligence.On July 16, the police received a tip-off and followed a vehicle purportedly transporting the abductors. However, the accused managed to give the police a slip by fleeing inside sugar cane fields at Daurala village.They left the car behind, which helped understand their plan and gave us a broad idea of their location, said Mr. Yadav.He added that there were masks, aluminium foil and rubber bands in the car, which the abductors might have planned to use after receiving the ransom.Detailed planThe police received yet another tip-off on Wednesday that Dr. Gouds was being held at Partapur village. The police team surrounded the house. During the shootout, one of the accused got injured in the left leg. Dr. Goud was rescued and handed over to his family, said Mr. Yadav.The police said the accused had planned the abduction in detail, including carrying out the crime during Kanwar season and wearing saffron clothes to conceal their identities."

This is because they are most likely to be chased or bitten by a pack of ferocious dogs which have been wreaking havoc on the campus.A gang of 50 dogs have been roaming around the vast campus throughout the day and night for sometime now. It is a frightening experience for anyone to move freely through the campus. What has left the people solely at the mercy of the canines is that hospital authorities have been washing their hands of the matter claiming it was up to the civic body to act. On its part, the city corporation has been silent on the issue.Suresh Alvar, a trader, was one among the latest victims of the stray dog menace. Being a regular visitor to the campus to supply sugar to a refreshment shop, he went there as usual on Tuesday. When he was busy delivering the commodities, a dog pounced on him to grab the bundles of sugar. ""I was taken aback by the incident. It took a long time for me to come out of the shock because the dog was ferocious. With the help of others in the area, I could break free from the dog. Fortunately, I escaped unhurt,"" said Suresh Alvar.At present, the campus has around 50 such stray dogs moving around the superspecialty building, TB centre, and isolation ward for fever patients. The security guards on the campus also found it difficult to chase them away because the dogs would retaliate. Incidences of dogs biting people on the campus have been reported time and again.The corporation health department which is responsible for catching and vaccinating the mongrels remain mute spectators. ""A veterinary doctor on contract has been on leave for the past 20 days. So, we have not taken up ABC measure. We also have no idea as to what to do to control the menace,"" city health officer (CHO) in-charge B Alli told TOI.An animal welfare activist in the city blamed the city corporation for the menace. ""It is the failure of the government. They should organize NGOs to maintain these ferocious dogs. There is no proper system in place to carry out animal birth control (ABC). If the corporation does ABC for 5,000 dogs every year for three years continuously, they can control the population of the dogs in Trichy. But they are not ready to do so,"" said honorary animal welfare officer G Ramakrishnan . It was unclear if any one of the dogs had undergone ABC which includes anti-rabies vaccine (ARV). The absence of ABC to the dogs may make the dogs prone to rabies attack., which presents an even bigger danger."

Reserve Bank of India's chief general manager in Delhi and Wardha Police Station are other respondents in the case.A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Rohit Deo directed all respondents to reply within two weeks. Rajnish Vyas has been appointed as amicus curiae in the case.He contended that UCO Bank fraud was systematic and organized crime committed by its officers along through illegal transactions where they floated a scheme for financing farmers for cultivation of sugar cane through tie-up arrangements with sugar mills.The amicus brought to fore large-scale misappropriation of public money by the bank officers in connivance with the directors of [private companies. He also pointed about adamant attitude of senior bank officers in not cooperating with the investigating agency. The premier agency is further accused of not showing interest in investigating the crime and exercising its powers.Vyas prayed for directives to RBI to call upon all bank and finance institutions to file a suo motu complaint on financial frauds by framing appropriate guidelines and strictly monitor the same. He also demanded CBI to explore the possibility of invocation of Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, in the financial crimes.He insisted on to look into the grievance made by CBI city office regarding non-cooperation of superior officers of UCO Bank and to take stringent action against them.As per the petition, the UCO Bank floated a scheme under which loans could be granted to the farmers/joint liability groups through industry/mill owner. They're required to prepare the list of farmers, who would be cultivating crops (Soyabean) and they would be guarantors for repayment. The loan amount would be disbursed in the account of farmers/joint liability groups. GS Oil Company allegedly acting in connivance with the officers of UCO Bank in Hinganghat and Wardha disbursed loan amount of Rs25 crore, though the list of farmers submitted was fraud and fabricated.After amount was deposited in farmers' account, it was immediately transferred in the accounts of GS Oils, which clearly shows that it was GS Oil who was ultimate beneficiary. The CBI then registered offences under Sections 420, 468, 471, 34 of IPC Section 13 (1) and 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act."

Mohammed Yunus , 65, of Karachi in Pakistan arrived in India through an illegal ferry from Sri Lanka in May.According to police sources, Mohammed Yunus is a narcotic dealer who pretended to be a nuts trader with business connections in Sri Lanka.Three months ago, he reached Sri Lanka for smuggling. A Sri Lankan agent, who was impressed with his ability to speak languages like English, Hindi, Urdu and Sinhalese, assigned him a task of collecting two cases of brown sugar from an agent in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.The Sri Lankan agent collected his passport and gave him $US 400.Yunus reached Ammapattinam beach in Pudukottai district on May 2. From there, he travelled to Ramanathapuram, Madurai, Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Ajmer in Rajasthan.""The Ahmedabad agent could not deliver the narcotic consignments as promised and asked him to travel back. So he called the Sri Lankan agent asking him to arrange illegal ferry back to Sri Lanka,"" said a Q branch police official who interrogated him.The agent in turn arranged some people at Kilakarai in Ramanathapuram for an illegal ferry.Yunus reached Erwadi Dhargah a few days ago and managed to book a room at a lodge. Based on a tip off from an informer, the Erwadi Dhargah police nabbed him on Saturday.Initially, he was suspected to be a Sri Lankan national, and the Q branch was asked to handle the issue. Further investigation by the Q branch revealed that he is actually a Pakistani narcotic dealer.Yunus had two duplicate Aadhaar cards in his possession with which he used to book rooms in lodges.He secured the duplicate Aadhaar cards - one with a Bihar address and another with Kilakarai address - with the help of a Sri Lankan national at Mannadi in Chennai. His photograph has been pasted on somebody else's Aadhaar cards and he had photocopies of such Aadhaar cards, Q sources said.The Erwadi Dharga police booked Yunus under IPC sections 465 and 468 for forgery, 471 for fraudulently forging a genuine document, 419 for cheating and impersonation and 420 for cheating. He was also booked under Section 14 of the Foreigners Act 1946 and 3 (a), 6 (a) of the Passport (entry to India) Rules 1950 for illegally entering into the country.He was produced before a judicial magistrate in Paramakudi who is in-charge of Ramanathapuram JM court. The magistrate remanded in judicial custody. He was lodged in Ramanathapuram prison. However, he might be shifted to the Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai after obtaining necessary documents, police said.The police also arrested Syed Abutahir and Ajees of Erwardi for assisting Yunus. They were booked for criminal conspiracy under sections of the Passport Act."

Even for the stopgap Rs10,000 loan for sowing needs, nationalized banks have been slow. As a result, out of 89 lakh eligible farmers, only 3,200 could avail of it till Friday.Tiwari pointed out that this year the total khairf farm credit target was hiked by Rs7,000 crore from Rs51,000 cr to 58,000 and nationalized banks were expected to play a bigger role. But the PSU banks have once again failed to rise to the occasion. Last year they had completed 80% of the target by this period. He further claimed that the district cooperative banks, though not in best financial health, have done far better by meeting 50% of their farm credit target.Tiwari has asked the government and NABARD to take strong action against bank officials failing to meet the target set for them. ""The mission is keeping a close watch on the situation. If any farmer commits suicide and we find that banks had failed to provide timely credit to such a farmer, we will take up such cases,"" Tiwari warned.The mission chief has welcomed state government's decision to make drip irrigation compulsory for sugar cane which is a water guzzling crop. He said the mission had recommended it to the chief minister a year ago. Sugar cane is an 18-month cash crop, requiring nearly 25,000 tmc water for one hectare. If drip irrigation is introduced, it will save nearly 7500-12500 tmc of water per hectare.According to the scheme approved by the state cabinet this week, the government will give a loan to farmers of up to Rs85,400 per hectare at subsidized interest rates of 2%. The state government aims to bring nearly 3.05 lakh hectares of land of the 9.42 lakh hectare under sugar cane cultivation under this scheme in the next two years. There are 2.25 lakh hectares which are already under drip irrigation."

Unable to handle the devotees frenzy during the distribution of the laddu hours before the immersion of the deity on the 11th day, the Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee is contemplating replacing the giant laddu that adorns Ganesh's left palm with a smaller locally made one or one made of Plaster of Paris.""This year, there will be no giant laddu or Maha Prasadam prepared by PVVS Mallikarjuna Rao , owner of Suruchi Laddu based in Tapeswaram in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. If no local donor comes forward for the preparation of a smaller laddu, we will go with one made of PoP,"" Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee organising secretary S Raj Kumar told STOI.From the year 2010, Mallikarjuna Rao has been offering the Khairatabad Ganesha the Maha Prasadam that came to be known as the Tapeswaram Laddu. Until 2009, the organizers used to offer a laddu that was no more than 10 kg. Apparently, the laddumaker from East Godavari had visited the Khairatabad Ganesha in 2009 wherein his daughter wondered as to why should the sweet offering to a giant Ganesha be such a small one. Taken in by her observation, Mallikarjuna approached the organisers and offered to donate a big laddu to the deity from then on. The bonanza for the devotees of the elephant god began in 2010. Beginning with a 500 kg laddu that year, Mallikarjuna Rao increased the quantity to 2,400 kg in 2011 to 6,000 kg in 2015. For the donor, making the laddu was a humungous task and a costly one too. The 6,000 kg laddu needed 2,600 kg of sugar, 1,500 kg of ghee, 1,500 kg of bengal gram, 200 kg of cashewnuts, 200 kg of badam, 30 kg of cardamom and cost him a whopping Rs 18 lakh.But by then, the scramble for a piece of the Maha Prasadam turned into a law and order problem, leading to lathicharge on a few occasions during the distribution of the laddu before the immersion. Devotees would assemble by midnight and stand in queues to have the laddu. Besides, in 2013, incessant rains damaged the laddu leading to it being dumped in Hussainsagar. With both the police and organizers pleading helplessness, Mallikarjuna Rao decided to trim the size of the laddu and donated a 500 kg laddu in 2016.For 2017, the committee is scouting for a city-based sweet maker who would come forward and donate the laddu, though not of the size that Mallikarjuna Rao used to offer. If nothing works out, devotees would have to do with a PoP laddu sitting on the Ganesha's left palm. In any case, from now on, the giant Khairatabad Ganesh would make his annual appearance but the giant laddu has taken the bow."

The second presentation was a sassy statement on feminism. 'Of Feminist and Flat Tyres' written by Bianca was tongue-in-cheek take on women empowerment.Ayushie's story 'The Hostel Life' showed the tricks young girls living in hostel play on their parents while 'The Birthday Present' written and directed by Moiz Haque was a not-so-serious take on parenting that had the audience actually sighing with relief as the father decides to withdraw the rather unconventional gift he had planned for his son's coming of age birthday.Keeping to contemporary themes, the play 'Human Resource' written by Raveesh dealt with the slimy side of an HR manager while 'Chakkar Mein Phase Ghanchakkar' was a hilarious spoof on saas-bahu serials. Written by Eshan Sharma, the play had audience in splits as it poked fun at not just the plots on which tele serials revolve but also the players.'The Blackberry Bush', 'Johnny is Late' and 'The Drunk', 'The Scared' and 'The Elevated' were based on varied themes revolving from fantasy to ephemeral thoughts.The clear show stealer was 'Bittu Bechara' written by Nitish and directed by Shantanu. The story veered around homosexuality and culminated at inter-religion acceptance. The racy ride brought the house down with not just quick wit dialogues but commendable body language and acting by the cast.Starting off as a platform for budding writers and directors, Stagecraft Adda has bloomed into a fine repository of talent. ""Out of the seven editions of Sugar & Spice, three have been held this year, such is the rush of young talent flooding this adda,"" said theatre director actor Vikash Khurana, the founder of Stagecraft."

The three are school dropouts and wanted to earn some fast bucks. When asked how the suspects developed their modus operandi, Shinde said the suspects once spotted a man coming out of an ATM kiosk in the Market Yard area. After he kept the cash in a pocket of his trousers, the suspects greeted him warmly and succeeded in stealing the cash.""They continued to keep an eye on the pockets of the pedestrians. If they looked heavy, the suspects hugged the man concerned after asking an address and stole the money,"" Shinde said."

Factories had decided to start trying the new varieties on fields, instead of waiting for the government to release them, to save time.Nine major sugar factories across the state, including Bannari Amman Sugars, EID Parry and Rajshree Sugars, had planted 20 new varieties of sugarcane developed by SBI. ""We gave them the new varieties, with different properties like early maturing (10 months maturing), mid to late maturing (12 month maturation) and short duration varieties (eight-month crops). All of them also show potential for better quality yield and a slightly higher sucrose content,"" said SBI director Bakshi Ram.The varieties are also resistant to the red rot disease and are non-flowering, because flowering leads to a fall in sucrose content, said principal scientist with the institute's crop improvement division, Hema Prabha.""We gave the cuttings of the new varieties to the companies in October 2016. They took three months to multiply them and start distributing them to the farmers they have tied up with. They have been in farmer's fields for the past six months,"" said Ram.By tying up with nine different factories, SBI has ensured that the varieties will be tried across nine different agroclimatic zones in the State including Thanjavur, Nellikuppam, Sivaganga, Thiruvannamalai and Erode.As part of the trial, the companies are set to start evaluating and assessing the sucrose content, especially because many of the varieties are only eight-month old crops.""The companies will start checking the sucrose content at regular intervals from next month, to arrive at the correct time to harvest the crop. Varieties in which the crops can give a sucrose content of around 10% in six to seven months, and the yield is high, will be considered successful,"" said agriculture extension scientist at SBI, Puthira Prathap. ""The whole point of the Sweet Bloom project is to find a successful alternative to the existing Co 86032 variety, the falling sugar recovery rates and yield of which is a cause of concern among farmers and corporates,"" he said.Prabha said, ""Successful short-duration varieties are likely to be preferred by many farmers in the State, especially after the drought. The shortage of water prompted many farmers to harvest immature crops because they feared that the crops would die due to lack of water,"" she said. This in turn had led to many crops having almost zero or less than 5% sucrose content."

And on the occasion of Teej today, Delhiites are all set to gorge on this sweet delicacy, which is sold mainly at this time of the year.Though the festival is mostly celebrated in UP and Rajasthan, for those with a sweet tooth, they don't mind buying ghevar - as is evident in Delhi markets in the last few days - whether they are celebrating at home or not. When we visited Bengali Market, the mithaiwalas shared how they have stocked up on all kinds and sizes of ghevar - malai, kesar or simply plain ghevar to cater to the customers' demand. As Anan Gupta from a popular sweet shop in Bengali market points out, ""We sell around 20kg of ghevar every day. This sweet is only available during this month, so a large number of people buy the sweet around this time. The sale drops after Rakhi.""(BCCL/ Ajay Kumar Gautam)The four varieties of ghevar that seem to be ruling Delhi markets are plain ghevar, malai ghevar, kesar ghevar and kesar-malai ghevar. Girish Aggarwal, who has a shop in Bengali Market, tells us, ""This is the time when ghevar is sold the most. Since it takes almost a day to prepare ghevar, usually, we do not experiment with flavours that only one or two people would buy. We have plain, malai, kesar and kesar-malai ghevar. People enjoy malai ghevar the most. We also have kesar ghevar in small sizes for those who don't want to buy the usual size.""Pooja Aggarwal, who has a shop in the same market, adds, ""Our clientele comes from south and central Delhi. They like sweets, but they are also concerned about their calories. They usually buy plain or kesar ghevar, which do not have a lot of sugar syrup. We make approximately five-six thals of ghevar each day, and each thal has around 70-80 ghevars. At the end of the day, all of them are sold. This shows how popular ghevar is.""(BCCL/ Ajay Kumar Gautam)Geetanjali Sinha from one of the shops in Bengali Market tells us, ""At our shop, 1kg plain ghevar is priced at Rs500 and kesar malai is available for Rs600. The customers are buying malai ghevar the most, which is for Rs560 for 1kg.""The other two shops have the same price for different kinds of ghevar. Plain ghevar is available for around Rs440 per kg, malai ghevar for Rs480, kesar for Rs520 and kesar-malai ghevar for Rs560. Nakul, one of the workers at a shop in the market, tells us, ""You can also have vanilla flavour in ghevar. But those are made only if you take one-two thals of ghevar and you book well in advance.""Though the sweet is particularly associated with Teej, those who love ghevar need no reason to buy it. Kiran Sachdeva, a resident of Sant Nagar, says, ""We don't celebrate Teej, but everyone in my family loves ghevar. I prefer to take half a kilo of each variety whenever I come to the market."" Kamla Singh, a resident of Bengali Market, adds, ""I actually wait for this season so that I can eat ghevar!"""
5a0cb93b9855b76bf13cfa32,Vidarbha pesticide deaths: Probe panel may file report this week,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/YtxwY9FhCdap9ra8aBWx4J/Vidarbha-pesticide-deaths-Probe-panel-may-file-report-this.html,2017-11-13,"Since July, over 40 cotton farmers and labourers have died in Vidarbha, 21 of them in Yavatmal district alone, reportedly of pesticide poisoning. Photo: MintMumbai: The deaths of over 40 farmers and farm workers in Maharashtras Vidarbha region since July has put the spotlight on the abuse of pesticides and lack of protection for those spraying them, even as a committee investigating the case prepares to submit its findings this week.A seven-member special investigation team (SIT) formed by the Maharashtra government to find the cause of farm deaths is likely to submit its report this week, a member of the SIT, who did not want to be named told Mint. The panel was set up on 13 October and given three weeks to complete the investigation. The SIT member cited above said the team has met all stakeholders and nearly completed its probe.Meanwhile, the SIT has come under pressure from two broad sections of stakeholders. Pesticide poisoning deaths have triggered a bitter battle between farm activists, environmentalists, non-government organizations, and advocates of organic farming on the one side and pesticide companies and some sector experts on the other. The activists have held pesticide companies and also genetically modified (GM) Bt cotton seeds including illegally sold herbicide tolerant (HT) seeds responsible for the spate of pesticide poisoning cases. But pesticide companies and experts have cautioned the SIT against arriving at populist conclusions not based on scientific data.Maharashtra has the largest area under cotton cultivation in India4.1 million hectares on averageand Yavatmal district alone has the largest area under cotton cultivation in India4.5 lakh hectares on average. Vidarbha alone accounts for 1.6 million hectares under cotton.Vidarbha and Marathwada alone account for 65% of cotton cultivation in Maharashtra, said a senior official from the Pune-based directorate of agriculture. In the 2017 kharif season, both Maharashtra and Yavatmal districts saw larger than average area come under cotton cultivationmore than 4.2 million hectares in Maharashtra and 4.70 lakh hectares in Yavatmal district, according to the directorate of agriculture. There has been a significant increase in cotton cultivation this season. In the 2016 kharif season, cotton was grown in 3.8 million hectares in Maharashtra because farmers moved towards pulses, especially tur (black pigeon). But since farmers did not get a good remunerative price for tur, they moved back to cotton this year, the official said.Since July this year, more than 40 cotton farmers and farm labourers have died in Vidarbha, 21 of them in Yavatmal district alone, reportedly of pesticide poisoning. At one point in September, more than 800 persons were being treated at different government hospitals in Yavatmal district for pesticide inhalation and poisoning. Farmers and farm workers Mint spoke to in Yavatmal district said less-than normal rainfall, extreme humidity, abnormally high growth of cotton plants, and intense infestation of pink bollworm which forced farmers to resort to higher-than-normal spraying of pesticides and use of different concoctions, were the primary causes.A team of scientists from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) undertook ground surveys in September to find out the reasons for pesticide deaths and came out with a report on 20 October. The report maintains that the majority of the poisoning cases were associated with the use of insecticides like Monocrotophos, Profenophos, Cypermethrin, Fipronil, Imidacloprid and Diafenthiuron. Monocrotophos, the report claims, is the most commonly used insecticide in combination with other insecticides and growth regulators.Monocrotophos stimulates growth and has a greening effect on plant. Use of Monocrotophos has been banned on vegetables in India. However, its use on crops like cotton, paddy, maize, pulses, sugarcane, coconut, coffee, etc., is still allowed keeping in view of its bio-efficacy and cost-effectiveness. According to the World Health Organisation-Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification 2009, Monocrotophos is categorized as Class 1b (Highly hazardous), the CICR report says. Similarly, Diafenthiuron has been classified as a slightly hazardous insecticide (Class III).The CICR report also pointed to lack of protective gear while spraying pesticides; prolonged and frequent direct exposure to insecticides; humid climate during September with day temperatures 20 degrees higher than normal and which induced profuse sweating that facilitated absorption of pesticides through skin; abnormally high growth of cotton plants up to 5-6 feet (1-and-a-half feet taller than the normal height) which forced farmers to direct the sprays above their shoulder height and increased the chances of contact and inhalation of pesticide directly and in higher quantity.Sachin Kathale, a 31-year-old farmer at Kalamb in Yavatmal district, demonstrated in his farm how factors like extreme humidity, lack of protective gear, abnormal height of cotton plants, intense infestation, and depleting resistance of Bollgard II Bt cotton seeds caused poisoning. I myself felt dizzy after I mixed the pesticide with water. I immediately ran under tree shade and rested till I felt better. But farmers and farm workers who suffered more serious inhalation probably did not take precautions and sprayed the pesticide in extreme heat and against the direction of the wind, Kathale said.He said the intensity of the pink bollworm attack this season was unprecedented. I have been growing Bollgard II Bt seeds for the last eight years but never experienced this scale of pink bollworm attack. So, I too did four rounds of spraying, which I have never done before. Obviously, the Bollgard II seeds are losing their resistance to pest attacks, he said.C.D. Mayee, chairman of the Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC) and former CICR director, said it was clear that pesticide alone could not cause such heavy tragedy and that it was a result of multiple factors. Why has it been so rampant only in Yavatmal when there are several other areas of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and even North India where much more spraying is being undertaken by cotton farmers? Let us compare grape or apple plantation sprays. In grapes, on an average, nearly 47 sprays are given but we have not heard any such tragedy. In brinjal in Bengal and Odisha, on an average, 50 sprays are given to control fruit and shoot borer but rarely such tragedy is noticed. The tragedy is the culmination of contractual spraying methods where the same person daily undertakes spraying from morning till evening without any protection mixing incompatible chemicals, lack of protective apparatus while spraying, fog type droplets remaining in air in colloidal state which could get inhaled, and chewing tobacco or drinking water or liquid without washing hands, could expose inner parts to the chemical reactions, Mayee said in an emailed response.A fact-finding team formed by the Delhi-based Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) studied the pesticide deaths and came up with a report that blamed, among other things, lack of regulation over use of pesticides and GM seeds including the illegal HT seeds. Farmers and their use of hazardous technologies is getting more and more desperate in the countrythis is apparent with pesticides and GM seeds and the rampant misuse, with regulators and others turning a blind eye to the unfolding problems. It is clear that end use regulation is not going to be possible since there is no existing mechanism or possible mechanism by which the use of the pesticide by the buyer, after the product leaves the retailer, can be monitored and regulated. The fact-finding team can clearly anticipate chronic health and environmental problems that are bound to emerge sooner or later, especially with the illegal use of herbicide tolerant GM cotton, the report said. The team demanded that the government ban all those pesticides involved in the poisoning cases as well as those pesticides that have been banned elsewhere. The report also demanded that the Maharashtra government revoke licences of sales of these pesticides in the state without waiting for a decision on their prohibition from the government of India.In its submission to the SIT, the Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI), the apex trade body for Indian crop protection industry, has claimed that there is no causal link between pesticide application and alleged deaths reported from Yavatmal district nor is there any observed co-relation between the two. The news that the deaths were caused by occupational exposure to certain pesticides application appear to be motivated rumours spread by foreign-funded activist NGOs subtly exploiting the public suspicion about chemicals and pesticides. Their ultimate agenda is to tarnish the image of Indian cotton as per the dictates of their donors, the CCFI said in its submission to the SIT."

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said yesterday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had directed the amendments once he came to know of the ""practical difficulties"".The final announcement that made eating out cheaper , along with an array of items from wrist watches to chocolates, was made on Saturday.The Congress had been quick to claim credit. Party vice president Rahul Gandhi, who dubbed GST the Gabbar Singh Tax after the arch-villain in Bollywood blockbuster Sholay, said instead of five tax slabs, there should be only one. ""We will fight for one rate, with a cap at 18 per cent. If BJP doesn't do it, Congress will,"" Mr Gandhi had told people in Gujarat, where he is on an election campaign.Rejecting the one-tax demand, Mr Jaitley said while there is scope for further rationalisation, it could be decided only by the revenues that flow in.""Those who are speaking of a single rate GST have no understanding of the tariff structure,"" Mr Jaitley was quoted as saying by news agency Press Trust of India.Explaining the rationale, he said food should have zero tax and essential items should be in the lowest tax bracket. ""Luxury goods, sin products and products hazardous to environment and health can't be taxed at the same rate as aam admi (common man) product. So, wheat, rice, sugar can't be taxed at the rate as Mercedes car or yacht or tobacco,"" the minister said.The minister said the process of rationalisation will continue ""wherever there is scope for improvement and procedural simplification"".Asked about anti-GST sentiment, Mr Jaitley said ""there is an initial reluctance whenever there is a change. But, I have no doubt that in medium and long term businesses will realise that this is a change for the better""."

Terming it an injustice with farmers, he demanded that SAP in Punjab be fixed at Rs 350 a quintal.The former state Congress president said due to lower SAP in Punjab, opposition parties are trying to project it as a decision taken under pressure from the lobby of sugar barons.He said in a release that the central and state governments have been asking farmers to diversify but if they are not given adequate price for their crop, the move could come a cropper.In four years, there has been no increase in the price of sugarcane in Punjab. Today, the retail price of sugar is at an all-time high of Rs 4,100 per quintal. 70% of the sugarcane is crushed by private millers in Punjab so the state government has nothing to lose. Private millers are into power generation, distilleries or breweries from the byproducts of sugarcane so even they wont be affected by the price increase as they make huge profits at prevailing rates, he said.The former state Congress president said due to lower SAP in Punjab, opposition parties are trying to project it as a decision taken under pressure from the lobby of sugar barons which is not the case. To debunk this negative propaganda against the government, an immediate hike in SAP should be effected, he added."

These equipments earlier attracted an effective tax burden of 17.5 % that included 5.5% Value Added Tax and 12.5% excise duty.""The new tax rate on agri-electricals has dealt a body blow to both the farm sector and the small-scale industry manufacturing units these appliances,"" Ratnaraj Pirgal, taxation committee head, Bengaluru Switchgear Manufacturers Association (BSMA).The new tax burden comes at a time when farmers in Karnataka are staring at the fourth successive drought year. The input cost of cultivation has gone up because of the increase in tax burden on various other commodities apart from electrical appliances. The drip and sprinkler irrigation equipment, which attracted 5% VAT, has been taxed at 18% in the GST regime. The tax burden on pesticide sprayers has gone up from 6% to 18%.The price of a 50-kg bag of urea has been increased from Rs 298 to Rs 334. Similarly, the cost of other fertilizers like di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and potash has gone up by Rs 224 and Rs 70 respectively.""We are perturbed by this taxation. Instead of supporting the farm sector, the government has unscientifically hiked the tax burden on farmers,"" said Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president, All-India Sugarcane Growers Association.He pointed out that government policies are doing little to help distressed farmers. For instance, the support price fixed for 1 quintal of rice is between Rs 750 and Rs 900, while the cost to produce is more than Rs 1,000. ""The cost to produce has been further increased due to GST. It'll worsen the situation where farmers are resorting to suicide,"" Shanthakumar added.Twenty-eight of the 30 districts in Karnataka have reported farmers'suicides with even districts in Cauvery basin  Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagara  also recording a high number. Chikkamagaluru in Malnad region saw the highest number of suicides.Jayant Mutha, office-bearer, BSMA, said his association has sent representations to both the Union finance minister and GST Council seeking reduction of GST rate on electrical farm appliances. ""We demand the capital goods and commodities used in the farm sector should be taxed at the lowest at 5%,"" Mutha said.""The GST Council has received many representations seeking revision of tax rates. The council will discuss them in its next meeting on August 5,"" said Ritvik Ranjanam Pandey, commissioner of commercial taxes and secretary (finance)."

Parivartana Trust, which has done a study over the benefits of eco-friendly industries, decided to take up agitations in a phased manner for the revival.Signature campaignTrust president Chintada Ravikumar sought cooperation of all the sections of the society to draw the attention of the government. We planned one lakh signature campaign for the reopening of the factory. It can prevent migration of farmers and labourers from Amadalavalasa constituency. The revival can spur economic and agriculture activity in several mandals, he added.Left parties and Lok Satta Party also urged the government to take immediate steps for its revival since Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had promised it during the 2014 election campaign. Sugarcane growing has come down drastically in the district after the closure of the factory. The government can overcome all the legal tangles if it pays attention. It should also extend financial assistance initially, said Lok Satta Party State vice-president Panchadi Rambabu.The farmers are also hopeful that they would get remunerative price for the produce if factory is in their vicinity. At present, they are selling sugarcane to private factories located in other places, including Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. Currently, they get around Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500 per quintal of sugarcane. They hoped that they can get more price if the factory begins its operations.The officials indicated that revival was not so easy since the issue had been in courts. The government has to pay huge amount to a private company which bought the factory for Rs. 8 crore.The company reportedly sought around Rs. 56 crore as compensation to hand over the factory to the government. The issue was brought to the notice of the Chief Minister. He can announce a revival package to benefit Amadalavalasa constituency, said an official."

Not because its brutal on your body and equally brutal on your soul to inflict pain on another human being, but because of the way it is judged. You can never be sure who wins until the last round. Sitting in the confines of my room, it will be very cruel to judge a fight fought elsewhere, but Vijender Singh did seem a little out of breath at times during his fight against Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China for the Oriental Super Middleweight belt.Even in the best of times, Vijender hates fighting southpaws. It cuts down the angles for his lethal right. It also exposes his body a trifle, just enough for opponents to land heavy blows on his body.On Saturday, there were hits on his face  something he trashes as obnoxious. He hates being hit on his face and like a child, protects it from those lethal lumberjacks that have the potential to disfigure the best faces in the world. On Saturday he was bleeding from his nose.Something not allowed in amateur fights. In the end, coupled with the Chinese not pacing it right  he was a little excited and seemed expended by the sixth round. It seemed very tight.As he admits, I thought it would not have lasted that long, he confesses before rushing to his post-match engagements. He was very good and strong. The below-belt punches took the wind out of me and it is not easy for a boxer to not get unsettled. It took time for me to come back.The nuances of 10-round fights are slowly sinking in. He is slowly shifting from the threeround amateur to 10-round professional fights. The 31-year-old also knew how well Zulpikar fought.I must tell he was fantastic and even offered him the belt as a gesture for being such a great fighter, he says. I dont know whether he will accept it.Whatever the fight seemed to be, Vijender knows it is not easy in professional boxing. Those victories and knockouts early in his career seem just a sugar-coated pill to the bitterness of pain of close victories and even defeats. The more endearing image will be of Jitender Kumar stepping into the ring after almost five years. The 29-year-old former flyweight looked a little jaded early on but for an Olympian, challenges in professional boxing are less than in amateur.I will improve, he declares. Akhil Kumar, as always, enthralled with his typical low guard and heavy half-step waltz on canvas.Message of peace after victory over ChineseSoon after getting the better of his Chinese opponent at Battleground Asia, Vijender Singh urged for peace amid the Indo-China border stand-off. I want to give back this belt to Zulpikar. I hope for peace in the border and the message is about peace. That is most important."

Ravi Raju, noted nephrologist and present Vice-Chancellor of Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences. We have started practising in Sompeta in 1992. During our early career, we found that the incidence of anaemia was more in Uddanam region. There were no testing facilities for blood sugar levels and creatinine in Uddanam at that time.We pondered over the issue and suspected kidney problem. We took the help of Dr. K. Suman of Vizag in the conduct of the tests and subsequently alerted the local media and political leaders of the problem. In 1995, I had approached Dr. Ravi Raju. Though some efforts were made on and off, they did not materialise.I again approached Dr. Raju, when was the Director of Medical Education and he gave a report to the State government, suggesting the establishment of a research centre, but nothing happened subsequently. The report must be lying somewhere, he said.Dr. Krishna Murthy became emotional when recalling the plight of the patients. They did not even have the money to come to our clinics for treatment due to poverty. Some lost the sole breadwinner in their families, while in some families children were orphaned.Gets attentionThe issue got the attention it deserved only after Jana Sena founder Pawan Kalyan went to Uddanam on January 3, this year.There were no coordinated effort till then but after that it caught the attention of the State government and the international community.Mr. Pawan Kalyan had deputed medical teams and started a movement for finding a solution to the nagging health problem, which literally turned the Konaseema of Srikakulam district into a picture of misery due to CKD, he said.Rajesh of JSP, however, said JSPs objective was to show how Peoples power can move people in power."

After taking a meeting with the local leaders of Congress in Jalore he advised everyone to start the day at 8 am to visit as much as villages he can on Tuesday.""The PM visited a flood affected village in Gujarat, which is just 40 kms away from Jalore but did not come here. If he had, the relief and rehabilitation work should have gained momentum. Situation is really bad,"" Pilot said while talking to TOI on the way to Keelwa village that comes under Sanchor constituency of Jalore.After reaching at the village Pilot distributed a kit to the victims. ""After the floods when everything washed away and people are not been able to move out to purchase grocery we have prepared this kit which can serve the kitchen of a family for next 15 days. It has pulses, ghee, cooking oil, tea, sugar and other items,"" he said while addressing the villagers.After reaching Banwarla village when he was told that SUV carrying him can't move further due to heavy water, a tractor was arranged. ""There is no point in just coming at the bus stand of village and leave. I would like to go and see inundated houses and the damage,"" he said while asking a party worker. Addressing the victims, he said, ""I am here to tell you all that we are with you in this hard time.""On his experience of floods, he said, ""People have lost their kin, their crops, cattle and above all their houses at many places. It is hard time for them. I hope state government will ensure proper aid and rehabilitation for them."" During the visit he also took memorandum of the affected people and listened to their problems carefully.Senior cabinet minister Rajendra Rathore, on Tuesday lashed out at Pilot for a delayed visit to the affected areas. In a statement released on Tuesday, Rathore said, ''it is ironical that Pilot finally visited the affected areas - after 198 hours. Meanwhile, the government has already launched relief and rehabilitation measures there.''"

Against 11 lakh tonnes of cane crushed by the units last year, it was expected that the sugarcane production by the time the factories were lighted up would be 22 lakh tonnes. Last year, drought had resulted in less than 50% production on 29,000 hectares of cropped area.The Director of Sugar and Cane Commissioner, Bhadru Malloth, said 2.2 lakh tonnes of sugar was expected in the coming season. Yet, Telangana would be way behind the demand of the State, which was 7.5 lakh tonnes, based on the per capita consumption as per the 2011 Census. The balance was met by purchases from the international market.Sugar production in Telangana has gradually decreased from 2005 when the cropped area of cane was the maximum and the sugar mills operated to 100% capacity. Now, the crushing capacity of the mills was only 68% as farmers shifted to other crops since the price of sugar was highly fluctuating and also due to non-availability of labour and lack of irrigation facility.The adverse conditions led to the closure of three units of Nizam Deccan Sugars Limited, a joint venture company, at Metpally, Bodhan and Mumbajipally and also the Nizam Cooperative Sugar earlier. Two of the seven existing private mills belonging to a prominent Congress leader also turned sick and went to the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR)."

They also submitted documents such as FIR, panchanama, and loss assessment reports by the village accountant and revenue inspector.In its defence, Gescom contended the charges on multiple grounds, including that the complainants were not its consumers and no power was supplied on that day as power was diverted to Jewargi town for a political programme. It also levelled counter-charges that the complainants, in connivance with public authorities and eyewitnesses, had hatched a plan to malign the utilitys image and to extort compensation using bogus documents.After hearing both sides and examining the documents produced and the recorded statements, the forum dismissed Gescoms arguments and upheld the complainants claims. It held that all the four siblings were consumers of Gescom by virtue of the eldest among them being a consumer and all of them being members of an undivided Hindu family.The forum also dismissed Gescoms claims that there was no power supply to the area on that day. [Opponents], in their efforts of escaping from the liability, have pushed up a theory that there was no power supply to Daishangi village... No such proof has been ever led before us, the forum said.It quoted the National Commissions verdict in the DHCVNL V/s Didhya Devi case and said, Electric companies transmitting energy [are] duty-bound to maintain and ensure safety and security of persons, animals and other objects. When exposed wires cause damages, the service provider [should] compensate the losses."
5a0dae9e9855b76bf13d0c01,In Karnataka  low rain drying up Cauvery,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/in-karnataka-low-rain-drying-up-cauvery/article19437612.ece,2017-08-06,"A severe deficit in rainfall in the Cauvery catchment areas of Karnataka could now lead to another crisis year for farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.What is the problem?At a deficit of 34% compared to normal monsoon rainfall, Indian Meteorological Department data show that the south interior Karnataka region, which encompasses the Cauvery catchment, is currently witnessing the worst monsoon in the country. In Tamil Nadu, the shortfall is 20%; and theres a 30% deficit in Kerala. Earlier this week, four major reservoirs in the Karnataka side of the Cauvery basin had a storage of just 43.18 tmcft (thousand million cubic feet). This is barely 40% of total capacity, and is even lesser than the 51 tmcft recorded last year (a drought year).In Mettur dam in Tamil Nadu, the biggest reservoir along the river, water storage was 10.35 tmcft or barely 10% of total capacity.Experts say the same conditions which saw record rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan in July caused the Cauvery deficit. Off-shore troughs or depressions (areas of low pressure) in the southern Arabian Sea or the southern Bay of Bengal allow for accumulation of south- west monsoon clouds in south India. This year, however, the depressions were off the coast of Maharashtra and Gujarat, and rain-bearing monsoon too migrated there.Locally, other factors may have played a role in reducing reservoir levels. According to environmentalists, large-scale deforestation in the Western Ghats, continued sand mining and the inability to revive tributaries have led to declining health of the catchment area and river capacity. Adding to this is the heavy dependence on the Cauvery for water-intensive crops such as sugarcane and paddy, which dominate the agrarian landscape, and the proliferation of borewells, which have had an impact on surface run-off.What is the fallout?Any deficit in the Cauverys source has a cascading effect through the basin, leading to agrarian distress. The crisis has deepened as the region is still reeling from three consecutive years of drought. There has been a spate of farmer suicides, assurances of loan waivers, and protests including those by Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi.This year, Karnataka has already stated that water will not be released for Kharif crop sowing. Instead, preference has been given to drinking water needs, estimated to be 30 tmcft (more than half of it for Bengaluru city alone) till the next monsoon. With lower water release from Karnataka, the main samba crop in Tamil Nadu will be under threat. Last year, Tamil Nadu, which is in the grip of an unprecedented drought, had witnessed a 41% dip in sowing area.What next?Preparations for drought have started, with the Karnataka government drawing up a contentious Rs. 30 crore plan for cloud seeding (spraying clouds with silver iodide to amass rain-bearing clouds).However, many experts say this will do little to alleviate the situation.For now, all eyes are on the Supreme Court which is hearing appeals by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala challenging the 2007 Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal award. The share of Cauvery had been determined as 270 tmcft to Karnataka and 419 tmcft to Tamil Nadu, among others.This year, conflict over water-sharing is bound to rise again. In June and July, Karnataka was to release 44 tmcft to abide by the award. So far, just 7 tmcft has been released.With elections looming in the State, water release is a politically-sensitive issue. Last year, Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles were set on fire in Bengaluru and one person was killed after the Supreme Court order to release water.Moreover, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah hails from the Cauvery belt and it is here that the Congress has to perform well if it hopes to return to power in the State; the BJP is in a bind as the NDA-led Centre cannot be seen as favouring either of the States.Mohit M.

And the reverse is also true.These energy bars are delectable as well as nourishing, but they are not available commercially, leaving the milch cattle yearning and the farmers clueless.When the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) initially prepared the Urea Molasses Mineral Block (UMMB) on a small scale, it was meant for buffaloes and hence tentatively named as buffalo chocolates, but today it is the most-liked delicacy for cows, buffaloes, sheep and goat.The cube-shaped bars are made of molasses (bellapu maddi), urea, mineral mixture, soyabean meal, maida, cement, calcite etc., which gives a salty taste, a welcome diversion for the animals from the insipid fodder and cereal mixture. Farmers hang a bar weighing 2 kg from the roof in the middle of the barn, which the animals will lick from time to time. One such bar gives sufficient energy supplement for two to three cattle or 10-15 sheep in a shed a day.A hit among rearersB. Devasena, animal nutritionist and professor at Sri Venkateswara Veterinary Universitys (SVVU) Livestock Farm Complex, told The Hindu that the SVVU displayed the product at its Kisan Mela held recently, which turned out to be a hit among cattle rearers. However, the product is not commercially available.Since molasses are misused to brew arrack, there is restriction on its sale. Even the sugar cane factories can sell it only with the permission of the Excise Department, which is considered a hindrance in its procurement, Dr. Devasena adds.The bar is not suitable for calves aged below six months and also for cows that have not eaten for a whole day.It is up to the entrepreneurial lot among the veterinary graduates to venture into what could be an unexplored, yet highly remunerative domain, to fill the gap, thus ensuring a win-win situation for all the stakeholders."
