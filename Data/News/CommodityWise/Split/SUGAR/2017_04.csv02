Next hearing is scheduled on August 11.Ultimatum came along with a warning that if SPCB failed to comply with the directions, NGT will be compelled to attach the treasury account of the state. That is state will have to pay up for the pollution caused from its own coffers.Apart from Rajasthan three other states - Haryana, UP and Punjab too have failed in giving the details to NGT.Earlier, the tribunal had also asked these states to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers.However, officials of SPCB expressed their surprise over the orders and claim that report has already been submitted to the tribunal. They claimed that Rajasthan is a part of a committee constituted by the ministry of environment and presented all facts and figures before them.""We have already notified and banned any sort of crop burning activities in the state. The practice however is not much prevalent in Rajasthan barring few pockets of Kota and Sriganganagar"" said a senior official of RSPCB.For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane.It was observed that crop burning is a major contributor to Delhi's winter air-pollution. With parts of Rajasthan from Alwar and Bharatpur district falls under national capital region (NCR), Rajasthan too was asked to take preventive measures."

Hence, agricultural activity and crop production for the kharif season is set to take a hit though intermittent rains as being witnessed since the last few days may help salvage the standing crop to a certain extent. Besides, agriculture takes place under rain-fed conditions on 2,82,000 hectares, while only 1,14,100 hectares comes under irrigated land. Hence, inadequate moisture is bound to affect crop yield.The uncertainty is also indicated in a lull in farmers availing fresh crop loans from commercial banks, according to a senior official of a nationalised bank. He said there were not many farmers seeking renewal or re-phasing of the current outstanding loans for the kharif season this year.There is a general perception and optimism among farmers that the government may declare a drought and announce a loan waiver and hence, farmers are hesitating to pay the interest component or even rescheduling their loan payment, he added. There were nearly 1.7 lakh crop loan accounts in the district, besides 2.5 lakh agricultural loan accounts in the district.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, told The Hindu that farmers were more keen to raise personal loan to eke out a living owing to successive crop failure because of drought rather than avail fresh agricultural or crop loan.The rescheduling of crop loans and raising fresh loan for the current year entails on us to pay the outstanding interest. But, there is no money because of crop failure owing to two consecutive years of drought, Mr. Shanthakumar said.He said the loan waiver announced by the State government was an eyewash as the waiver was limited to Rs. 50,000 only for loans availed from cooperative banks whereas a majority of the farmers are in a debt trap with the interest component compounding over the years.Most farmers have availed loan from commercial banks and the average outstanding loan ranges from Rs. 1.5 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh, he added.In view of the growing agrarian distress, the farmers are seeking the implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee report on agriculture which stipulates fixation of crop procurement price at twice the input cost of cultivation.The sugarcane cultivators association members and Consortium of Indian Farmers Association want the State and the Union governments to announce a rehabilitation package with interest-free loan for each farmers family based on the size of their family or landholding to held them tide over the present financial crisis and is our key demand, Mr. Shanthakumar said."

5a0dd0f19855b76bf13d148c,What’s in a bulb,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/whats-in-a-bulb-onion-prices-rise-price-today-4782952/,2017-08-05,"The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But it will be only for drinking purpose. The farmers have been urged not to take up cultivation of water-intensive crops like paddy and sugar cane, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah told reporters after holding a meeting with elected representatives from Mandya district.In all, 45 tmcft of water is available in the four major reservoirs  the lowest in 46 years. Around this time last year, the major reservoirs of the Cauvery river basin  KRS, Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathi  had 53.52 tmcft of water. Our priority now is to improve groundwater levels that have plummeted. So, water will be released to fill up lakes and tanks in the river basin, he said, adding that cloud-seeding will be taken up next week.Water Resources Minister M B Patil said Karnataka is expected to release to Tamil Nadu 10 tmcft in June, 34 tmcft in July and 50 tmcft in August in a normal year. Three-fifths of the monsoon has passed in June and July and we are in a crisis. We hope the Meteorological Departments forecast of rainfall in August will come true. Nothing is in our hands, Patil said. So far, the state has released 12 tmcft water to Tamil Nadu, he added.The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on the review petition filed by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala against the 2007 Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunals final award. An apex court bench had earlier directed the state to release 2,000 cusecs to Tamil Nadu every day till further orders. Our arguments have gone well. We have reiterated our stand that the 1894 and 1924 agreements on Cauvery water-sharing should not be given importance, Patil said."

The fall in profit was on account of lower sales owing to GST transition. M&M made a provision of Rs 144 crore to support dealers with respect to duty paid for goods lying with them following the transition to GST to overcome unavailability of input credit for certain taxes paid, as well as due to tractors being exempt from excise duty in the earlier regime.It may be noted that the auto sectors sales were affected during the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal due to phasing out of BS-III vehicles. Moreover, saturation of replacement demand coupled with production constraints of BS-IV models led to sales being the lowest in the previous 13 quarters, it added.Sales in auto sector were impacted due to transition to GST. Passenger vehicles were impacted in anticipation of a price reduction in the new tax regime and saw a nominal growth of 4.4 per cent.

About 48 km from one end to another, Bawana is one of Delhis largest and most varied Assembly segments, with lush green villages existing alongside crowded, unauthorised slum clusters.Ahead of the August 23 bypoll in the reserved constituency, home to over three lakh voters, The Indian Express follows the campaign of the BJP, AAP and the Congress to understand why the contest holds great significance for each party.About 48 km from one end to another, Bawana is one of Delhis largest and most varied Assembly segments, with lush green villages existing alongside crowded, unauthorised slum clusters. Punctuating these are a few pockets of Rohini, mostly comprising vacant DDA flats. Ahead of the August 23 bypoll, Bawana is also ground zero for a pitched battle between the BJP, the AAP and the Congress. To understand the significance of this bypoll, one only needs to look at what is at stake for each party.For the AAP, which won the 2015 elections with a resounding majority, Bawana offers a chance to overturn two electoral losses  the Punjab Assembly elections and the MCD polls. The BJP, on the other hand, hopes to build on the momentum from the victory in MCD polls. But the highest stakes, perhaps, are for the Congress, which, for the first time in the history of Delhis politics, has not had representation in the Delhi Assembly and hopes to finally win its sole seat. The contest, though, is anything but easy.At the BJP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) At the BJP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)One of the 12 reserved seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly, Bawanas 26 rural villages have traditionally voted for the BJP, and the colonies have traditionally voted for the Congress. The pattern began to change from 1998, five years after Bawana was declared a reserved seat, when an influx of migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar moved to the colonies in the area, tilting the electoral advantage in favour of the Congress  so much so that their candidate, Surender Kumar, remained the legislator from1998 to 2013.But with Kumar losing to the BJP in 2013, and AAP winning the seat in 2015, none of the three parties are confident of which way the wind is blowing, with party leaders maintaining that it all depends on the voter turnout. The fact that the issues the residents are facing vary every few kilometres makes coming up with a strategy that much harder. At Bawana village  the largest of the 26 rural villages  Om Prakash Rana (45) explained, The villages are very different from the colonies. Here, the concerns are that fertilizers are expensive, seeds are hard to get and water for irrigation is poor. Water is a problem on both sides, but here its more pronounced because the need is more. Plus, in the last few years, our crops were destroyed by hailstorms. That is also a major concern.In comparison, at Shahbad Dairy  the largest of the slum clusters in the area  Ram Kumar, a migrant from Madhubani district in Bihar, said, We dont own land here. We barely have any space to live. I have been working as a labourer for a decade. All I want is to earn enough to eat and drink, and make a decent salary so my children can go to school. What unites these two distinct areas of Bawana, though, is the sense of waste that the bypoll entails. With Assembly elections in Delhi scheduled in less than three years, residents maintained that the election is a waste of taxpayer money.***The bypoll was necessitated after AAP legislator Ved Parkash quit the Delhi Assembly just ahead of the municipal polls to join the BJP. Parkash, who had been in the BJP until 2015, fought the Assembly polls that year as an AAP candidate after being denied a ticket by his former party. Speaking to The Indian Express, he explained his reason for leaving AAP for the BJP this time: They turned Delhi into a launching pad for Punjab. I kept telling Kejriwal and other leaders that this is not why the people of Delhi had voted for us. But they wouldnt listen. Everything, from what was being said in press conferences to what would be asked at the Delhi Assembly, was coordinated and pre-decided. How can anyone work like that?At the AAP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) At the AAP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)He added, If I hadnt left the party then, my political career would have been finished. I have another 20 years left; for me coming back to the BJP was like a ghar wapsi. BJP leaders said their strategy for Bawana would be the same as it was during the MCD polls  a combination of Modis image, a promise of governance as provided by the Centre, and a hint of nationalism. Parkash argued, Which other party will stand for the Jats? They are the backbone of our nation, they are the farmers and the soldiers. They are nationalism.BJP MP Parvesh Verma, the party in-charge for the bypoll, added, The BJP will win as it has approved the land pooling policy, which will benefit the rural population. The challenge for the former AAP legislator, though, will be to explain to people why he left the party and joined the BJP. A close aide said, When he left, some people felt betrayed. But we had to explain to them what AAP was doing. It is something that comes up still, but we are dealing with it.For now, the BJP appears confident. The party office is a week-old, freshly painted in saffron and green with photographs of the PM dotting its walls. A lotus has been painted at the entrance. Asked how the campaign was progressing, a BJP leader said, We bought four quintals of sugar to make laddoos, which got over in a week. We bought 50 cartons of water, almost over in two days. People are flocking to the BJP. Whether its Bihar or Bawana, people want the BJP and they know we will form a government.***To get to Punjab Khor village, one has to drive 8 km from Bawana village along the Saheb Singh Verma road. On Thursday, AAP cabinet minister and Delhi convener Gopal Rai, who is handling the campaign, sat there, addressing the 100-odd people who had gathered at the rural chowk. The greatest advantage that AAP has is that its in power in Delhi, which is why it can do the most for you, he said. Rai described such events as seedhi baat sessions, an opportunity for the party  that feels its strength is in the unauthorised colonies and slum clusters  to make its presence felt in these villages. Their candidate, Ram Chandra, who had contested on a BSP ticket in 2008 and had received 14 per cent of the votes, is a resident of Shahbad Dairy.A Purvanchali, AAP hopes that Chandra will be able to mobilise voters in these clusters, dominated by residents from Bihar and eastern UP. Has any other party done so much for those who are poor and live in slums? From free electricity to water, from mohalla clinics to improving the standard of education is government schools. There is no question in their minds about who they should vote for, said Ram Chandra.Rai, on the other hand, is focussing on rural villages. The smart village idea is a game- changer. This is something the Delhi government has recently done. They have constituted a rural development board and decided to allocate Rs 2 crore to each village annually under the Smart Village scheme. In the case of Bawana, with 26 villages, the amount comes up to Rs 52 crore. An MLA, on the other hand, gets only Rs 4 crore to develop the entire area. This will give power back to the villagers and let them decide on how the money should be spent.But, will the project not come through if AAP doesnt win the polls? It will. But its better if the MLA and the government are from the same party. Things work more smoothly then, Rai said. Another AAP leader explained, With Parkash leaving the party, the onus is on him to explain why he left. Anti-incumbency is not a factor here; in fact, us heading the state government puts us in a unique position from where we can deliver results faster and more easily.Of the three party offices, AAPs  currently run out of three rooms at a cricket coaching centre for teens, three kilometres away from Shahbad Dairy  is arguably the busiest. A small army of volunteers can be seen going through documents, while a room has been assigned to Rai to meet voters who turn up with their problems. What neither Rai nor Ram Chandra admits is the desperation that underscores this frantic activity. We simply cant afford to lose another election. But this is different  enough time has passed and Rai has virtually been here for the past month, said a volunteer.Since the MCD poll loss, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seems to have largely disappeared from public discourse in the capital. However, he has made frequent visits to rural areas, including Bawana  either to talk about the land pooling policy that the DDA had passed, which both the BJP and the AAP take credit for, or to speak about the historical rates of compensation that the AAP government gives to farmers for destroyed crops, or just to tout MLA Kailash Gehlots promotion to the Delhi cabinet. On June 3, Kejriwal had said in Bawana, No other government works for the villages like we do. The land pooling policy, we hope, will bring joy and income. Gehlot will be the voice of the villages in the cabinet.***The Congress, meanwhile, hopes the swapping of leaders between the BJP and the AAP will work to its advantage. Pointing to the induction of former BJP MLA Gugan Singh  who won the 2013 elections from Bawana with a margin of over 20,000 voters  into AAP, Delhi state unit chief Ajay Maken said, Both parties are morally bankrupt. What kind of inducement must the BJP have given to the AAP MLA, for him to have resigned from AAP and joined the BJP? He negated the mandate that the people of Bawana had given him. Similarly, what kind of inducement must the AAP have given to the BJP leader?At the Congress office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) At the Congress office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)While Singhs induction to AAP has been touted as a masterstroke by some who feel it will help them get traction in rural areas of Bawana, Congress candidate and three-time MLA from the area, Surender Kumar, said he is relying on his past work. As MLA, I worked here day and night for 15 years. I am a strong believer of the Congress philosophy of ensuring that the poor and the middle class have roti, kapda aur makaan. They have always felt safe when the Congress is in power not like now.The Congress office in Bawana, a few metres from the BJP office, is not new. A little away from the road, it opens into a massive hall with a high ceiling. A desk is placed at one corner, with two landlines and a pile of notebooks. On the other side, mattresses have been laid out, where some party workers were taking a nap on Thursday afternoon. Asked about Kumars schedule, a handwritten sheet is drawn out. He is scheduled to travel to eight areas and meet people as part of his padyatra. But a Congress worker informed that the timing of each meeting hasnt been mentioned. After some discussion, a phone call is made to figure out where the Congress candidate is.Another worker added, This is the problem with the party. Our candidate is easily the best, the most seasoned and arguably the most popular. You dont win an election thrice otherwise. Nobody has heard of Ved Parkash or Ram Chandra, but after our defeats in the elections since 2013, the organisation hasnt been the same. When Kumar was eventually traced, he told The Indian Express, I have worked selflessly for the people of Bawana for years. There is no doubt in my mind that we will win.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

This will help bring 7.5 lakh hectares of additional land under irrigation.In the last 30 months, the state government has accorded highest priority to the irrigation sector, undertaking policy reforms to plug financial bleeding and thin spreading of resources. The government aims to enhance the irrigation potential from 18 per cent to 27, the maximum given the geographical conditions and terrain in Maharashtra. The national average is 42 per cent.In a clear departure from the past, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has imposed a ban on new irrigation projects. Instead, he has accorded priority to completion of ongoing projects.Water Resources Minister Girish Mahajan said, At present, there are 376 irrigation projects in the state, of which 67 are major, 83 medium and 226 minor projects. The amount required to complete them is Rs 84,000 crore. There are 49 projects worth Rs 26,600 crore that are facing problems with land acquisition, forest clearances, etc. The government has decided to keep them on hold and focus on the rest of the 327 projects, which require Rs 57,400 crore.A senior official in the water resources ministry said, The state budget allocation in the next three years will be Rs 24,000 crore. Loans from NABARD (for central projects under PMKSY) is Rs 12,770 crore and central assistance Rs 3,830 crore. Loan from NABARD to the state government (Rs 2,000 crore) and raising bonds from markets (in next three years) of Rs 14,800 crore sums up to the required amount of Rs 57,400 crore.Former chairman of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probnig the irrigation scam and water management expert Madhav Chitale said, A scientific policy along with fiscal discipline is integral to maximising the irrigation potential. Apart from the irrigation projects, emphasis on water conservation through jalyukta shivar would help tackle the water scarcity and raise the water tables, he said.Of the 42 recommendations made by the Chitale committee to plug corruption, the government has implemented 38.Those that remain on paper include evaluation of canals using remote sensors and levying water charges to stop the misuse and diversion of dam water for sugarcane cultivation, leading to drought.The state government has proposed central assistance of Rs 7,187 crore for 107 projects in 14 suicide-prone districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada; and Rs 3,500 crore for seven projects in drought-prone areas.Of the total 99 projects under PMKSY, 26 are in Maharashtra, proposed to be completed by December 2019, creating an additional irrigation potential of 2.56 lakh hectares.Greater Centre-state coordination saw the chief minister succeed in getting environmental clearance for 10 crucial projects, which were on hold for 10-15 years. The projects are spread in Vidarbha (4), Marathwada (3), Western Maharashtra (2) and Konkan (1). For the last 10 years, the environment ministry had kept the Krishna-Marathwada project on hold, resulting in work coming to a grinding halt.In 12 projects, forest land was handed over after the environment ministry gave the nod, paving the way for work to start. The projects in Vidarbha includes Jigaon, Gosikhurd right bank canal, Bhimdi, Khindsi feeder canal in Pencha project and Bhimalkasa Ingalwadi. Whereas in Western Maharashtra, it is Nira Deoghar and Gunjavani, the Dhondalpada diversion scheme, Panzan left canal and Shelgaon barrage.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Qasmi said a Muslim who chants Jai Sri Ram and believes in worshipping Lord Ram or Rahim is ostracised in Islam.But Ahmad, a JD(U) legislator from Sikta in West Champaran district known for his initiatives towards fostering religious harmony in his constituency, first defied the fatwa and said he would not apologise. I refuse to be cowed down by such decrees. Islam teaches respect for all religions. Why is there such uproar over my chanting Jai Sri Ram? asked Ahmad, who took oath on Saturday as a minister and was given the minority welfare and sugarcane industries departments.Soon after Nitish Kumars new JD(U)-BJP alliance government won the trust vote in the Assembly on Friday, Ahmad was seen merrily chanting Jai Sri Ram outside the Assembly while having a loud exchange with an Opposition RJD legislator, Arun Yadav. Ahmad had said he worships both Ram and Rahim and visits holy places of all religions. You are a fake Muslim, Yadav told him, and the whole episode was caught on media cameras and aired on TV.Even as BJP leaders condemned the fatwa and RJD slammed Ahmad, JD(U)s minorities cell was uncomfortable about the ministers statements and held a meeting at the CMs residence to discuss the controversy. The meeting, in which both Ahmad and the CM were present, was marked by raucous opposition from JD(U)s Muslim leaders to Ahmads stance.I will not back down from chanting Jai Sri Ram for Bihars progress and social harmony, said Ahmad at the meeting, sparking protests from JD(U)s Muslim leaders, who urged him to publicly apologise for his statements. Nitish Kumar also asked Ahmad not to get too emotional and hurt the sentiments of people from his community.Ahmad, who was also a minister in the previous grand alliance government, finally apologised at the meeting and then repeated it while speaking to a TV news channel.I apologise if my statements have hurt anyone. My statements were distorted. My intentions were not to hurt anyones sentiments, said Ahmad, adding that Nitish Kumar asked him to apologise in order not to hurt anyones sentiments.Abdul Ghafoor, RJD legislator who was minority welfare minister in the previous government, described the entire episode as political drama, saying Ahmad sold his conscience to bag a ministerial berth."

Apart from people from the North-eastern states, hundreds of Mumbaikars, too, made a beeline for the event to get a plateful of authentic Naga cuisine.As platters of colourful items were dished out at the Eats and Beats-Authentic Naga Food Buffet, attendees showed interest not just in the food but also the culture of the North-eastern states. The smell of spices and a variety of meats hung in the air at the Indian Airlines Ideal School, Santacruz, the venue.On offer was a plethora of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options including singju, eromba, chicken with bamboo shoot and kidney beans gravy served with steamed rice. To top it all, banana caramel custard, a dessert made out of mashed bananas, sugar, eggs and milk, was served.People from the North-eastern states currently residing in Mumbai found solace in the authentic food that reminded them of their homes in the hills.This event makes me feel closer to home and gives the Naga students who have settled in Mumbai an opportunity to feel less homesick said Manesa Krichena Mao who is from Manipur and is in Mumbai for her studies.She said that the buffet was a platform for Mumbaikars to experience Naga culture and know more about the community.The event, which spanned a period of three hours, was organised by the Mumbai chapter of the non-profit Naga Christian Fellowship (NCF) community which includes students, working people and families predominantly from the North-East, who have settled in Mumbai.The raw material for the buffet was sourced from the North-East and the meal was prepared by the members of NCF Mumbai. To keep the audience entertained, stalls selling NCF goodies and exotic pickles were set up. The first edition of Eats and Beats was an attempt to provide Mumbaikars with a glimpse of the rich Naga cuisine.The beauty of our country is in its diversity, and through this event we tried our best to present a slice of the Naga culinary art, that is rarely displayed in Mumbai.

Announcing this after a meeting on Cauvery water distribution chaired by the Chief Minister on Friday, Water Resources Minister M B Patil said that about 1,000 cusecs of water would be released everyday through the high-level canal for ten days. The water would be released for drinking requirement and also to fill up lakes in Hassan district.JD(S) supremo Deve Gowda, who is also MP for Hassan district, had written to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah two days ago requesting that water be released from Hemavathy for drinking purpose as the people were facing hardship. Siddaramaiah had immediately called Deve Gowda and assured that water would be released.Hassan district in charge Minister A Manju said that the water would travel for 94 kms and the release of water would help all the lakes to fill up as well. He requested farmers not to use the water for agricultural purposes.Storage in dams at historic lowThe Chief Minister has also decided to hold another meeting on August 14 to decide on future course of action with regard to release of water from the four reservoirs. Minister M B Patil said they had been assured of good rains by officials from Meteorological Department in the coming week and they would assess the situation on August 14.At present, we have a live storage of 43 tmc ft from the four dams. This is a historic low and less by 9-10 tmc ft from the previous year. If we had received normal rainfall, we would have had a storage of 122 tmc ft in the four dams. So far, our dams have received only 57.83 tmc this year, Patil said.He also said that the drinking water requirement of Bengaluru, Mandya, Mysuru and surrounding areas was 34 tmc ft and the kharif water requirement for the area, including paddy, sugarcane andsemi-arid crops was 95 tmc ft.But we have only 43 tmc ft at our disposal. Since IMD has predicted good rain for the next week, we want to assess the situation again on August 14 and then take a final decision on release of water, he said.Water being released to TNIn accordance to the distress formula, around 7,000 to 8,000 cusecs of water a day is being released to Tamil Nadu.

People in 78 villages depend on water supplied through tankers.Though Mandya district is known as the Sugar Bowl of Karnataka, the scanty rainfall and low reservoir levels have hit drinking water supply in many villages.The delay in giving water to irrigation canals has severely depleated the underground water table. The drying up of borewells has made the matter worse forcing the zilla panchayat to depend on private borewells for drinking water in 130 villages.The government has convened a meeting of elected representatives of Cauvery basin to decide whether to give water from KRS to canals on August 14. But the livestock are suffering due to lack of sufficient water.However, the task force comprising zilla, taluk and village panchayats have managed to supply water to 70 villages through tankers. They have also managed to draw water from private borewells by paying them high price. They are paying `500-`800 per tanker to meet the demand in the parched districts.Though a series of agitations were reported across the region for water, the government is keeping cards close to its chest and is releasing 10,000 cusecs of water to Tamil Nadu in the wake of Cauvery Tribunal hearing the Karnatakas revised petition.

He is a resident of Chakoti in PoK.Investigations have been set in motion to identify the people involved in this drug trade.In February, 2015, the cross-Line of Control trade was suspended for several days after a Pakistani driver was arrested following recovery of 300 packets of narcotics from his vehicle at Uri."

Kenyans are going to the polls to vote in a general election after a tightly fought presidential race between incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and main opposition leader Raila Odinga. | APNAIROBI: Kenyans began voting Tuesday in general elections headlined by a too-close-to-call battle between incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta and his rival Raila Odinga that has sent tensions soaring in east Africa's richest economy.From first-time voters to those bent with age, thousands descended upon polling stations, some from before midnight, to cast their ballots under heavy security.Voting began relatively smoothly, with minor delays and technical hiccups, while all eyes are on a biometric voter identification and tallying system whose success is seen as crucial to a smooth election.""I voted Raila, because he will be so much better to us. But if he does not win, it's ok. It's a democracy after all. Really, there's no need for violence,"" said Tom Mboya, 43, who works in construction and voted in the capital's largest slum Kibera.Tensions soared in the last days of the campaign with the murder of a top election official in charge of the electronic voting system and opposition claims of a plot to rig the vote heightening a feverish atmosphere of conspiracy and suspicion.The polls come a decade after a shambolic election -- which foreign observers agreed was riddled with irregularities -- sparked violence which left more than 1,100 dead and 600,000 displaced.Odinga, 72, who is the flagbearer for the NASA coalition, is taking his fourth and likely final stab at the presidency.He claims elections in 2007 and 2013 were stolen from him and right up until the eve of the vote, insisted that Kenyatta's Jubilee Party planned to rig Tuesday's presidential election.Elections in 2013 were marred by the widespread failure of the electronic system, forcing officials to revert to manual counting of the vote. However Odinga took his grievances to the courts instead of the streets, where he lost.Dynastic rivalryThe devolution of power to Kenya's 47 counties after a post-conflict constitutional reform means elections are now a complex affair, with citizens casting six different ballots.Several tight races for posts such as governor have seen tensions flaring at the local level.Nevertheless all eyes are on what is set to be the last showdown of a dynastic rivalry that has lasted more than half a century since the presidential candidates' fathers Jomo Kenyatta and Jaramogi Odinga went from allies in the struggle for independence to bitter rivals.The men belong to two of the country's main ethnic groups, Kenyatta from the Kikuyu, the largest, and Odinga from the Luo.Both have secured formidable alliances with other influential communities in a country where voting takes place largely along tribal lines.Kenyatta, 55, is seeking re-election after a first term in which he oversaw a massive infrastructure drive and steady economic growth of more than five percent.""He has done a lot for the country and he must absolutely be re-elected. He has built a lot of infrastructure, like the SGR train (between Nairobi and Mombasa), he has created jobs,"" said Evelyn Sum, 32, dressed in an elegant brown coat.However Kenyatta is also criticised for soaring food prices -- with prices jumping 20 percent year-on-year in May -- and massive corruption scandals on his watch.""Life is more and more expensive, especially the flour and the sugar. That's not good for poor people like us, and we hope that Odinga will change this,"" said Rose Lida, 48, wrapped in a red Maasai blanket on the chilly morning.Obama urges peaceFormer US president Barack Obama, whose father was born in Kenya, led a chorus of international calls on the eve of the vote for a peaceful election.""I urge Kenyan leaders to reject violence and incitement; respect the will of the people,"" Obama said in a statement.There are more than 19 million registered voters in the nation of 48 million. Half are aged under 35.More than 150,000 security forces -- including wildlife, prison and forestry officers -- have been deployed for the vote, which ends at 5pm (1400 GMT).Counting will begin immediately and the polls commission has a week to release final results."

Two of the Gujarat MLAs were taken to a private hospital with complaints of fever and breathlessness while many others are keen to return home.Jyotiba Patel and Raju Parmar were taken to BGS GlenEagles Global Hospital in Kengeri on Thursday afternoon after they complained of uneasiness, believed to be due to BP and blood sugar-related problems. The two MLAs have been hospitalised with fever.

Patel is in constant touch with the MLAs over phone to boost their confidence, the sources said.However, the raid seems to have unnerved the Gujarat MLAs as many of them are said to have expressed their desire to return home as they are getting calls from their worried family members. Some of the MLAs visited a temple in a corner of the resort premises to offer prayers for an early end to the ongoing political drama.KPCC president G Parameshwara too visited the resort later in the evening and interacted with the MLAs to keep them in good spirits.Speaking to reporters later, he said, We will take care of the security of the MLAs. No one has expressed their desire to go home.Parameshwara also said that one of the MLAs was taken to hospital for fever and has since returned to the resort after getting medical attention.Earlier in the day, Parameshwara met Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and discussed the possible effects of the raids in the state and measures to be taken to counter it. The possibility of similar raids on a few more ministers premises was also discussed, it is learnt.When asked about reports of more ministers in the I-T hit list, Parameshwara told reporters he was not aware of it. He also said the party will chalk out plans for protests against the vendetta politics of BJP and to counter the BJPs game plan."

He was speaking at the 74th foundation day celebrations of CSIR  Indian Institute of Chemical Technology to a packed auditorium on  Methanol Economy. Among other advantages, the scientist also said, residues of methanol are harmless when compared to any other fuel and there will be no addition to global warming that is on the rise in this time.We, in India do not use methanol at all. We have only started using ethanol 15 years ago. Meanwhile, methanol is not listed as a fuel, but only as a chemical and we have sent recommendations to government to look into adapting this as an alternative fuel, he said.Explaining how it is also a cheaper investment, he said, methanol can be created out of jungle residues. It is available anywhere at the cost of Rs16 per litre. Also, India has a rich source of coal. For instance, in TS, we can set up a methanol creating base at Singereni coal mines. Most states in the country can be transformed on the same lines, he added. On the other hand, ethanol is created from molasses, a product of refined sugar cane. From households to industrial set ups, everyone can switch to using methanol and can contribute to bringing down our import cost, he said.Rural households which depend on wood can also switch to this with no side effects. In fact, it is less harmful than coal, wood or scattered waste that is used. As part of the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, many came forward to give up their subsidy on LPG. This too can be replaced as it is available freely, said the Padmabhushan awardee who initiated development of technologies for security of energy in the country."

Take the case of Cyrus Peter (name changed), a sixteen-year-old who received counselling for his addiction at a counseling centre in Hyderabad. He started consuming alcohol at the age of twelve, when his father offered him a mug of beer in the hope that if he doesnt allow him to do so, someone else would. With the child eventually ending up becoming addiced to alcohol, his mother had to take him to a therapist at the age of 16 who checked his cognitive behaviour and cured his disease in a span of five months.With that case, the parent is to be blamed who had a senseless approach in parenting and in most of the cases parenting style governs a childs choices. Parents should not resort to over pampering and should create a sense of accountability among children, said VS Gideon, a de-addiction therapist. Breaking the denial for a child to admit their addiction is the biggest task and off late there is no gender bias in cases being brought to us, but because of social stigma, parents of girls come out slowly, he added.In another case, an IIT-K graduate who started smoking since sixteen years of age is a marijuana addict for six years. He had the perception that doing marijuana would cultivate creative thoughts in him and that would help him to perform well in exams. After his parents found out that he was an addict, they rushed him to a de-addiction centre where he is currently being treated.Explaining the ill-effects of alcoholism and drugs, Dr Y Jayarami Reddy, a de-addiction specialist said that children who consume such intoxicants have a sudden release of endorphins and dopamine which enhances mood and keeps them focused. The high is only for a specific time, and once it gets lowered, the body gets tremors. Moreover, it is the brain dependency on a substance that makes a child say that creative thoughts cultivate, he said.Alcohol consumption laws not uniform across IndiaThe non-uniform laws of alcohol consumption in India have paved the way for increasing alcohol usage among children, says Dr Monika Arora, Additional Professor at Public Health Foundation of India. Minimum age for alcohol consumption varies across several states in India and it is 21 in Telangana. And, with 60 per cent of alcohol consumption unrecorded, the policy makers need to have a national policy to curb underage drinking, she said."

As many as 14 IT companies in the city were recently issued notices by the government. However, the techies believe the industry should not be targeted because of the choice of some individuals.Courtesy the huge amount of stress at work owing to tiring work hours, work shifts and ever-changing work environment and pressure to perform consistently, the addiction is not just to drugs but to sleeping pills as well.Mohan Krishna (name changed), a techie who left an IT company recently said that many employees who worked in his process used drugs like marijuana to ease off stress levels.Marijuana is the most common drug which many uses, besides popping sleeping pills to counter shift work sleep disorder, a sleeping disorder that arises because of multiple work shifts that break sleep cycle, he said.Another techie said that employees who manage multiple servers and those who are into hardcore programming mostly resort to drugs.In IT sector, consuming drugs has become a lifestyle because of high pay packages. But still the number is not significant, said Kiran Bantu, a software employee.Interestingly, psychiatrists feel that marijuana is the gateway to several hardcore drugs that can even prove fatal. For a person who uses marijuana, consuming drugs like cocaine and brown sugar is no big deal. One should try to manage stress instead of giving to drugs, said Aftab Khan, a psychiatrist.The problem comes when employees stop introspecting about their lives which cause stress levels to increase. Basics such as nutrition, sleep, and exercise should be adherently practiced to overcome stress, said Dr P Madhurima Reddy, a psychologist. She further added that sleeping pills will lead to addiction that causes lethargy and can even affect a persons sex life.Several others like Akshay Kumar, a techie, believe that drug abuse is rampant among personnel in all professions. There are a few teachers and lecturers who do drugs but that does not mean all teachers do drugs. In the same way because of a few, blaming the entire IT sector is an absurd idea, he said."

It said the lifestyle of Sharif and his children were beyond their known sources of income, and recommended filing of a new corruption case against them.Sharif has dismissed the report as a ""bundle of baseless allegations"".According to the report in Pakistan's Dawn newspaper, the JIT has asked the court to reopen 15 old cases, including five cases decided by the Lahore High Court, eight investigations and two inquiries against the prime minister.Of these 15 cases, three were filed during the 1994 and 2011 tenures of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and 12 were prepared during the tenure of Pervez Musharraf, who toppled Sharif's government in October 1999 in a military coup.The case relating to the Sharif family's four London apartments was also among the eight investigations started by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in December 1999.In its April 20 verdict, the Supreme Court asked the JIT to investigate the money trail for the London flats.The court's other 12 questions were related to the sale and purchase of the Gulf Steel Mill, the Qatari letter, offshore companies and other matters.In addition to the 18-year-old investigation into the London properties, the JIT has also recommended reviving cases such as three NAB references and two FIA cases that were quashed by the Lahore High Court.The JIT even found anomalies in the cases quashed by the high court. The report noted ""that these cases have also been quashed without conducting a proper trial and without giving evidence a chance to come on record"".The JIT also recommended reopening of another case the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) registered the same year of the same nature.Its report pointed out that the LHC had quashed an NAB reference filed against Sharif and Saifur Rehman related to the purchase of a helicopter, allegedly through unfair means, and said it was a ""case of further investigation"".Discussing the LHC verdict on the Hudabiya Paper Mills reference, the team opined: ""It was very well investigated reference which could not get a chance to go under trial and was quashed mere on technical grounds.""Regarding the Sharif family's assets reference quashed by the LHC in 2014, the JIT insisted that there was strong evidence against the accused individuals. The team recommended that the SC direct NAB to appeal the acquittal of the Sharif family in these cases.The JIT also recommended that NAB be directed to complete its investigation into the London properties.The JIT also recommended that the SC resume investigations against the prime minister for recruiting 42 employees in the FIA in the late 90s, the forced acquisition of land in and around Raiwind, the construction of a road to Raiwind, receiving funds for the Sharif Trust, assets beyond known sources of income and illegal plot allotments.The SC was also recommended to direct the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to reopen the investigation into alleged money laundering by the Chaudhry Sugar Mills, owned by the Sharif family"

Mr. Shetty said, The decision is an example of the governments authoritarian behaviour. Mr. Shetty, who is also leading farmers protests in Maharashtra and across the country, said that the decision was taken to profit private companies with links to Ministers in the Cabinet.Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has asked the government not to merely make announcements, but also to implement them. NCP leader Jayant Patil said, Ever since this government took charge, it has announced a number of schemes. However, none of them have been implemented properly on the ground. In reality, the people are not benefiting from the schemes.Mr. Patil pointed out that like the farm loan waiver scheme whose details have not been announced yet, the drip irrigation scheme too lacked clarity. He said, The government must announce the amount of money it has reserved for this scheme.Agriculture Minister Pandurang Fundkar said the decision would help increase sugarcane production in the State. Water will be saved and production will increase too. The private sector has also welcomed the move. Drip irrigation is a proven method for increasing sugarcane production. This is a positive step, said Arvind So make, Director, Sustainable Agro-commercial Finance Limited."

Students are said to be among the 100-odd customers of the peddlers.By ArrangementLSD, popularly known as acid, is now being peddled in the form of biscuits. Hyderabad Police learnt this after nabbing six peddlers including two Africans on Wednesday. Biscuits laced with drugs are a fad among youth, police officials revealed.The psychedelic substance, at the heart of a sensational drug bust with links to Tollywood biggies, was prepared in labs and later a drop of the chemical was absorbed by a medium, usually by blotting paper. However, given that blotting papers caused suspicion, drug sellers were finding different ways to transport and sell LSD, cops said.It is easy to transport the drug. That apart, in a biscuit form, it is unlikely to look suspect. Additionally, it is appealing to youth, a police official said. We have found LSD-laced sugar cubes. This is the first time we have found the drug in biscuits.The police seized the contraband substance from a gang of six, including two foreign nationals. Five people, N. Raghu Vamshidar Reddy, Abhinav Mahender, V. Mallikarjun Rao, Christopher H.H. Giddens and Nigerian Chika Ohycowusi were nabbed near a popular hotel in Banjara Hills. The five had gathered to exchange drugs including MDMA or ecstasy, and cocaine. Their arrest led to the apprehension of South-African national Lucky Bongani. The police learnt that the peddlers used the dark net to purchase drugs.Preliminary interrogation and analysis of cell phone data of the peddlers revealed that they might have sold drugs to over 100 people in the last one and half years.Many of the buyers are college students. More can be learnt after further investigation. We will informally counsel the drug users but not summon them, said Task Force Deputy Commissioner of Police, Limba Reddy. The Prohibition and Excise department, which is overseeing the drug bust involving a large haul of LSD, has sent notices to reputed Tollywood personalities.In a different case, the Task Force also arrested three other persons for possessing drugs. P. Revanth, Irfan Najeeb Khan and Zain Khan were arrested. While they were not peddlers, cops said the trio used drugs and also sold them in known circles of friends. Police seized LSD, MDMA and cocaine in both cases."

The kidnappers demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore, not from the doctor's family, but from Ola.The 13-day drama, which saw two police encounters with the accused and 200 Delhi cops being deployed for investigations and search operations, finally ended on Wednesday with the doctor's rescue and the arrest of four kidnappers from Meerut. At least other five accused, including the masterminds, are absconding.""We're conducting raids to nab the rest of them and also questioning some of the accused,"" said joint commissioner (eastern range) Ravindra Yadav, who headed the operation., works at a private hospital in Delhi. He had booked the cab through the mobile app on the night of July 6 for returning from a birthday party in Noida. Gaud's friend, Dr Rakesh, dropped him around midnight at Preet Vihar Metro station, where Gaud had booked the cab. He lives with a friend in Gautam Nagar, south Delhi.After he boarded the cab, the driver locked the doors and drove the car towards Dadri. Goud told police he had protested when the driver took a turn towards Noida. However, the driver kept going and after they crossed into Noida, he threatened to kill the doctor if he tried to raise an alarm. Three of the cabbie's associates boarded the vehicle from Noida before driving off to Dadri.The first call was made to the Ola call centre on July 7, in which the kidnappers demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore. Ola refused to comment on the developments.Another call was made to the doctor's hospital. The kidnappers spoke to a nurse and asked the hospital to build pressure on Ola, saying they just wanted to teach the company a lesson. Meanwhile, they kept changing their locations.To evade technical surveillance, the gang used the doctor's mobile. They shot the doctor's vidoes on his mobile and send the clips to Ola and the family.It was found that two of the kidnappers are siblings and both had earlier worked with Ola. They are yet to be arrested. They were miffed with Ola due to alleged non-payment of incentives, sources said.Wednesday's encounter took place in Shatabdi Nagar area of Meerut, when cops confronted the kidnappers near a railway crossing while they were changing their location with the doctor. They tried to take advantage of a group of kanwariyas and flee, but were surrounded by a joint team of Delhi Police and UP STF. When they were challenged by the cops, the men opened fire.At least three-four rounds were exchanged during which one of the kidnappers was hit on the thigh.Sources said massive raids are on in the Meerut district to nab the prime conspirators, one of whom has been identified as Anuj. Most of these kidnappers belong to Daurala, Dadri and areas near Meerut. Three of the four have been identified as Pradeep, Nepal and Amit. Cops are trying to identify the cabbie.""A team led by SHO Preet Vihar Maninder Singh has been tracking the rest of the culprits in different places,"" said Omvir Singh, DCP, east.Earlier on Sunday, cops had confronted the kidnappers near a sugarcane field at Peerpur village near Khatauli, while they were fleeing with the doctor in a WagonR car. On seeing the cops, the men drove into the field, plunging almost five feet into a pit. The car's tyre burst in the process but the kidnappers had managed to escape, leaving the vehicle behind.Since Sunday's encounter, a cat-and-mouse chase began between the cops and the kidnappers. However, this only made the game more dangerous. The kidnappers became more careful and discreet in their actions. The doctor's life was also at risk. Instead of going easy, the Delhi Police turned on the heat, with joint commissioner Ravindra Yadav himself going to Meerut to lead the operation.With the kidnappers' family members in detention and all of the accused having been identified, it was unlikely that the criminals would have risked killing the doctor. Their priority was now to get out of the mess.On Wednesday afternoon, the cops again got whiff of the criminals' whereabouts in Shatabdi Nagar, Meerut. A posse of cops surrounded the area. The kidnappers tried to flee with the doctor in a car but it got stuck near a rail gate while it was closing. The car, another WagonR, was also damaged. Another shootout ensued but the doctor was finally rescued around 5pm.Sources in the Meerut police said at least 25 Delhi Police teams have been stationed in west UP for the last 10 days, after the first ransom call was tracked to Daurala.They said some of the other accused have been identified as Sushil, Gaurav Sharma, Vivek (also known as Modi) and Pramod. Sushil is the brother of the main conspirator, Anuj.(With inputs fromin Meerut)"

The 200-litre drums of liquid glucose, the main ingredient used in the candies, was found without company labels showing the name of the manufacturer, date of manufacture or the 'best before dates'. The owner just claimed that he had brought the drums from Hyderabad.Another violation observed by the food safety officials is the mismatch between FSSAI licence numbers on the labels. They have printed different numbers on different labels.Assistant controller of food safety N Poornachandra Rao said that efforts are being made to ascertain the genuineness of the licence of the confectionery unit. Labels on the food products under the brand name of Gokul Foods were with a fake FSSAI licence number, he disclosed.Poornachandra Rao observed that the liquid glucose, if adulterated, can cause intestinal disorders in children which, in turn, leads to many other health complications. He said the very process of making candies at the unit is faulty as there is a mismatch between the ingredients used by the manufacturer and those printed on the product labels. For instance, the manufacturer claimed to have been using citric acid in the making of candies but there is no trace of it either on the label or on the factory premises.""We have seized the stocks and served notices on Gokul Foods management.

However, the state government has not responded positively to this demand so far. Over 1.20 lakh people have availed the portability facility in the various FP shops located in the limits of Greater Hyderabad in just the month of June.Officials said portability is not only a facility to card-holders to pick FP shops of their choice but also initiates a competition among dealers to offer better service to consumers. Presently , the portability facility is applicable only in FP shops in Hyderabad. The officials of Civil Supplies Corporation are making arrangements to extend it to all shops in the state in a phased man ner. However, the dealers are firm on their demands with their Association leader Bathula Ramesh Babu stating that there is no question of going back on the strike call if their demands were not met.Speaking to TOI over phone from Warangal, where the dealers organised a massive rally on Wednesday demanding monthly honorarium, Ramesh Babu said, "" Almost all the dealers will stop selling subsidised rice through FP shops from August 1 if our demands are not met. The government should formally announce payment of a monthly honorarium to us before July 31,"" he asserted.Stating that their income from such shops has come down drastically as the government has been withdrawing essential commodities from the public distribution system (PDS), such as sugar, edible oil and wheat, he said that even the price of per quintal rice has not been enhanced for several years now. As a result, it has become difficult for FP shop dealers to earn even Rs 5,000 per month.""One of the FP shop dealers in Sircilla recently committed suicide owing to financial problems. Let the government do anything they want with PDS. All we want is monthly honorarium of Rs 30,000 replacing the commission, so that we can feed our family members at least twice a day . We will accept e-pos machines and all other reforms of the government if we are given the honorarium,"" Ramesh Babu said.On their part, the officials of civil supplies department said that there are plans to transform these shops into super markets and mini-banks and then, dealers would get their commission on every transaction.

He was being shielded by SP leaders,"" the CM said, adding that Yadav was involved in the death of 60 people in an earlier hooch tragedy and shielded by SP leaders even then.""If I decide to speak up, many people would get exposed. Let there be political courtesies,"" the CM said, adding that under a new law, no one would be spared for patronising criminals Maintain a high pitch throughout his speech, Yogi said: ""We don't just plan, we face (problems).""Continuing in the same vein, the CM said that sugarcane sector was passing through its worst phase but the BJP government had decided to set up a new sugar industry in Gorakhpur's Pipraich and Basti and even ethanol would be produced from the crushed sugarcane in a second-generation plant, the CM announced.The CM said UP would also have at least four third-generation plants in east UP, Bundelkhand, central UP and west UP. These would produce green diesel and green fuel. Each would cost Rs 1,200 crore, he added.While there was no water scarcity in Bundelkhand this time, the CM said, during SP's regime, the Centre was forced to send a water train, he added.Using harsh words for the Opposition, the CM said that the government was not afraid of any opposition as that was their job.""After all, they don't have much work to do. Empty mind is a devil's workshop,"" he said.Referring to the anti-Romeo squad, Yogi gestured towards SP members and said, ""You all might not have liked the concept.""Bringing up the issue of Ramleela in Ayodhya, the CM said that when he went to Ayodhya, seers and saints told him about its discontinuation.""I told them why do you expect them to restart Ramleela when they believe in Ravan-leela,"" he said adding there was cultural degeneration in the past 15 years as nothing was done to develop places like Ayodhya, Mathura, Vrindavan and Varanasi.The CM also hit out at BSP government, saying despite them talking of Lord Buddha, nothing was done to develop or protect Buddhist sites.The CM said the BJP government's Budget was not to appease any caste or community but to cater to interest of everyone.""If we are giving electricity to Deva Sharif (in Barabanki), electricity would be provided to Mahadeva temple also. If electricity will be provided to Suresh Khanna's Shahjahanpur, it would also be provided to Rampur,"" the CM said.The CM also hit out at the SP government for ""not coordinating with the Centre for development schemes.""Hailing the Budget as one for women, poor, youth, children and everyone, the CM said the government was able to put a check on irrelevant expenses and arrange for crores for farmers' debt redemption and salary arrears for state government employees.Since SP had nothing to do with cleanliness, nothing was done under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the CM said, adding the result was that of the 100 dirtiest cities, 52 were from UP.""You didn't even spare the Ganga. Villages on the banks of Ganga were not made open defecation-free. We made 1,627 villages by Ganga ODF in just four months."""

When the teacher went to complain to his father and grandfather, they were also doing the same. Later, addressing media persons, Chaudhary clarified that he had compared the student, his father and grandfather with BJP MLAs, ministers and chief minister respectively, as the behaviour of all of them was the same.Earlier, on the floor of House, Chaudhary said the Budget should not be big or small but a disciplined one. ""It seems that the CM is rattled by the marvellous architecture and vastness of the Assembly hall as compared to Parliament and has lost control on what to say and what not,"" Chaudhary said. ""How can you claim that sugar production increased in four months of the BJP government when crushing season of sugarcane this year was yet to begin,"" Chaudhary said.""I have deep respect for you as an individual as you are not only a leader but the head priest of a temple,"" Chaudhary said and added ""you should not be arrogant. If you are a yogi, we are devotees.""However, the treasury benches stood up in protest and his words were lost in the din.Parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna meanwhile requested Speaker Hridya Narain Dixit to take up other agenda for the day even as Leader of Opposition and SP members stood up at their places. Enraged over not being allowed to speak, a united Opposition staged a walkout even as Speaker adjourned the proceeding until Thursday.Later, Chaudhary said that since 1977, when he became a member of the House, he had never seen an occasion when the LoP 's mic was switched off. ""The BJP government has fallen from the eyes of the people in four months only,"" Chaudhary said, adding that both in Centre and UP, an undeclared emergency had been clamped.""Let them hold a CBI inquiry, we are not afraid of them.

But once inside the ring, the fighter known as The Greatest asked his trainer, Angelo Dundee, to take off the tape.The photo of a sweat-drenched Ali fending off a punishing swing from Spinks  the name Cleto Reyes visibly stamped on his glove  was published around the world after the former champ, then aged 36, seized back the heavyweight title belt from his 25-year-old opponent.That particular pair of gloves was made by longtime Cleto Reyes employee Ruben Albarran, today aged 64. It was one of the first pairs I made, he said at one of the companys two factories on the outskirts of Mexico City.When I saw the fight, I was so excited for the company. Then I saw the picture in the newspaper.Mr. Albarran grew up with dreams of becoming a boxer himself, but when he was 15 years old, his father told him he was crazy, he said. So he went for the next best thing, in his eyes: a job making gloves at Cleto Reyes.It is nearly the same story as that of Alberto Reyess father, Cleto Reyes himself.As a young man in the 1930s, he idolised Mexicos then-emerging boxers like Juan Zurita and Rodolfo Casanova.Trying his luckIn those days, amateurs were allowed to get in the ring and try their luck  and Mr. Reyes, whose day job was making baseball gear at a local factory, did just that.He lasted three rounds, said his son. The trainers told him, Go to the gym, learn how to hold your hands. Youve got potential and youre brave.Mr. Reyes was traumatised for life. But he used his experience stitching baseball gear to patch up his damaged gloves after that fight.Soon he was making his own gloves  and gained the notice of his idol Zurita, who used Cleto Reyes gloves in a 1945 championship bout against American boxer Ike Williams.Word spread from one boxer to another that Cleto Reyes made an exceptional pair of gloves.And the list of famous clients grew: Joe Louis, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Oscar De La Hoya... even Sylvester Stallone as Rocky .Pride and craftAlberto Reyes says the company has never paid a fighter to wear its gloves. They use them because they feel safe, because they know theyre going to score a knockout, he said.Cleto Reyes gloves are a source of pride in Mexico.The firms artisans start by selecting the best-quality leather. Then they painstakingly cut it, sew it and stuff it with foam and horsehair. It is an old-school exercise in craft, using old-fashioned sewing machines. A professional pair of Cleto Reyes gloves costs $75 (Rs. 4,800)."

Hypoglycemia was common in patients with type 2 diabetes, with an estimated 38% of patients experiencing it, he said, adding that mostly due to a meal-drug mismatch  an ill-timed insulin dose, excess of insulin, a missed meal or sometimes alcohol ingestion could be the cause.Asymptomatic hypoglycemiaDr. Mahadevan also spoke of asymptomatic hypoglycemia, where the patient experiences an episode but with no symptoms.Educating patients, allaying their fears and modification of medicines are important to help prevent further episodes, and in this, newer drugs may help, he said.

To prevent this, they should be provided with jobs under MGNREGA schemes. Works such as construction of bunds and removal of silt in local tanks should be taken up involving the local people without further delay, he said.The groundwater table has further dipped to 800 ft. from 700 ft. This is an alarming situation. To increase the water table, check dams should be constructed.The zilla panchayat members have to identify places in their respective constituencies and take the support of the Minor Irrigation officials in constructing check dams.There is every possibility of drinking water shortage surfacing in the district and hence, rural people should be sensitised in using water judiciously.Farmers cultivating vegetables, sugarcane and fruits using irrigation facility should be educated on adopting drip irrigation to grow more crops using less quantity of water. Horticulture and Agriculture officials have to camp in hoblis and conduct awareness programmes on drip irrigation, he said.Officials of the Department of Agriculture said that under the Prime Ministers Fasal Bima Yojana, Rs. 171 crore has been sanctioned to the district of which Rs. 65 crore has been released. A sum of Rs. 41 crore could not be remitted to bank accounts, as IFSC code did not match with bank accounts. Another sum of Rs. 107 crore is expected to be released, they added. Reading out from the rain report, the officials said that against an average of 235 mm rainfall till July third week, the district has received 137 mm rainfall which is almost 40 % deficient.As much as 12,500 quintals of seeds were procured, of which 9,787 quintals have been distributed. Similarly, 12,300 tonnes of fertilizera have been distributed, they said.Mr. Kulkarni directed zilla panchayat Chief Executive Officer Snehal Rayamane to hand over clean drinking water units in rural areas to the respective gram panchayats. The maintenance of these units should be handed over to the taluk panchayat. Matters related to ration card distribution, Bhagya Lakshmi bond, anganwadi centres, and others were discussed.Zilla panchayat president Chaitra Shirur, MLAs C. Shivalli, N.H. Konaraddi, Deputy Commissioner S.B. Bommanahalli, Superintendent of Police Sangeetha G. and others were present."

In Vellore district alone, 26 centres in the Sholinghur block and 28 in the Pernambut block would be upgraded.Among the 42 health districts in the State,as many as 42 model blocks have been selected underthe scheme. A total of 988 health sub-centres in these 42 blocks would be upgraded, with each block being allocated Rs. 1 crore for the purpose, health officials said.The scheme would be implemented from September.The blocks had been selected on the basis of certain parameters such as backwardness , public demand and difficulty in access to the areas, K.S.T. Suresh, deputy director of health services, Vellore said.Under the scheme, an additional village health nurse (VHN) would be appointed to each health sub-centre, besides the existing VHN. The additional VHN would attend to out patients between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. daily.At present, the VHN posted to the health sub-centre followed a fixed tour programme that included conducting ante natal clinic at the centre on a fixed day and field activities such as visits to anganwadi centres and vaccination, he said.With the upgradation, the additional VHN would be available at the centre. These VHNs will provide follow-up drugs to persons, who are already under treatment for non-communicable diseases at Primary Health Centres or government hospitals. They will also take basic measurements such as blood pressure level, height and weight, he said.The VHNs had been trained in identifying the signs and symptoms of 18 minor ailments such as diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections. They will also conduct basic tests for pregnant women such as blood sugar and haemogloblin, he said .Tabs for VHNsBesides computerising the details of the patients, their Aadhaar number and biometric details too will be registered.This would enable them to continue treatment in any rural health facility in any part of the State.Tabs will be provided for the VHNs, and they would be trained in entering patient details to create a database for patients, Dr. Suresh said."

It starts as a feeling of dread at around 3 p.m. and gives in to some ill-advised snacking by 4 p.m. This is where Neha Pandit Tembe comes in with Snack Right, a subscription box for your daily snacking needs. Each box takes care of 15 days of nibbles with two snacks a day. Wholesome granola bars, trail mixes, whole grain puffs, sweet nutri pops, crackers, multigrain mixtures all made with ingredients nutritionists love to exhort you to take: oats, amaranth, nuts, dates, seeds and so on. Every product is natural, no added sugars (no sucrose, glucose or corn syrup etc) or refined flours and no trans fats or preservatives.Tembe is a nutritionist who has studied nutrition at SNDT, Mumbai and M.S. University, Baroda. She has a masters (M.Sc Dietetics and is a University Gold medallist. She says, In the academic arena, the health benefits of many traditional ingredients is being explored these days. Her study of food apart, she has also years of experience: three years of lecturing at SNDT and two years of consulting at Anjali Mukerjees diet clinics along with research in nutrition and health for several local, national, international projects.The years of interacting with clients of all shapes and sizes made Tembe realise that people wanted to eat healthy but often just did not have the time to make it. She says, There is a lacuna in the fresh food market. I thought I should provide salad and soup. But salads and their freshness are problematic to maintain. This is when she realised that the other time people cheat is when they are reaching for snacks and in-between-meal solutions. Reading off shelves of dietary foods, Tembe says she could see how harmful many so-called diet foods really could be.She says, People will eat anything that says baked or roasted and not realise that they are eating maida or other kinds of fats. Diet khari makes me crazy  look at the composition, its still maida and fat in all the layers. Tembe feels its a challenge to educate people on labels and what they mean. She feels nutrition-seekers must consult professionals on products that have added sugars and trans fats.All ingredients and products source are examined very carefully. I cannot compromise on this. I am always talking to my suppliers about whether they use colours, sweeteners or maida. I check their laboratory certifications As her products have a limited shelf life, Tembe says the business is a challenge. Nuts and seeds, in particular, go off faster than other ingredients. Seasonal fluctuations can also cause ingredients to behave unpredictably and a lot of ingredients get discarded, she says. Things like nuts cannot be ordered in bulk because they dont taste fresh and yet suppliers cater to large orders only. I am now working on better storage for my ingredients.Tembe has a unit in Vile Parle east that she works out of. Her business was launched in May last year. Now she is researching how to upscale her module. She presently has a team of five managing the manufacturing, packaging and logistics. Each snack is between 100 and 140 calories and this works for most people. She adds, If someone has a more specific diet requirement or is diabetic, I tailor according to that. Heres a sample to tickle your afternoon slump: date coco delight, cashew craving bar, date lemon fusion, tangy apricot bar, super seed snack mix, ragi power puffs, minty jowar power puffs and Punjabi tadka makhana puffs to name a few of the over 35 products she already has listed.

Kavitha, Deputy Director of Agriculture Rajeswari and other officials were present.S. Nallasamy, president, Lower Bhavani Farmers Welfare Association said that 50% of the coconut trees had withered while there is no water for cattle and humans. He said that farmers insistence led to the release of 440 cusecs of water from Amaravathi Dam and wanted 200 cusecs water to be released in the canal. He wanted the district administration to recommend the State government for release of water. The same was insisted by many farmers and representatives of various farmers associations.Logusamy of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association wanted food processing park to be established at many places in the district so that grading of vegetables could be done for exports. He also wanted food Technology Park for brown sugar like the one established in Karnataka so that modern methods in production could be adopted.A farmer Krishnamoorthy said that a private sugar mill is yet to pay the outstanding due from December 2014 and insisted that the dues are settled. The Collector said that a second notice has been served to the mill and added that settlement to farmers will be made within August 21.When the issue of over-digging of water bodies for lifting sand and gravel was brought to the notice of the administration, the Collector asked farmers to lift gravel only after obtaining permission from the competent authority.

Every evening, thousands of smartphones beep with this notification  ""Dimple D'Souza is broadcasting on Bigo Live "".Immediately, the owners of these smartphones swipe right to enter a live chat where a Chennai-based broadcaster is showing off her makeup skills in a lace black off-the-shoulder dress. As she talks, Dimple's screen is flooded with instant messages from followers, who ply her with virtual gifts like roses and tiaras.Dimple is a star on Bigo Live, a Singapore-based app, which is a cross between Snapchat (a messaging app that allows you to post short videos which disappear after 24 hours) and Periscope (Twitter's live streaming video app where videos can be saved) for its live-streaming and multimedia messaging features. It's just one of many live-streaming platforms that allow users to showcase their skills and make a quick buck from their fan base.Dimple, for instance, earns a six-figure salary from live streaming alone. A makeup artist cum love guru, she broadcasts on a range of topics from health to relationships to paranormal activity.The app claims to have over 20 million registered users in India. Unlike YouTube, every user is both a broadcaster and follower. The more people you follow, the more followers you earn, who in turn gift you virtual stuff like a picture of a sports car, which can be exchanged for money. Other apps simply pay you based on the number of followers. Users range from college students to 20-something millennials who sing, bake cakes, stream video game sessions and jabber about mundane stuff.To gain more followers and subsequently more cash, a lot of broadcasts get a little raunchy. A quick glance through various streams reveals teenaged girls lying on the bed in provocative positions reading out onscreen messages and answering questions about their personal life with eager fans. Across the screen 'call me' and 'sexy' mushrooms over the comments section along with bubbling heart emojis. Earlier this year, Vice wrote about how sugar daddies in Indonesia were spending a big slice of their incomes on sending virtual gifts to women starring in such X-rated streams.There are other ways to make streaming money. Ishan Agarwal, a Gurgaon-based photographer, who sings for his followers on a range of popular apps like BeLive, BigoLive and Live.me, recently pocketed Rs 16,000 from his 5 lakh followers.""I spend 2-3 hours every day on these apps,"" says Ishan, who stopped considering it ""timepass"" ever since money began streaming in. ""Last month I earned Rs 16,000 by completing Bigo Live target of gaining 5 lakh followers. As your followers grow, you get new targets. Users can earn up to $1000 a month by completing targets on time.Another way of earning money is through encashing the virtual gifts. If you are a popular streamer, the followers send you virtual gifts. The streamers, in turn, can stock up these gifts that can be transformed into 'beans'. The more popular the streamer, the more beans they earn. These beans can be encashed for real money which the app deposits in your account. The current 'bean' exchange rate is 210 beans for US $1,"" he adds.The apps portray themselves as more accessible versions of television's 'Indian Idol' or 'America's Got Talent'. ""Our target audience is anyone with a smartphone and talent,"" says a senior director from Bigo Live.Live streaming apps have also become a great marketing tool for automobiles and media brands. Last year, Jaguar Land Rover India launched the Discovery Sport, a luxury SUV, live on Periscope. Abroad, these apps are also a hit with property agents who conduct house viewings for their real estate clients.For 25-year-old stand-up comedian Duksh, live streaming helps promote his upcoming gigs without having to hire PR people. ""The more people you follow, the more followers you have!""Live streaming apps have also becoming a platform to let professional gamers broadcast themselves playing video games live on their PC.Their spectators are usually other gamers who wish to learn the modus operandi of the games like Clash of Clans, League of Legends, DOTA II, FIFA online among others. They can also learn about the latest games or just make friends with those who share the same passion for the game.Of course, in this age of online trolls and stalkers, live streaming has its dark side. Dimple, who has over 80,000 followers, has dealt with obsessive fans. She recounts an incident where one follower went a bit overboard  incessantly messaging and showering her with gifts.""Every time I would mute him, he would change his name and appear on the next broadcast with the same request to call him,"" she recalls.""So, at last, I called him during the broadcast and asked him to reveal his real name. He was reluctant because he said his wife uses the app too."""

Drug stores, however, fear it could take much longer.Nearly 40% of drug distributors in Bengal are yet to secure GST registration, and this is one of the factors affecting the flow of medicines into retail stores, says WBCDA. Even though drug prices have remained uncha-nged post-GST  retailers are selling old stocks at pre-GST prices  a 2%- 2.5% rise is imminent from October.But what has left Kolkatans worried is the short supply of some essential medicines like Galvusmet (for blood sugar), Stamlo 5 (for blood pressure) and widely used antacids Pan 40 and Pan D. Several drug stores in south and central Kolkata have been able to procure less than half the requirement for these medicines in August.""Several commonly prescribed drugs have suddenly disappeared. This is due to the slow supply from the distributors' end. Around 40% of the latter are yet to get GST registrations, without which they can't procure drugs. So, the supply volume has gone down,"" said Subodh Ghosh, the general secretary of WBCDA.Thankfully, most retailers have multiple distributors to fall back on. So, even if one can't supply certain drugs, others chip in. This has ensured that all drugs are still available, though their supplies have remained insufficient. ""It's taking time to replenish the stock of some essential drugs, which is a worry. Some of these are cardiac, blood pressure and diabetes-control medicines that have to be taken regularly by patients. This has left many of our customers desperate and we have been forced to direct them to other shops. But it is turning out to be difficult for the elderly to procure some of these medicines,"" said Sanjay Majumdar, owner of The Pharmacy, a drug store in New Alipore.Drug store chains like Blue Print and Frank Ross, too, have been grappling with the shortage . It ranges between 20% and 30%, according to a Frank Ross spokesperson. ""By the time we manage to have an adequate supply of a few, several others are turning scarce. We had expected the supply to normalize by August, but distributors are still struggling to secure enough drugs. It seems unlikely for the supply to normalize before September,"" he said.Many distributors have been thrown out of the supply chain since they don't have GST registration, yet, said Ghosh. They are also struggling to install software and adapt to the new procurement and distribution rules in the GST regime. ""With the demand for software, necessitated by the new GST billing pattern having suddenly shot up, hundreds of distributors have been left in the lurch. They are still waiting for software and personnel to install and operate them. Till they can arrange for these, supply will remain irregular. But things are improving,"" said Ghosh.He added that the new GST rules have also led to a cost escalation for distributors and small retailers, threatening their existence. ""While big retailers can easily appoint personnel to look after their software requirements and tax return formalities - that have now changed - smaller ones are struggling with the additional expenditure,"" said Ghosh."

Forest officials don't know the big cat's gender or age. All three killings made by the feline were similar in fashion-it had killed the victim by clawing the neck and snuffing life out, like a fierce German Shepherd dog does.In none of the cases did it eat the flesh. ""It's not a man-eater, just a stray,"" said V K Singh, conservator, Bareilly , who is camping in the forest area since August 9 along with five vets and darting experts. The team is armed with eight tranquilising guns. Team from the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) has also joined the search operation.On Saturday, drone camera was used to comb the area and dispel fear among villagers that the tiger could be lurking in their village. The killings were reported on August 7, 9 and 10. The deceased were working in sugarcane fields all alone when the tiger attacked them. The cane has just been sown and the fields are gradually getting dense. Combing the area, in such a situation, is a challenge and also threatening. That's where Batalik and Gajraj's would prove helpful.Elephants and tigers avoid coming face to face. Also, they react to each other's spoor instantly. Batalik and Gajraj know it well.Batalik was born in 1999 on the day Indian Army won its toughest challenge during the Kargil war and that's how the jumbo got its name. Gajraj, also born and brought up in Dudhwa tiger reserve like Batalik, was born in 1995. The two were brought to Pilibhit reserve in February to catch another tiger that had strayed out at that time. Besides, they have been part of almost every combing operation by forest officials.Combing in Pilibhit is on since Thursday, when the last killing was reported. The three men were killed in villages hardly 4kms apart. The tiger, at present, is 16km out of the forest area moving in the periphery.""We have issued alert in 19 villages around the reserve and are assuring villagers of early solution,"" said the official. Villagers have been advised not to venture into the forest or out of the village alone, to keep their children indoors after sunset and not go out without a torch or a lighting equipment. A control room number has been circulated among villagers to seek help and drop alerts as well.The said tiger was for the first time caught in a camera trap on July 14th, about 500 metres outside forest. Since then the tiger has been moving along Devha river in the area. On August 4, it was caught on camera again about 16km outside forest.""But now it could be moving back to forest as show his pattern of movement,"" said the official.Meanwhile, officials are getting lot of hoax call. On Friday, officers received 15 hoax calls and on Saturday at least seven. ""We did not find tiger anywhere but several jackals, hyenna and other animals,"" he said."

However, a twist to the tale came within hours of passing the order through a clarification from food minister R Kamaraj , who said the GO was issued only to comply with the guidelines prescribed by the Centre under the Food Security Act, but the state government would continue with its universal PDS The GO, which would remain just as a piece of paper for now, says households with air conditioners or an annual income of 1 lakh and above are not eligible to get any commodity from PDS shops. In effect, whether the state government implements its own order or not, TN would not be able to get Central food subsidy for ineligible families.""We have issued an order as per the Act as it is mandatory to identify the priority households. But as pointed out when the act was adopted by Tamil Nadu, the present universal PDS, which includes 20kg of free rice, will continue to be provided to all households irrespective of the provisions of the Food Security Act,"" food department principal secretary Pradeep Yadav told TOI.As per the GO, 9 types of households will fall outside the purview of PDS. ""Households with an income tax payer, having professional tax payers, farmers owning 5 acres, government employees and retired employees, those who own 4 wheelers (except in cases where it is used for livelihood), those owning air conditioner, owning enterprises registered under any law and families whose annual income is more than Rs 1 lakh from all sources will not be eligible for PDS as per the Act,"" said the secretary.The act says only those households which are dependent on Antyoaya Anna Yojana, Annapurana Anna Yojana, families living below poverty line, old age pensioners, households headed by widows or single women and households headed by differently-abled persons are eligible to get commodities under PDS.There are many middle class households in the state which purchase at least sugar from PDS shops every month and give their ration cards to maids to purchase other commodities. ""If the act is implemented in letter and spirit, it will prevent corruption and black marketing in PDS shops. Many card holders get SMS alerts about purchase of commodities from ration shops even without their visiting the shops,"" said retired bank employee S Saraswathi.Some sections feel the order, though not being implemented now, would come into force at some stage in future.""I am the only earning member in my family of 5 people. I am an income tax payer, but still depend on PDS for various commodities excluding rice. If the conditions as per the Act come into force, I am in for trouble,"" said a secretariat employee not willing to be named. Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa continued to oppose the Food Security Act till she was admitted to hospital in September last year."

""The current generation of the leopards is more comfortable with human settlements than the older ones,"" a forest officer said.The officials also claimed that the animal has changed its hunting pattern and now prefers to attack only during night.The present generation of the animal prefers to stay in area close to hamlets, deputy forest conservator C F Mhase told TOI over the phone.""Most of the cubs are born in sugarcane fields close to villages. As a result, these cubs start observing human beings right from their early days. Human beings are not unknown to them anymore,"" he said.""They also get an easy prey base of dogs, rabbits and frogs in the sugarcane fields. As a result, their struggle for food has reduced and they feel safe in the fields. We have observed that leopards prefer to stay close to human settlements now,"" Mhase added.The researchers have found that the man-animal conflict mostly rises during the cane crushing period. ""Animals do not like to migrate to a new place, as they often struggle to get adequate food and water. This is the reason that the cane crushing period witnesses the maximum number of leopard attacks,"" the official said.Veterinarian Ajay Deshmukh , who is the head of the Manikdoh Animal Rescue Centre and working in the division for the last 10 years, said, ""The animal observes human settlements closely and changes its behaviour. For example, it only attacks during night as human presence in an area is less during the dark hours.""Wildlife experts and forest officials feel that catching the animal is not a scientific solution to reduce the conflicts.""In 1999-2004, 104 leopards were caught by the forest department. But it didn't yield much result. The capacity of the rescue centre is 34 and it is already full. Even if we catch one more leopard, we cannot release it in another forest as it will be difficult for the animal to survive,"" an official said. Vidya Athreya , a wildlife biologist and research associate with the Centre for Wildlife Studies and Wildlife Conservation Society, said, ""It is difficult for people to accept that there's presence of the animal in the vicinity. They get food close to places were human beings stay. It is natural that the leopards will visit such places in search of food."""

He is always available to those who are willing to learn the skills he had acquired over the years from many well-known masters in Kanyakumari district. In return, he accepts no money as fee.Before breathing his last, my master Chellaiah Asan from Thuckalay told me that I should teach the art to anyone who is interested. He also elicited a promise that I should not collect money for teaching the art. My wife sometimes says I should charge at least a nominal fee. But I cannot afford to violate the promise I made to my teacher, said Shenbgalingam Asan, who ekes out a living by working as a water pump operator in a local college and is supported by government pension.He is so popular that even a child in Rajakkamangalam, a small town in Kanyakumari district, knows the name of Shenbagalingam Asan. Hailing from Thekkurichi village, he first learnt silambam from Venkatachalam of Alathankaram, whom he called Annachi (elder brother).He told me that I should further improve my skills by learning from others. Fortunately for me, Minnal Thiraviam, an outstanding teacher of silambam and other martial arts, settled in my village. He shaped me well, recalled Shenbagalingam Asan, who is also adept at using his hand to ward off attackers with lethal weapons.Later he learnt from Stunt Thiraviam of Pattasalianvilai, Narayanan Asan of Moolachi and Chellaiah Asan.Proliferation of teachersMartial arts as a form was once confined to the soldiers of the Travancore Army and reached others when Veluthampi Thalavai recruited a lot of people. That explains the presence of many martial arts masters in Kanyakumari districts, explained Shenbagalingam Asan, who recommends a sweet made of palm sugar, rice, dried ginger and fenugreek to keep fit.On those who had learnt the art and then used it to intimidate others, he said everything depended on the mindset of the individual.We normally avoid such elements. If you acquire complete knowledge of the art, you will not waste your skills in creating nuisance for others. Never in my life have I hit anyone and have not been hit by anyone either. I have never stepped into a police station, laughed Asan."

These robbers have slashed commuters during peak hour and have also not spared RPF sleuths.""Most of the men caught for looting cellphones or cash from commuters are drug users. They are hooked to brown sugar, mephedrone or whitener and need to make Rs 1000 to 2000 per day to fund their addiction. Besides blades, they could carry pen knives or cigarette lighters. They may even use the weapon to injure themselves so as to avert a conviction,"" a senior RPF official said.On August 5, three men were spotted in the CCTV footage of Kurla station, around 1 pm, while they were robbing a commuter's cellphone near a first-class coach. The RPF kept a watch for the men to return. At 3.20pm, one of the three was spotted again on platform 1 and was picked up. On sustained questioning, he led the RPF to his associates. ""At the chowky, one of the robbers Sakir Sayed, slashed his neck with a blade that he had been hiding in his pocket,"" said senior inspector Suresh Atri of Kurla RPF. Offenders may later claim, before court, that the prosecuting agency had inflicted the injury on them. ""We shot a video clip of Sayed where he admitted he had hurt himself. Sayed claimed he wasn't involved in any crime and was only hanging out with a friend when he got arrested,"" said Atri.Another trick used by these offenders is to fake an attack of epileptic fits on being arrested. Sadiq Shaikh, who was nabbed last month, remained coiled on the floor till we sprinkled some water on him,"" said an RPF officer. Another offender, Manoj Kamble, caught on Saturday, started frothing from the mouth while his questioning was on. But he too sat upright soon after.The RPF has compiled CCTV grabs to understand the different modus operandi used by these offenders. ""In some cases, a robber discreetly pokes a commuter standing at the door of a train that has just begun to move. The commuter drops his phone on the platform, as a result. The robber then picks it up and pretends he is all set to hand it to the cops while he actually pockets the device,"" said an officer. Another method used by robbers is to jump into a coach, along with the other co-passengers, as soon as a train arrives on the platform. The robber then steals someone's phone in the melee and gets off, claiming he has boarded a wrong train.A pickpocket, Gafar Ali Shaikh, who has been nabbed by the Kurla GRP over and over since last year, gave a demo to investigators on how he hides a razor blade in his cheek and pulls it out whenever he has to slice a commuter's pocket.The RPF has now issued an advisory for commuters to keep a check on their belongings every time they board or alight from a coach and to not brandish their phones or valuables while standing at the compartment entrance."

The delay was because the consumers had not provided details like date of birth, Aadhaar card details, change of address and other details or because there were discrepancies.He said they had received over 200 complaints in the last four months about misuse of the system, where the people had received SMSs saying they had purchased goods, when they had not. Inquiries have been conducted and the respective supervisor and salesman of the shops were slapped with fines of Rs 25 for each kg of rice, Rs 50 for kg palmoil, Rs 50 for a kg of sugar and Rs 75 for every kg of dals purchased through fake bills.The DSO said that people who have no commodity cards, which they did not use to purchase also have to get their cards upgraded into smart cards, which they could do so by approaching the e-service centres in the district, by the end of this month.How to complain wrong billing:If the consumers of the PDS system receive SMSs for goods not purchased by them on their ration card or smart card, they can lodge a complaint by dialling the toll free numbers 1967 or 1800 425 5901."

Presently Villupuram town region alone was covered under the scheme.Brushing aside the criticisms by the opposition parties on the closeness of the Tamil Nadu state government with the Union government, he said the state government, which focuses on people's welfare, will maintain a cordial relationship with the Centre. He said MGR, who supported the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi also supported her successors including Morarji Desai and Charan Singh as he was keen in implementing people welfare measures without any hiccups.""We are more concerned in launching and implementing schemes for the welfare of the people and we are not bothered about opposition parties' criticisms,"" he said.He said the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had said her sacred duty was to fulfill the promises she made to the voters.

As of August 9, agriculture department data shows zero paddy activity in the district.In fact, the time has passed for farmers to plant the regular, long-term variety of the crop. If there is sufficient rain in the coming days, the department may issue a short term variety of seeds which take 3-4 months to harvest.""The time to plant the regular variety ended on July 8.There hasn't been enough rain to sow even ragi, which consumes only a portion of the water needed for paddy,"" joint director (agriculture) MN Rajasulochana told TOI.""This is for the first time in decades that there is absolutely no paddy in the district, according to farmers and officers who have served here.

The targeted area of ragi, paddy and other crops was devised by t h e g o ve r n m e n t , which supplies the seeds, based on rain predictions.With tanks, wells and borewells dry and no water from KRS, Mandya district is dependent on rain this season.""Officials may say they are yet to take stock of borewell-fed land, but they will find nothing,"" Induvalu Chandrashekhar, a farmer leader, said.Mandya is spread over 4.98 lakh hectares, of which 2.48 lakh hectares are the sown area. Of the 1.17 lakh hectares of irrigated area, 88,000 hectares get water from KRS and 16,000 from Hemavathi reservoir. The rest is irrigated by tanks, wells and borewells.In villages like Ganadahosuru and Ankanahalli, farmers have committed suicide due to failure of borewells.The few working borewells are laid low by lack of power.

""This is achieved largely because of alasande (cowpea),"" Rajasulochana said. Data shows the district has sown it in 22,047 hectares.Sunanda Jayaram, another farmer leader, said: ""The approach to agriculture must change if the government wants to prevent farmers' suicides. Every strata of our society borrows money, but why do only farmers commit suicide?""

Retail inflation jumped to 2.36 per cent in the month, chiefly driven by hardening of prices of sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants.""We estimate August CPI and WPI inflation to rise further to 3.0 per cent and 2.1 per cent year-on-year, respectively, based on current trends in high-frequency food prices and global commodity prices,"" Morgan Stanley said in the research note.Post RBI 's rate cut by 25 bps earlier this month, the debate on further easing continues on expectation that inflationary pressures would remain subdued, providing the central bank with further room to ease.However, Morgan Stanley maintains that RBI is unlikely to take up any further cuts as inflation is expected to gradually edge back towards the target of 4 per cent.The report said on expectation of CPI inflation rising further in August, the incoming data prints will likely mean that the MPC may adopt a wait and watch approach in the October meeting by keeping rates on hold.For easing of monetary policy, the report said, there is a need to see further deceleration in underlying inflation pressures."

Through this process, they have been able to predict that the health condition, affecting millions of Indians, can be completely reversed. The model and its results were published in the August edition of the journal PLOS ONE.The researchers, under the leadership of Milind Watve , used what is technically called a 'network model'  a giant cobweb of sorts in which perturbing one thread disturbs the entire network. The model suggests that even when sugar is controlled without hypoglycemia, the progress of diabetes pathology could not be arrested. In the complex network, increased blood glucose is not central to the pathophysiological changes in T2DM and, therefore, controlling sugar was ineffective in reversing the condition.The research revealed that increased blood glucose is only a symptom and not the root cause of T2DM. The researchers said targeting glucose and insulin are unlikely to do the job because both of them do not appear to be central to pathophysiology of T2DM. ""It might be only a burden of history that we associate only glucose and insulin with T2DM. In reality, there are over 70 molecules involved in inter-organ signaling. Glucose and insulin are only two out of the lot. There is no evidence that they are the key molecules in the complex network,"" the research revealed.According to the study, once an individual gets into an insulin resistant or diabetic trap, it is difficult to come out of it. In the model, coming out of the state was not possible by regulating insulin and glucose, but by other means. This implies that diabetes has alternate cures, including signals in the brain and behavior which can make a complete reversal possible, the researchers said.Senior diabetologist C S Yajnik of KEM Hospital, however, advised caution. ""The treatment involves targetting different organs, including the pancreas, liver, kidney, intestine and brain. Computer modelling will be useful to generate hypothesis, but it requires testing on human beings,"" he said."

Accordingly, the issue price at the fair price shop was fixed as Rs 13.50 with a view to distributing sugar under the Public Distribution System at no cost on the State government. Now, the market rate of sugar has gone upto Rs 42 per kg and the State government has all along borne this additional expenditure of approximately Rs 10 per kg.Therefore, the level of subsidy, which was fixed way back in 2002, may be revised at least as Rs 28.50 per kg of sugar, Palaniswami added.He said the supply has also been restricted to only one kg per family, which was very low keeping in view the average family size of approximately four persons in Tamil Nadu. The State government had been distributing sugar at the scale of 0.5 kg per person subject to a ceiling of two kg per card.Stating that it might not be desirable to bring down the current scale of supply among the poorest of the poor, he said the present scale of supply should be protected."

During his amateur boxing days, Jitender tasted fair success - winning a bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games , two bronze medals at the Asian Championships and a bronze at the 2008 World Cup. He was also a quarterfinalist at the Beijing Olympics where he fought his last-16 bout with stiches on his chin.Now, with an aim to replicate the success he achieved when competing at the amateur circuit, Jitender is now focused and committed to his pro-boxing career.In a chat with TOI, the 28-year-old spoke about the reason he returned to boxing and his ultimate aim - to fight for the world title one day.ExcerptsIt has been almost a year since I decided to turn pro. In fact, it all started with Akhil (Kumar). I was posted as ACP (Crime) Gurgaon and the offer for pro boxing came to me via Akhil. He told me that those competing as pro can also participate in Olympics now and it will be a chance for us to replicate the success we achieved as amateurs. So, we decided to try our luck and then sought the permission of the (Haryana) government to allow us to resume our careers and they fully supported us.I entered the ring after quite a long time. It felt good to be back. Thankfully it has begun well, I won my first bout. Let's hope it stays that way and I will continue winning.Tentatively in October/November. It will be clear in the coming weeks.I remember the 2006 Commonwealth Games when I won the bronze medal. And after that the quarterfinals of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. I had a satisfying career but the only regret is to have missed out on an Olympic medal by a whisker. But I don't fret on it, whatever happens, happens for the best.Yes. For a sportsperson, the dream is to represent the country and there's not a bigger stage than the Olympics. Winning a medal there would have been a dream come true. So sometimes, when I am sitting alone, the memories come rushing back - I made it to the quarterfinals and was just one step away from the medal. But I am sure, I'll make up for it.Well, boxing is the reason that I am known today. The recognition and success came after it. So how can you ever stop doing that? That I became a cop was only due to my boxing career. Being a cop was different. I enjoyed being both (boxer and cop). I try to give my best in any field - be it sparring with boxers or fighting crime. Whatever task is handed to me, I dedicate myself 100 percent to it and never take it as a burden. So, I never gave a second thought about returning to boxing.American boxer Sugar Ray Leonard , because I believe our styles are a lot similar. I follow him - his footwork, hands down approach and speed. He was an entertainer.Professional is tougher. No doubt about that. The gloves are quite set and small - amateurs weigh 10 ounces - two less than what are used in professional. The world title fights are of 12 rounds but in amateurs it is less. I am not claiming that amateur boxing is easier - the competition is very tough in Olympics but pro boxing is more demanding.A lot has changed today. Now, every time a boxer or any other athlete goes to the Olympics, a medal is expected. It's not just about participation anymore. I hope we will start getting more medals.I don't even think about these things. The level at which we are competing, these things shouldn't even matter. We cannot fret about who will say what or what the consequences will be. The international body has made it clear, pro boxers can compete at the Olympics There's a system in place qualifications were held (for Rio Olympics). I don't think there should be any problem.To compete for the world title. I won't be satisfied competing in 5-6 rounds bouts. The target is for 12 rounds.Let's see what happens. I will think about it later. Right now I am fully focused to professional boxing."

PCOS can affect patients menstrual cycle, fertility, cardiac function and appearance.Once a women is diagnosed of PCOS, they have to realise that it is never going to be cured completely and the best way the side effects can be kept at bay is through medication, regular exercise and diet control, said A Pallavi, gynaecologist at Pallavi Nursing Home. Women with PCOS are at high risk of uterine, ovarian, endometrial and breast cancers. Their body tends to have higher than normal estrogen levels which can trigger these cancers, Pallavi said.Undiagnosed PCOS can lead to infertility and in the long term, several health complications which can be attributed to other factors as well, said G Saradha, a gynaecologist.She said her hospital witness at least 10- 15 young women per day seeking medical help for PCOS. Early diagnosis and treatment can help control the symptoms and prevent health-related problems. Medical tests like testosterone test along with a host of other tests like blood sugar, insulin, FSH and LH can diagnose the disease, she added.What is PCOS?Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition where imbalance in hormones - estrogen and progesterone - lead to cyst formation in the ovary. PCOS is a vicious cycle. Abnormal hormone level leads to cyst in the ovary which further leads to hormonal imbalance, obesity and problems linked with fertility, say gynaecologists.CausesThe exact cause of PCOS is not known. Gynaecologists believe that hormonal imbalance and genetics play a key role. Women are more likely to develop PCOS if their mother or sister also has the condition. Women with PCOS often produce higher-than-normal levels of androgen. This can affect their development and release of eggs during ovulation. Excess insulin may lead to high androgen levelsSymptomsSymptoms of PCOS typically start soon after a woman begins to menstruate for the first time. The type and severity of symptoms varies from person to person.It includesExcess hair on the face, chest, stomach, thumbsor toesDecrease in breast sizeDeeper voiceHair lossInfertilityDiagnosisThere is no definite test for PCOS. While gynaecologists suggest that blood test and thyroid test will help determine the severity of the case. A vaginal ultrasound will give real-time images of the reproductive organs in women to provide better medical care."

The Lokayukta had taken up a suo motu enquiry based on news reports about ineligible BPL and APL cards. The Lokayukta appointed Dr R Balasubramaniam of Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement to investigate into the irregularities.The Food and Civil Supplies Department had entered into a contract with Comat Technologies Pvt Ltd to identify beneficiaries and issue BPL cards. The Lokayukta had sent the report recommending action against officials and private firms responsible for the loss in keeping with section 12 (3) of the Lokayukta Act in 2011. When there was neither any action nor any action taken report, the then Lokayukta Justice Y Bhaskar Rao sent a report to the Governor in 2013.The enquiry report had stated that the PDS scheme was loaded with errors of exclusion of actual BPL families from the BPL status, inclusion of APL families into the BPL category, and ghost cards, whose owners could not be verified. During the enquiry period, it was found that the state government had more cards issued than the number of people in the state. The statistics showed that a total of 1.6 crore ration cards were distributed, while the total number of families in the state was just 1.2 crore.Rs 144-cr monthly lossThe enquiry report estimated the monthly economic loss to the government at Rs 144 crore. It said that during the 2008-09 parliamentary elections, the government mandated that any family could be called BPL if they produced a self-declared affidavit that said they were poor.PDS was used as a political tool to gain votes and garner support. According to the governments claim, there are 96 lakh BPL families in the state whereas the investigation found the number of genuine BPL families in Karnataka to be 44 lakh. Providing subsidised food grains for these additional families which were wrongly included in the BPL list, resulted in monthly over-allotment loss.

However, a neutral policy stance was retained owing to expectations of a higher inflation trajectory in coming days, the report noted.According to Nomura, July inflation data confirmed that inflation troughed in June, and going ahead inflation is expected to see an uptrend due to rebound in vegetable prices.Moreover, GST has also resulted in a slightly faster pace of core inflation momentum.""Most MPC members highlighted upside risks from the implementation of house rent allowance (HRA) increases, fiscal impulses such as farm loan waivers, proximity to 2019 elections, the recent uptick in inflation expectations, rising vegetable prices and the impact of GST,"" Nomura said.The wholesale inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent in July from 0.90 per cent in June 2017, mainly on account of turnaround in prices of food articles, especially vegetables.Retail inflation jumped to 2.36 per cent in the month, chiefly driven by hardening of prices of sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants.""In view of the recent data on inflation and the neutral bias of most MPC members, we expect the RBI to stay on hold in October likely with a 5-1 vote,"" the report said.Nomura expects the GST-related activity disruption to also wane, and growth and inflation to trend higher in the next 6-12 months."

Perhaps, Shah doesnt know how to behave, Siddaramaiah told reporters seeking his reaction on the issue.On Sunday, Shah visited the seer in what was seen as a move to woo the Vokkaliga community, which holds the Mutt in high reverence. However, Shah courted controversy when a picture showing him seated crosslegged in front of the seer went viral. Sitting with one leg crossed on top of the other is considered informal and disrespectful.The chief minister also hit back at Shah for calling the Karnataka government Indias most corrupt. He has no moral right to speak on corruption when he has corrupt people flanking him all the time. In the last four years, Congress has given a scam-free administration in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah said.Earlier in the day, Union Minister D V Sadananda Gowda targeted the Siddaramaiah government for not waiving loans taken by farmers from nationalised banks. Governments of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra wrote off farm loans taken from nationalised banks. It wont be a new thing if Karnataka does it. It was under the Modi government that we gave interest-free loans to sugarcane factories and ensured that 90% farmers got their dues. Also, the devolution of central funds to states is up from 32% to 42%. It is the state governments responsibility to ensure the excess 10% reaches farmers, Gowda said.Siddaramaiah responded by pointing out that former prime ministers, Manmohan Singh and V P Singh, had waived farm loans worth Rs 72,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore, respectively. If he (Manmohan Singh) could do it, why cant Modi? If the BJP doesnt do it, they are anti-farmer, he said.DH News Service"

The petition has no merits. Dismissed,"" the bench said.The non-profit company, India Awake for Transparency, had in its plea filed through advocate R Subramanian claimed there was no point in prohibiting serving of alcohol on domestic flights if passengers were free to drink or purchase it from the bars or liquor outlets in the airport terminal.It had contended that as per the aviation rules, the reason for non-serving of alcohol on domestic flights was to prevent drunken behaviour by passengers.The petitioner company had claimed that the ban was brought into force after an airline, Damania Airways (now defunct), had started serving alcoholic beverages on its domestic flights which had led to unsavoury incidents. The government had then held that such incidents were endangering flight and passenger safety. The ban has, thereafter, been in force for over two decades, it had said."

5a0f11cd9855b76bf13d5b6f,Maharashtra Kranti Morcha: All you need to know,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/aug/10/maharashtra-kranti-morcha-all-you-need-to-know-1641248.html,2017-08-10,"MUMBAI: Wednesday was the completion of one year of the silent protest marches by the Maratha community of Maharashtra. The Maratha Kranti Morchas represent the churn going on among intermediate caste groups in several parts of India, for instance, the Jats in Rajasthan and Haryana, the Gujjars in Rajasthan, the Patidars in Gujarat and the Kapus in Andhra Pradesh.Seen together, these communities are united by a demand for reservation, regardless of the fact that they enjoy reasonable access to resources and social status. In each state, they represent a challenge to the ruling coalitions headed by the BJP or its allies.In the context of Maharashtra, the Maratha protests, triggered by the gang-rape of a minor girl from the community on July 18, 2016, could pose a challenge to the government of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in the months ahead.The first of the 58 Maratha Kranti Morchas was taken out in Ahmednagar on August 9, 2016, in the aftermath of the Kopardhi gang-rape. It was the first time that the community came together on a non-political platform to make demands such as reservation and a reining in of the Atrocities Act. Within a span of a couple of months, 30 such protest marches were taken out across Maharashtra. The latest was held in Mumbai on Wednesday when more than half a million people marched.As in other protests by intermediate caste groups in other states, the Maratha rallies have remained steadfastly apolitical, a quality that confounds the traditional political parties. The Congress and the NCP, parties that traditionally enjoyed the support of the Maratha community in Maharashtra, made initial advances to claim leadership of the agitation but backed off in the face of fierce opposition from the marchers.While professing to be apolitical, it was significant that the flare-up of the morchas last year happened at a time when Maharashtra was in the throes of local body elections, which were seen as a sort of a mid-term vote on the performance of the Fadnavis government. The results were not too encouraging for the Congress and NCP: the Marathas did not vote for them despite the two opposition parties joining hands against the BJP. The BJP was able to retain the support it had earned in the 2014 Assembly election.However, the agitation polarised non-Marathas social groups -- mainly other backward classes (who account for more than one-third of the states population) and backward caste voters.During the post-demonetisation period in November 2016, the agitation saw a lull. After the protest march at Nagpur during the winter session of the Assembly, there were small, localised rallies to keep the issue burning. But Wednesday's big march in Mumbai, coming after a gap of eight months, has again boosted the marchers' fervour.Congress leader Narayan Rane said on the eve of the Mumbai march, If the government doesnt agree to all the demands, future battles will be fought in the way that the Marathas have always fought.In the popular reckoning, the Marathas are not an economically or socially underprivileged community. But its leaders have in recent years been making a case for its inclusion in the reserved category. In a report submitted to the state government in 2014, Narayan Rane said, The Marathas are mostly farmers and labourers who depend on the employment guarantee scheme. Their economic condition is pathetic. Maratha students are poor and often dont have money to complete their education and struggle to get good jobs. The committee, headed by Rane, recommended a 16 per cent quota for the Marathas and the BJP government brought in a proposal to grant it to them. However, as with other such political tactics in other states, its risks coming up against legal hurdles. A similar decision by the UPA government in Maharashtra was quashed by the court.As a response to the court setback, a committee was constituted under education minister Vinod Tawde to gather evidence of the social backwardness of the community. However, there was a new twist to the issue when talk began of constituting a backward class commission that would review the committee's findings. Not much has been done on that issue in the past few months, though the government has given some educational sops to students of the community. However, the leadership of the community is not quite satisfied with such measures.On the strength of the Mumbai march, the agitation looks poised to increase in intensity and political heft. This likely to test the political acumen of Fadnavis, a Brahmin, as he steers his party towards the next Assembly election in the state.Maratha demands1. Speedy prosecution and punishment of the culprits in the Kopardi rape and murder case.2. Reservation in education and government jobs.3.

Eleven of the 18 chief ministers to the state have been from this community.However, their representation in government jobs is 15 per cent, and 12 per cent in technical courses and higher education. About 73 per cent of the community falls in the middle-income group. Fifty per cent of land sellers and 67 per cent of borrowers in the state are Marathas.The Marathas dominate 16 of the 36 districts of Maharashtra.

SCARF, a city-based NGO, is organising a lecture on the link between diabetes and mental illness and the scope for integrated treatment todayCHENNAI: Mental illnesses can take a huge toll on the body and can in fact cause or increase the risk of developing other physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, diabetes etc. To create awareness about the relationship between physical and mental disorders, Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), an NGO in Chennai, is organising a series of lectures, and the first session will focus on the link between diabetes and mental illness. CE chats with Dr Shruti Sivaprakash, endocrinologist and Dr Padmavati, additional director, SCARF, to know more about how these illnesses are linked, whether they can be prevented and/or treated, and the need for an integrated treatment system of both conditions.Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of mental health disorders  including depression and psychotic disorders  than the general population. Likewise, patients with mental health disorders are at higher risk of developing diabetes, due to the medications and lack of physical exercise. However, patients with such co-morbidity are frequently misdiagnosed and undertreated, increasing the risk of long-term complications from either type of disorder. The incidence of Type II diabetes is alarmingly high in India. According to statistics, two out of five people do not know they have diabetes, because they have not checked it, Dr Shruti Sivaprakash explains, adding that the rising numbers is mainly due to the changing lifestyle.There are mental-health implications to people with diabetes, especially on the early onset. Diabetes patients are prone to depression, dementia or cognitive decline, which leads to memory impairment and the inability to perform daily activities. Sometimes, especially among the elderly population, you cant differentiate between memory impairment and depression. Thats why we need a good psychiatrist to assess the symptoms early on  to see the impact of diabetes on the mentally ill, she points out.For many patients, its a shock when they are diagnosed with diabetes, and many go into denial. A lot of women become depressed just by hearing theyre diabetic. That makes it worse because they dont put in the much-needed efforts to exercise and eat right. They also become tired often and dont sleep well.All this indirectly affects their sugar levels and makes it worse, rues Dr Shruti.Thats why its crucial to make people aware of the link between diabetes and mental illness. As physicians, we need to do a thorough evaluation of the patients to understand how theyre feeling mentally. We need to pick up on subtle signs of depression, especially among diabetics, she says, and advises patients to seek timely help if theyre not feeling motivated. Only when we treat depression, diabetes will begin to improve. Even if we put them on multiple medications and insulin, it will not improve their sugar levels. she explains.Likewise, people with mental illness are prone to developing diabetes, and other chronic cardio-vascular diseases. The milder mental illnesses, like anxiety and depression, can impact lifestyle; some people will eat a lot, and others will not exercise. These people might develop impaired glucose tolerance, or even diabetes, says Dr Padmavati. The reasons why diabetes occurs in people with severe mental illnesses, like schizophrenia, mood disorders, bipolar disorders, are not clear. Compared to the general population, people with mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, will have less physical exercise and high basic metabolism  and are more likely to develop diabetes.Psychiatric medications can also precipitate diabetes in people who already have increased risk of diabetes. The psycho-pharmacological agents might cause diabetes or glucose intolerance by various mechanisms  there is potential to increase the adipose tissue (fat tissue) in the body, which can contribute to impaired glucose metabolism, she explains. There is an increased mortality rate among persons with serious mental illness, which is primarily attributed to physical diseases like diabetes or cardiovascular illnesses. This is a huge problem.We need to start addressing these problems in the initial treatments of schizophrenia or mood disorders, and depressive disorders. We should start encouraging people to do more exercise and maintain good diet, she advises.Dr Padmavati has been doing surveys among people with serious mental illness in South India, and one of the things she found is that there is no coordinated treatment of diabetes and psychiatric problems. As a psychiatrist, we should switch diabetics to medications that do not raise blood sugar levels. This kind of integrated management is crucial, which is why the lecture series is important, she says.The talk on Body and Mind in Diabetes  What we need to know' will be held today at SCARF Resource and Training centre, Greams Road, from 4 pm onwards.For details, call: 26153971"

The seven-twelve land title documents of these farmers do not have mention of these loans, so they will be eligible for fresh loans from banks,"" the minister said.Seven-twelve or ""saat-bara"" extract is a document maintained by the Revenue Department for agricultural land which contains information such as survey number and owner's name.

We don't know how we will die,"" she sighed. ""God protect us. May Raqa be liberated so that we can return to our homes in peace.""Displaced 'back and forth'As Anud gestured, her 11-year-old son Ahmed listened in silence.Ahmed stopped speaking after the trauma of seeing his home destroyed, his father wounded, and his neighbours displaced in fierce bombardment of his district.Outside, a pair of scrawny young boys pushed a wheelbarrow full of jerry cans to a nearby canal to draw some water.Much of Al-Sabahiya has been destroyed by fighting, and civilians desperately rummage through the rubble looking for salvageable items.It is Abu Ghanem's native neighbourhood, but the fighting in Raqa has displaced his family several times.""Back and forth, back and forth, sometimes we can go back to our houses, sometimes we go and sit in the open,"" the man in his sixties said.He said his family can't afford to leave the city and rent a home elsewhere.""Sometimes there's no bread, sometimes there's no flour, sometimes there's nothing to eat,"" he said.He sat cross-legged on a blue wicker mat inside his simple home, dragging on a cigarette as relatives lit a small camping stove to begin cooking.Air strikes and bombardment still regularly shake the walls of his house, whose glass windows had long since shattered.""In the middle of the night, the children wake up and ask for bread because they are hungry,"" Abu Ghanem said.""We're living on the front line in the middle of fear and terror.""His wife, Umm Ghanem, would rather leave the area.""Should we stay here to die?"" she asked angrily of her husband. ""We don't know when a mine could explode. We're holding our lives in our hands.""'Fed up with death and fear'When Fatima Ahmed's family fled their home in the western Al-Romaniya district, they initially headed to a camp for the displaced, like thousands of other civilians from Raqa.But she said it was impossible to survive at the camp without money to buy basic necessities, so they headed back to Al-Sabahiya.""We're staying here, what can we do? We don't have the money to leave,"" she said, dressed in a black robe.Conditions in the camps for the displaced scattered across Raqa province are harsh, according to UN agencies and the International Committee of the Red Cross.Food and clean water are difficult to access, displaced families struggle in the blistering heat, and even the most basic medicine is often unavailable.That leaves Raqa natives like Fatima torn between being unable to afford life in the camp and trying to keep their families safe.""There are a lot of mines here... We spend all day standing over the children like guards to make sure they don't get hurt,"" she said.""We don't have anything -- no water, no electricity. We take water from an irrigation canal nearby and it's dirty.""The home they are squatting in is near a position held by an SDF unit, which sometimes provides them with bread, sugar, and other food to survive.Al-Sabahiya lies adjacent to their home district of Al-Romaniya, but in battle-torn Raqa, it feels worlds away.""We hope that the situation and the danger will end and we can go back to our homes because we're fed up with death and fear,"" she said."
5a0f14449855b76bf13d5d97,Monsoon’s last spell is farmers’ best hope,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2017/aug/14/monsoons-last-spell-is-farmers-best-hope-1642967.html,2017-08-14,"BENGALURU: With just weeks to go for the Kharif sowing season to end, which is normally by August-end, farmers across the state are pinning their hopes on the last spurt of good monsoon rain. After the initial expectations of a normal rainfall season were dashed, the Department of Agriculture is now busy preparing to deliver on its contingency plan to supply alternate short-term crop seeds to farmers. The season has so far been dismaying.The state has recorded rainfall deficit of about 27 per cent, registering only 404 mm of rainfall as against the average of 551 mm from June 1 to August 10. Of this, only 358 mm of rainfall was recorded from June 1 to July 31, marking a deficit. South-Interior Karnataka has been one of the worst hit areas with a (-)44 per cent departure from the average rainfall.Agriculture Department Director G Y Srinivas pointed out that only 63 per cent of sowing had completed so far with 46.35 lakh hectares (ha) being cultivated against the target of 73 lakh ha. Of this, only 8.53 lakh ha is irrigated while the remaining 37.82 lakh ha is dependent on rainfall.So far, districts like Mysuru and Chamarajanagar have registered only 57 per cent and 43 per cent sowing, respectively. In districts like Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Raichur and Bagalkot, farmers who had sown earlier in June and early July are looking at stunted plants of cereals and pulses in their fields. This will lead to lower yield and also lower prices as such cereals and pulses tend to be of inferior quality.In districts like Chitradurga, farmers have completely removed the millet plants as they were badly damaged due to lack of rain. It has affected pulses more and cereals like maize and bajra are next on the list, Srinivas explained.He also said that the Cauvery basin has been one of the worst affected as the dams storing Cauvery waters have seen the lowest storage in 46 years. As we are looking at conserving water till next May and fulfilling water drinking requirements of people and cattle, we are requesting farmers not to go for water-intensive crops like sugarcane and paddy and instead opt for dry crops like ragi, jowar and maize which require less water, he added.Each year, the department prepares a contingency plan for short-term alternate crops at the district and taluk levels of the Kharif sowing fails to take off. This year, coupled with news of good rain till the end of August, the Department is preparing to supply 1.94 lakh quintals of seeds for this purpose. About 60 per cent of the average rainfall in the state is witnessed before August 15 and but it has fallen woefully short yet again.Also Read: More rainfall expected across Karnataka this weekDirector of Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) Srinivas Reddy said rains are likely to be good until the end of August. Predictions for rain are good for the entire state and hopefully, this will cover sowing gaps. There are some areas where sowing has not been taken up at all. I can say that as far as agricultural purpose is concerned, it is good news for us. But, as far as the inflow into dams is concerned, we are not sure if it is sufficient to make up for the shortfall. We will have to see about that, he said.He has good reason to be wary. For instance, the catchment areas in Cauvery basin received only 56 per cent of rain till last week and has only picked up since. Just a week of good rain and with a little bit of inflow, the government has decided to release Cauvery waters from the four reservoirs purely for drinking water purposes.Women watering the saplings at a field in Hubballi-Dharwad district | D HemanthHUBBALLIOnly 50 pc land cultivatedKumar Mulkipatil, who had cultivated green gram, groundnut and cotton on his 20 acre farm land in Annigeri Hobli has lost all the crop due to scanty rainfall. He had spent about `1.5 lakh on cultivation and his five-member family is now in deep financial crisis.For the last three years, I have been suffering crop loss. Every year I slip into financial trouble. Agriculture is not at all profitable now. I may have to sell some of the land to save my family, says Mulkipatil.With the monsoon season in its last legs, the situation is turning grim for farmers in Hubballi-Dharwad district which has recorded 60 per cent deficit rainfall (June 1 to August 10). The district has received only 67.4 mm of rainfall as against normal of 134.3 mm rainfall for this period. The district has recorded only 58.1 mm rain against a normal of 113.6 mm, a deficit of 49 per cent.As a result, sowing activities have came to halt and only 50 per cent of the cultivable land has been covered under kharif sowing so far. Of the targeted 2.31 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in 1.24 lakh hectares as of August 10. Last year, at end of June, sowing was completed in 1.78 lakh hectares while the rain deficit was just 20 per cent.This year, maize has been cultivated in 18,000 hectare against a targeted area of 34,621 hectares. Green gram, another major crop, was sown in 8,000 hectares of the targeted 43,284 hectares while groundnut was sown in only 3,145 hectares against a target of 32,215 hectares. Hybrid cotton has been cultivated in 6,608 hectares against a target of 49,217 hectares. Agriculture Department Joint Director Rudreshappa T S said the kharif season has failed completely in Navalgund and Kundagol taluk completely. However, farming activity is good in Kalaghtagi taluk, Alnavar in Dharwad and Chabbi Hobli in Hubballi taluk, he added.SHIVAMOGGAFarmers worried about another drought yearDespite having four reservoirs -- Tunga, Bhadra, Anjanapura and Ambligola -- the district is staring at a drought for the third successive year. Deficit rainfall has led to low water levels of in all the reservoirs.Lakes and tanks which feed agricultural fields in Shikaripura and Sorab taluks are not yet full and farmers are pinning their hopes on good rain in the remainder of the monsoon season.The district has recorded a deficit of 31 per cent rainfall as on August 1, having received 1,000 mm of rainfall against the normal of 1,444 mm.Of the targeted 1,69,000 hectares, cultivation has been taken up in about 1,09,000 hectares. This includes 45,000 hectares of paddy and 6,0000 hectares of maize. Paddy cultivation has come down from 1,07,000 hectares to 45,000 hectare while maize cultivation has increased from 54,000 hectares to 60,000 hectares.J Madhusudhan, Joint Director of agriculture, said farmers still waiting for good rains to sow paddy over the next fifteen days. If there are no good rains by the end of August, then the farmers have to go in for alternative crops like ragi, green gram and black gram which require less water, he said.We will suggest to farmers not to go for paddy or maize cultivation after August. They can think of sorghum (white Bijapur jowar), sunflower and horse gram. Even millets like Sava, Navane too will fetch them decent returns, he said.UDUPIRain deficit, but paddy sowing close to targetThe district has witnessed 16.72 per cent rainfall in the current monsoon season as of July 31 this year. It received 2005 mm rain in the period between June and July, against the normal rainfall of 2,408 mm rain. Despite this, sowing of paddy does not seem to have been affected much.Against a target of 44,000 hectares for this kharif season, paddy seeds were sown in 42,400 hectares as of August 11, according to Chandrashekar, Deputy Director, Agriculture Department. As of July 12, paddy seeds were sown in 23,000 hectares. Later, sowing activity picked up pace and 42,400 hectares are now under paddy cultivation, he said.Farmers engaged in sowing paddy in Kodagu districtKODAGUDelayed start to sowing activityWith deficient rain in the early days of the monsoon season in the prime catchment area of river Cauvery, farming activity had been slow across the district. It picked up pace only in the last few weeks with good rains. As on August 12, the district recorded an average of 1,345.25 mm of rainfall while it was 1,344.11 mm last year in the corresponding period.In 2015, paddy sowing had been completed by the second week of August, while last year, 55 per cent had been completed. This year, sowing has been completed in less than half of the targeted cultivation area.Though coffee is a major crop in the district, paddy is also cultivated. The Agriculture Department has set a target of 30,500 hectares for paddy cultivation against last years 28,090 hectares. As of August 12, only 12,733 hectares of paddy sowing was completed in district .With many farmers turning away from paddy cultivation due to increased cost and less market price, the Agriculture Department had announced a subsidy for mechanised sowing.Farmer Yallalinga of Kere Bhosaga hopes the skies will open up soon and save the standing cropKALABURAGI70 per cent of crop already damagedThe good monsoon rains in June, when the monsoon set in, brought cheer to farmers in Kalaburagi district. But their hopes have been dashed with the no rains over the last one-and-half months. Sitting in his fields and looking skyward hoping for rains, Yallalinga, a farmer from Kere Bhosga village says,  We have been unlucky. Already, the green gram and black gram crops have been damaged completely. If it does not rains in the next 4-5 days, the tur crop will also be damaged.Crops like green gram, black gram, sesame, soya and hyacinth beans have also been seriously affected due to the dry spell. Karabasappa of Kallur village in Jewargi taluk said that with high hopes he cultivated green gram, black gram, red gram and sugarcane. But he now fears he may face heavy crop loss.According to Agriculture Department officials, 93 per cent of kharif cultivation has been completed in Kalaburagi district Farmers have cultivated green gram in 49,000 hectars, black gram in 39,000 hectars, soya beans in five hectares and sesame in 10,000 hectors. Sources say 70 per cent of the cultivated crop has been damaged badly. The executive committee of the Zilla Krashik Samaj , of which the Joint Director of Agriculture Department is also a member, reviewed the situation at a meeting on Thursday and sent a proposal to the government to compensate farmers who have suffered losses due to dry spell.Less rain hasnt hit areca plantations |Rajesh Shetty BallalbaghD-K DISTRICT24 pc rain deficit, but all seems okay hereTraditionally a paddy-growing district, Dakshina Kannada has a total of 38,000 hectares under paddy cultivation. But with monsoon showers being scarce, this year, only 28,000 hectares have been cultivated under the kharif season.This will cut down our kharif window by at least 25 days as most of the low-lying fields have to get their initial showers by first week of June followed by regular monsoon showers from the last week or latest by first week of July. This is the ideal monsoon behaviour for a good kharif crop, says Subramanya Shastry, a Krishi Pandit awardee and farmer from Buntwal taluk. But this time we have 20 per cent lesser rainfall, he pointed outJoint Director of Agriculture Kempe Gowda said, We did have a fair extent of pre-monsoon showers since April. It is wrong to assume that the extent, intensity and duration of the monsoon showers are an indicator of the quality and yield of khariff crop. In paddy-growing areas, if we get showers even in June, it is sufficient.Districts where sowing has been affected due to poor rainfallBengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Davangere, Ballari, Dharwad, Gadag and Yadgir.Dists where plants have suffered stunted growth due lack of moistureMysuru, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Mandya, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Tumakaru, Dharwad, Gadag, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Raichur, Koppal, Ballari, Yadgir, Ramanagara and Bengaluru Rural.Status of minor irrigation tanksOut of total 3,602 minor irrigation tanks in the state, only 2 per cent of them had storage capacity of more than 50 per cent, 39 per cent of the tanks had storage capacity between 30 per cent and 50 per cent and the remaining 58 per cent of the tanks are dry.(With inputs from Prakash Samaga in Udupi, Ramachandra V Gunari in Shivamogga, B Kishan Singh in Hubballi, Coovercolly Indresh in Madikeri & M Raghuram in Mangaluru)"

They found that M sylvestris has contributed so extensively to the apple's genome that the modern apple is actually more similar to the sour crabapple than to its Kazakhstan ancestor, M sieversii.""For the ancestral species, Malus sieversii, the fruits are generally much larger than other wild apples. They are also soft and have a very plain flavor that people do not like much,"" said Yang Bai from BTI.The hybridisation between ancient cultivated apples and M sylvestris, followed by extensive human selection, gave us new apples that are larger and fuller in flavor, and with a crispy firmness that gives them a longer shelf life, researchers said.""The modern domesticated apples have higher and well-balanced sugar and organic acid contents. That is how the apple started to become a popular and favoured fruit,"" Bai said.The study was published in the journal Nature Communications."

In the last few years, I have taken the brand to a national level, overseeing the opening of restaurants in cities such as Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata.Its been a tremendous learning with conceptualising, planning menus, training manpower and keeping the consistency throughout. I won the Global Grill in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and for Sigree in 2010, 2011. And was named among top 60 chefs in 60 years from IHM Mumbai. I passed out in 2003 from the college IHM Dadar catering and joined The Park group of hotels as a Kitchen management trainee and thats where I honed the skills of making kebab and curry.My hobbies have only been related to food. I enjoy cooking and I usually spend my spare time testing recipes and archives to understand the history of the food industry.I found two unique ingredients in Japanese cuisine  Japanese horseradish and Mirin. Japanese horseradish, also known as wasabi, is an Asian root that is ground or grated to produce a pungent, strongly flavoured condiment. Although, it is different from a horseradish plant, its often used in raw fish such as sushi or sashimi and to serve with various varieties of cooked fish, noodles and salads. It is also used to make dips and marinades. Its very rare to find wasabi plant outside Japan.Mirin, on the other hand, is a Japanese rice wine, but with a low alcohol content and high sugar content. Its used in desserts, dips and poaching of various meats.- Harman Singh Sawhney, Head chef, Hoppipola"

In some dishes, it was difficult to guess the ingredients even after tasting it. Anokhi Kheer, an old Hyderabadi dessert is one delight. Traditionally kheer has rice or some other similar ingredient in it. The word anokhi means unique, and the uniqueness of this particular kheer lies in the fact that it uses onions instead of the usual rice as the main ingredient with milk. However, the dessert does not even have even a little bit of sharpness of taste which we normally associate with onions.The story of Anokhi Kheer dates back a few centuries. Unlike some other Nizami dishes, this used to be a dessert of the masses. Onion was an economical ingredient, and it is said that middle class and poor citizens who could not afford good quality rice substituted it with onions in their dessert. Anokhi Kheer was a typical summer food, it was served chilled to keep the body cool.Anokhi Kheer is prepared the same way as you prepare any other kheer, but the main trick is to prevent the pungency of onion from overwhelming the taste. Large white onions are used here, and sliced onions are boiled in water multiple times till the same get blanched, bringing out the sweetness. Like other kheer recipes, it is then added to reduced milk, sugar and khoya. Powdered cardamom seeds almonds, cashews and pistachios are used to add further taste to the dish.Unfortunately, this unique dish is not commonly available now. Jewel of Nizam is perhaps the only restaurant which serves Anokhi Kheer as one of their signature dishes. However, a few wedding caterers and home chefs like home chef Ahaana Khan have kept this dish alive. According to Ahaana, Choice of the right onions and patience in removing the pungency are key to the taste of this delicate dish.She laments that now very few people know about this dish, and one of the reasons of this dish going off popularity charts might be that the prices of onions have gone up many times compared to rice in the last few decades. She also mentions about another similar dish in Hyderabadi cuisine known as Lehsooni Kheer, where large garlic pods replace onions in the preparation. She fervently hopes that these delectable dishes regain their popularity in the times to come."

Keep a tab on your diet,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/aug/13/wary-of-pcos-keep-a-tab-on-your-diet-1642796.html,2017-08-13,"KOCHI:You will be shocked to know that at any given time, 20- 40% of teenage girls are plagued by a condition that many have never even heard of- Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). This disease usually leads to irregular periods, acne, excessive hair growth and also leads to being overweight. PCOS is nothing but altered state of psychology and abnormal hormone levels. The three main complications in PCOS are Insulin Resistance, Anovulation (absence of ovulation) and Hyperandrogenia (high levels of testosterone).The high intake of sugar in the form of carbohydrate, sweets, carbonated drinks etc leads to high level of Insulin in blood, which in turn causes increase in resistance towards insulin. Thus diet becomes an important catalyst in contributing to this disease. High fat intake also causes and aggravates insulin resistance, so a calorific western style diet (like unhealthy fast foods) is a typical example of the kind of diet that should be avoided in children to prevent PCOS. Insulin resistance typically causes symptoms like tiredness, lethargy, darkening of skin flexures (behind the neck) and increased occurrence of diabetes even in young adults.Another symptom in PCOS is the presence of high levels of androgen (male hormone) compared to the normal girls. This can lead to a myriad of psychological symptoms like irritability, aggressiveness, mood variations, anxiety, depression, social isolation, and poor body image. Physical symptoms may include acne and excessive hair growth, but these symptoms may be absent in some girls. These indications can be controlled by routine exercise and a low calorie diet in most of the cases.Unfortunately, these girls are repeatedly condemned to silently suffer from these symptoms, as the teachers and parents quite often misinterpret their behaviour without attributing the cause to PCOS. As the girls have the tendency to put on weight and are likely to have extra facial hair, they are further ridiculed by peers. It is common to find suicide notes by teenagers on the sites of counselors requesting for help, as they find no solace from friends and parents. Counseling of parents and girls greatly helps in the recognition and management of what is essentially a treatable problem, so that they grow up to become confident and healthy individuals.In addition to the problems discussed earlier, PCOS also leads to long-term complications such as sub fertility and pregnancy related problems. They are also at a high risk of developing diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and allergic disorders as the body produces inflammatory markers.Many of my patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful multiple IVF treatments at other infertility centres have conceived naturally under my treatment just by controlling PCOS. This prompted me to explore this subject deeply by comprehensive reading and understanding the problem by attending numerous international conferences and lectures on PCOS.  I have been lucky to meet and gather medical information from prominent doctors and researchers on PCOS,  says Anita. Infertility treatment is quite expensive, making it beyond the reach of many couples and the medicines have side effects if used repeatedly. The long term implications of PCOS is frightful and the sheer volume of girls affected with PCOS is appalling. Hence, I have opened a specialized PCOS wing at GIFT IVF Centre, Kochi for controlling and prevention of this disease, so that many of the affected women can achieve their dream of having a baby and for building a generation of women who are equipped to deal with this menace.As a major step towards addressing this concern and for the benefit of our doctors and patients, we are conducting an International Medical Conference on PCOS at Gift IVF centre, Athani( Kochi) on February 18, 2018 in collaboration with PCOS Challenge Group USA, where distinguished and prominent International experts on the topic of PCOS will partake and share their invaluable knowledge . This symposium is going to be first of its kind in that PCOS patients and their parents are going to be a part of the conference wherein they can directly interact and clear the doubts with the eminent doctors and related medical faculty learning about the latest methods of treatment.Anita Mani,infertility specialist"

Farmers patrolling their sugarcane field in Kolwadi found the cub clinging on to a pump at the bottom of the well around 5pm.We heard loud cries and rushed to see what was in the well. It was leopard cub. The only thing that prevented the animal from drowning was the pump. We immediately informed the forest department, said Satish Bhoir, farmer from the area.Upon receiving information, a five-member team from Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) in Junnar, rushed to the spot. Veterinarians from MLRC said 2,000 people had gathered at the spot, which made the rescue difficult.Since the cub was in distress, we deployed a specially designed trap cage to rescue it. We generally use crates for cub rescues, said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinarian, MLRC, in-charge of the operation. After the forest department was able to control the crowd, we managed to completed the rescue.Deshmukh who examined the cub said it was fit to be released back in to the wild.Forest officials said that the cubs mother was spotted in the vicinity. An hour after the rescue, we decided to release the cub. We have told farmers to inform us about the reunion, if the witness it, said Sachin Ragatwan, range forest officer, Ottur.Experts said there was a need to educate local residents about the significance of the species. As human habitations expand in to wilderness, leopards will be forced out of their territory and will fall in to these dangerous wells. We need a more sustainable solution, said Kartick Satyanarayan, chairman, Wildlife SOS."

Kids today will never know the fun of fighting for the remote with siblings, over which cartoon channel to watch first. The best thing about these cartoons, it wasnt just fun to watch, but we learnt an incredible lot from these tiny characters. From rooting for Jerry to win Tom and his bully cat pals, to thinking perhaps Tom was the better of the lot, we have all grown up - or have we? Join us as we take a fun trip down the nostalgia lane, as we list ten cartoons we miss watching the most, from the stone-age Flintstones to butt-kicking Powerpuff girls, plus some interesting behind-the-scenes trivia.Dexters LaboratoryWhat this orange-haired munchkin of a boy does in his secret laboratory all day, well never know, but boy was it fun to watch him do scientific experiments to create red buttons while DeeDee ran amok destroying everything in sight! Interspersed with Mom and Dad-focussed episodes, and lets not forget nemesis Mandark, Dexters laboratory was great fun to watch! Yet how a young lad managed to keep a cavernous lab hidden behind a book-shelf a secret from his parents for so long is a mystery in itself.What we learnt: Never underestimate your sister. And also, Science is amazing!BTS trivia: Dexter was voiced by women! Yes, voice actress Christine Cavanaugh, even won an Annie Award for her performance. When she retired she was replaced by Candi Milo, another voice actress.Looney TunesThe Looney Tunes had something for everyone. It had so many characters you simply could NOT have a good time watching them. Bugs Bunny getting away from his hunters with witty banter, dumb cat Sylvester trying to eat up cute bird Tweety, Porky pig just being plain goofy - for some special reason most of us continue to love these comedy shorts even as adults. Each cartoon ends with a character going, Thats all Folks!What we learnt: Quick-thinking and witty banter can always save you from being killed by your enemies.BTS trivia: Almost all the characters were voiced by Mel Blanc - Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Bird, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Marvin the Martian, Wile E. Coyote, Road Runner etc. He was called the The Man of a Thousand VoicesThe Powerpuff GirlsAdmit it, at least once you and your pals have named yourself Buttercup, Blossom or Bubbles, tying towels on you backs and runs around the house fighting Evil. These bad-ass kindergarteners always knew how to save the city of Townsville from a host of other regular villains. Boy, arent we glad the Professor Utonium accidentally added chemical X while making the girls! Some sugar spice and everything nice, indeed!What we learnt: Every villain has a story behind why he became so. Remember Mojo-jojos story?BTS trivia: Mojo Jojo created evil male counterparts of the Powerpuff Girls called the Rowdyruff Boys. They were made of snips, snails and puppy dogs tails (just like in the nursery rhyme What are Little Boys Made Of?Samurai JackMore than anything else, the opening credits voiceover is what stays in the mind  Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting Master of Darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish Samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me.. The series follows Jack, sent through time to a dystopian future ruled by Aku, and his quests to travel back in time and defeat Aku before he can take over the world. Great action scenes and in-depth landscapes set this series apart from the others.Looney TunesWhat we learnt: In the face of Evil, you can do anything to live BTS trivia: Samurai Jack was inspired by the Frank Miller comic book Ronin, which is also about a samurai who is thrown into the future and must battle a shape-shifting demon. Aku even has the same face-tentacles as the main villain from Ronin.Tom & JerryNo description needed, this was hands down the single most loved cartoon ever, enjoyed by kids and parents alike. Enough said.What we learnt: Karma is real, Tom, it is real.BTS trivia: Tom & Jerry was created by animations most successful ever partnership  William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The duo later formed the studio that gave us The Flintstones, Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear, Top Cat, The Smurfs and countless other icons.Scooby DooScooby-Doo was the first proper cartoon detective show we watched. It was brilliant spending afternoons solving mysteries with the talking Great Dane along with Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy AKA those meddling kids, thwarting the plans of criminal masterminds. Amped up toward the final reveal  and the shocking revelation of the bad guy (cue: gasp!) will be someone who we already knew! Though movies came out, none could match the colourful What we learnt: The only real monsters are those that exist inside people. Remove their mask, and youll know them.BTS trivia: Velmas classic line My glasses... I cant see without them! was actually first said by Velmas voice actor Nicole Jaffe at the first table read. She dropped her glasses and said the line. The writers thought her reaction was cute and threw it into the show.The FlintstonesYabba dabba doo!! The Flintstones is every bit fantastic with a innovative premise  placing typical 20th century societal culture to pre-history! The Flintstones and the Rubbles lived in the Stone Age, doing things that we do today, but with the help of animal-powered technology! Pet dinosaurs, a woolly baby elephant as a vacuum cleaner, actual rock for rock music and the coolest vehicles and caves, need we say more! A favourite is the bird carving on stone instant cameras.What we learnt: Animals can do great things  and necessity is truly the mother of invention.BTS trivia: Barbera, the maker of the show, spent eight weeks pitching the sitcom to potential sponsors and networks. Finally, on his last day in the city, he presented the show to ABC, who took a chance.The Addams FamilyA show about a family that consisted of gargoyles, Frankenstein like butlers, crazy scientists. The Addamses are a satirical inversion of the ideal American family; an eccentric, wealthy clan who delight in the macabre and are unaware, or do not care, that other people find them bizarre or frightening. As crazy as the premise sounds, the show made for some extremely fun times and morbid times.What we learnt: Being different isnt so bad.BTS trivia: Though morbid and peculiar, the Addams family was considered a model family by critics of that time  a psychologist was quoted saying There wasnt any bickering. There wasnt the making a fool of the father or the mother. There werent sides drawn between the children and the parents. There was all love, and they still managed to be funny."

The road is riddled with pits making it a commuters nightmare.VB spokesperson said on basis of complaints, bureau chief director BK Uppal along with public works department (PWD) and Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) engineers and experts of the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) excavated the 200 feet road at two points.He said it has been found prima facie that the road was not designed properly taking into consideration the actual soil (clay) and traffic conditions (heavy vehicles) at the site and the material used was not as per the prescribed specifications in the contract.Killer Chandigarh Airport Road continues to be commuters nightmareUppal said GMADA had already received a sampling report from the CRRI. The CRRI experts have been asked to collect some more samples from the locations selected by the technical teams of VB, PWD and GMADA and submit a report after a thorough analysis so that the exact findings could be reviewed by the bureau.The vigilance chief said further action will be taken against the guilty engineers and contractor on the basis of the CRRI reports. After digging the road for fresh samples, senior engineers present on the spot also confirmed that irregularities were committed during its construction, due to which the road got damaged in a short span.Sources said the 28-point report submitted by the CRRI to GMADA officials a few days ago lacked remedial measures and did not include the recommendations made by the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research (NITTER). Not satisfied with the sugar-coated report, GMADA has asked the institute to send another report within a week.Given the importance of the case, the report lacked depth and samples taken by the authorities were from a select few places, said a senior GMADA official. The report had mentioned that pebbles found at the riverside were used to make the road against the rules."

But liquor manufacturers, who incur the additional cost, and excise officials who determine MRP for CL-2 (retail) licence holders, term it illegal. ""As such, liquor sold at retail outlets and elsewhere is not in the ambit of GST and the new taxation system is not linked to the pricing of liquor. The MRP of liquor is subject to excise rules and it has not been changed,"" said Rajendra Prasad, joint commissioner of excise. ""Traders must sell the drink at the price they used to before July 1. Selling liquor at a price other than MRP is illegal.""""Input goods like packaging materials attract GST, but it should not be reflected on the output tax of liquor sold in the market. The manufacturer has to absorb the tax on the raw material and hence the MRP should not be changed even in the GST regime,"" said Rakshit Neelakanta Jagadale, excutive director of Amrut Global Luxury Malt and Spirits, a division of Amrut Distilleris Ltd.One key input, ENL (extra neutral alcohol), used to make Indian-made liquor, does not attract tax. ENL is fermented from molasses, which draws 28% GST, but it is exempt from tax if it is used for captive production of ENL by sugar factories. Captive production, said one manufacturer, accounts for about 98% of the ENL produced in the state and hence does not attract any tax.""Most of the distillers buy ENL from sugar factories directly to avail tax-free benefit.Only a few distilleries may buy from others in which case they have to pay tax, but it has be absorbed by them,"" said Shivalingaiah, secretary-general of Karnataka Brewers and Distillers Association.However, packaging materials, including bottles, caps, labels and boxes attract 18% GST.The materials were taxed at 14.5 % in the previous value-added tax (VAT) regime. ""But since the increased tax burden is to be absorbed by the manufacturers, no way can the traders charge more than the MRP of liquor,"" said Shivalingaiah.Notwithstanding this, from Saturday, several MRP-liquor stores have increased bottle prices by at least 15%. Beer was costlier by 38%. Harsha Jayaram, who had flown down from Mumbai for a family gettogether, said, ""I had accompanied my cousin to this MRP store that we have been buying from. We had picked up beer on Wednesday and it was Rs 120. Today , it is Rs 165.""The price of one bottle of Black Dog Reserve (scotch), which was Rs 1,730.85 until Friday , is now Rs 1,960 -a hike of 13%. ""When I enquired, I was told that it was because of GST.A bottle of Black Dog Triple Gold, which was for Rs 2,870 when I purchased it last, was being sold at Rs 3.070 (6% more),"" said G Ritchie, employee of an an IT firm.When TOI enquired at MRP shops -in Sanjaynagar (New BEL Road), J P Nagar and Indiranagar -cashiers said the price rise was due to GST. When told that liquor did not attract GST, a cashier from the Sanjaynagar store said, ""Our distributor told us the input cost has gone up. We have nothing to do with this.""Industry representatives demanded that the government take action against those violating MRP . ""Some of the retailers are cheating in the name of GST. Both excise and legal metrology departments should take note of it and punish them,"" said Shivalingaiah."

He was 75.He died Sunday from cancer complications, the World Boxing Council said.Ramos was best known for his 1963 fight at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles with Davey Moore in which he won the featherweight title for the first time. It was the only fight card held at the ballpark, and it was deadly.Ramos had been battered by the champion in early rounds but came back to stop him in the 10th. Moore left the ring on his own but lost consciousness in his dressing room and slipped into a coma.He died two days later, sparking an outcry about the safety of boxing and prompting California Gov. Edmund Brown to call for the sport to be banned. Dylan would later memorialize the bout in the song ""Who Killed Davey Moore?""Ramos was no stranger to tragedy in the ring. Five year earlier in Cuba he stopped a fighter named Jose Blanco, who also died.Ramos, whose real name was Ultiminio Ramos, lived in Mexico after fleeing Cuba. He was the first champion of the WBC, winning the organization's new belt in his fight with Moore.""We will always remember Ultiminio as a great champion, but even more so, as a wonderful, friendly, genuine and kind man,"" WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said.Ramos, who started boxing professionally at age 15, retired in 1972 with a record of 55-7-4 with 40 knockouts.A power puncher despite standing only 5-foot-4, Ramos drew large crowds to his fights, largely because he never backed up. He fought in an era of 15-round battles and six-ounce gloves, and he fought whoever was put in front of him.Doctors who looked at tapes of the Moore fight didn't blame his punches for the boxer's death, though. The ring at Dodger Stadium had only three ropes and they weren't padded. Moore's head snapped on the bottom one as he fell in the 10th round and his brain swelled.""It was a time when there was one champion in every division, if you can imagine that,"" said boxing publicist Bill Caplan, who was at the fight. ""Davey Moore was the guy and he was a heck of a fighter. It turned out that so was Sugar Ramos.""Caplan also saw Ramos fight Mando Ramos at the iconic Olympic Auditorium, where he drew capacity crowds. Sugar Ramos lost the fight by split decision, and was never the same fighter again.""One of the greatest fights I've ever seen, just a bloody war,"" Caplan said. ""He was a very, very popular high action fighter.""Ramos would defend the title that he won from Moore three times before losing it by knockout to Carlos Ortiz in 1966. He was knocked out in a rematch a year later, and never fought for a title again.But it was his fight with Moore for which Ramos would mostly be remembered. Ramos shrugged off suggestions he killed Moore in the ring, saying his injury was caused by the rope and complaining no one gave him credit for putting up a good fight against a top champion.Soon after the fight, another rope was added to boxing rings, and they were padded.Dylan, in his 1963 song, asked the question: Who was to blame for Moore's death? He sings at the outset: ""Who killed Davey Moore/Why an' what's the reason for?""""'Not I,' says the referee/'Don't point your finger at me.'""The lyrics continue:""'Not us,' says the angry crowd,/Whose screams filled the arena loud./'It's too bad he died that night/But we just like to see a fight."""

Floyd Sr. taught his son to box almost as soon as he could walk.Floyd Sr. was holding his infant son in his arms when he was shot in the leg during a family dispute, an injury that effectively ended his career.""He was training to be a fighter in the crib,"" Mayweather Sr. said of his son.Mayweather, who grew up in a cramped apartment with seven relatives, frames his early life as a battle for survival.'Never been easy'""It's never been easy for me. Boxing is easy but life has never been easy,"" Mayweather says.""I had a father who was a hustler and a mother who was on drugs. I was the man in the house from 16. That's just the way it was.""When Mayweather fought at the 1996 Olympics, his father was serving a five-year prison sentence for drug-trafficking.In Floyd Sr's absence, his uncle Roger had taken over the training of the young fighter, overseeing his entry to the professional ranks.Within two years, the skilful, lightning-fast Mayweather had won his first world title, knocking out the WBC superfeatherweight champion Genaro Hernandez in eight rounds.Years of domination followed as Mayweather plowed through the divisions up to welterweight.In 2006, he took the unusual step of buying out his contract with promoter Bob Arum, in order to take greater control of his career.Since then Mayweather has been able to dictate terms for most of his fights, taking a cut of the back-end profit in exchange for upfront risk.It means that the dollars have continued to flow in ever-increasing numbers, from USD 25 million to fight Oscar De La Hoya in 2007 to around USD 220 million for his 2015 fight against Manny Pacquiao.But while the dollars have rolled in and the bank balances have swollen, Mayweather has struggled to build up a reserve of public goodwill.Multiple convictions for domestic violence point to the fighter's dark side, while in boxing terms he has faced accusations that he ducked his most dangerous opponents, such as Pacquiao, until they were past their peak.His cagey, cautious style inside the ring, while earning grudging approval from purists, has also frustrated fans hoping to see him take a more aggressive approach.Mayweather, who insists Saturday's bout with McGregor will be the last time he ever enters a ring, is unapologetic about the tactics that have guided his career, believing his is a template that many rivals would like to emulate.""When a person has been so dominant in his era, I think other fighters are going to pay attention,"" he told reporters recently.""The main fighters are going to pay attention because they want to be at my level and they want to do the same thing -- they want to dominate with ease."""

This would help ensure availability of drinking water, he noted. Mr. Siddaramaiah said the decision had to be taken in the wake of dire shortage of water due to a weak monsoon.Farmers are free to cultivate rain-fed crops, the Chief Minister said. It may be noted that sowing of paddy and sugarcane crops has not picked up in the Cauvery basin this year due to the non-release of water from reservoirs. The total storage in all the four Cauvery basin reservoirs is just 45 tmcft now as against 53.52 tmcft during the corresponding period in the previous year, he said, describing the situation as the worst in the last 46 years. Mr. Siddaramaiah was not committal when asked if the government would think of compensating farmers for not growing paddy and sugarcane. He said that cloud seeding would also be taken up from next week.Mandya District in-charge M. Krishnappa said the water release would start from midnight itself.However, both Mr. Krishnappa and Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil made it clear that details such as total tanks to be filled up and the total quantum of water to be released had not been finalised.Water will be released to fill up tanks to help increase groundwater level and to ensure availability of drinking waterSiddaramaiahChief Minister"

This is ridiculous at a time when the state is staring at third consecutive drought,"" said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Kar nataka State Sugarcane Growers' Association. Instead of targeting poor farmers, he said that the revenue department must issue notices to landowners who have bought huge parcels of agricultural land around major cities of Bengaluru, Mysuru, Hubballi-Dharwad and Belagavi , and have kept them unused to take up real estate activities.In a recent directive to officials, the revenue department said that village accountants should identify fallow lands in their jurisdictions and inform the revenue officer, who will in turn issue notice to the farmer or landowner concerned to take up farming or lease the land within a year from the date of notice. But the government has not specified what action they will face if they fail to do so.It is contrived that it may take a cue from the previous UP government which had imposed a penalty on defaulters even as the Centre's draft bill on contract farming, suggested by Niti Ayog, planned to give incentives to farmers who give their land to contractors.The move has irked the farmers of Kolar more than anyone else.
