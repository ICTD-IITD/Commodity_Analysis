Patil has regretted that expect Almatti, no other major reservoir in the State has reached the full level this year.The water level in four major dams, including KRS and Harangi, is poor. The total available water is only 43 tmcft while last year, these dams had 55 tmcft of water, he said. Addressing presspersons after hoisting the National Flag and participating in the Independence Day programme here on Tuesday, he said that this year too, the State was facing drought.He said that the dams have only 43 tmcft of water, with cities such as Mysuru and Bengaluru requiring 35 tmcft of water for drinking purposes. In such a grim situation, the government is forced to advise the farmers not to cultivate sugarcane and paddy crops which required huge quantum of water. We have been urging farmers to cultivate more short-term and rain-dependent crops this year as water should be saved for drinking purposes, he said.The Minister, however, made it clear that the government has made arrangements for cloud seeding with the hope that it will bring some relief.With regard to other irrigation projects in the State, mainly those coming under the Upper Krishna Project III, Mr. Patil said that a majority of the projects were being expedited to be completed in a time-bound manner.He said that infrastructure has been prepared to provide irrigation facility to around 15 lakh acres of land in Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts.We are making every effort to make use of 166 tmcft of water which we have received after the final award by Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal, the Minister said.Meanwhile, students from various schools expressed anger against the district administration for cancelling the cultural programmes scheduled for Independence Day at the district stadium.The district administration took the decision of cancelling the cultural programmes considering the huge stagnation of water in the stadium after the heavy rain on Monday night.Since there was very limited dry space on the ground, it was decided to cancel all the cultural events.Angry with the decision, the students marched towards the podium demanding that the authorities not cancel the event as they have spent a fortnight in practice sessions.But their demand was not met and the students returned disappointed."

The quiescence of hair follicle stem cells is regulated by many factors. In certain cases they fail to activate, which is what causes hair loss.Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that hair follicle stem cell metabolism is different from other cells of the skin.As hair follicle stem cells consume the nutrient glucose  a form of sugar  from the bloodstream, they process the glucose to eventually produce a metabolite called pyruvate. The cells then can either send pyruvate to their mitochondria  the part of the cell that creates energy  or can convert pyruvate into another metabolite called lactate.Experiment on miceThe research team first blocked the production of lactate genetically in mice and showed that this prevented hair follicle stem cell activation.Conversely, they increased lactate production genetically in the mice and this accelerated hair follicle stem cell activation, increasing the hair cycle."

Vazhimegam and P. Sangeeth Kumar who had been cultivating sugarcane at Neivayal in Thiruvadanai block, bordering Sivaganga district, for nearly 10 years, raised the seed farms of TKM 13, CO 51 and NLR 34449 varieties and the crops were ready for harvest.When they wanted to change the crop pattern, the agriculture department suggested that they could raise seed farms, utilising the ground water potential in their area and they came forward to help the department augment the seed stock.P. Raja, Personal Assistant to Collector (agriculture), who inspected the farms along with U. Ambathkumar and M. Packiaraj, Agriculture Officers, said the crops were in an advanced maturity stage and they could be harvested in a week.Mr. Vazhimegam has cultivated TKM 13, a fine variety, on an extent of 18 acres while P. Sangeeth Kumar, next to his field, raised CO 51 and NLR 34449 varieties on five acres each. Though the transplantation took place during the peak of summer in May, the paddy crops braved the searing heat and successfully crossed the crucial flowering stage. A single panicle has more than 200 grains and the yield could touch 2.5 tonnes per acre.We have raised the crops by following the guidelines of officials and we are happy to join the elite club of seed producers, the farmers told The Hindu during a field visit on recently.As the officials insisted on line planting, Vazhimegam brought workers from Tiruvarur district. Both the farmers faced no problem in irrigating the crops thanks to copious groundwater source, pumped through borewells.Collector S. Natarajan, who visited the farms recently, commended the farmers for taking the risk of raising the seed farms during summer and helping the department in distributing quality seeds.S. S.

In present times, the first batch of caparisoned elephants march a short distance after which they are transported to the city in trucks.Flagged off near Nagapura on the outskirts of the Nagarahole National Park, the elephants were the cynosure of all eyes as they left a large batch of tourists, brought to witness the occasion for the first time, mesmerised.The animals were accorded a traditional welcome complete with poorna kumbha amidst the chanting of hymns in the backdrop of the ensemble of musicians playing traditional tunes. Special prayers, including Ganesh ashtotthara, were conducted for the safety of the elephants and the collective welfare of society, while coconuts, jaggery and sugarcane were offered in plenty to the jumbos.Cultural programmes that included tribal and folk dances were presented. Elected representatives led by Public Works Minister H.C. Mahadevappa, who is also the Mysuru district in-charge, and officials from the district administration and Forest Department were among those present.The six elephants in the first batch include Arjuna, Balarama, Abhimanyu, Kaveri, Varalakshmi and Vijaya. Bhima and Gajendra are being transported from Mathigodu and K. Gudi camps, respectively. They will be joined by the second batch of seven other elephants in a few weeks time and will camp at the sprawling open space of the Mysuru Palace rehearsing for Dasara, which will be held from September 21 to 30 this year, adding to the festivities celebrated as Nada Habba (State festival) in Karnataka.All the eight elephants reached Aloka campus of the Forest Department on the outskirts of the city in the evening and will move into the palace on August 17 where they will be accorded a traditional reception.A recurring motif in Indian art and architecture, elephants  that symbolise wisdom and strength in Indian culture  are strongly entwined with Mysuru Dasara since time immemorial. The earliest extant paintings of a Dasara procession show them occupying a pivotal position carrying the king. In modern times, they have the honour of carrying the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari on the day of the Vijayadashmi procession.The Dasara official website www.mysoredasara.gov.in was also launched on the occasion.World Elephant DayThis years Gajapayana was coincidentally held on World Elephant Day  observed to highlight the plight of Indian and African elephants  on Saturday.Besides this, Gaja Yatra, a nation-wide rally by Wildlife Trust of India in association with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, is also being held to mark the occasion.The objective of Gaja Yatra is to create awareness on shrinking elephant space owing to encroachment, habitat destruction and fragmentation and the imperatives of protecting or reclaiming for elephants the ancient corridors or tracts of forests, which they use during their course of migration.Elephants, mahouts insuredThe Dasara elephants and their mahouts have been insured by the authorities against any unforeseen event. While 15 elephants, which will take part in Dasara, have been insured for Rs. 2.8 lakh each with New India Insurance Company Ltd., the 30 mahouts accompanying them have been insured for Rs. 1 lakh each. Besides, there is insurance coverage for public liability for Rs. 22.5 lakh. The period of insurance coverage is from August 12 to October 4, 2017."

Paddy cultivation too has taken a hit as it is entirely dependent on canal irrigation and no water has been released into the canals for agriculture purpose this year.There is a sense of dismay among farmers that the interests of those in the Cauvery basin of Karnataka has been compromised by the State government, he added.Releasing water to replenish tanks is fine but what will farmers do for their livelihood and sustenance is the question being raised by the cultivators, said Mr. Shanthakumar, who wanted assurance on regular release of water to enable farmers to take up at least cultivation of semi-arid crops like ragi.The decision to release water to the canals was taken under duress from farmers who have been agitating for many days. The government should now announce the duration for which water will be released so that farmers can take up cultivating alternative crops, according to the association. If there is no clarity on the duration of the water release, then farmers will hesitate to take up sowing again, Mr. Shanthakumar said.Focus on semi-arid cropsThe Department of Agriculture has launched an awareness drive on cultivation of crops like ragi and maize in areas where agriculture is under rain-fed conditions.Heavy rain in Mysuru taluk, T. Narsipur and Nanjangud on Wednesday has helped revive withering crops, including cotton, and most of it can be salvaged. But the rain has also created ideal conditions for the cultivation of maize and ragi and we will encourage farmers to take it up, said Mr. Somasundar, Joint Director of Agriculture. Agriculture is under rain-fed conditions in nearly 2.82 lakh hectares in the district and is more than the irrigated area which is about 1.14 lakh ha."

We strongly object to the governments decision to cancel the discussion.Mr. Chavan said the Opposition wanted a discussion on Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Ltd., which is alleged to have availed loan worth Rs. 328 crore in the names of farmers without their consent.Mr. Chavan said the Opposition had also raised serious points regarding the corruption scandals involving Mr. Mehta and Mr. Mopalwar, which need to be discussed.Parliamentary affairs minister Girish Bapat strongly objected to Mr. Chavans demand. The leaders from the Opposition have demanded discussion on some 10 issues. There isnt enough time for this, and the House has many other procedures to complete. Hence, government has decided to cancel discussion on these issues.Mr. Bapat, however, faced opposition from his own party, after former Revenue Minister Eknath Khadse sided with the Congress and NCP. It is the Opposition which has to decide the subjects in the last weeks discussion. The ruling party should have consulted with the Opposition before deleting any topics, he said.Similar allegations were made in the Council by leader of the Opposition Dhananjay Munde, who alleged that the mention of corruption scandals had been purposely deleted from the Oppositions motion.Subhash Sabne, pro-term speaker of the House, suggested that the ruling and Opposition party leaders together finalise the topics for discussions. But the sugar mill issue was dropped from the list.Meanwhile, Mr. Chavan raised an adjournment motion, mentioning a sting operation that had revealed that a former CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority had allegedly admitted to have paid Rs. 7 crore as bribe to the former State Chief Secretary to stop his transfer. Mr. Chavan demanded a CBI inquiry, saying that the transfer and appointment of IAS officers also has the involvement of the Chief Minister. He did not, however, mention any names."

Shanmugam said here on Thursday.Talking to press persons, he said 11 sugar mills had not settled arrears amounting to Rs. 1,660 crore for the past four years. The State government should direct all sugar mills to settle the arrears immediately to five lakh farmers.Claiming that around 12 lakh hectares of land were utilised for non-agricultural purposes between 2000 and 2016 in the country, he demanded that the practice be stopped immediately. Agriculture was in a state of extinction owing to acute drought and shrinkage in area under cultivation.Even as the State government declared Tamil Nadu a power surplus State, new connections for free power were not given to farmers for the past 10 years. More than 2.5 lakh farmers in the State were awaiting free power. But the government was sanctioning power under tatkal scheme. It should be abolished and sanction should be made on seniority basis, he said.Mr. Shanmugam also expressed concern over fixing of meters for free power for agriculture.He said the Centre should not allow private insurance companies in the area of crop insurance. Compensation to the tune of Rs. 488 crore had been disbursed under the crop insurance scheme by nationalised banks in Thiruvarur district whereas private insurance firms had settled just Rs. 10 crore in Cuddalore district, he pointed out.One lakh tribal families in the State would hoist black flags to protest against inordinate delay in implementing Forest Protection Act 2006, he added.A three-day State-level farmers conference would be held in Cumbum from August 27 to 29 to discuss various issues affecting farmers and to draw the attention of the Central and State governments to their plight.New connections for free power were not given to farmers for the past 10 years.P.

It has also recommended the cessation of all extraction of groundwater from a 1km-zone on either side of Najafgarh drain and from landfill and industrial sites because of the water there being highly polluted.In its report called ""Hydrogeological Framework and Groundwater Management Plan of NCT Delhi,"" released recently, CGWB has recommended extraction in Zone 1 areas, where groundwater is available at a depth of less than 8 metres below the ground. However, the report also said that many areas in this zone had poor quality water and this should be used for salt-tolerant crops or blended with clean water for non-drinking purposes.The board said extraction projects should not be allowed in areas with declining water level (zone III). These included Delhi Cantonment , Vasant Vihar, Hauz Khas, Kalkaji, Chanakyapuri, Connaught Place, Punjabi Bagh, Paharganj, Preet Vihar and Vivek Vihar. CGWB has said if pumping continued at the current rate here, it would result in saline water. It has recommended rainwater harvesting and use of tertiary treated waste water for recharge of these areas.The report warned that overexploitation was not only depleting water resources, but turning groundwater saline. Of the 13,491 million cubic metres (MCM) of groundwater in Delhi, 10284 MCM, or 76%, was brackish or saline. Among affected areas were Darya Ganj, Saraswati Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, Najafgarh, Civil Lines, Defence Colony, and Delhi Cantonment. ""Poor quality groundwater can be used for growing salt-tolerant crops like cotton, wheat, gaur, chickpea, soyabean, sugarcane and others,"" the report advised.As for places abutting the Najafgarh drain, the report stated that the ""presence of heavy metals has been reported in groundwater along the drain. Therefore, groundwater in this zone is unsuitable for drinking and irrigation purposes...pesticides and bacteriological parameters have also been reported in isolated pockets. It is recommended that landfill sites should be selected after concluding hydrogeological surveys to minimise the risk of groundwater pollution"".Shashank Shekhar, assistant professor of geology at Delhi University, who had conducted an independent study on the Najafgarh drain, pointed out, ""Fluoride and even arsenic in groundwater in water samples of the Najafgarh drain can be attributed primarily to anthropogenic sources. Some heavy metals are, of course, found naturally in the environment, but they are not found in levels that are dangerous to human use. High nitrate contamination was also discovered in Timarpur, with fluoride levels above permissible limits in 20% of the samples.""CGWB has identified a ""potential aquifer zone"" along the western Yamuna canal which can yield around 5 million gallons per day (MGD) of water (the city's need is estimated to be 1,140 MGD by the 12th Five Year Approach Plan paper). The board also mapped tehsil-wise groundwater level trends between 2003 and 2013. Kalkaji tehsil showed the highest groundwater development at 277%, or much higher exploitation than the recharge capacity. It was followed by Vasant Vihar at 268%, Hauz Khas at 260% and Rajouri Garden at 232%."

For, the area is known for its melt-as-you-bite-into it traditional sweet. The city's other areas that are thronging with Ganeshotsav festivity, also see a steady stream of customers for this steamed delight. But it's no longer found in just mawa and barfi variations. This time, how about tucking into healthy modaks with unique flavours, like some city-based sweetmakers are trying out...You might think the idea for a granola modak might take time to catch on. No, says Tanvi Kewal Chheda, who decided to make the novel recipe this year. ""This is a modak, but with a homemade granola addition, comprising rice bran, wheat bran, wheat or corn flakes and rolled oats, and raisins or cranberries for flavour,"" she says. And the modaks won't crumble away if that's what you're thinking  dates are the binding agent here. ""This is a good replacement for the usual mithai versions,"" she adds.Seeds have several health benefits and they've also popped into modaks this year. Bandra-based foodie Yajur Khanna makes about seven variations with pumpkin and chia seeds. ""I've also tried date-oat-coconut, lemon and saffron and kesar-pista  so they're interesting flavours with a healthy twist. She explains, ""No ghee, khoya or sugar is used in the preparation. For sweetness, we use dates, raisins and cranberry paste.""And are you a peanut butter fan? Your breakfast staple has also gone a la modak. In this, the sweet is made with a little low-fat homemade peanut butter and saffron milk as the binding agent. ""We started these different healthier versions this year as there is so much awareness about health issues and with so many Mumbaikars shifting to different diets there is a demand for these. Yes, the healthier modaks may cost a little more than the regular ones as dryfruits and other ingredients are used as the base here, but I have heard people say, 'It doesn't matter; health comes first. It's good to know people are willing to make a healthier switch,"" she adds.Folks seem to want to push the proverbial envelope and go ahead of the regular fare, which is what is prompting foodies to make zany flavours such as red velvet and strawberry. Chef Rakhee Vasawani tried a refreshing chocolate and paan modak and Kemps Corner-based confectionist Shradha Mehra Virani, has fused innovation into the sweet with flavours like sea salt-caramel and cupcake modaks, with themed toppings. Other quirky flavours include orange, blueberry, coffee and a 'kairi modak', too! ""A few years ago who would have thought of green mango modaks, but today people are more willing to accept other tastes when it comes to festive sweets. This one is more tangy, for instance,"" says Khushboo Soni from Andheri who started making these flavours from this year. If you want to spice things up, take your taste buds on a ride with a 'chilly modak'. Adds Khushboo, ""When you bite into this modak, it's sweet and then comes the piquant flavour.""Kings Circle resident Neetu Nandrajog has gone a step further to make cake modaks. She explains, ""These are cakes carved into modak shapes. You can do so many flavours apart from the normal chococlate cake, like rasmalai-cake modak. To make it, the cake is moisturised with milk used for rasmalai and has pieces of the cottage cheese in between the layers. You can also do a blackforest-rasgulla cake modak in the same way.""Fusion has found its way here as well. Foodie Richa Lulla is doing a fusion modak, with 'til gul-praline'. ""These are two popular flavours so I thought why not merge them and it's been a hit,"" she says.If you're having family and friends over at this auspicious time, serve them these dessert-style 'waffle modaks'. Here, mini-sized modaks are made and placed in the pockets of the waffle. Shaved coconut is added on top and it's drizzled with maple syrup or honey."

The other issues, which will be under the GoM's scanner, include access to medical and educational facilities and matters related to village panchayats.Even though a final programme schedule is yet to be received by GB Nagar district officials, sources said the committee would meet officials of the three authorities, district administration and other stakeholders during its two-day visit.

This is expected to build volumes for the Swedish furniture retailer and, as a result, help bring down prices of its products in India.Ikea India CEO Juvencio Maeztu told TOI that Ikea products sold here will sport lower price tags than the ones sold in European markets. ""At Ikea, we target everyone -we want you to come to our store, your boss and your maid, as well,"" said Maeztu. ""Some of them will buy big furniture and some of them will buy a spoon or a glass and therefore we need to have low prices.""One of the ways how Ikea plans to reduce prices of its products in India is by exporting locally-made products to its global stores to achieve economies of scale. Although the company has been sourcing from the country for 30 years for its stores worldwide, textiles constituted 70% of its exports.Currently, however, as it inches towards running a full-fledged operation here, Ikea sees potential in sectors such as metal, plastic and glass. ""We are now working on comfort items such as sofas and mattresses,"" said Maeztu. ""Simultaneously, we are also trying to develop products from materials such as coconut, sugarcane, bamboo and banana leaves -materials that have had no organised industry built around them.""Globally, Ikea sources around 75% of its products from Europe and the rest from other places, including Asia. ""Going forward, we will see more Made-in-India products in Ikea stores around the world,"" Maeztu said.Ikea plans to open 25 stores in India by 2025 for a proposed investment of Rs 10,500 crore."

While Bengaluru has the highest count of millet consumers, as per industry estimates, Hyderabad is fast catching up, say observers. This, courtesy more dieticians and chefs promoting the nutritionally-superior millets.Also fuelling its demand is the Indian Institute of Millets Research 's (IIMR) partnership with a company to market millet-based products such as jowar idli, jowar pops, ragi dosa, foxtail flakes etc. Turns out there's another 35-40 companies that have come forward to forge similar tie-ups. ""Although we had conducted a lot of research on millets and developed a technology to add nutritional value to millets, we had to work on the demand too. We noticed that it was the inconvenience of using millets that was keeping modern women from using it in their daily cooking. We worked on processing technologies and with the help of the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) we came up with a range of ready to eat products that have cut down the drudgery. For example for making a bajra roti, it's no longer required to mix it with hot water kneed endlessly,"" said B Dayakar Rao , principal scientist, IIMR. He suggested millets be introduced in mid-day meals as well.Dieticians and nutritionists too confirm the benefits of millets and say that clinical trials conducted on diabetics, hypertension and obesity patients have shown impressive results. ""Available in many varieties, millets help in controlling blood sugar levels considerably. Being glutton free millets are easily adopted by the body. Millets are also easy to digest and are good for people with gastritis and other digestive disorders,"" said Sneha Ghosh , nutritionist, Apollo Life Studio.While experts suggest replacing one meal (150-200 gram of cooked millets) with rice or wheat, it can also be included in meals progressively, they add.C J Jadav, director Innerbeing Wellness Pvt Ltd that has partnered with IIMR points to a paradigm shift in the choice of peoples' food.

The appointment of the managing director and other staff, and granting of support price to the cane farmers was previously handled by the agriculture department, but these works would be now carried out by the cooperation department, Sardesai said.The factory is presently facing a huge loss and in an attempt to bring back profits to the lone state-funded cooperative sugar factory, the state government had plans to modernize it before the 45th crushing season of the factory, which is likely to start in October-November.The four decade-old factory had become a white elephant, incurring losses of over Rs 80 crore with a technical committee suggesting the necessity of modernization. Following the suggestion, the factory has already submitted a proposal , costing Rs 29.32 crore, to the state government long ago.The factory has a crushing capacity of 1,200 metric tonnes canes a day and the government wishes to enhance the crushing capacity to 1,800 metric tonnes canes per day. Records reveal that, on an average, the factory crushes about 1.2 lakh metric tonnes , including 85,000 metric tonnes of local canes, to produce about one lakh tonne of sugar every year."

And while it is true that his festival, Ganesh Chaturthi, evolved as a metaphor for the abundance reaped from the land during the monsoon, today it is also a joyous occasion for families to bond over food and sweets.In talking about the culinary spread associated with the Chaturthi , two sweets - the modak and nevri - merit special mention. For one, they are traditionally not prepared during any other Hindu festival, and two, they have their unique mythological links. Of course, to say that nevreo are not prepared on other occasions is no longer completely true, for with improved economics people, nowadays, mark other festivals with nevreo, too.Modaks and nevreo are principally stuffed sweets and share common fillings, covers and methods of cooking, differing only in their shapes.The modak can be defined as a round dumpling with a tapered top, or, as writer and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik writes in his book '99 Thoughts on Ganesha', ""It looks like a bag of money, similar to one carried by Kuber, treasurer of the gods."" Pattanaik adds that the sweet filling is to remind man that wealth has to bring happiness.Noted Goan folk researcher Jayanti Naik , points to the similarity in shape between the modak and a tufted coconut, which is a ritualistic male symbol.The reason why the modak is prepared only during Chaturthi is well-known. It is a great favourite of the elephant-headed god and it is compulsory to offer him as many as 21.While the nevri has a simple, half-moon shape, why it is synonymous with the festival is open to discussion.Naik alludes to the semi-circular shape of the sweet as being representative of the 'garbh' or womb, a subtle reference to the undertones of fertility rituals associated with the festival. ""Therefore, no matter how many nevreo you make at Chaturthi, you have to make at least one modak,"" she adds.Folklore researcher Pandurang Phaldesai says, ""Sweet preparations symbolise all that is good and prosperous, and what better way to celebrate than by fashioning sweets out of the indigenous ecological produce of the land?"" Which in this case comprises rice, wheat, coconut, jaggery, and a variety of grains.But, whether it is the nevri or the modak, the fillings reflect an amazing variety. To begin with, the ingredients used to make the shell will determine if the sweet will be steamed or fried. Rice makes for the former variety, while wheat is used for the latter. In an interesting twist, sometimes the covering is made from sweet potato.Coming to the ingredients, Prabha Pradeep Rege of Ponda , who prepares nevreos and modaks on pre-order basis for festivals, says, ""There is the principle base, sweetener and fillers that enhance taste. The favourite sweetener is jaggery, though sugar may also be used. The choice for the base can range from coconut (fresh and dry) to flour of various grams, and from evaporated milk solids (khava) to wheat flour. There is even a spicy variety, but it is not offered to god.""So if someone offers you a 'chunnache' nevri or modak you should know the stuffing comprises coconut and jaggery. 'Punnache' indicates a filling of the flour of chana dal or moong, while 'tikhatache' refers to a spicy stuffing.Which variety a family will offer to Ganesha will differ according to economic status and personal choices. The number of nevreo offered, too, is subjective. The only constant is 21 modaks."

As part of Ganesha festival, we opened a counter near Sri Mahaganapathi Temple with the consent of the temple management and with the support of environment activist Dinesh Holla. Devotees were given option to buy saplings from the collection of 21 varieties available at the counter by paying Rs 50. After obtaining the receipt, devotees are given opportunity to pray and get prasada from the temple. Later, they are allowed to plant saplings near the temple and public places,"" Shetty said adding that nearly 50 devotees booked trees on Friday.He said the NECF has plans to introduce the programme in churches and masjids in Dakshina Kannada district. ""We will soon meet heads of all religions and urge them to give a statement in favour of the campaign.

Ever since the advent of the DD Kisan national Hindi channel, we were asked to spend its funds only on the programmes being made for the new channel, he explains.Stating that he had been writing to the Prasar Bharati headquarters time and again seeking release of funds for clearing the dues and to produce new programmes, the official says finding resources for producing Hindi programmes is another major challenge ahead of them. We are suffering paucity of funds here, while the DD Yadagiri is returning about half of the unspent budgets earmarked for agriculture programmes every year. We hope our headquarters will look into the issue and release funds, Mr. Bhagawan says."

The council will also recommend policy changes that will make healthy foods more affordable, she said.Last week, a study published in the medical journal Lancet, overturned the conventional medical wisdom on dietary intake. The study showed that people, who cut back on fats had shorter lives than those who enjoyed oil, butter, cheese and meat. It also suggested that carbs created complication. ""We have to take the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study seriously because two teams from north and south India surveyed people here too,"" said Swaminathan.Most Indians have a carbohydrate-rich diet as they cannot afford proteins or fat. ""Healthy diet is expensive and still out of reach for many,"" said Swaminathan, adding that government food subsidies provide free rice, not fruit, vegetable or dal.According to the ICMR manual, a balanced diet has 50%-60% of calories from carbohydrates, and 20%-30% from fat. ""We too recommended some amount of fat, because most cardiac arrests and strokes aren't triggered by cholesterol, but by triglycerides. We should see if we can cut down carbs and increase protein,"" said former National Institute of Nutrition director B Sesikeran. Triglycerides come from ""bad"" carbs like high sugar and processed food and lack of legumes, fruit and vegetables.Madras Diabetes Research Foundation president Dr V Mohan, who was a part of the PURE study, said: ""We have been collecting data for ICMR's India diabetes study. In two years, we will have detailed India-specific information."""

It has also owed honorarium to the scientists and the programme crew that involved in the production last year.

He ran 133 welfare projects, encouraged people to marry even prostitutes and had played a commendable role in drug de-addiction programmes. He suffered from three diseases, disc problepm, blood pressure and high sugar level, said the counsel.However, the prosecution pressed for maximum sentence stating that the Dera chief had sexually assaulted the victims who were under his care.

He quit the job of a police officer, became an MP and now as a Union minister he aims to ""work for the entire country with renewed energy.""Singh's first posting was as assistant superintendent of police of Nasik. He then went on to become the superintendent of police of Buldhana.Prior to being appointed the Mumbai Police chief, Singh was Maharashtra's additional director general of police. He has also served as the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) in Mumbai.He has also been on deputation to the CBI and received a special service medal for extraordinary work in Naxalite areas of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. He received the President's Police Medal for distinguished service in 2004, the President's Police Medal for meritorious service in 1996 and the DG's Insignia in the same year.During his tenure in Mumbai, he is credited with breaking the backbone of organised crime syndicates that terrorised Mumbai in the 1990s, including the Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel and Arun Gawli gangs.During the same time in the late '90s, when gangsters were active in Mumbai and the mafia in Mumbai went berserk with several high-profile killings, Singh formed special police squads and cracked down on several underworld figures.That tenure saw several encounter killings in Mumbai with specialists such as Daya Nayak, Pradeep Sharma and Vijay Salaskar given the licence to take on the underworld. It was during this stint that the 25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings at Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar took place.As Police Commissioner of Nagpur, he began an outreach programme called 'Mission Mrityunjay'. This was an anti-terror initiative that aimed to enlist college students in the fight against terrorism whereby students recommended by college authorities assisted the police in intelligence gathering and reported suspicious and anti-social activities on campus and in the city.Identical programmes were launched in Pune as well as Mumbai during his tenure as the police chief of respective cities.As Nagpur police chief, Singh had also busted the 'matka' gangs there, unearthing a local politician's links to the high-profile racket.His tenure as Pune Police Commissioner was witness to the 2010 Pune bombing which occurred at the German Bakery that killed 17 people and injured at least 60 more.In June 2011, weeks after being appointed chairman of a special investigation team constituted by the Gujarat High Court to probe the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, Singh was replaced after requesting the court to relieve him after he cited differences of opinion between two other SIT members.On 23 August 2012, Singh was appointed as the Police Commissioner of Mumbai after his predecessor Arup Patnaik faced flak and was eventually shunted out for his handling of the Azad Maidan riots that occurred on August 11 in the city. Several policemen were injured in that melee.On 31 January, 2014 Singh tendered his resignation and applied for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and sought to be relieved as soon as possible from his post so he could contest the Lok Sabha elections.He was then quoted as saying, ""My inner voice is telling me that it's time to change profession. As a police officer, I have worked for the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra for many years, but now it's time to work for the entire country with a renewed energy.""Born in Basauli village in Meerut district on November 29, 1955, he is a BJP MP from Baghpat in western UP.He was pitted against Rashtriya Lok Dal supremo Ajit Singh from Baghpat where he won with a thumping margin of 2,09,866 votes, defeating Samajwadi Party's Ghulam Mohammed and pushing Ajit Singh to the third spot with only 1,99,516 votes.In Parliament, Singh has been vocal about farmers' issues, advocating the need to involve the farming community actively in drafting of the Union Budget. He has also been raising the problems faced by sugarcane farmers in western UP who are debt-ridden in the face of non repayment of their heightening dues by sugar mills. He has actively been campaigning for Government regulation of sugar prices.Singh is also a vocal proponent of holistic health, yoga and vegetarianism.He has a keen interest in vedic studies and regularly delivers lectures on spirituality, religious extremism and corruption."

Companies and traders were bullish about sugarcane and cotton , which have seen an increase in acreage by 9% and 18%, respectively, this year.Floods in parts of Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and weak rainfall in south India have hit crops. Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

Laxmi's companion elephant, suffering from similar health issues due to severe neglect, had collapsed and died in front of her eyes.Today, she not only walks gleefully, but also plays in a pool and wallows in the mud as she has shed 700 kgs during her stay at Mathura 's Elephant Conservation and Care Center (ECCC) run by wildlife conservation charity Wildlife SOS . She was put on a calibrated diet of green fodder and nutritious vegetables. The abscesses in her feet have now healed and Vitamin D3 supplements keep her arthritis in check.""For a young elephant of 18 years, being 1,800-kg overweight could have severely impacted her ability to live,"" said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of the conservation charity.

After four years of love and medical care, she has transformed into a gregarious and playful elephant. She is particularly fond of the bulls, and squeals with excitement whenever she smells or sights one of them while out on her walks. ""She is the only one who squeals in this typical happy tone,"" says Satyanarayan. She enjoys two walks every day with her friends-Bijli and Chanchal.But Satyanarayan and Laxmi cannot rest easy yet. ""We are still caught in a court battle to retain her custody as her previous 'illegal' owner and abuser still claims ownership and keeps filing cases in different courts,"" he said. ""The legal battle is taking up a lot of our resources but we are committed to Laxmi and will not let her down."" Laxmi was poached as a calf from her wild herd and initially trained to work at a circus. Later, the female elephant was used for begging outside temples in Mulund.Wildlife SOS is providing critical medical treatment and care to 24 elephants rescued from circuses, street begging and manual labour. While 21 of them enjoy the comforts of the care centre in Mathura, three are housed at a similar facility in Haryana. ""Every elephant you see in captivity is stolen from its mother at a very young age; once in captivity, it is tied up and beaten for months to break its spirit. Later, sophisticated pain inflicting tools are used to make it submissive and obedient,"" he said while speaking at an awareness event about the plight of elephants in the country hosted by the Royal Western Indian Turf Club (RWITC) at the Mahalaxmi racecourse on Friday.The club along with the horse owners' association presented a cheque of Rs5 lakh for the care of these elephants.

It came to light when villagers from Manickapuram noticed coloured water streaming into the river from a common effluent treatment plant CETP ) in Kasipalayam Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) issued a show-cause notice to Eastern CETP and after an inspection found that the discharge was not made deliberately, but due to damage of a pipelines. However, local residents say the discharge is from the CETP, which is catering to more than 20 dyeing and bleaching units, often during the night hours.The 150-acre Manickapuram tank was once the major source of irrigation for paddy, sugarcane and cotton cultivation in Mudhalipalayam and surrounding villages. But, due to the continuous drought and ill-effects of discharge of industrial effluents, agriculture was reduced to mere fodder cultivation in the region.With an aim to save the tank, if not to regain its lost glory, a group of farmers along with a non-governmental organisation has been working for the past several years. They were able to desilt Rajavaikkal, the canal that flows from Noyyal River and drains into the tank, and also the tank. They also repaired the shutter of the canal, said G Saravana Muthu, one of the volunteers.""After six long years, Noyyal is flowing with full force and at last, our efforts have paid off. As Rajavaikkal received a significant amount of water in the last one week, the tank is slowly filling up,"" said V Karthik, a farmer.All was well till Wednesday night. Villagers noticed industrial effluents flowing into Rajavaikkal the next morning. ""We believe that the effluents were let to flow at least for about eight hours. It may amount to 10 lakh litres of effluent water. We wanted to save the tank, at least to ensure that quality of groundwater source is good in the region. Illegal discharge of industrial effluents would poison the tank,"" said Saravana Muthu, a farmer.P Lingusamy, an 80-year-old farmer, said, ""Once, this area was known for paddy cultivation.

I never imagine this would happen.""After a complaint was made to TNPCB, authorities visited the spot and collected samples from the canal. They ensured that the discharge will be stopped, said Karthik.Speaking to TOI, a senior TNPCB official said, ""We were concentrating more on upstream and downstream of the river and the particular canal did not come to our notice. As per preliminary findings, one of Eastern CETP members' pipeline was leaking. The CETP authorities should have noticed the damage. Subsequently, the department issued a show-cause notice to CETP. Further action will be taken after receiving their reply.""Meanwhile, villagers want authorities to stop effluent discharge at the earliest.

Incidentally, our workers were about to go home at the end of their shift. But the moment we got to know of the derailment, we started mobilising our resources... We rescued around 100 passengers trapped in the coaches, Dr. Kumar said.The first three teams of the NDRF left their Ghaziabad camp  80 km from the site  at 6.30-7 p.m. However, since seven of the 13 derailed coaches had overturned, many passengers were trapped, and immediate rescue measures were necessary to save lives.Before the NDRF teams arrived, residents living on both sides of the track rushed to rescue the passengers. Many workers from the nearby mill who were well trained in cutting arrived immediately with their equipment. As it was getting dark, the mill also gave generators to supply electricity to ensure better visibility, Mr. Kanhai Singh said.Around 100-150 workers rushed to the site nearly 500 metres away from the mill. We provided lighting arrangements and around 10-15 cutters to cut through the coaches and take out the passengers, Dr. Kumar said.Our target was to cut open the window grill of the coaches so that we could free the passengers straight out of the window because our cutting equipment could not break the coaches, said Anwar Alam, who works at the mill. We started off with the S2 coach that crashed into a house near Khatauli, leaving the passengers stuck. We managed to save 10-12 persons from this coach, he said.Sushant Thakur, assistant general manager (administration and security) at Triveni, said the mill provided 25 halogen lights for proper lighting at the site for the mill workers engaged in the rescue. Our medical officers were present there to provide immediate assistance to the injured passengers and we deployed our ambulances too, he said. The responsive passengers were pulled out of the window, but for those who were deep inside the coaches, cutting equipment was used, he said.Finally, at 9 p.m., three NDRF teams arrived and used their high-end cutting tools to rescue the remaining passengers. The NDRF teams cordoned off the area and rescued the passengers more expeditiously, Mr. Singh said."

The trap was set five days ago and the leopard was caught on Saturday night. It came to light on Sunday and after examination for injuries, it was released in Nagarahole, said range forest officer H.K. Puttaraju. Though there were no complaints of the leopard attacking domestic cattle, there were reports of dogs going missing for some time, he added.More than 40 leopards have been trapped and released into the wild from the Mysuru territorial division in the last three years. The division comprises Mysuru, H.D. Kote, Nanjangud and T. Narsipura and has a favourable habitat for leopards. The landscape has sugarcane fields surrounded by wild shrub forests and reserve forests like Chamundi Hills. Besides, Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks border the territorial forest territory and hence, leopard sightings are frequent."

The sugar kelp had declined dramatically and been replaced by invasive, shrub-like seaweed that looked like a giant shag rug. I was shocked at how few kelp blades we saw, she said.The Gulf of Maine, stretching from Cape Cod to Nova Scotia, is the latest in a growing list of global hotspots losing their kelp, including hundreds of miles in the Mediterranean Sea, off southern Japan and Australia, and parts of the California coast.Diverse ecosystemsAmong the worlds most diverse marine ecosystems, kelp forests are found on all continental coastlines except for Antarctica and provide critical food and shelter to myriad fish and other creatures. Kelp also is critical to coastal economies, providing billions of dollars in tourism and fishing.The likely culprit for the loss of kelp is warming oceans from climate change, coupled with the arrival of invasive species. In Maine, the invaders are other seaweeds.In Australia, the Mediterranean and Japan, tropical fish are feasting on the kelp. Most kelp are replaced by small, tightly packed, bushy seaweeds that collect sediment and prevent kelp from growing back, said the University of Western Australias Thomas Wernberg. Collectively these changes are part of global trend of flattening of the worlds kelp forests, said Mr. Wernberg, co-author of a 2016 study, which found that 38% of kelp forest declined over the past 50 years in regions.Drop in species richnessKelp losses on Australias Great Southern Reef threaten tourism and fishing industries worth $10 billion. Die-offs contributed to a 60% drop in species richness in the Mediterranean and were blamed for the collapse of the abalone fishery in Japan.You are losing food. You are losing shoreline protection, said University of Massachusetts Bostons Jarrett Byrnes, who leads a working group on kelp and climate change. They provide real value to humans.The Pacific Coast from northern California to the Oregon border is one place that suffered dramatic kelp loss, according to Cynthia Catton, a research associate at the University of California, Davis. Since 2014, aerial surveys have shown that bull kelp declined by over 90%, something she blamed on a marine heat wave along with a rapid increase in sea urchins.What the future holds is more complicated, Mr. Byrnes said. If the Gulf of Maine warms sufficiently, we know kelp will have a hard time holding on."

The state government has already started the process for payment of compensation to the farmers.""The quantum of damage put at Rs 122 crore is based on the initial estimate. Now that floodwaters have receded, survey to assess the actual damage has started,"" said cane commissioner Jitendra Kumar Singh here on Thursday .""Once the survey is over, the quantum of damage may increase or decrease. The cane growers would be compensated accordingly,"" Singh said adding, ""Instructions have been given to the district cane officers to assist and cooperate with the respective DMs who are supervising the survey and the extent of the damage.""The cane commissioner and the joint cane commissioner, S N Lal, also visited the flood- affected blocks of West Champaran district in the first week of September to assess the damage caused to the standing sugar cane crop.They inspected places like Sidhaon, Bagaha, Lauria, Gaunaha, Narkatiaganj, Mainatand and Sikta. ""The initial assessment was done on the basis of the reports of cane officers and representatives of sugar mills operational in the state,"" Lal said.The cane commissioner said while the farmers suffered as their standing crops were destroyed, the sugar mills suffered as stored sugar was damaged under the impact of floodwaters.Singh said the calculation of actual damage would not be difficult, as all the 11 operational sugar mills have their respective reserved areas of cane and cane growers. He also said that farmers of the 'reserved areas' of all the sugar mills were surveyed and listed with all relevant information before the onset of flood.The relevant information furnished includes name of farmers, their mobile numbers, area of land under cane cultivation, type of cane cultivated, etc. ""Thus the surveyor while assessing the damage would compare the post-flood situation with the pre-flood situation, and thereby, easily find the actual quantum of damage,"" said the official.According to Lal, the damage caused and losses suffered by the cane growers would not have any substantial impact on the production of cane required for crushing and sugar produced compared to the last season, as the area under cane cultivation has increased by 15 to 20%, in accordance with the capacity of sugar mills. ""Therefore, the damage caused could bring the difference of only around 15%,"" Lal said.The area under cane cultivation in the state was 2.9 lakh hectare during 2015-16, which had yielded 57.44 lakh metric tonne (MT) of cane crushed, resulting in production of 5.26 lakh MT of sugar."

Legal experts have slammed the proposal saying society members should be allowed to approach courts as the authority heads may not have the requisite legal knowledge to handle such matters.The committee has further proposed that a three-quarters majority at an annual general body meeting is all that is required for a society's members to decide on redeveloping a building--even if the structure is not in a dilapidated condition or has been declared unsafe to live in. The state-level authority would also deal with issues ranging from society elections to allotting parking spaces.These are some of the major recommendations that the committee has listed in its report which it recently tabled before the state cooperative department. The panel has suggested amending the Maharashtra Cooperative Society Act 1960 to widen its scope to deal with housingrelated issues with the setting up of an independent authority .The state has around 95,000 housing societies, of which 25,000-odd are located in Mumbai and its suburbs.As of now, the Act is applicable to sugarcane and cotton industries, milk cooperative societies, cooperative banks and cooperative credit and housing societies. Currently , housing society issues are handled by the registrar's office, though. The panel has suggested that Authority of Housing Societies be formed to redress grievances of housing societies so that members don't need to move cooperative or civic courts.Reacting to the proposal, Vinod Sampat, lawyer and president of Cooperative Society Residents Association, said, ""The intention to create a housing authority is good but it requires a lot of study and research, proper infrastructure and budget.Certain powers like allotting parking space to members should not be vested with the authority. A quasi-judicial authority can decide on issues to a certain extent, but its members don't have the knowledge of law. As far as legality is concerned, they might face a lot of limitations."" Sampat said people should have the right to move court.Neha Nagothanekar, another lawyer who handles cooperative society matters, said she fears that corrupt practices may rise if the authority is not headed by a person with a legal background. ""If the government has decided to create a housing authority for cooperative societies, it should be headed by a person with judicial knowledge and not a political personality, as this would lead to a rise in corruption,"" she said.""The reason why cases are pending in cooperative courts is non-judicial staff,"" said Nagothanekar. Every year, around 6,000 cases are filed in various cooperative courts in Mumbai.The committee report sug gested that in its general body meeting, a society would allot parking spaces to its members on the basis of their flats in keeping with Development Control Regulations (DCR). If a society fails to allot parking spaces, the registrar would exercise powers vested with him. In case of dispute, the matter would be referred to the housing authority , which would take a decision after hearing concerned parties.Instead of conducting society elections under an elected officer of the registrar as is the current practice, the committee has suggested that polls be held at the society level during annual general body meetings.The report has omitted the mandatory condition of appointing scheduled caste and tribe committee members, citing non-availability of reserved ca ndidates in some societies. However, another condition has been added--mandatory appointment of a woman candidate.Following vociferous demands, the requirement of a minimum of 11members for a society's registration has been reduced to five. In other words, even five members could form a society and conduct committee elections--provided the amendment is passed by the legislature.BJP MLA Ashish Shelar raised the issue in the legislative assembly last December and demanded a separate authority to deal with housing society affairs. Shelar said, ""Instead of a three-forth majority , 51% of total members with voting rights must decide a building's redevelopment. I will suggest the necessary changes when the report is discussed in the legislature."""

The first train that left Transport Nagar Metro Station at 6.01 am, made a successful run to Charbagh. However, the second train from Charbagh Metro Station to Transport Nagar Metro Station at 6.20 am, stopped midway near Durgapuri due to a technical glitch. About a hundred passengers, who had got onto the train with much excitement and enthusiasm to be among the first ones to travel on the Metro, were left high and dry literally, as the Metro was stuck, for an hour-and-a-half on the rails.Passengers had to walk half a kilometre on the tracks to the next Metro station to board another Metro rail (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav and Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)With no air conditioner and lights and the doors stuck the passengers remained trapped in the metro till the engineers evacuated them through the emergency exit. Even the emergency numbers provided in the coaches went unattended, as the people on board continuously tried to call on the numbers. Our reporters who were on board reported the ordeal faced by passengers on the Metro rail in Lucknow. It created a panic like situation for all, especially for the elderly and the children. With no means to even access the washrooms, the passengers faced a harrowing experience early in the morning.Among the enthusiastic passengers was Gaurav Tripathi who missed his flight to Delhi because of the glitch. ""This was not expected from Lucknow Metro that too on the very first day,"" said Tripathi, adding, ""I had an important meeting scheduled in Delhi which I have now missed. This Metro cannot run for long if the Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation does not provide adequate training to their employees. I am extremely angry right now and will file a complaint against the Lucknow Metro.""Lack of fresh air also made a few people on board fall ill.

Finally, after reaching the Durgapuri Metro station, another train was arranged for and the passengers were then taken to Transport Nagar Metro Station.Lucknow Metro official trying to open the locked door of the train (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav and Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)The unexpected breaking down of the Metro rail resulted in not just giving passengers on board a tough time, the delay caused due to it also severely affected the run of the subsequent trains from Transport Nagar. Passengers who were waiting for the train at the station got late for work and students who had hoped to catch a Metro ride to school had to miss school. ""I had hoped to go to college in the Metro on the very first day of its run, but unfortunately itna delay hone ke baad mujhe auto se hi jaana pada.

Consider this: a staggering 273 dams have been built in the Upper Bhima basin across the state and 90% of canal water diverted from such dams is used to irrigate sugarcane. Agri expert Nishikant Bhalerao says the reason for such disproportionate distribution is, ""Politicians wanted to ensure sugarcane growers don't face water shortage.""Sugar mills became the lynchpin of the state's rural economy and its politics over the decades. ""Every MLA wants a sugar mill...we help them as we have to keep them (happy) with us. But today , we are suffering because of this policy ,"" said Sharad Pawar recently . Most of Pawar's satraps own two or three sugar mills.In the last decade and a half, Maharashtra's share in sugarcane output rose from 15.6% to 21.9% while Uttar Pradesh's marginally declined. UP tops in sugarcane production in the country (38.7%) followed by Maharashtra (21.9%).In the Upper Bhima basin, 19% of the cultivated area--more than six lakh hectare--is under sugarcane. In 2016, amid acute water shortage when Sec 144 was imposed to protect water sources in Marathwada, sugar mills continued to receive copious quantities for the cane-crushing season.Sugarcane tracts in western Maharash tra thrive on a combination of flood irrigation and high doses of fertilizers. Water treated with chemicals remains stagnant in fields, but this process has degraded more than six lakh hectares of land, turning them saline, according to a recent study. Salinity is multiplying annually by 10% in the sugarcane belt.The paper on `Severity of soil salinity and sodicity problems in Maharashtra and their reclamation' said salt concentration is high ""owing to injudicious management of canal irrigation water"" and this is expected to reduce land productivity .Expressing concern over excessive use of water for sugarcane, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has now directed agriculture officials to make cane growers take to drip irrigation."

Alert level 2 may be maintained if needed.Cloud accumulation along the hilly regions are evident. Dense clouds cover northern Kerala, Kannur and Kasargod.In the incessant rains in the last few days, the roads have been damaged in many places and also the traffic was affected on the National Highway near Valappattanam when an uprooted tree fell on the road. However, the tree was later removed and traffic resumed.Since it has been raining heavily for the last couple of days, there is fear of landslide in the hilly terrains, though no untoward incidents have been reported so far.In the low lying areas of the district, including Thalassery and Iritty, water logging has affected normal life and water has entered many houses as well.

Hence it is engaged in selecting resource persons who can properly guide farmers to shift to less water-intensive crops and earn a descent income out of it.Deputy Commissioner D. Randeep and Joint Director, Agriculture, K.M. Somasundra told The Hindu that there will be a seminar and interactive session on September 22 at the MMS Alumni Building. Agriculture scientists, progressive farmers, and agriculture officials will deliver lectures on water-intensive crops.It may be recalled here that the district administration at the behest of the government had not provided water to crops such as paddy in the command area owing to failure of rain.There will be a Dasara Raitha Dasara procession from Kote Anjeneyaswamy Temple in Mysuru palace to the J.K. grounds on September 22. District in-charge Minister H.C. Mahadevappa will inaugurate the procession. An exhibition of agriculture implements and various other agriculture equipment will be held for three days at the J.K. grounds.

Last year, the yield was 4,556 kg per hectare. In the wake of modern farm practices adopted by farmers in some pockets, the Agriculture Department set the target this year at 4,750 kg per hectare.Joint Director (Agriculture) Leelavathi is hopeful that normal crop area could be covered fully with the aged seedlings, if farmers adopted farm management methods in all mandals and rains continued till September 15. Still, the JD did not rule out a drop in yield per hectare.The numbersWhile three mandals  Vizianagaram, Bobbili and Pachipenta  recorded a deficit rainfall of 31, 21, and 25% respectively, 23 mandals registered normal and the remaining eight mandals received excess rainfall from June to August.

Water from the reservoir is being released to the canals depending on the availability in the interest of providing drinking water. Releasing water through canals may have to be stopped to manage available water for the coming days, she said.The Deputy Commissioner said that if farmers go ahead with water-intensive crops the administration would not be responsible for the consequences.As on Thursday, water level in the Hemavati reservoir stood at 2,894.33 ft against the full reservoir level of 2,922 ft.Water available in the reservoir is 16.48 tmcft against the maximum capacity of 37.103 tmcft.

The most immediate challenge for the country is to become number five in the foreseeable future, but in the end my vision for India is we will be one of the top three markets in the world for Coca-Cola company. We had a rough few months  end of last year and beginning of this year  but things are starting to come back. India is going to return to a vibrant growth, Mr. Quincey said, addressing a select gathering of mediapersons.Buyer preference for non-sugary healthier beverages had led to tepid demand for aerated drinks. Promising to reduce sugar content in Coca-Cola products, Mr. Quincey said faster growth in India would also come from non-carbonated (non-sparkling) drinks, as elsewhere. However, sparkling drinks will continue to grow here and our immediate focus will be on the same. The company has introduced Minute Maid Pulpy Santra which contains juice from oranges locally grown in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The company aims to invest $1.7 billion in Indias fruit circular economy over the next five years, of which $900 million would be towards procurement of processed fruit pulp and fruit concentrate. On competition, Mr. Quincey said, We pay a lot of attention to what competition does, not just the big players but also new entrants because they are doing something that the consumers find interesting.Mr. Quinceys visit comes four months after he took over the reins of Coca Cola from Muhtar Kent, who remains chairman of the board at Coca-Cola globally.At the moment, we have got a lot of investments in the bottling operations in India and we are very happy with them and thats going to continue, he said."

It said that the growth was driven principally by a recovery in cane availability in Maharashtra and north Karnataka, supported by monsoon rain and an increase in sugar production in Uttar Pradesh.ICRA, Senior Vice President Sabyasachi Majumdar said that in comparison to the sugar year of 2017, the domestic sugar production in sugar year 2018 could rise by 18%-20% and production could be between 24  24.5 million tonnes.Sugar production in south Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is likely to remain impacted by consecutive seasons of poor rainfall. This, coupled with an increase in the cane costs due to higher fair and remunerative price in sugar year 2018, is likely to negatively impact the performance of the sugar mills in these regions, he said.Drought impactMr. Majumdar said that in terms of profitability, the south-based mills especially those in Tamil Nadu and south Karnataka are likely to be adversely affected in the financial year of 2018. This is due to continued drought which is expected to significantly impact their cane availability in sugar year 2018 and the increase in the cane costs.While mills in Maharashtra and north Karnataka are likely to be negatively impacted by higher costs, they are likely to reap benefits of higher production. As far as Uttar Pradesh-based mills are concerned, they are likely to be benefitted by the healthy sugar prices along with continued healthy volumes and recovery rates, although that impact could be partly offset by higher cane prices, he said.He said that according to ICRA estimates, sugar year 2017 would end with a stock between 4 - 4.5 million tonnes, which is likely to be sufficient for around two months of domestic consumption, although there is a possibility of a localised sugar deficit in the southern and western States during the forthcoming festival season. While the shortage in the west is likely to be mitigated by early commencement of cane crushing, the deficit in the south is largely likely to be handled by way of imports from west and north India, said Mr. Majumdar."

The move to allow the proposed committees to select the beneficiaries for the schemes meant for farmers would jeopardise the interests of farmers, he charged.Other speakers demanded that the government make public the results of various surveys and schemes including the Intensive Household Survey, Mana Vuru Mana Pranalika, Grama Jyothi and others in terms of tangible outcomes.The round table conference resolved to submit memoranda to the authorities concerned at the mandal, division and district level against the move to form Farmers Coordination Committees on nomination basis in the next few days.Telangana Rythu Sangham district president B.

The suspicious transaction could be part of an international professional money laundering operation to help the Bulgarian mafia clean the proceeds from the narcotic trade, illegal sale of stolen antiques and human trafficking.It could also be an attempt by some Gulf-based hawala syndicate to reroute corrupt takings as legitimate business earnings to Kerala.Account holderThe account holder, a 67-year-old resident of Kochi, is the only person named as a suspect in the case so far. His case was that the cash was for the export of sunflower oil and sugar to Bulgaria. He also submitted records showing that the shipment had left the Mumbai port for that country.Fabricated recordsHowever, the ED found last week that the records were fabricated and no such shipment had left Mumbai. The Harbour police in Kochi has registered a case of forgery and cheating against the suspect. Investigators said that the accused had registered several paper companies in Mumbai, Jaipur and Coimbatore.However, his only known business activity in the past 15 years was the export of Rs. 1.5 lakh worth of sunflower oil to a foreign country in 2014.

Earlier, the State had to take permission from the Centre to procure essential commodities whose prices had risen beyond the reach of the common man.At present, when prices fluctuate, the State Food and Civil Supplies Department demands a subsidised price list from the Centre and puts up a proposal for procurement with the State government. But this process takes a long time, and until then the crisis usually has already hit a peak. With a decentralised policy for procurement, we will save a lot of time, said an official.Last year, the government had decided to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell it to State fair-price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India from the procurement chain. But the move was made possible by switching to the Centres scheme of decentralised procurement of food grain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and the Public Distribution System (PDS).The government has already started buying sugar, meant for distribution through PDS every month, through a live centralised e-auction conducted through the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX), an online commodity exchange.The auction had received great response and cut out the role of middlemen; it showed us that independent procurement can be done in a fair and transparent way, said a former secretary of the Food and Civil Supplies Department.West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala have adopted decentralised policies. Data shows that due to the decentralised process, there has been an increase in procurement of grains in these States."

Ramakrishnan urged Tamil Nadu State Cooperative Societies Election Commission (TNCEC) to conduct the elections in a fair and transparent manner without the influence of the ruling party.Speaking at a conference of cooperative societies and cooperative banks here on Sunday, he alleged that there were rampant irregularities in the 2013 elections to favour ruling party members, who consequently got elected in large numbers as members and executives.To avoid such irregularities, he said, the list of members of all the cooperative societies, who were eligible to vote in the elections, must be finalised six months in advance and identity cards with photographs must be provided to each member.There are around 24,000 cooperative societies of various kinds in Tamil Nadu with a membership of roughly three crore. This is nearly 50% of the adult population of the State. Hence, safeguarding these societies and ensuring that they are performing well are of utmost importance, for which the elections are crucial, he said. He, however, said the present AIADMK (Amma) government in Tamil Nadu could delay the elections for cooperative societies like it did in the case of local body elections.P. Krishnaprasad, former MLA from Kerala and finance secretary of All India Kisan Sabha, spoke on the necessity of cooperative societies and their functioning in Kerala. K.

It results in saline contents from the bottom of the soil resurfacing and stagnating in the top layer when the water dried out. It makes the soil saline and alkaline. As a result, productivity decreases.A study done by the NBSSLUP in Cauvery Command Area in the State in 2013-14, found that paddy yield covering 17,000 hectares in 42 villages declined by 30% owing to salinity and alkaline factors. Its total loss has been estimated at Rs. 1,250 crore per annum.The same factor has made about 30% to 35% land in Tungabhadra Command Area in the State not fit for farming.The issue could be addressed by cultivating tolerant varieties, other crops, by providing rest to paddy and sugarcane for some years and draining out salt contents accumulated, and other methods recommended by the NBSSLUP.He said NBSSLUP was preparing very fine scale plot-level data in 12 taluks of the State under the World Bank-supported Sujala Watershed Development Project.The mapping of soil in those taluks would help provide plot-level data on soil condition. The study, which was started in 2014, is likely to be completed by 2018."

According to gastroenterologists, fatty liver or hepatic steatosis is the buildup of fat in the liver. Its normal to have some fat in your liver, but too much can pose to be a health hazard.The liver is the second largest organ in the body. Its function is to process everything we eat or drink and filter harmful substances from the blood. The process is interrupted if the liver contains too much fat. When fat accounts for more than 5 to 10 per cent of your livers weight, the condition is termed as fatty liver. Its also one of the causes of liver cancer. It may also occur due to metabolic problems such as diabetes, obesity or viral infections such as Hepatitis B and C.Fatty liver is a reversible condition that can often be resolved with lifestyle modifications. In many cases, fatty liver has no symptoms.It doesnt usually cause permanent damage unless the fat is left to accumulate in the liver. It can become harmful if its underlying cause is not recognized and treated.About 30 per cent of the population may have a fatty liver. But the incidence of fatty liver can be found in about 10 per cent of this 30 per cent, said K Veerabhadra Rao, a gastroenterologist at a private hospital.Many patients and practitioners view fat in the liver as just fat in the liver, but we believe that a diagnosis of fatty liver could raise an alarm for impending Type 2 diabetes, he added.Fatty liver is the most common finding when you ask for an ultrasound of the abdomen in anyone above 40 years. People who are obese, diabetic, hypertensive, or have had a history of jaundice are more prone to fatty liver. While alcohol consumption can compromise the liver, it is also common to find fatty livers among nonalcoholics, said N Tirumala Rao, a consultant gastroenterologist.We test patients who come with fatty liver for other metabolic disorders including diabetes and start treating them for those conditions. Food habits and excessive consumption of fatty foods, lack of exercise, untimely meals and high-stress levels are the causes. Among patients who follow a diet and an exercise chart, the fat deposits actually disappear in the re-evaluation done after three months, Rao explained.Types of Fatty liverNonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseAlcoholic fatty liverNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic steatohepatitis.Acute fatty liver during pregnancyCausesObesityHyperlipidemia, or high levels of fats in the bloodDiabetesGenetic inheritanceRapid weight lossSide effect of certain medications, including aspirin, steroids, tamoxifen (Nolvadex), and tetracycline (Panmycin)SymptomsPoor AppetiteWeight lossAbdominal painFatigueDiagnosisBlood TestLiver biopsyUltrasoundTreatmentLimiting or avoiding alcoholic beveragesManaging your cholesterol levelsReducing your sugar intake, saturated fatty acidsLosing weightControlling your blood sugar"

During the break-time in the morning and evening, students are seen going out to nearby shops and purchasing inferior quality and nameless food items with the pocket money given by their parents. 80 per cent of the food products available in these shops, such as local made soft drinks, lollipops, snacks, chocolates, chewing gums, candies and others go unchecked and are unbranded. Products which do not have a license from the food safety department can be harmful to the children who consume these items without being aware of the repercussions.In the recent raids conducted by the Commissioners Task Force (CTF) at Krishnalanka which brought into light a case of adulteration, the dairy parlour owner A Surendra Babu was found misbranding and manufacturing Rasna packets and jellies. Both the corporation and Food Safety officials were in for a rude shock observing the menace created by small scale food markets. Not only Surendra, there are many unauthorized manufactures in the city who are introducing their products without giving any thought to the ill-effects. They mainly target school children mostly as they would hardly question the quality or the standard.During the raids, food Safety officials found Surendra using metal cleaning chemical as a color ingredient in the preparation of Rasna and jellies. He had not taken permission for manufacturing food products and beverages and has been marketing the items across the district. With no monitoring system to regulate the marketing of these food items, many unauthorised manufacturing units have mushroomed in the outskirts of the city. Food safety officials have failed to take action against the offenders.These products are cheaper and tastier. Repeated consumption of such items will take a toll on the health. The manufacturers mix color ingredient with sugar, the solution is then packed into small plastic sachets. Illegal manufacturers do not follow the manufacturing procedure and market them with the help of promoters, said food inspector Venkateswara Rao. City based physician Dr Sandhya Rani told TNIE that these food items affect the childs immunity system, making the child prone to stomach related ailments.They fall ill repeatedly without any specific reason. The digestive system is disturbed and it can possibly lead to stomach cancer, she said.FLOUTING NORMSShopkeepers making more profits with the sale of unbranded food itemsNo standard procedure followed in the process of manufacturing.Manufacturers mostly use sub standard and inferior quality raw materials.Cheaper the price, higher the patronage for these products, say food safety officialsOfficials promise to take stern action agaisnt illegal manufacturersMarketers to be cautioned against sale of unidentified and nameless products"

The present BJP governments policies are anti-farmers. When the Congress was in power, their policies were also not in favour of the farmers. So, we have decided to field our candidates in the Assembly elections, said KSG president Jayesh Patel, adding the candidates who will run as Independents.In the last few years, the outfit has been raising farmers issues like irrigation, land acquisition and better prices for agriculture produce among others.We fought against the Gujarat governments decision to acquire land for special investment region in Hazira and we achieved success. At present, our leaders, in association with local farmers, have started a movement against land acquisition for Vadodara-Mumbai expressway. Our organisation is also against the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor project, he said, adding that they are trying to bring all the farmers under one umbrella of KGS.Patel had contested the last Assembly election from Olpad on a Congress ticket, but was defeated by BJP.According to him, the KSG has well established network in North Gujarat, Saurashtra and South Gujarat.Our organisation is known in 26 districts. We are strong in in South Gujarat districts like Surat, Valsad, Tapi, Navsari, Bharuch.

It is an alarming trend as most of our health indices are compared to those of the developed West. The rising incidence is basically due to Malayalees mindset.We think there is a pill for every ailment, said K R Thankappan, emeritus professor, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies and the surveys chief investigator.The major NCDs are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and clinical lung disorder, in that order.  The incidence of heart attacks among Malayalees is rising. If it was 1.3 per cent in 1993 it has jumped to 3.8 per cent in 2016. It is the lets see attitude whether it is a heart attack or accidents which is proving the bane, said Thankappan.The survey found 69 per cent of the population consumes salt in excess of the recommended5 gm daily. It is for the first time these statistics have come out. Mainly bakery products, especially banana, potato and tapioca chips, and pickles are to blame for the high salt intake, he said.More than three-fourth of the population (77.8 per cent) reported consumption of less than the recommended three servings of vegetables per day, while almost nine out of 10 participants (86 per cent) reported consumption of less than two servings of fruits per day. It also found one out of every four adults surveyed reported current use of tobacco in some form and over 30 per cent reported current alcohol use among males."

Inaugurating the Congress dharna in front of the Secretariat, Chandy said the LDF Governments volte-face would only immerse people in liquor and the younger generation would become easy prey in the new environs with liquor all around them.Similar protests led by senior leaders were held in front of the district Collectorates across the state against the government decision to bring down the distance limit from educational institutions and places of worship to 50 m for sanctioning bars as well as de-notifying state highways within the municipal-corporation limits for re-opening the bar hotels which were shut down. The eagerness with which the liberal liquor policy touted for the benefit of bar owners was not visible in the distribution of ration rice. The Pinarayi Vijayan Government didnt show justice to the people even during Onam season, as the promise of 5 kg of foodgrain and a kilo of sugar for ration card holders was not fulfilled.The BPL families which had received free Onam kits when the UDF was in power were also disappointed this time, he said. It seems the only concern of the rulers is to earn revenue from the sale of liquor. Even the powers given by the former government for local bodies to have a final say in the functioning of bars were taken away by the new government.The UDF Governments which ruled the state had a clear vision through a transparent liquor policy, since the days of the K Karunakaran Government, which had set up the Udayabhanu Commission to save the state from the ill-effects of liquor, Chandy said. Phase-by-phase prohibition, distribution of soft liquor and quality toddy were the salient features of the report,which were imbibed by the UDF Government. The Left Government has struck down all the initiatives framed for peoples benefit, to pamper liquor barons, he charged."

After a few days, he was discharged following which he approached the High Court, seeking anticipatory bail.Hearing his plea, the court directed him to appear before the probe team on Friday.The court also directed the probe team not to arrest him till September 18, when the court looks into his anticipatory bail plea again.On Friday, for the second time, Shah appeared before police.He arrived at the club at 9.45 a.m and shortly thereafter, a team of medical professionals drove into the club to examine him and declared him unfit.It was in June, Shah and actor Dileep first appeared for questioning and after a marathon 13-hour questioning, both were let off.But on July 10, Dileep was arrested after further questioning and since then, he is in Aluva sub-jail, even as three of his bail peas were turned down.On Thursday, he filed his fourth bail, which would be heard by the trial court near here on Saturday.The abduction took place in February, when the actress was on her way from Thrissur to Kochi.She was taken around in her vehicle forcefully for about two hours before being dumped near actor-director Lal's home, from where the police were informed.The key accused -- Pulsar Suni and his accomplices involved in the actual abduction -- were arrested a week later and following detailed questioning, police unearthed the conspiracy angle in the abduction and arrested Dileep."

Not only did St Kitts & Nevis put on a gutsy show against opponents ranked 28 places above them, but did so with a B team made up of amateurs and semi-professionals, and an average age of 22.8 years.A precise header from the 57 Jackichand Singh, assisted by Rowlin Borges, had put India in lead in the 39th minute but the visitors hit back with a goal in the 71st minute. Even though India emerged at top, having beaten Mauritius 2-1 in the first match, in the tournament, it wasnt the best of shows India has put up in recent times, which has seen them climb to 97 in the rankings. With the AFC Asian Cup qualification match against Macau, away from home, on the horizon, these two matches were mainly used to get players some game time.But the young Indian team, without their Bengaluru FC stars including Sunil Chhetri, failed to stamp their authority on their lower-ranked opponents. The team has failed to sustain level of play the full 90 minutes, and it was evident on Thursday against the side from the Caribbean as the hosts failed to back up their solid first-half performance.They gave their opponents too many chances and too much space to come back. The substitutes by St Kitts & Nevis were the ones who led the fightback. Forward Bertie Carlos set the ball in motion, when his shot at goal was saved by Indian goalkeeper Subrata Paul. That led to a sequence of corner, free-kick, corner, corner for the visitors, and their confidence seemed to grow with each set piece.On the last corner, the ball was directed to Hanley Tiran, standing outside the box. He flicked it on, and Amory Gvaune caught it on the volley and sent it at the back of the net. Indias desperate attempts in the five minutes of added time came to zilch as they could not quite get the final shot.deepti@newindianexpress.com"

The annual demand is 24-25 MT.The stock limits have been imposed to prevent artificial hoarding of sugar by mills during the festive season.While cooperative sugar mills industry body NFCSF said there was no need to impose stock limits as current ex-mill prices are not alarming, private millers association ISMA welcomed the decision saying the move will check price rise during the festival season.It said that only 150 mills out of 530 would have to sell more during the next two months.""The average ex-mill sugar realisation at an all-India basis is not alarmingly high to call for imposing stock limits on sugar mills. Stock limits on traders are already in place.Retail price will not go beyond Rs 44 per kg as mills are selling at a reasonable realisation,"" NFCFS MD Prakash Naiknavare told PTI.He further said the stock limit will bring down the mills realisation and lead to financial stress on cooperative mills.Meanwhile, the ISMA said, ""Being a low production year, sugar mills have been generally selling reasonable quantity of sugar during the season.""Therefore, this decision will have an impact on some mills which were not selling at par with others, it said, adding that there could be around 150 out of 530 sugar mills which might be under pressure to sell more in the next two months.This decision will ensure that the sugar prices remain comfortable for consumers without adversely impacting millers' realisation and farmers.""The stock holding limit prescribed will hopefully ensure sufficient supplies in the festival season and also leave a reasonable balance before the new sugar from the next season,"" ISMA said."

If I remember correctly, I was eight when I cooked my first dish but I don't remember what I made (laughs). I love cooking because it is a creative process. In cooking, we innovate and evolve every day and that's the best part about it.I mostly cook South-East Asian cuisines. I was driven towards this category of cuisine because of my mother's mixed heritage  she is half Indonesian half Dutch. So, I grew up eating Indonesian food. When I started this as a profession about 30 years ago, there were no restaurants that offered Thai-Indonesian cuisines. Since I knew the food very well, I explored the opportunity.My favourite dish is the Burmese Khau Swey which is basically a soupy noodle with coconut. It also contains spring onions, fired onions, chili sauce, garlic and peanuts. My second favourite dish is tandoori chicken because it is very different from what I cook. Another reason is because it is more like a homely dish to me since I grew up in Delhi.There is also a chef's mentality that he/she won't be craving for the cuisine he/she cooks every day. I believe that a chef should always be innovative and he/she should always update his/her taste receptors to new and different taste all the time. This is also a way to evolve.I also like Chinese food a lot because it is comfort food. I believe making deserts are boring because it has limited room for creativity unlike normal cooking. Hence I enjoy hardcore cooking more than making after food deserts.If you want to try a simple vegetarian dish at home, I would suggest making stir fried vegetables. It's a simple and healthy dish. You hardly use any oil; instead you just should brown the garlic with any combination of vegetables. The ingredients include black pepper, light soya sauce and vegetarian oyster sauce.I tend to add just a pinch of sugar in my dishes for flavour. When I make fish fillet, I marinate the fish in lime juice. While cooking, I add a little chicken stock to the fish sauce, as it gives a unique taste to the fillet.The cuisine I love to experiment is hardcore French cooking. I will only try doing that after my retirement because, right now I have so much to experiment in the South East Asian category itself."

For her husband, P Madurai, had passed away six months ago. Living with her daughters family now, Devaki hadnt used her husbands smart card which was linked to his Aadhaar. On going through her SMS inbox, she noticed there were similar messages in the previous months too after his death. Someone had been procuring her dead husbands ration. This is not uncommon, admitted officials.Knowing that the dead do not require monthly provisions, salesmen at Public Distribution System (PDS) shops pilfer the ration. Removing names of the dead from the system is a problem in the city. We still have to conduct manual checks for this purpose, says S Madhumathi, commissioner of Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department.Every three months, we refresh the system after sending personnel for visits to PDS shops and homes in the the respective localities, but it is a herculean task, she said.It is relatively easier in the districts, as officials coordinate with the district Collector, who in turn delegates the work to the District Revenue Officer and his team. This team collects the details of the deceased from the village administrative officers. Chennai, with 17 PDS zones, makes it hard for officials to follow such a procedure. Each month, we are able to conduct manual checks in just one shop from each of these 17 zones, said an official.However, with the advent of smart ration cards linked to mobilephones and the TNEPDS app, people can request cancellation of deceased. With an OTP sent to the registered mobile number, they can complete the cancellation and help update the system, he said. Of the 1,97,26,588 ration cards, 1,88,65,664 have been linked with phone numbers. But for people like Devaki, who do not have easy access to technology, it is easier said than done. Cracking down on pilferage, complaints through helplines and SMSs to PDS 107 have gotten 13 salespersons dismissed in the last four months, officials said.When Aadhaar is made mandatory for registering deaths from October 1, the civil supplies department will greatly benefit from the move, said officials. It would enable them to remove the deceased from the system on a real-time basis, with cooperation from the bodies in charge of registering death.Instead of relying on information from the beneficiary and conducting manual checks, we will be able to update the system every day, said an official, adding that this would help them check misuse of ration cards and pilferage.Linked to AadhaarCurrently, 6,17,75,614 of the total 6,73,61,843 beneficiaries have linked their Aadhar number to ration card."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession.

The main sectors which attracted the highest foreign inflows include services, telecom, trading, computer hardware and software and automobile.Bulk of the FDI came in from Singapore, Mauritius, the Netherlands and Japan. The government has announced several steps to attract foreign inflows. The measures include liberalisation of FDI policy and improvement in business climate.Foreign investments are considered crucial for India, which needs around USD 1 trillion for overhauling its infrastructure sector such as ports, airports and highways to boost growth. A strong inflow of foreign investments will help improve the countrys balance of payments situation and strengthen the rupee value against other global currencies, especially the US dollar.The DIPP through its 'Make in India' twitter handle also stated that FDI equity inflow in manufacturing sector grew by 31 per cent to USD 4.19 billion during April-June this fiscal. FDI equity inflow in glass, Leather cement & gypsum products, sea transport, air transport, construction development, mining, sugar and medical & surgical appliances recorded five fold jump during the quarter. It added that since the launch of 'Make in India' initiative (October 2014 - June this year), foreign inflows jumped 64 per cent to USD 110.12 billion from USD 67.26 billion in the same period last year."
5a111d959855b76bf13dcd05,Human-wildlife conflicts on a rise in Tamil Nadu,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/sep/10/human-wildlife-conflicts-on-a-rise-in-tamil-nadu-1654894.html,2017-09-10,"Lighting fire crackers, using ferocious hounds and strumming loud drums doesnt seem to be of help anymore. Leopards keep falling into wells, elephants continue tossing humans to death, Indian Gaurs topple vehicles, boars ravage crop and Wildcats maul cattle, and these instances have been making headlines more frequently in recent months.A deadly conflict is underway between Indias growing masses and its wildlife. In Tamil Nadu alone, the human-animal conflict has claimed at least 185 human lives, and more than 132 lives of elephants and tigers between 2013 and 2016, according to data from the State forest department and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and climate change of India. This data, however, ignores hundreds of other animals including leopards, monkeys, foxes, rabbits and other animals that are trapped in the conflict too.The State forest department estimates a 50 percent rise in human-animal conflict this year owing to the severe drought that has strangled the State and its water bodies. The scarcity of water resources within the forests drives animals to the periphery, bringing them in conflict with humans living on the fringes. This argument is however too simplistic and drought has merely added fuel to the already burning crisis.For example, the human-animal conflict rose sharply in forests near Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri after a National Highway pierced through forestlands. On the other hand, increased cultivation of animal-enticing cash crops such as sugarcane has increased the conflict near Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve and Rajapalayam. Human-animal conflict in Tamil Nadu is complex, dynamic and factors causing the crisis vary geographically and from species to species.Hating and loving humansElephant poachers embed country acid bombs in fruits and leave it at foothills of Dindugul forest division, rues KS Subramaniyan, founder secretary of Wildlife Association of Rajapalayam, adding that frequency of such incidents is increasing in recent days. The bomb explodes in the mouth of wild boars and other smaller herbivores. Subramaniyan claims that the perpetrators of the crime get away by pointing fingers at farmers who are at risk of facing crop damages by these boars.On the other hand, entry of humans into forests have familiarised these animals far too much with humans, argues KV Sudhakar, secretary of Madras Naturalists Society. Eco-tourism and wildlife safaris acquaint wild animals to hundreds of tourists each day, diminishing their inherent fear for humans. Tourist resorts in forests have become more in number and roads to reach them have become longer in length, he commented, adding familiarity has bred contempt among animals.Shrinking habitat, corridorsEven the limited space available to wild animals is shrinking with expanding demographic profiles and unreasonable demand for resources in pursuit of economic growth.Unscientific development in forest buffers not only shrinks habitat and territory of wild animals, but also leads to isolation and inbreeding, making them genetically weak. When wildlife corridors are being infringed by growing human population, it makes the animal defensive, increasing the incidents of human-animal conflict.In Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, for instance, the wildlife corridor between Western and Eastern Ghats is mired in regular conflict. The reserve is surrounded by human habitation along the entire southern boundary from Gudalur to Masinagudi area to a stretch of about 30 km restricting animal movement.Animals like elephants migrate along their traditional 201 corridors which have now got fragmented in Gudalur area due to anthropogenic reasons ... In the case of tiger, it needs a minimum territory ranging from 2-5 sq. kms. Since Gudalur Division is in close proximity with Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and Wynad Wildlife Sanctuary, dispersed population of these animals therein, running short of the territorial areas, stray temporarily in search of food to the adjoining Gudalur Division, where intense human habitations exist, observed Wildlife Conservation and Management in Tamil Nadu, a report published by the State forest department in 2016.Allegations against the StateIn an attempt to create forests, the Department chooses to plant commercially valuable trees such as silver oak and eucalyptus, alleges N Arun Shankar, secretary of the Palni Hill Conservation Council. He added that apart from being under-staffed the department also appoints unqualified conservators. The State forest department however denied these allegations.Unconstructive solutionsSeveral measures taken by both public and the government has backfired as it lacks scientific vigour. Mixing glass pieces or poison with baits, grazing in forest land or shooting them only turns animals, particularly elephants (that have a strong memory) against farmers. Solutions offered by the government too have not been very successful.The recent spell of rains has invited animals back to the forest, but it does not make up for shrinking green cover. It is extremely important to detect and evict existing encroachments and prevent future ones, the wildlife report stated. However, the plan is yet to be implemented.Translocation not solutionWhy it is bad?Translocation of animals such as monkeys and snakes from urban areas to forest not only creates imbalance in the natural biodiversity, but also causes human-animal conflict in tribal areasCAG adviceA June 2017 study by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) advices the government to engage in animal-fodder based afforestation and creation of artificial waterholes.Rich and variedWith its hill areas and marshlands, TN is one of the highly bio-diverse states187: Number of species of mammals in Tamil NaduThe State is also home to 76 species of amphibiansMany forestsThe total protected area is 7,069.72 sq.km, which comes to 30.9 per cent of the States forest area.

It was not until he reached level 20, when he was told to draw a blue whale with a blue pen and when his school had started awareness drives against self-harm apps, that he sensed something could be wrong.After level 20, I told the administrator I want to quit playing this game. They threatened to kill me and my parents. I tried to uninstall it but found it really difficult. So I reset the phone to its factory settings, said Roshan, who confessed to one of his teachers about the incident during one of the schools awareness drives.The student of Class IX said that he was oblivious to what the game held in store when he downloaded it after a friend from another school tempted him to do so. For his part, Roshan later attempted to convince his junior in Class VI to download it, though the boy decided against it. The software asked for my e-mail ID, photos and contacts, which I gave. Initially the tasks were easy and interesting. It was not scary at all, he said.On the fifteenth day was when Roshan realised that the game was taking a slightly sinister turn, when the admin asked him to watch a horror movie and record the process as proof. The link of the horror movie The Ring was sent to me via the app. It was sent at midnight and I had to download it. It was a two-hour movie. Since my parents were asleep, I could watch the movie all alone, he said. The friend who had earlier convinced him to download the game received the link to the movie Sinister.When he got to the twentieth level, he was asked to draw a blue whale on his arm with a blue pen. Roshan saw a YouTube video that told him that at level 30, he would be asked to carve the same blue whale on his arm with a blade. He decided it was time to stop, confiding in his teacher at an awareness programme.His headmaster requesting anonymity said that Roshan was an average student and was as chirpy as a regular 13-year-old before he received threats from the apps administrators who claimed to have access to his every detail.His parents were unaware of it. We informed them and asked them not to give him the mobile phone. He had been using his mothers mobile phone, the headmaster said. Another teacher, who is also a counsellor at a CBSE school, said a lot of queries came in from the students for the app.While the focus is often on teens and young adults, who are said to be the target of self harm games, a 32-year-old businessman from Mogappair claims to have completed level 36 of the Bluewhale Challenge before he decided to seek medical help. He was brought in by his grandfather, who noticed that he has begun to isolate himself from his family. When asked if he was indeed playing the game, he confessed. However, even now, the game continues to remain on his phone, said B Elayaraja, counselling psychologist at 104 helpline.According to experts, there may not be a pattern in the behaviour of those who decide to download the game, although there may be a pattern in those going to the lengths of harming themselves.This man, for instance, was a regular businessman who did not have history of mental illnesses. He was brought in for treatment before he got a chance to harm himself, the psychologist said.Self-harm games were never new, though only a few had attained the popularity of the Blue Whale Challenge. The eraser challenge, for instance, encouraged children to recite the alphabet while rubbing an eraser on their skin until it peeled off. The one with the deepest wound be titled winner. Since self-harm games like these did not culminate in one jumping off a building, it had successfully thrived unabated for years and may continue to do so with platforms allowing apps to be published without enforcing strict guidelines."
