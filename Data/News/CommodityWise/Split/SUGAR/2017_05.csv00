5a1123c29855b76bf13dd22d,A first: Hindu vs Hindu vs Hindu in Gurdaspur,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/a-first-hindu-vs-hindu-vs-hindu-in-gurdaspur/story-P61lcRI5SlKRIlFPtFYWEM.html,2017-09-23,"The Congress returned to power in Punjab after a 10-year hiatus by wooing back its traditional vote-bank of Hindus and Dalits. Unlike the election of 2012, when kinship and loyalty to factional leaders was the deciding factor even in seats with dominant presence of the community such as Mansa and Sangrur, this time it fielded Hindus for seats where that matters. And the results have not been disappointing.Now, after 27 years, the Congress has fielded a Hindu candidate, state unit chief Sunil Jakhar, for the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha seat. From 1980 till 2014, it relied on Jat Sikh candidates. Sukhbans Kaur won five times (between 1980 and 1996) and Partap Singh Bajwa in 2009. BJPs Vinod Khanna ended Kaurs winning spree but lost to Bajwa in 2009 and avenged his defeat in 2014 by trouncing Bajwa. The seat fell vacant after Khanna passed away in April this year.Before Kaur, the Congress had fielded Hindu candidates  Diwan Chand Sharma and Prabodh Chandra  who won. The partys first candidate here, in 1952, was a Sikh, Teja Singh Akarpuri.With a new contender in the the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the October 11 bypoll to the seat will witness a triangular contest among Hindus for the first time. The Congress picked a Hindu face to prevent the BJP from polarising the communitys vote. So has the AAP, which had gone wrong in its calculations for state polls by relying heavily on the Sikh vote. The party has roped in Maj Gen Suresh Khajuria (retd) to harvest the disillusionment of voters with both the SAD-BJP and the Congress besides cashing in on votes of ex-servicemen in the border district.Caste mathThe BJP believes its candidate, Swaran Salaria, like his name that means gold, has the Midas touch. Other than being moneyed, Salaria is also a Rajput, the community which has highest percentage among Hindus in the nine assembly segments of the seat.According to internal estimates of the Congress, Rajputs comprise 21% in Sujanpur out of 37% Hindus in the area. They make 17% of Bhoa seat out of 29% Hindus, 10% in the nearly 50% Hindu population in Pathankot, and 8% of the 25% in Dinanagar. Their presence is 5% or less in the four other segments.The Congress calculations hinge on the fact that the Rajputs do not vote en bloc, and Salaria may find little favour with other Hindu groups such as Mahajans, Khatris and Brahmins who have more presence than Rajputs in Pathankot, Gurdaspur and Batala segments. Batala has few Rajputs and nearly 10% Christians who traditionally vote for the Congress. Qadian and Dera Baba Nanak have 12% and 14% Christians.While Sujanpur, Pathankot and Bhoa have less Jat and non-Jat Sikhs, they make nearly half of the population in Qadian, Fatehgarh Churian and Dera Baba Nanak seats. As the party in power in the state and with sitting MLAs in all three seats, the Congress is banking here more on support of urban Sikhs (non-Jat), and Hindus and Christians, at a time farmers are up in arms against the government over its half-hearted loan waiver, hike in market fee and rural development fee on some crops, and sugarcane arrears. In Gurdaspur, Batala and Dinanagar, Sikhs and Hindu voters are almost on a par in numbers, and other communities, including SCs and OBCs, can tilt the scales too.Having garnered the biggest chunk of reserved seats in the state polls, the Congress is also hoping to find favour with SCs not only in the reserved seats of Bhoa and Dinanagar but also general seats, because Ramdasia, Valmiki, Bhagat and Mazhabi communities have a high presence  15-30%  in almost all other segments.Out of 16 elections, Gurdaspur has sent Congress MPs to the Lok Sabha 11 times. The BJP has won four times  Vinod Khanna all four times  and the Janata Party candidate won in 1977. Of these, nine were Hindus and seven Sikhs. Does Gurdaspur vote on party or community lines? History says it is almost 50-50!"

(File | PTI)NEW DELHI: A Mumbai Police commissioner who quit the post to join politics, Satyapal Singh seems to have found his true calling after taking the electoral plunge to become an MP and now a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet.61-year-old Satyapal Singh wanted to become a scientist before he joined the IPS in 1980 and got Maharashtra cadre.But in his own words, his inner voice told him it was time to change his profession. He quit the job of a police officer, became an MP and now as a Union minister he aims to work for the entire country with renewed energy.""Singh's first posting was as assistant superintendent of police of Nasik. He then went on to become the superintendent of police of Buldhana.Prior to being appointed the Mumbai Police chief, Singh was Maharashtra's additional director general of police. He has also served as the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) in Mumbai.He has also been on deputation to the CBI and received a special service medal for extraordinary work in Naxalite areas of Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. He received the President's Police Medal for distinguished service in 2004, the President's Police Medal for meritorious service in 1996 and the DG's Insignia in the same year.During his tenure in Mumbai, he is credited with breaking the backbone of organised crime syndicates that terrorised Mumbai in the 1990s, including the Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel and Arun Gawli gangs.During the same time in the late '90s, when gangsters were active in Mumbai and the mafia in Mumbai went berserk with several high-profile killings, Singh formed special police squads and cracked down on several underworld figures.That tenure saw several encounter killings in Mumbai with specialists such as Daya Nayak, Pradeep Sharma and Vijay Salaskar given the licence to take on the underworld. It was during this stint that the 25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings at Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar took place.As Police Commissioner of Nagpur, he began an outreach programme called 'Mission Mrityunjay'. This was an anti-terror initiative that aimed to enlist college students in the fight against terrorism whereby students recommended by college authorities assisted the police in intelligence gathering and reported suspicious and anti-social activities on campus and in the city.Identical programmes were launched in Pune as well as Mumbai during his tenure as the police chief of respective cities.As Nagpur police chief, Singh had also busted the 'matka' gangs there, unearthing a local politician's links to the high-profile racket.His tenure as Pune Police Commissioner was witness to the 2010 Pune bombing which occurred at the German Bakery that killed 17 people and injured at least 60 more.In June 2011, weeks after being appointed chairman of a special investigation team constituted by the Gujarat High Court to probe the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, Singh was replaced after requesting the court to relieve him after he cited differences of opinion between two other SIT members.On 23 August 2012, Singh was appointed as the Police Commissioner of Mumbai after his predecessor Arup Patnaik faced flak and was eventually shunted out for his handling of the Azad Maidan riots that occurred on August 11 in the city.Several policemen were injured in that melee.On 31 January, 2014 Singh tendered his resignation and applied for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and sought to be relieved as soon as possible from his post so he could contest the Lok Sabha elections.He was then quoted as saying, ""My inner voice is telling me that it's time to change profession. As a police officer, I have worked for the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra for many years, but now it's time to work for the entire country with a renewed energy.""Born in Basauli village in Meerut district on November 29, 1955, he is a BJP MP from Baghpat in western UP.He was pitted against Rashtriya Lok Dal supremo Ajit Singh from Baghpat where he won with a thumping margin of 2,09,866 votes, defeating Samajwadi Party's Ghulam Mohammed and pushing Ajit Singh to the third spot with only 1,99,516 votes.In Parliament, Singh has been vocal about farmers issues, advocating the need to involve the farming community actively in drafting of the Union Budget. He has also been raising the problems faced by sugarcane farmers in western UP who are debt-ridden in the face of non repayment of their heightening dues by sugar mills. He has actively been campaigning for Government regulation of sugar prices.Singh is also a vocal proponent of holistic health, yoga and vegetarianism.He has a keen interest in vedic studies and regularly delivers lectures on spirituality, religious extremism and corruption."

Here on the Sikkim front, trade through the Nathu La pass counts for more than bragging rights.Through the 72-day standoff at Doklam, Nathu La traders reckon they become the collateral damage in a contest they know would never flare into a war. With the pass shut since mid-June and the annual winter closure coming up at the end of September, they have copped more losses than most in all this. I knew the Chinese would never fight a war with India in Sikkim, Ongmo Bhutia, a trader, said.Tibet needs our sugar, kerosene and vegetables. While they can produce low-quality salt, they cant do without sugar, vegetables and rice, which they cant grow on the arid plateau. Reopened in 2006, 44 years after the 1962 war, Nathu La is a focal point of trade along the Silk Route from the Himalayas to the Tibetan plateau.While sugar, kerosene, fresh vegetables, tobacco, watches and spices are chief among the 29 listed exportable items from India to Tibet, clothes, yak hair, goat and sheep skin, butter and raw silk top the list of 15 items allowed to be imported from China through Nathu La.As fresh supplies have been blocked somewhere on the other side of the pass, the traders here have a deficit inventory of warm Chinese jackets. So Ongmo Bhutia lends out his old stock on hire at `100 per jacket per day to the few tourists still visiting eastern Sikkim. Many of Ongmos friends had taken their stocks to Siliguri to survive the winter.We buy a Chinese jacket for `1,500 and sell it at `4,500 to tourists in Gangtok. But due to closure of the Nathu La and a bad tourist season, we now have to travel to Siliguri to make the same profit. We need the money to sustain during the harsh winter when we will have no source of income at all, said trader Diki Sherpa. Peace between India and China is very important for trade to flourish, he added, speaking like an MEA diplomat.La for LhasaSome of the older traders here still remember what it used to be like before the last time the two Asian giants actually fought rather than glared at each other. The Silk Route was only a mule track before the 1962 war, said Palsang Dorje, an 82-year-old Silk Route trader. In those days they used to remove the wheels of jeeps and the chassis would be hauled by 16 strong Tibetans all the way from Kalimpong to Lhasa. Back then, it took 25 days by foot from Kalimpong to Lhasa through Nathu La. But after the 1962 war, the Sikkimese people built a motorable road from Kalimpong to Nathu La through Dzuluk and Gnathang. The 1962 war in Arunachal Pradesh had sent warning signals to the kingdom of Sikkim, then not a part of India, that border road links were a dire necessity.Silk Route construction supervisor Sangmo Sherpa explained the La in the Himalayan passes leading to Tibet. The La in the names of passes such as Doka La, Nathu La and Bum La means Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. The locals used to ask merchants where they were heading to and the answer used to be Lhasa. Duly, it was shortened to La and that stuck to the passes that led to the Tibetan capital, he said.Another old-timer Prashant Rai narrated how he once made a fortune by importing gold and watches from Tibet during the barter days. Sikkimese merchants used to import Rolex watches and pure gold from Tibet. We used to bring back thousands of silver coins and 135-140 biscuits of gold of four-inch thickness from Lhasa by trading rice, sugar, kerosene, cereals and jeeps. It was not treated as smuggling since we had to deposit the silver and gold at the Rongli check-post and the Kalimpong Sadar police station and could take them back to our villages only after providing details of the trade, he said."

For me both Mysuru and Mandya are equally dear to my heart. Through great love and faith for Mandya district, I have done my best from the days as Finance Minister.Should I not say all these works were done for the district when the elections are round the corner? he asked JD(S) MP C S Puttaraju. Siddaramaiah said the government will fix the sugarcane price based the that to be fixed by the Union government.He said the state government will issue 16 lakh new BPL cards in the next 15 days that will cover 4 crore people under the Anna Bhagya scheme, apart from giving support price to milk produced in the state.No positive reply from Goa CM on MahadayiSiddaramaiah on Friday said BJP leaders who assured to meet and hold talks with the Goa Chief Minister in an effort to reslove the Mahadayi issue, have not come out with a positive reply.He told reporters that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should intervene to resolve the Mahadayi issue which involves the states of Karnataka, Goa and Maharastra. The Karnataka government is keen to resolve the issue amicably and had written to the other states, but they are sticking to their stand that it be resloved by the water disputes tribunal, the CM said.Siddaramaiah also said that the state government has submitted a detailed project report on constructing balancing reservoir at Mekedatu. The state government will start the project once the state gets the Centres nod."

But the function on Friday evening also gave rise to speculation of a fresh bout of dissension, with KPCC president G Parameshwara staying away. That Siddaramaiah ensured all three ministerial berths went to his nominees is seen as reason for Parameshwaras sulk.MLCs H M Revanna, R B Timmapur and first-time legislator M C Mohana Kumari (Geetha Mahadeva Prasad) were inducted into the ministry.While Revanna and Timmapur got cabinet rank, Geetha has been made Minister of State with independent charge. The choice of Reddy as Home Minister over Forest Minister Ramanath Rai is also seen as a safe bet.The BJP had threatened to launch an agitation against the controversial Rai, who belongs to Dakshina Kannada district, if he was made the Home Minister. Though Siddaramaiah was reportedly keen on Rai to keep a check on the communal violence in the coast, he was advised against it.While Revanna gets Transport, Timmapur has been assigned Excise. Small Scale Industries portfolio, which was with Ramesh Jarkiholi has been given to Geetha,who has also got Sugar portfolio, earlier held by her late husband H S Mahadeva Prasad.In the minor reshuffle effected on Friday, Minister for Labour Santosh Lad got additional portfolio of Skill Development. Ramesh Jarkiholi has been given the Co-operation ministry, earlier held by Prasad.The Chief Minister has also elevated Ministers of State Priyank Kharge, Pramod Madhwaraj, Eshwar Khandre and Rudrappa Lamani to Cabinet rank.While Siddaramaiah has succeeded in having his way in the choice of new entrants to the ministry, he may not be able to wish away the discontent creeping in the party on account of that. Parameshwara, by staying away from the ceremony, sent a clear signal at his unhappiness with the developments.Parameshwara was batting for Tiptur MLA K Shadakshari from his Tumakuru district under the Lingayat quota. But Siddaramaiah chose political novice Geetha. The next shock was the induction of Timmapur under the Dalit quota, earlier represented by Parameshwara.Parameshwara, who had quit as Home Minister to focus on his job as KPCC chief, was reportedly eyeing the slot for Motamma. Moreover, he belongs to the right wing group of Dalit community while Timmapur belongs to the left. The recent nomination of C M Ibrahim, Siddaramaiahs candidate, for the vacant Legislative Council seat too didnt go down well with Parameshwara."
5a11298f9855b76bf13dd6f7,City honours fallen  watchers of forests,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/sep/11/city-honours-fallen--watchers-of-forests-1655666.html,2017-09-11,"BENGALURU: All alone in a thick forest in the death of the night with wild animals all around might seem something out of your worst nightmares. However, for a forest watcher or forest guard, its just another day at work.Panchalingaiah, a forest watcher at the Ramnagara Division (Bengaluru Circle), was out chasing wild elephants near his village in Magadi on September 9, 2016. Unfortunately, he didnt return home. During work, he was trampled by one of the elephants, and died leaving behind his wife and two infant children. He had served in the department for 10 years, and died just two days before the Forest Martyrs Day.A year after his death, Panchalingaiahs wife, Vedavati BU, her two children aged five and two and a half years, and her two brothers, attended a Forest Martyrs Day event in the city on Monday. Panchalingaiah and four other forest watchers and guards who died while on duty (in different incidents), were honoured on the day.Vedavati says, We were married for just for five years and then he left us. Dayanand K, Vedavatis brother, talks fondly about his brother-in-law and says, He was dedicated to his job, and there was a time when he did not take a single day off for a year  he was on duty day and night.Vedavati now lives with her parents in Hesseraghatta. One of my children is studying in LKG. I have to do menial jobs to make ends meet now, she adds. Panchalingaiahs father passed away a few years before his death, and his mother is also a widow now. She works as an agricultural labourer and is quite old, she adds.While the forest department has already given a compensation of `5 lakh, Panchalingiahs wife and brothers claim that they were promised a total of `25 lakh and a job. Dayanand, says,We have been running around from Ramanagaru to Bengaluru regularly for the last year to get the rest of the compensation.K Lingappa, deputy conservator of forests, Headquarters, Bengaluru, says that forest watchers and guards are usually given a compensation of `5 lakh. There is some talk in the department to increase this amount substantially. It was only in the case of a forest guard, Murigeppa Tamangol, who was charred to death in Bandipur National Park while trying to put our forest fires, that a compensation of `25 lakh was given. Murigeppa was also honoured on Monday. With regards to jobs, a certain criteria such as qualification is followed, but a job is usually a surety, adds Lingappa.Other MartyrsFrom 1966 to 2017, there have been 42 deaths of forest guards, watchers other people from the state forest department. Forest watchers Ramaiah and Dibbanna died in Bannerghatta forest while chasing wild elephants. Doddashetty, another forest watcher, was also killed by elephants. They were also honoured on the day.Monetary benefits for forest staff on the anvilAlthough they risk their lives everyday, forest watchers and guards do not get much in terms of compensation in case of death. This is set to change with the Forest Department being in talks to bring in a number of changes with regards to various monetary benefits. Kishen Singh Sugara, principal chief conservator of forests (Head of Forest Force), says that for starters, the compensation of the staff in the forest department would be increased from the present ` 5 lakh to `25 lakh. He says that a proposal has already been prepared on the same. Once approved, the compensation would be on par with that of police services, says Kishen Singh.Another benefit that will soon be extended is scholarships to the children of those who fell in the line of duty. We are deciding on the modalities of the scholarships, such as the amount, whether it should be dependent on the course or college that has been chosen, and other factors. A committee to decide on this and other monetary benefits is still deliberating on the issue, and we hope that things will be finalised in the next few weeks, says Kishen. There is also the issue of insurance policies for forest staff. At present, there is no definite policy, says Kishen Singh, which is why the matter has also come up for deliberation. Another plan is to have bravery awards and medals on the lines of many defense and police forces. It will be something like a chief minister silver or gold medal for bravery. A proposal has already been sent to the government on the same,and we are positive that it willbe approved very soon, says Kishen Singh."

Their festival - NH44 - was all about food and drinks that one would find at dhabas along highways in south India.The items on the menu were limited, but had some popular names on it. We started the meal with the Magic Mushrooms and Social Chicken Sukka. Both dishes were low on spice and high on flavour, making them the perfect accompaniments with your drink. We paired it with the Tanker LLIIT, which comes in a long, cylindrical glass, and one of these can keep you going for some time, as it is quite strong. We tried the Luru Prawns and Red Hot Chilli Babycorn. Both the dishes were spicy, especially the prawns that had an overwhelming flavour of chilli powder - definitely reccomemded for those who have a high spice tolerance. One cocktail that we particularly enjoyed was the Bhayanak Thandi Beer - a shandy of sorts which helped wash down the spicy starters.We really wanted to give the Banarasi Patiala a try - a sugarcane juice based cocktail - which was unfortunately not available that day. The Tenderloin Roast - which is basically like a Kerala beef fry - was good and had plenty of coconut bits to make it feel authentic. The Mackerel Masala Fry was also on point in the flavour department. They also had some Social classics on the drinks menu, such as Dawa Daru and Pauvas.For the main course, the festival had three thali options - fish, chicken and vegetarian. We tried the special on the main course list - Ramesh Annas Chicken Chettinadu Biryani. The biryani was actually very good. The mildly-flavoured rice was comforting, and had a very home-cooked feel to it, making it our favourite dish on the menu. All in all, the concept of the festival was refreshing and gave us that feeling of driving down a highway and stopping for a meal at a local dhaba. However, this festival had limited options for the vegetarians, but gave meat lovers enough to want to come back for more.The festival ended yesterday, and the prices of the dishes starts at as low ` 100."
5a1129c69855b76bf13dd72b,Decoding juvenile diabetes,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/sep/20/decoding-juvenile-diabetes-1660310.html,2017-09-20,"BENGALURU: Type 1 diabetes usually starts in childhood, but can occur in adults (30 to 40-year-olds). In this type of diabetes, the pancreas produces very little insulin. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, sugar starts to build up in the blood. Individuals with type 1 diabetes must take some form of insulin for the rest of their lives.When the bodys immune system destroys beta cells in pancreas, type 1 diabetes develops. Beta cells produce insulin. Researchers are not sure why a persons immune system attacks its own insulin producing cells. Although type1 diabetes can develop at any age, about two-thirds are diagnosed in individuals under the age of 19 in early childhood and at puberty. Male and female are equally affected.Insulin as TreatmentEvery person with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin to help their body process sugar in the blood. Most take insulin in the injectable form and may require several shots per day. Insulin is a hormone from the pancreas that allows sugar to enter the cells. Insulin also lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Without insulin, sugar is unable to enter the cells. This means that cells that make up muscles and other tissues will not be able to receive their main source of energy.There are different types of insulins available. Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within a few minutes and lasts for a couple of hours. Regular or short-acting insulin takes about 30 minutes to work and lasts 3-6 hours. Intermediate-acting insulin takes 2-4 hours to work and lasts up to 18 hours. Long-acting insulin can work for an entire day.Side effects of insulin must be watched-out. Insulin is bound to cause low blood sugar, headache, flu-like symptoms, weight gain when you first start using insulin, lumps, scars, or rash at injection site and shock.Although insulin is a wonderful drug that helps people with diabetes, it needs to be used carefully. If a person takes too much insulin it is possible the blood sugar level will lower into dangerous levels. This situation is termed an insulin reaction (low blood sugar due to excessive insulin) severe hypoglycemia.Low Blood SugarSome signs and symptoms of low blood sugar include fatigue, excessive yawning, mild confusion, decreased coordination, sweating, muscle twitching, and pale skin. As these symptoms get progressively worse, seizures, loss of consciousness and even death may occur.People with type 1 diabetes, are advised to carry about 15 grams of a source of instantly available sugar, glucose biscuits, juices. These carbohydrates may resolve mild to moderate insulin reactions. For severe reactions, a drug called glucagon should be injected under the skin by a family doctor.Type 1 and PregnancyPlanning ahead, even before conception, to control blood sugar levels can lower the risk of miscarriage and birth defects.During pregnancy, keep your A1c below 7 per cent. Preeclampsia is a condition that 18-30 per cent of pregnant women with diabetes develop after the 20-week mark and is characterized by high blood pressure and proteins in the urine. if untreated it may harm the baby and put the mother at risk for stroke and seizures. While mother is breastfeeding, it is important for her to check her glucose levels frequently.Artificial PancreasThis device is a combination of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system controlled by a computer program. Some early trials have shown promising results.Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplant: Although there are benefits to pancreas transplantation, there are also drawbacks including medications with serious side effects that must be used to prevent rejection of the donor cells, and the probability that the transplanted cells may only function for a few years.About 20,000 children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year and is a life-changing situation. it affects the whole family. Parents must help children monitor blood sugar and plan meals. Insulin dosages must be monitored and blood sugar levels need to be checked often. Diabetes in children is a 24-hour-a-day problem, when a child is attending school and participating in extracurricular activities. Parents and their children need to make arrangements to follow through with insulin treatments even while the child is at school.SymptomsUnusual thirstWeight loss and an increase in appetite as the body metabolizes fat for energy. Disrupted glucose metabolism causes lack of energy and drowsiness for extended periods.Higher risk for bacterial infections and fungal infections. Common fungal infections include athletes foot, vaginal yeast infection in women, jock itch, ringworm, and diaper rashes in babies.Dangerous signs and symptoms such as blurry vision, numbness or tingling in the extremities (especially the feet), loss of consciousness, fatigue, fruity breath, dry mouth, and diabetic coma.Ketoacidosis . The body cells start burning fat for energy, which causes ketones to build up in the blood. These acids can change the persons blood pH level and can trigger a life-threatening coma. This is termed diabetic ketoacidosis and is a medical emergency.(The author is a former Director Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology, former VC Bangalore University and former Chairman Karnataka State Health Commission)"
5a112a5c9855b76bf13dd7ac,One step away from diabetes?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/sep/13/one-step-away-from-diabetes-1656828.html,2017-09-13,"BENGALURU:Pre-diabetes is blood sugar that is halfway through the door.37 per cent of adults older than 20 years and 51 per cent of those older than 65 have pre-diabetes.As many as one in ten people with this condition will developdiabetes within one year, depending on whether they are able to prevent insulin resistance from progressing. If insulin resistance is kept in check, pre-diabetes may never turn into diabetes. If you do not exercise or improve your diet, blood sugar levels will probably eventually rise to diabetic levels.An estimated 86 million have pre-diabetes, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2016, a nationwide study found that modest weight loss and regular exercise reduced the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes by almost 60 per cent. Metformin lowered the risk by 30 percent.The problem is that most people do not work on losing weight and they fail to stick to anexercise programme.Following a meal, insulin is released in two phases: an early burst that occurs 30 minutes after eating and a late phase that happens a half hour to two hours after a meal. Some people with pre-diabetes have trouble producing that late-phase insulin. Theres good news, however. Progression from pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes isnt inevitable.PreventionFor some people with pre-diabetes, early treatment can actually return blood glucose levels to the normal range. Research shows that you can lower your risk for Type-2 diabetes by 58% by losing 7% of your body weight. Exercising moderately 30 minutes a day, five days a week, and losing even 10 to 15 pounds can make a huge difference.SymptomsPre diabetes generally has no signs or symptoms.Routine blood glucose screening particularly Hba1c- Glycosylated hemoglobin will predict the onset of prediabetes.Family history and genetics appear to play an important role.Sedentary lifestyle contributes to Prediabetes.Risk factorsFamily history. Your risk of pre diabetes increases if you have a parent or sibling with Type-2 diabetes.Obesity, thicker waistline, which is larger than 40 inches for men and larger than 35 inches for women.Dietary patterns that are rich in carbohydrates and sedentary lifestyle.Polycystic ovary syndromeRisk of pre-diabetes increases after the age of 45.Gestational diabetes: If you developed gestational diabetes while pregnant, you and your child are at higher risk of developing prediabetes. If you gave birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms), youre also at increased risk of prediabetes.Associated conditionsHigh blood pressureLow levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,High levels of triglyceridesThe most serious consequence of pre-diabetes is progression to Type-2 diabetes.Research indicates that pre-diabetes is often associated with sudden heart attacks and can damage your kidneys, even if you havent progressed to type-2 diabetes.DiagnosisGlycated haemoglobin (A1C) test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. The test measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells (hemoglobin). The higher your blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin youll have with sugar attached. An A1C level below 5.7 per cent is considered normal and an A1C level between 5.7 and 6.4 per cent is considered pre-diabetes. An A1C level of 6.5 per cent or higher on two separate tests indicates Type 2 diabetes.(The writer is former Director Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology, former VC Bangalore University and former Chairman Karnataka State Health Commission)"

He was arrested on August 13, four days after the massive pilferage of government funds by non-governmental organisation (NGO), Srijan Vikas Sahyog Samiti, came to light.Also the father of a local JD(U) leader, Mahesh Mandal was charged for working as a conduit between banks and the NGO in siphoning off hundreds of crores of government funds over several years. He had allegedly received `3 crore as commission from Srijan over the past 10 years.Mandal died of natural causes due to the failure of his kidneys. He was also suffering from severe sugar problems. He was shifted from jail to Mayaganj Hospital when his condition deteriorated on Sunday night, said Ramanuj Kumar, jailer of Bhagalpur Central Jail.Mahesh MandalSources said Mandal had also required dialysis when he was interrogated by officials of the Economic Offences Wing of Bihar police. He was hospitalised and then arrested.Prior to his arrest, he had regularly received renal dialysis at Mumbais Hinduja Hospital. When his condition worsened in jail on Friday night, he was provided dialysis at Mayaganj Hospital and was sent back to jail on Sunday morning, said sources.He died because of deliberate negligence by the government towards his medical treatment, said his brother Dinesh Mandal.Opposition RJD leaders attacked the state government over Mahesh Mandals death, saying he could have spilled the beans of political involvement in the scam. The first death has taken place in the Srijan mega scam. One of the 13 people arrested who has died was the father of a super-rich leader of Nitish Kumars party, tweeted RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav. Opposition leader in Assembly, Tejaswi Yadav, said Mandals death occurred in a suspicious atmosphere and that the Srijan scam is bigger than Madhya Pradeshs Vyapam scam.Sources said his Mahesh Mandals son Shiv Mandal, who is a district board member in Bhagalpur and JD(U) district youth wing president, had spent huge sums of money to ensure his victory in the last civic body polls. The assembly monsoon session which began on Monday resounded with protests by the RJD, which demanded a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge."

We might consider orange juice a healthier option but 100 ml of it contains 9 gms of natural sugar. He explains, 100 ml of an aerated drink contains 10 gms of sugar. So, it is more healthy to have the fruit. You feel full after having one. For a glass of juice, they add about four oranges, increasing its sugar content.It is important to know the amount of nutrients you are consuming. Veer says Indians tend to have an unhealthy diet. Indian foods are heavy on carbohydrates and fat as there are rotis, rice and curries are made with lot of oil and butter. And, once you try them, you get addicted and it is difficult to get out of them. He says 35 per cent of his subscribers are from India. People from Mumbai and Delhi are more fitness conscious than Bengaluru, he adds.Todays youngsters want to look good and Bollywood impresses an image of that perfect body. They go to a gym but dont realise that gymming is just 20 per cent of the equation. The rest 80 per cent is food, he says adding people think it is important to consume proteins for developing muscles. It is true. They eat chicken but the meat contains fat too. Hence, it is important to eat in right amount, he adds.Veer founded The Food Analysts four months ago and has more than 60,000 subscribers from USA, UK, Middle East and India, India being the biggest market.He says, I used to spend a lot for a trainer and gym. But, I wasnt satisfied with the results. He downloaded a fitness app that tracks intake of food. I had to break down the food into its different nutrients and upload pictures and data on the app. I thought why not have someone else to do it for me, he adds. People usually click food pictures to post on Instagram, Facebook. With TFA, they can post the pictures on a WhatsApp group and get a report on the nutrients in their diet.I didnt want to inconvenience users, with downloading an app and then uploading pictures. Instead, I decided to have it on WhatsApp so they can chat like friends, he says.How the platform worksSign up on the platform, giving basic details such as weight, height, food habits and exercise routine. You can choose a monthly package or a yearly one. A registration fee of `400 per month for a year is charged. Once you register, you can start chatting with the nutritionists on WhatsApp. You can send the pictures of your food and get a report on the nutrients you have consumed. The nutritionists can also suggest a change in diet, if required and suggest the foods you should consume.How accurate is this platform?Veer Ramlugon, founder of The Food Analysts claims that they have a database of five million food items that have been tested in labs for its nutrients. The platform is 85 per cent accurate as the staff has received maximum training to detect the portion one consumes checking the size of the plate and food in the picture. Over a period of time, 15 per cent inaccuracy can be eliminated with the guidance from the nutritionists, he says adding, 10 calories can be burned easily by walking for five minutes."

When we finally arrived, we quickly realised that we were one of the only few groups of people to be there, despite it being a Saturday night.Irish Pub is quite large, and sports a rugged, vintage look. Although the interiors are are hard on the eyes, nothing exactly screams Irish about it. The music was mainly commercial tracks, which didnt seem to go with the rustic feel of the place.We began with some cocktails. The Inverted Bird, which has vodka, apple, juice, passion fruit extract and an inverted pint of beer, is quite strong with overwhelming liquory taste.If youre in the mood for something fresh and fruity, do give the French Red Head a try, which is a combination of vodka, watermelon and fresh basil. A personal favourite was the Jack Sparrow, which has a good dose of Jack Daniels, banana puree and pineapple juice. Although the combination sounds odd, this is actually a great cocktail with the perfect blend of flavours. The bar menu has a diverse set of drinks, along with all your staples.Coming to the food, we started the meal with Armagh Mushroom Bites, which were basically mini brioche buns with a creamy mushroom filling. Although tasty, it was nothing spectacular.The Mini Chicken Tacos were alright, and the taco shell was slightly stale. There were a few different kinds of fries, all of which looked appealing. We tried the Minced up Fries, that had fries topped with chicken bolognese, cheddar, boiled egg and crispy onion. This is something youd definitely want to try while drinking, although wed have liked a more amount of cheddar to cut through the strong flavour of the bolognese.We got the Sourdough Fondue Bowl next - hollow sourdough filled a three-cheese sauce, served with chargrilled broccoli, smoked sausage, grilled chicken bits and roasted sweet potato. Overall, a good dish, and the secret hero was the roasted sweet potato that went beautifully with the cheese sauce.We started our mains with the Beer Can Roast Chicken  stout flavoured grilled chicken served with roast potatoes and vegetables  and it was average, mainly due to the gamey chicken. The Portofino Grilled Fish had (slightly dry) pieces of fish with lumpy, flavourless mashed potatoes and string beans.The best part of the meal was the Irish House Burger. This tenderloin patty, topped with a jalapeno-cheese sauce, cheddar melts, a sunny-side up egg and caramelised onions served with fries and gherkins was what saved the meal for us. We also gave the Original Italian Spaghetti with prawns a try, which was a traditional tomoto, basil, garlic sauce pasta, but very on-point with the flavours.For desserts, we tried the Irish River Dance (purely for the sake of the name), for which we only had one word  overwhelming. Served in a massive beer glass, this mish-mash of brownie bits, dark chocolate, vanilla ice cream, chocolate truffles, nuts, caramel sauce and fresh lager beer - is for the one hoping to fall deep into a sugar coma. The Nutty Caramel Pie was actually quite good, as peanut butter, caramel and dark chocolate are a combination made in heaven for food.The Irish Pub in Bellandur is ideal for colleagues from the nearby offices to grab a post-work drink and snacks, because the rather unexciting food is perhaps not worth braving the journey for.Cost for two: Rs 700"

Because of her high blood-sugar level, the baby grew abnormally large and had developed a heart defect.Extra blood glucose triggers babys pancreas to make extra insulin. This causes the baby to grow abnormally, says Dr Srinivas A, consultant endocrinologist at BGS Glenseagles Global Hospital.He adds that if the mothers glucose level is in control then the weight of the baby can be managed. In one case, this was done.The diabetic mother was kept under strict dietary supervision during her pregnancy. Though it was a caesarean baby and there are chances of the baby becoming diabetic in future, his weight at the time of delivery was 3 kg, which is an average weight of an Indian baby, says Dr Srinivas.Macrosomia babies, as large babies are called, are kept in NICU for a longer period of time because the lungs are not properly developed.Doctors agree that the sedentary lifestyles of younger individuals including binging on instant-food and desk jobs are to be blamed. Dr Rashmi Yogesh, fertility consultant at Nova IVI Fertility, says that diabetes and hyper-tension are making pregnancies difficult nowadays.Though diabetes in men does not harm the baby directly, many men suffer from erectile dysfunction because of diabetes. According to Dr Rashmi Yogesh, there has been 35 per cent increase on diabetes causing pregnancy complications in the last five years.A few years ago, Type 2 Diabetes was seen in individuals above the age of 45 and now it is commonly identified in individuals in their 20s, few of whom have already developed complications such as high-blood pressure, high cholesterol, kidney damage and retina damage, says Dr Manjunath Malige, consultant endocrinologist and diabetologist at Fortis Hospital. Among the age-group, the most vulnerable ones are software engineers, bank employees and executives.Polycystic Ovary SyndromeAccording to Dr Rashmi Yogesh, diabetes in women is also caused by a hormonal disorder called the polycystic ovary syndrome which is caused by sleeping late and eating junk food. This leads to increase in weight that triggers many other complications.One and a half years ago, 28-year-old Meena (name changed), weighed 120 kgs. Her IVF pregnancy was unsuccessful because of high blood sugar. After a bariatric surgery, she conceived twins successfully. Dr Rashmi advises that losing weight before getting pregnant is the best thing to do and no amount of binging will affect the baby."

This constraint faced by young artists inspired Naveen to work on a series 81 sq ft Studio, on display at Gallery Sumukha till September 16.The display is a mix of paintings and 3D-printed sculptures, which have been fitted into Kavad boxes (an Indian traditional form of storytelling where the box unfolds, showing pictures from an episode of a story).81 sq ft Studio is after the size of his bedroom, which is 80 feet wide with a one-foot window. He says, There's only about four to six feet space left after the cupboards and cot in the room. I sometimes, roll the canvas like a scroll and work on the detailing. I saw my work in entirety only after it was displayed at the exhibition hall.The cramping in his room means he uses even the window to work, especially when he is spraying over it. The sprays have a strong smell. So, I spray keeping the canvas near the window, he says. But the small space has also worked to his advantage, he says, Naveen is able to pay closer attention to detailing in the work.Naveen says, The whole idea of this series is to speak about my studio and how I work there. I sleep, work and live in that space. Through his 3D-printed sculptures, made from recycled sugarcane fibre, he narrates stories from his life. He adds, It tackles issues such as deforestation, Nature, urbanisation and water scarcity.The exhibition has been titled Magical Stories to capture the element of surprise in life. He says things happen unexpectedly all the time. ""You close and open your eyes, and there is a new building, he says. The city's changing so fast I recently read an article that said only 12 per cent of the buildings in Bengaluru are occupied, rest are unoccupied because of high rates. Many middle-class people are unable to afford these houses because they are sold for crores of rupees.""One of his paintings on deforestation shows an elephant flying over and away from a forest, its flight a symbol of our high-handed destruction of Nature and disconnect from it. He recalls a story he heard while on a train journey: ""A man told me how his son sold their farm to build villas and sell them off. But, he couldn't sell any. Now, they have lost the land and also money, he says, adding, It got me thinking how we destroy Nature to make money.""Another painting has a bear cycling across the city, struggling to find a house. He says he was chased away several times because the owners thought their houses would be dirtied with his paints. When I look at apartments, I keep wondering why I cant afford one, says Naveen. His favourite medium is watercolour and now there is the 3D-prints. He has been working for this series for about a year, it takes about 18 to 20 hours to develop a 3D-printed sculpture.I draw the sculptures and give it to the technicians to develop the prints, he says. Naveen is also a member of Artist Pension Trust, an international organisation which screens and exhibits work of select artists, to help aging artists who may not be able to find work."

A letter was also sent to Chief Secretary, Uttar Pradesh asking to focus on major industrial districts responsible for 50 percent of pollution in the river.A drive was carried out in March-April this year to identify grossly polluting industries that dont comply with the effluent discharge norms. Eleven technical institutions like IITs, NIITs were roped in for indentifying defaulters.About 1109 such industries were identified and then based on the report, closure notice has been issued to 358 and show cause notices were issued to 180. The closure orders came after these industries failed to give a satisfactorily reply about effluent discharge in the river, said a senior official in the water resources ministry.The closure notice has been issued if industries failed to comply the norms or did not put the Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS). All polluting industries were asked to put emission monitoring system but still many have not complied with it.We have written to UP chief secretary last week that most of these polluting industries are confined in eight districts -- Kanpur, Unnao, Allahabad, Varanasi, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Meerut. If we can monitor these, it will solve nearly 50 percent pollution related problem in the river, the official said.Majority of polluting industries are cement, iron and steel, thermal power plants, sugar, tannery, distillery, fertilizers, paper and pulp and pesticides and Centre has asked Ganga states to ensure that the district and state administration play an important role in checking these polluting industries.District Ganga committees and District Magistrates must play an active role as they have the resources and manpower to check polluting industries and give feedback to NMCG to take action, the official added.The NMCG has been given powers under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act to take legal action against polluters."

(Photo | AP)DHAKA: India today sent 53 tonnes of relief materials to Bangladesh for Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, who poured into this country following the ethnic violence in the neighbouring Buddhist-majority nation.The first consignment of India's assistance comes days after Dhaka briefed New Delhi about the problems faced by it due to the influx of these refugees.Bangladesh High Commissioner in New Delhi Syed Muazzem Ali had met Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar last week and discussed the issue of Rohingyas in detail.""In response to the humanitarian crisis being faced on account of the large influx of refugees into Bangladesh, Government of India has decided to extend assistance to Bangladesh,"" External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi said in a statement.The relief material consists of items required urgently by the affected people, namely rice, pulses, sugar, salt, cooking oil, tea, ready to eat noodles, biscuits, mosquito nets etc, it said.""Operation Insaniyat:High Commission handed over 1st consignment humanitarian assistance by India to Bangladesh,"" the mission tweeted.""1st consignment of #Indian humanitarian assistance of 53 MT for #Bangladeshi arrives under Operation #Insaniyat @SushmaSwaraj,"" it said.India will provide 7,000 tonnes of relief materials to Bangladesh.Bangladeshs Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader received the materials from Indian High Commissioner Harsh Vardhan Shringla after an Indian aircraft carrying the assistance landed at southeastern port city of Chittagong.The mission said Quader likened the aid to India's assistance to Bangladesh during the 1971 Liberation War.Bangladesh, which is facing a big influx of Rohingyas from Myanmar, has called on the international community to intervene and put pressure on Myanmar to address the exodus.According to the UN estimates, over 379,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar's Rakhine state into Bangladesh since August 25 when fresh wave of violence erupted.According to media reports, the violence began when Rohingya militants attacked police posts in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state.Rohingya residents - a stateless mostly Muslim minority in a Buddhist-majority nation - allege that the military and Rakhine Buddhists responded with a brutal campaign against them, according to the reports.Bangladesh had earlier said the new influx of Rohingya refugees is an unbearable additional burden on the country which has been hosting around 400,000 Myanmar nationals who had to leave their country in the past due to communal violence and repeated military operations."

It is a duty from a Muslim brother to another to help in distress.""Bangladesh already hosted at least 300,000 Rohingya refugees in squalid camps along its border with Myanmar before this latest influx, offering sanctuary for more than three decades to civilians fleeing violence and persecution in neighbouring Rakhine State.But this fresh wave is unprecedented in its magnitude, pushing conditions at the camps to the absolute limit.Charities are warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis as Bangladesh pushes for a diplomatic solution to close the floodgates.Prices soaringAt the congested market near Kutupalong refugee camp, where children bang on the windows of passing cars pleading for food, Bangladeshis are helping out with whatever meagre resources they have.Some of these freelance relief efforts are shambolic, with tremendous crushes and children knocked down as donated supplies are tossed from moving trucks.As the crisis enters its third week, patience is also running thin among some Bangladeshis living near the border, where many earn little.Prices for food and other staples have soared in local markets, which have become choked with chronic traffic and large numbers of beggars.Kuilla Mia, a tea seller working a street corner amid a chaotic swirl of refugees, said he had nothing to spare.""I would like to give them a discount, but I cannot because the price of sugar is high,"" he told AFP.Bangladesh -- which initially ordered border guards to turn back newcomers before the effort became futile -- has been praised for taking on the burden despite its own pressing challenges as one of the region's poorest countries.The plight of the Rohingya, who are reviled and denied citizenship in Myanmar, has particularly roused emotion across the Islamic world.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina toured Kutupalong, one of the biggest camps, where she was seen consoling a young Rohingya boy.""I can't hold back the tears in eyes as I look at this scene... Why should people suffer such pain?"" she said, according to private news portal bdnews24.com.Bangladeshi authorities have said they will register all new arrivals, setting up booths in the camps to collect fingerprints and family information.Hasina wants the Rohingya returned to what she has labelled their ""ancestral homeland"" in Myanmar.""Myanmar has created the problem and it will have to resolve it,"" she told parliament on Monday.Dhaka has pointed to a deal with Yangon in 1992 that saw more than 236,000 Rohingya repatriated as ""members of Myanmar society"".Mohammad Hussain, a lentil vendor, said he was giving away what he could, but Bangladeshis alone could not be expected to care for all the refugees.""If aid doesn't arrive from abroad, then these people will be in serious danger,"" he told AFP.But for young Hassan, the experience has been moving""I feel great helping them, and I want to do more,"" he said."

Would another girl, who looks even younger, get justice after an alleged statutory rape at the hands of an older man?In their impoverished communities in Uganda, the answers hinged on the fact that one girl had a birth certificate and the other didn't. Police foiled the planned marriage after locating paperwork that proved the first girl was not 18 as her parents claimed. The other girl could not prove she was under the age of consent; her aunt, who's also her guardian, has struggled to press charges against the builder who seduced and impregnated her.""The police were asking me many questions about proof of the girl's birth date,"" said the aunt, Percy Namirembe, sitting in her tin-roofed shantytown home in Masaka near the shores of Lake Victoria in south-central Uganda. ""I don't have evidence showing the victim is not yet 18.""As Namirembe spoke, her niece sat beside her, her belly swollen and a vacant stare on her face.In the developed world, birth certificates are often a bureaucratic certainty. However, across vast swaths of Africa and South Asia, tens of millions of children never get them, with potentially dire consequences in regard to education, health care, job prospects and legal rights. Young people without IDs are vulnerable to being coerced into early marriage, military service or the labour market before the legal age. As adults, they may struggle to assert their right to vote or inherit property.""They could end up invisible,"" said Joanne Dunn, a child protection specialist with UNICEF.With support from UNICEF and various non-governmental organizations, many of the worst-affected countries have worked to improve their birth registration rates. In Uganda, volunteers go house to house in targeted villages, looking for unregistered children. Many babies are born at home, missing out on registration procedures that are being modernized at hospitals and health centers.By UNICEF's latest count, in 2013, the births of about 230 million children under age 5  35 percent of the world's total  had never been recorded. Later this year, UNICEF plans to release a new report showing that the figure has dropped to below 30 percent.India is the biggest success story. It accounted for 71 million of the unregistered children in UNICEF's 2013 report  more than half of all the Indian children in that age range. Thanks to concerted nationwide efforts, UNICEF says the number of unregistered children has dropped to 23 million  about 20 percent of all children under age 5.Uganda is a potential success story as well. UNICEF child protection officer Augustine Wassago estimates that Uganda's registration rate for children under 5 is now about 60 percent, up from 30 percent in 2011.While obtaining a birth certificate is routine for most parents in the West, it may not be a priority for African parents who worry about keeping a newborn alive and fed.Lack of registration hampers Uganda's efforts to enforce laws setting 18 as the minimum age for marriage. Child marriage remains widespread, due largely to parents hoping to get a dowry from their daughters' suitors. Even when the police are alerted, investigators face an uphill task pressing charges if they cannot prove, with a birth certificate or other official document, that the girl is a minor.But in the recent case in the Rakai administrative district, police detective Deborah Atwebembeire was able to prevail in a surprise raid on a wedding party because the bride-to-be's birth certificate proved she was 15.""When we reached there, I heard one man say, 'Ah, but the police have come. Let me hope the girl is not young,'"" Atwebembeire recalled.The girls' parents claimed she was born in March 1999, which would have made her old enough to consent. Yet only months before, the parents told birth registration officials she was born in October 2001.The wedding was called off; the parents spent a night in jail.The girl, Asimart Nakabanda, had dropped out of school before the planned marriage. ""The man is out of my mind now,"" she said. ""I want to go back to school.""The progress in India results from a decades-long initiative. Health workers, midwives, teachers and village councilors in remote areas have all been empowered to report births.Chhitaranjan Khaitan, a census official, said 15 of India's 29 states now report a 100 percent birth registration rate.An added motivation is India's effort to stem its skewed gender ratio, due largely to families' preference for sons. By requiring health workers and village officials to register all births, authorities hope fewer newborn girls will be killed by their families.Pradeep Verma, a car mechanic in the central state of Chhattisgarh, was thrilled to obtain his daughter's birth certificate earlier this year.""It was the first thing I did after my daughter was born,"" said Verma, 28. ""My parents did not register my birth. It was not considered important or necessary in those days.""Verma, who dropped out of school in 10th grade, has had repeated problems with proving his identity, particularly in getting a government ration card entitling him to cheap rice and sugar.""My daughter will not have to face such hassles,"" he said.Children in an orphanage-school in Uganda (AP)Chhattisgarh was recording just 55 percent of births in 2011. In 2013, with help from UNICEF, the state government launched a registration campaign and today it registers virtually every birth.Yet huge challenges remain for UNICEF and its partners to attain their goal of near-universal registration by 2030. In war-wracked Somalia the most recent registration rate documented by UNICEF, based on 2006 data, was 3 percent  the lowest of any nation.There's also the massive problem of children without birth certificates or other identification who comprise a significant portion of the millions of displaced people worldwide, fleeing war, famine, persecution and poverty. Birth registration can be crucial to enabling refugee children to return home or to reunite after being separated from their parents.Claudia Cappa, author of the upcoming UNICEF report, says such separations can be heartbreaking for a parent.""How can you claim your child if you don't have proof he or she really existed?"" she said."

The only thing she could do was run.She was one of the survivors, those who managed to escape the surging mudslides and floodwaters in and around Sierra Leone's capital that killed more than 300 people, many of them trapped as they slept. Another 600 people are missing, the Red Cross said Tuesday, and the death toll is expected to rise.Thousands lost their homes in the disaster, which was triggered by heavy rains.""I ran away from the house, leaving behind my family,"" a grieving Kamara told The Associated Press. ""I am the only one that has survived, as my house and dozens of others were covered with mud and boulders.""Rescuers dug with their bare hands through the thick, reddish mud to try to find any survivors in the debris of the homes. Heavy equipment was later brought in, said government spokesman Cornelius Deveaux. The military also was deployed to help.Late Tuesday, Deveaux said that 297 bodies have been recovered so far, including 109 males, 83 females and 105 children.Some bodies were swept into the sea off the coast of the West African nation and have begun washing back ashore.The mortuary of the Connaught Hospital in central Freetown was overwhelmed with the dead. More than 300 bodies of men, women and children were brought there, and many were laid out on the floor. Deveaux said an exact death toll was unknown, and many of the bodies were horribly mangled.President Ernest Bai Koroma said Sierra Leone was in a state of grief and mourning, with many survivors still in shock. He called for seven days of mourning starting on Wednesday.Radio journalist Gibril Sesay said he lost his entire family.""I am yet to grasp that I survived, and my family is gone,"" he said through sobs, unable to continue.Ahmed Sesay, caretaker of a two-story house near the Guma Valley Dam east of the capital, said he was sleeping around 6 a.m. when he felt a vibration.""It was like an earthquake. I ran out of my quarters to the gate of the compound,"" he said. ""The ground shook and I had to stay outside the compound until daybreak.""An estimated 9,000 people have been affected in some way by the disaster, said Abdul Nasir, program coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.""I have never seen anything like it,"" he said. ""A river of mud came out of nowhere and swallowed entire communities, just wiped them away. We are racing against time, more flooding and the risk of disease to help these affected communities survive and cope with their loss.""Charles Mambu, a civil society activist and resident of one affected area, Mount Sugar Loaf, said the magnitude of the destruction indicated that hundreds more people could be dead.In one sign of hope, two people were pulled alive from the debris Monday evening, Mambu said.The U.N. said it is providing emergency response assistance.Contingency plans are being put in place to try to stem the outbreak of diseases such as cholera, Deveaux told radio station FM 98.1.The bodies that have been recovered will begin to be buried in the next 48 hours, said Sulaiman Parker, environmental protection officer for the Freetown City Council.Many of the poor areas of Freetown are near sea level and have poor drainage systems, which makes flooding worse during the rainy season. The capital also is plagued by unregulated construction of large residential houses in hilltop areas.Thousands of makeshift settlements in and around the city were severely affected.""The government has been warning people not to construct houses in these areas. When they do this, there are risks,"" Nasir said. ""People don't follow the standard construction rules, and that is another reason that many of these houses have been affected.""Deforestation for firewood and charcoal is one of the leading contributors to the flooding and mudslides."

Millions of people braced for a prolonged battering that could swamp dozens of counties more than 100 miles inland.Landfall was predicted for late Friday or early Saturday between Port O'Connor and Matagorda Bay, a 30-mile (48-kilometer) stretch of coastline about 70 miles (110 kilometres) northeast of Corpus ChristiHarvey grew quickly Thursday from a tropical depression into a Category 1 hurricane. Fueled by warm Gulf of Mexico waters, it was projected to become a major Category 3 hurricane. The last storm of that category to hit the U.S. was Hurricane Wilma in October 2005 in Florida.Superstorm Sandy, which pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, never had the high winds and had lost tropical status by the time it struck. But it was devastating without formally being called a major hurricane.""We're forecasting continuing intensification right up until landfall,"" National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen said.All seven Texas counties on the coast from Corpus Christi to the western end of Galveston Island have ordered mandatory evacuations of tens of thousands of residents from all low-lying areas. In four of those counties, officials ordered their entire county evacuated and warned those who stayed behind that no one could be guaranteed rescue. Voluntary evacuations have been urged for Corpus Christi itself and for the Bolivar Peninsula, a sand spit near Galveston where many homes were washed away by the storm surge of Hurricane Ike in 2008.Texas officials expressed concern that not as many people are evacuating compared with previous storms.""A lot of people are taking this storm for granted thinking it may not pose much of a danger to them,"" Governor Greg Abbott told Houston television station KPRC. ""Please heed warnings and evacuate as soon as possible.""Abbott has activated about 700 members of the state National Guard ahead of Hurricane Harvey making landfall.As of late Thursday afternoon, Harvey was about 305 miles (490 kilometres) southeast of Corpus Christi, moving to the north-northwest at about 10 mph (17 kph). Sustained winds were clocked at 85 mph.Harvey's effect would be broad. The hurricane centre said storm surges as much as 3 feet could be expected as far north as Morgan City, Louisiana, some 400 miles away from the anticipated landfall.And once it comes ashore, the storm is expected to stall, dumping copious amounts of rain for days in areas like flood-prone Houston, the nation's fourth most-populous city, and San Antonio.State transportation officials were considering when to turn all evacuation routes from coastal areas into one-way traffic arteries headed inland. John Barton, a former deputy executive director of the Texas Department of Transportation, predicted state officials will do this before the storm hits, but said timing and determining where to use it are the key factors. Storms change paths and if contraflow starts too early, supplies such as extra gasoline needed to support impacted areas can't get in, he noted.""We are closing down,"" said Bethany Martinez, a front desk clerk at a Holiday Inn Express at Port Aransas. The 74-room hotel a couple of blocks from the Gulf of Mexico was about two-thirds full before all guests were cleared out.#Hurricane Harvey with 85 mph winds as of 7 PM CDT, still expected to become CAT 3 major hurricane before landfall along TX coast early Sat. pic.twitter.com/bPu0HiWWfM  NHC Atlantic Ops (@NHC_Atlantic) August 25, 2017This would be the first hurricane for Martinez, who is pregnant and has two boys, 5 and 6. They were with grandparents in Austin.Asked about her demeanour, she replied: ""Afraid.""Harvey would be the first significant hurricane to hit Texas since Ike in September 2008 brought winds of 110 mph (177 kph) to the Galveston and Houston areas and inflicted $22 billion in damage. It would be the first big storm along the middle Texas coast since Hurricane Claudette in 2003 caused $180 million in damage.It's taking aim at the same vicinity as Hurricane Carla, the largest Texas hurricane on record. Carla came ashore in 1961 with wind gusts estimated at 175 mph and inflicted more than $300 million in damage. The storm killed 34 people and forced about 250,000 people to evacuate.White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Donald Trump was ""briefed and will continue to be updated as the storm progresses.""In Houston, one of the nation's most flood-prone cities, Bill Pennington was philosophical as he prepared his one-story home for what he expected would be its third invasion of floodwaters in as many years and the fifth since 1983.""We know how to handle it. We'll handle it again,"" Pennington said he told his nervous 9-year-old son.Dozens were in lines early Thursday at a Corpus Christi Sam's Club, at home improvement stores and supermarkets. The city also was passing out sandbags.Alex Garcia bought bottled water, bread and other basics in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land after dropping his daughter off at college. He said grocery items were likely more available in Houston than back home in Corpus Christi, where Garcia, a beer distributor salesman, said stores were ""crazy.""""We'll be selling lots of beer,"" he laughed.Kim Fraleigh, of Sugar Land, stocked up with five cases of water, three bags of ice and other supplies at a supermarket.""We've got chips, tuna, dry salami, anything that does not require refrigeration,"" she said.Joey Garcia, director of the HEB store, said more than a semitrailer load of water was sold Wednesday, and he expected two more trailers on Thursday.In Galveston, where a 1900 hurricane went down as the worst in U.S. history, City Manager Brian Maxwell said he was anticipating street flooding and higher-than-normal tides.""Obviously being on an island, everybody around here is kind of used to it."""

Chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh shared this information with the press today. The state government has set up a corpus fund of Rs 500 crore for encouraging start-ups in the state and each proposal received under this initiative is screened at several levels before getting a final approval. As far as the investment proposals in the industry sector is concerned, after implementation of the new industrial policy, which came into effect from July last year, the state has received 493 investment proposals of which 422 proposals worth Rs 3,900 crore have been approved. During the course of the previous industrial policy (2011-16), 263 industrial units were set up, said industries principal secretary S. Siddharth, which brought investments to the tune of Rs 6,336 crore. On a query about the state government's response to the recent demands made by bodies representing industrialists regarding the new industrial policy, the chief secretary said it had been formulated after due deliberations and it would ensure entry of serious players. He also revealed that some private players had shown interest in setting up textile units in the state owing to availability of trained cheap labour and these units were likely to come up at Bhagalpur and Patna. The chief secretary, however, didn't share the details. Singh also announced the government's plan of setting up a leather park on a 10-acre plot in Muzaffarpur and steps being taken to protect the interests of the sugarcane growers as well as to promote sugarcane industry in Bihar. Minority welfare The state government will now provide funds to develop good infrastructure in the state-recognised madarsas. The decision was taken during a review meeting of the department today which was headed by chief minister Nitish Kumar. There are 2,200 madarsas in the state which would be benefited. ""This is being done for the first time in Bihar and the goal of this aim is to equip madarsas with classrooms, toilets, libraries and other facilities. The minority welfare department has been asked to work out the details after which funds will be sanctioned under this initiative,"" chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh said."

Picture by UB PhotosGuwahati, Aug. 13: Security forces have increased vigil along Assam's inter-state borders to foil any bid by militants to enter the state and carry out strikes ahead of Independence Day.Special director-general of police (law and order) Kuladhar Saikia told The Telegraph today that superintendents of police of border districts, particularly in Upper Assam bordering Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, have been asked to take all necessary measures to thwart any attempt by Ulfa (Independent) cadres to enter Assam to carry out attacks.Intelligence inputs suggest a group of Ulfa (I) cadres might try to enter the state from Arunachal and Nagaland to carry out attacks targeting security forces and oil installations in Upper Assam.""We have also alerted the citizens' committees and village defence parties to keep vigil on oil installations and bridges, among others,"" said Saikia, who reviewed the security arrangements in Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Charaideo districts on Thursday.He said apart from Upper Assam, security has been beefed up in Guwahati and lower Assam districts like Bongaigaon and Chirang where NDFB (Songbijit) has a presence.Saikia said a detailed security analysis has been conducted and reinforcements made wherever required.Ulfa (I), Manipur's CorCom and Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) of Meghalaya have given a joint call for boycott of the Independence Day celebration.Security forces fear that Ulfa (I) may team up with NSCN (Khaplang) to carry out attacks as there have been earlier instances when cadres of the two outfits have jointly targeted forces in Upper Assam.In a related development, Assam Rifles troops arrested an NSCN (Reformation) "" rajapio"" (area commander), Bokam Wangrey, from Yongchik village in Arunachal Pradesh's Changlang district last night.An AK-47 assault rifle with a magazine, 28 rounds of 7.62mm-bore rifle ammunition, 10g brown sugar, nine SIM cards and incriminating documents were recovered from him.Public relations officer (defence) Chiranjeet Konwer said, ""Based on specific inputs, Assam Rifles troops launched an operation and arrested a senior cadre of NSCN (R) faction. Security forces have also arrested an overground worker of the outfit, Raju Kumar Choudhury, during the operation.""On August 4, another NSCN (R) cadre, Jongsham Chena, was arrested from Changlang district.""The tightening of noose around the outfit by the security forces has brought much relief to local residents who were under distress because of extortion and forceful recruitment by the militant group,"" Konwer said.ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY RISHU KALANTRI IN TINSUKIA"

Telegraph picture Care and help are on way for the elderly in the state. On Tuesday, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, began training 57 youths under Shravan Kumar Yojana, a scheme it rolled out last year to create a young army of caregivers for the geriatric (elderly) population. While last year around 40 people were given a daylong training on how to take care of the elderly, AIIMS-Patna this year has decided to train young caregivers for two months before posting them in clinical departments such as medicine and surgery among others. The aim is to inculcate basic clinical skills in them to take care of the aged population. The course co-ordinator of the Shravan Kumar Yojana at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Anil Kumar, said: ""The daylong training of the youths last year could not equip them with the skill set required to take care of the elderly. Training the caregivers on how to check blood pressure, sugar level in blood among other things in a day is impossible. That is why we have extended the training period to two months. The best thing is that we will ensure they are posted in various clinical departments so that they learn the skills in a better way."" ""The idea behind giving clinical postings to the Shravan Kumars (youths trained under the Shravan Kumar Yojana scheme are basically called as Shravan Kumar by AIIMS-Patna) is that they would be able to judge the initial symptoms of various diseases and would be able to provide the basic medical aid on time which would help in saving the life of the elderly."" The doctor added: ""For example, diabetes is a very common ailment among old people. Taking too much medicine and skipping meals can cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level)."" According to the AIIMS-Patna doctors, the caregivers would be trained on how to check blood pressure, how to do use glucometer to check blood sugar, provide basic medical aid such as how to apply a bandage, push an injection and provide primary treatment in case of medical emergencies among others. AIIMS-Patna will also get a consent letter signed by the youths being trained under its Shravan Kumar Yojana. ""The consent letter would say that the youths would identify the number of elderly people in their respective communities. It would be their responsibility to take care of at least 10 to 20 elderly people from their community. We are basically training 10 and 12 passouts,"" said Anil. Those who received training under the Shravan Kumar Yojana seemed contended. Naveen Kumar Anuj, a 25-year-old from Mohanpura village in Maner block, who received training at AIIMS-Patna, said on Tuesday: ""I was inspired to take up the training programme because around two months ago, an elderly person died in my village due to high blood pressure complications. The doctor in the private hospital had told this to us where we had taken that elderly person. Then, I realised that had I known basic clinical skills, I could have extended any help to the elderly person which could save his life."""

Today, apart from the forts and ruins, some dating to the pre-Mughal period, this place is famous for one more thing  its desserts like khowa jalebis and gulab jamuns.Khowa Jalebi is a special sweet of Madhya Pradesh, locally known there as mawa jalebis.While this delicacy is made in Indore, Jabalpur and many other towns and cities, Burhanpur is one place which really prides itself for this sweet.Unlike the usual jalebis made of maida, this jalebi batter is made using a batter of khowa, and milk with a little maida just to bind it together.The prepared batter is squeezed out from a cloth into jalebi patterns and deep fried in oil to get its dark brown colour. Finally, the jalebis are immersed in sugar syrup to soak up the sweetness. The sweet can be enjoyed standalone or it can be enjoyed with milk or malai.Looking at the popularity of the dish, mithai shops from Burhanpur decided to take this sweet outside the town and set up outlets in other cities.In Mohammed Ali Road of Mumbai, a branch of a well-known jalebi shop from Burhanpur is extremely popular, especially during Ramzan.Shahjahanabad of Old Delhi is another place where this delicacy is available.In Hyderabad too, Burhanpur Khowa Jalebi, a small shop in the Old City, is exclusively selling the khowa jalebis and gulab jamuns from Burhanpur.Mohammed Dawood is the owner of Burhanpur Khoya Jalebi, an outlet opposite Mir Chowk Police Station on the Mur Alam Mandi Road. He set up the place about a decade ago when he migrated from Burhanpur where his relatives are still in the khowa jalebi business.According to him the khowa jalebis of Burhanpur stand out due to the richness of extra khoya providing the taste. The jalebi is prepared in a huge kadhai right next to the shop. It is interesting to see the colour gradually turn into brown as it is gradually fried, and a garland of jalebis being transferred from the oil to sugar syrup.Business is brisk throughout the day. People from all over the city flock to the shop and large orders are delivered regularly for various functions.The jalebis are priced at Rs 300 for a kilo. The customers seem to love the taste of the jalebis, and the sweets get sold in no time.As Mohammed, son of Dawood says about their product, Dekh ne me kaala, lekin bada dilwala  the jalebis may look black in colour but the taste touches the heart.

The second wave of floods, since July, devastated the two districts along with adjoining districts - Nagaon and Lakhimpur - claiming lives and leaving thousands homeless. In spite of the water level of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries receding in some parts, most of the places still remain submerged. The residents of the affected places are yet to return to normal life with scarcity of drinking water posing a major health hazard. Nakul Das, a resident of South Jaipur village in Gohpur sub-division, said lack of drinking water has become a cause# for concern. ""We are collecting water from miles away and boiling it for consumption,"" he said. Incessant rain, followed by floods, have contaminated most of the sources of drinking water in the flood-affected areas. General secretary of All Assam Koibatra Students' Union, Gohpur sub-division, Padma Das, said, despite all the efforts, most of the affected people were compelled to drink unsafe water as most of the shallow tubewells are still submerged. ""Water pouches are being distributed by the administration, but this measure is far short of the huge demand,"" Das said. Talking to The Telegraph, Gohpur sub-divisional officer (civil) Indranoshee Das said, ""We are providing drinking water pouches to the affected people. We have also installed over 40 shallow tubewells with hand pumps in affected areas and are trying to install more. But, this will take time because of technical problems, as the sites are still underwater."" She also said chlorine tablets and bleaching powder packets have been distributed among the affected to purify and decontaminate# water before consumption. The tablets have been distributed through relief and rescue teams among the affected people. Das also admitted that there was demand for more. Rina Das, a resident from Naduar circle of Sonitpur district, said, ""The public health engineering department supplied water packets because the sources from where we were consuming water are all submerged in floodwater. Now we are afraid of consuming water from there. Water pouches are also being distributed by the relief workers but still it is not enough."" In Naduar circle, 22 villages were affected by floods and 18 in Gohpur.

Further compensation will be given after proper assessment of the damages they have suffered. Around 7.82 lakh affected people have been evacuated to safer areas, while community kitchens are serving 3.44 lakh people. Chief minister Nitish Kumar visited Sagauli and other areas in East Champaran district on Thursday and inspected food and other relief material. He also visited the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited-run Sagauli sugar mill after flood victims complained to him that the factory discharged polluted water in the flooded area. ""More than 30 lakh families are affected by the current floods will be immediately provided Rs 6,000 each,"" said deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi. ""Adequate compensation for crops, houses, cattle and other assets will be provided after assessing the damages."" The announcement came as the overall death toll touched 379 and rescue and relief teams trawled through the waters in the affected districts for more bodies. The maximum number deaths have happened in Araria, where 80 bodies have been recovered so far, followed by 43 in Sitamarhi, 36 in West Champaran, 35 in Katihar, 25 in Madhubani and 24 in Kishanganj. Sitamarhi-based social activist, flood and environment expert Shashi Shekhar felt the state government was not being generous enough on flood relief. ""We are witnessing the worst floods in the recent decades,"" Shekhar pointed out. ""Even if we consider the average damage suffered by a family at Rs 50,000 - including various household goods, cattle and huts - the state government will need to spend Rs 15,000 crore for 30 lakh flood-affected families. If we include the damage to public infrastructure, the government will need to spend around Rs 50,000 crore to bring north Bihar back to how it was before the flood."" Shekhar also said that while building embankments on the Bagmati river in Sitamarhi, contractors dig up mud to build the embankment from the gap in between the river and the embankment just to save money. This illegal practice, he said, led to damages to the embankment during the flood season. The Bagmati and the Burhi Gandak rivers were posing serious threat to areas in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Darbhanga districts. Train services under the East Central Railway (ECR) and Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) remained disrupted and discontinued at several places. The NFR region is the worst hit as tracks and bridges have been damaged at several places in the Seemanchal region comprising Purnea, Katihar, Kishanganj and Araria districts. The NFR is yet to assess the full extent of the damage. In the ECR, which is headquartered at Hajipur and covers the maximum part of the state except the north-eastern districts, train services between Narkatiyaganj and Sagauli, Narkatiyaganj and Sitamarhi, Raxaul and Sitamarhi sections in West Champaran, East Champaran and Sitamarhi districts remain disrupted due to damages to two bridges and changes in the alignment of railway tracks due to the gushing waters. Movement of trains on the Hayaghat-Thalwara and Samastipur-Muktapur routes have been stopped due to unsafe conditions and very high level of water in the Bagmati and the Burhi Gandak. Water of the Bagmati is touching girders of the railway bridge between Hayaghat and Thalwara stations. ""Around 10km of tracks and two bridges have been damaged in the floods within our zone in Bihar,"" ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar told The Telegraph. ""We will be able to assess the damage and how long it will take to open the tracks to traffic only after the floodwaters recede and our engineers are able to reach the sites."" Rajesh added that the ECR was prepared with goods trains loaded with repair material like boulders, girders and stone dust to quickly start repair work at the places of damage once the floodwater recedes. Protests erupted in Muzaffarpur and other districts over tardy pace of relief work on Thursday. People in flood-hit Gopalganj district made former JDU MLA Manjit Singh sit on a chair in the floodwater for a few hours in protest against what they called poor relief work. Several legislators belonging to the NDA are donating money to Chief Minister's Relief Fund to tackle the floods. Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi flagged off 20 vehicles laden with relief material to Bettiah and Motihari on Thursday. Jan Adhikar Party Loktantrik national general secretary and spokesperson Premchand Singh sent relief material to Chhapra."

They eat her food,"" Sombari said, referring to her three other grandchildren. Dr Shyamlal Murmu, head of paediatrics at MGM hospital, said a healthy baby should weigh 2.5kg at birth. ""But, Bishakha's daughter weighed only 1.6kg. The baby should have been 4kg in a month had she not been malnourished (in the womb and outside it),"" the doctor said. Now, this is not a stray case. Hundreds of pregnant women and lactating mothers in East Singhbhum do receive nutrition supplement from anganwadis, but the food is mostly eaten by other members of their families. As a result, most babies are born with health complications. The Union government had in 1975 launched the concept centres under its Integrated Child Development Services to combat malnutrition in women and infants. In East Singhbhum's 11 blocks, including Jamshedpur, the district social welfare wing runs 1,722 anganwadis and over 1.5 lakh pregnant women and lactating mothers seek benefit of the programme. Each block has a child development project officer (CDPO) to monitor the anganwadis that are directly run by sevikas. In Jamshedpur block, there are 392 anganwadis - 188 in urban pockets and the rest in rural areas. The Haludbani anganwadi, of which Bishakha a beneficiary, falls under the rural division. Ranjana Mishra, former district social welfare officer and currently director of the National Employment Programme, conceded the nutrition challenge. ""Around 900gm of ready-to-eat food is provided to beneficiaries - including children aged between six months and 3.5 years who are also given soya bean apart from the rest - through anganwadis every week. But, in most cases other family members share the food and bona fide beneficiaries get to eat leftovers or nothing at all,"" Mishra said. She added: ""Sevikas can distribute food and advise beneficiaries, but they cannot go door-to-door and make pregnant women or lactating mothers eat the same. Lack of awareness and social norms come in the way of healthy babies being born."" Laxmi Bharati, incumbent district social welfare officer in East Singhbhum, said they were trying to generate awareness. ""We have begun Poshahar Week from today (Friday). Sevikas will be trained on how to convince pregnant women and lactating mothers into eating the food provided through anganwadis,"" she added. How can the reach of anganwadis be improved?

The placenta that connects him to the world is a radio, its varying frequencies taking him through an assorted spectrum. They share a unique camaraderie, like two lovers as he puts it. He browses through events and incidents, engages in heated dialogues, smiles, sings and even dances with its broadcasts. But one day his only link to the world outside gets ruptured, leaving Joseph bereft and isolated. Josephine Radio, Jayachandran Thakazhikkarans solo play, explores the situation of a man whose all lines of communication fray. His life in limbo, he walks through the thick sugarcane fields in search of a mechanic. Here the radio stands for democracy, the journey indicates rebellion and his wail points towards a brewing riot, says Jayachandran.Josephinte Radio has the arena format where the audience sit surrounding the platform. At one point Joseph ventures into the crowd while the voice of his wife booms loud, warning him about the razor-sharp leaves of his crop. Getting out in search of a mechanic means a precarious trip through the farm. But Joseph says he cant sit at home all afraid when his radio has gone silent, he says. He finds a mechanic finally who disappears with the radio asking him to wait for five minutes. Now we see Joseph who has been waiting for last five years. During this period he asks some unsettling questions which eventually gets him branded as a Maoist, he adds.Joseph says the ink mark on your forefinger is his radio and he has a right to know what happened to it. Next he transforms into the mechanic who reveals that its not his radio but the station that has gone inept. Here the playwright creates a startling analogue when the mechanic states he is planning to visit some foreign countries to study about radio stations and their functioning. After so many years of waiting he is left with the same old situation and an agitated Joseph denounces his religion as well. He doesnt want a God who cant save him, but its not an attempt to question Christianity. The lines are spoken by a disillusioned individual coming out of all religious confines, he adds. The play also examines the political correctness of a spate of things including news. Joseph thinks news is like a wild animal hunted by a pack of tigers. Once they get to it they eat all the flesh and leave the bones for others, he says.Towards the concluding portion of the play Joseph once again changes his identity, this time to a slightly feminine persona. He asks the people to start meditation with their eyes closed and concentrate on their breathing pattern. He advises them to neglect the sounds of screams, gunshots and slogans and imagine an idyllic surrounding. But Joseph breaks free from this powerless trance and urges the audience to protect democracy and its values. He asks them to open all their senses and react, he adds.Jayachandran has been staging Josephinte Radio for the last 15 years but he says the play gains new dimensions each time. There has been small alterations springing from the change in socio-political situations. Democracy in 2002 and 2017 and two different things and I have tried to sharpen my presentation accordingly. On each stage it creates a new experience in connection with the current scenario. You can watch it multiple times without feeling any monotony, he says. The play was staged at Vyloppilli Samskriti Bhavan last week."
5a1146eb9855b76bf13dee80,Kannada activism fells food scientist,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170830/jsp/nation/story_169934.jsp,2017-08-30,"Bangalore, Aug. 29: The director of a central institute credited with breakthroughs in food technology has been transferred reportedly at the behest of pro-Kannada groups for his refusal to let the campus be used for cultural events that have little to do with research. Ram Rajashekaran, the director of Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore, has been replaced after pressure from Kannada activists who sought his scalp for his alleged discrimination against the local language and culture. The change of guard is the latest instance of the Kannada campaigners having their way after Bangalore Metro was recently forced to remove Hindi signboards. The cultural activism is incongruous with the cosmopolitan and tech-friendly image associated with Bangalore but it mirrors the patronage such campaigners receive from most political parties, including the ruling Congress that has been tugging at local sentiments ahead of the Assembly elections next year. The CFTRI functions under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and is known for its research in food technology. Among its array of achievements are long-lasting high-protein processed foods that help feed survivors of natural calamities like earthquakes and floods and food-preservation packaging. The institute confirmed that the transfer order was received on August 25 and Rajashekaran has since been on medical leave but did not attribute any reason for the shift. Rajashekaran told The Telegraph he had no idea why he was transferred. ""I am still trying to understand the reason for the transfer as I haven't had time to check. I am still on medical leave,"" he said. On his run-ins with pro-Kannada activists, Rajashekaran said: ""I am sure you already know about the issues. I have nothing more to say now."" The irony is that Rajashekaran has been credited with opening up the institute to local farmers. ""All I care is he is an Indian and he did some great work. Before he took over, we farmers had no idea what the CFTRI was all about,"" Kurubur Shanta Kumar, president of Indian Sugarcane Farmers' Association, told this newspaper. ""He went out of his way to provide high-yield millet seeds that helped us increase our income as it requires very less water. I don't understand the issues as the CFTRI is a central agency free to appoint anyone in any position. The central government shouldn't have transferred him,"" he said. The director of the National Aerospace Laboratory, Jitendra Jadhav, has been asked to hold additional charge at the CFTRI until a replacement is found. Rajashekaran, who hails from Tamil Nadu and was appointed director about five years ago, had reportedly stopped a long-standing practice of allowing the in-house Kannada group to hold its cultural and literary events on the CFTRI campus. The director's stand was that the campus should not be used for any non-scientific activity. In January 2014, when Rajashekaran was just 18 months into the job, pro-Kannada activists had roughed him up and sprayed black paint on him. The self-appointed guardian of the state's language and culture, the Kannada Rakshana Vedike, was then held responsible. The outfit had termed it as a ""retaliation"" for denying permission to hold a Kannada festival on the CFTRI campus. Last month, the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), a government body assigned to safeguard the state's language, intervened. KDA chairman S.G. Siddaramiah had met Rajashekaran to ""review"" the implementation of the Kannada language in the institute. The KDA subsequently sent out a circular with a 15-day deadline to rectify the alleged lapses that included the suspension of three Kannadiga employees and remove the ""anti-Kannada"" atmosphere from the campus. One of the employees who faced disciplinary action for defying the director's orders against holding cultural events on the campus told this newspaper that the CFTRI always encouraged local events until Rajashekaran arrived. ""We have had several Tamil-speaking officials, but never had any issue. In fact, the new director is a Maharashtrian,"" said the official who now hopes to resume the activities suspended for the past five years."

5a11479f9855b76bf13deef8,Stock limit on sugar mills,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170830/jsp/business/story_169845.jsp,2017-08-30,"New Delhi, Aug. 29: The government has imposed stock limits on sugar mills to keep a check on the price of the sweetener during the festival season. Minister of consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan announced the stock limit for two months. Paswan in a tweet said, ""For keeping the prices of sugar under control during the festival months of September and October 2017, stock limits have been imposed on sugar mills."" Mills cannot hold more than 21 per cent of the total output of the current 2016-17 season in stock during September and this needs to be brought down to 8 per cent by October. The minister said there was no shortage of sugar. Monthly demand in the country is estimated to be 2-2.25 million tonnes and the demand peaks during festival months. Prices have climbed since July, despite a lower tax burden on the commodity under the new goods and services tax (GST) regime as traders delayed purchases to take the benefit of input credit. The traders had stopped buying in June and were offloading existing stocks order to take input credit under the GST, which checked supply, while creating more demand in July. Input credit allows a seller to reduce the tax burden being paid by claiming offset for the taxes already paid on inputs. Before the GST, a cess of about 6 per cent and octroi of nearly 2 per cent was charged on sugar, taking effective tax to 8 per cent. Post-GST, overall tax on sugar is only 5 per cent charged on the traders. So a fall in the tax rate should have reduced prices. Sugar prices are ruling at more than Rs 40 per kg in the Delhi retail market, while branded sugar is available at Rs 50 per kg. They have increased from the pre-GST price of about Rs 36 per kg. A section of the industry has been asking the government to reduce import duty ahead of the festive season when the consumption of the sweetener increases."
5a1147f09855b76bf13def27,Mixed Bag,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170828/jsp/opinion/story_169394.jsp,2017-08-28,"For India, a victim of repeated cross-border terrorist attacks, it is tempting to interpret Donald Trump's sharp criticism of Pakistan in his new South Asia policy as a diplomatic gain. But as with any sugar-coated pill, the true implications of Mr Trump's approach to the region will eventually depend on the complex reactions it evokes in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Given his isolationist campaign rhetoric, Mr Trump's announcement that the United States of America will continue with a military presence in Afghanistan should bring relief to India, which is worried that the Afghan State and security establishment are still too brittle to effectively withstand attacks from Pakistan-backed groups like the Taliban and the Haqqani network. That Mr Trump has deliberately stayed clear of announcing any deadlines for the withdrawal of troops is a positive for India. His demand that Pakistan must end providing safe haven to groups that then target American troops in Afghanistan also echoes India's concerns on terror outfits, which find shelter and support in the territory of its western neighbour. However, India must not miss the red flags. Mr Trump demanded that India should do more for Afghanistan as a key element of his strategy. But it is India's independent approach in Afghanistan, seen as divorced from America's war, which has won New Delhi the goodwill it enjoys there. On Pakistan, while Mr Trump was typically bombastic, his accusations were identical to those of his predecessor, Barack Obama, who used drone attacks and cuts in military aid to try and nudge Islamabad into action against militant groups. Mr Obama failed, in part because of limits to how much the US can pressurize Pakistan on which it depends for its supply routes into Afghanistan. That equation has not changed fundamentally against Pakistan. Instead, China and Russia have publicly defended Pakistan after Mr Trump's address. Many in the US are already cautioning the Donald Trump administration that more pressure on Pakistan may only push it deeper into the arms of China, already its biggest economic benefactor. Finally, neither Mr Trump nor Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, referred to Pakistan-based terror groups that target India in the litany of complaints against Islamabad on South Asia's instability. Mr Trump's priorities for the region only partly overlap with those of India. As for the rest, India's battles remain its own. To fight them successfully, its approach must remain independent too, including in Afghanistan."

Around 5,000 farmers converged at the village on Friday, sources claimed.The governments move will help only a small number of farmers while others continue to live in a state of distress.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, state president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), one of the organisations, behind the protest, said, In its election manifesto, the Congress made tall claims of waiving loans of debt-ridden farmers. The scheme that the state Cabinet has approved is a farce and mocks at farmers.The protesting organisations are BKU (Ekta Ugarahan), BKU (Dakaunda), Kirti Kisan Union, Krantikari Kisan Union, BKU (Krantikari), Kisan Sangharsh Committee (Azad), and Kisan Sangharsh Committee (Pannu).Notification covers landholdings up to 5 acresThe notification that the government has approved  the election commission of India has to approve it before it can be implemented  proposes writing-off crop loans worth Rs 2 lakh of small and marginal farmers with landholdings of up to five acres. The government will also give a relief of Rs 2 lakh to the remaining marginal farmers irrespective of the debt amount.Farmers say, only small number coveredThe governments move will help only a small number of farmers. Most others will continue to live in a state of distress, waiting for the government to waive their loans, Ugrahan said. Farmers have also demanded that the state government fix a minimum support price (MSP) for all crops as per the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee report. Other demands are that all tenants and re-claimants be given ownership rights of the land they are cultivating, permanent arrangement of the stray and wild animals be made and adequate arrangement for disposal of paddy straw.State president of BKU (Dakaunda), Buta Singh Burjgill, said farmers had no option, but to burn paddy straw unless and until the government provides monetary assistance to handle crop residues.Organisations are demanding Rs 200 per quintal of paddy yield for handling straw without burning it. The state agriculture department is only concentrating on issuing diktats to us to use to combines having Super Straw Management System (SMS) with self-propelled combine harvesters, Burjgill added.Heavy security coverEven as the protest has been allowed, heavy security arrangements have been put in place to maintain law and order. Special check-posts have been set up on roads leading to Patiala from the protest venue to restrict movement of farmers towards the city.Though we are allotted protest site in the wilderness, but we will ensure that our voices be heard in residence of Captain Amarinder Singh at Patiala, Ugrahan added.Farm loan waiver process to start by Monday: ManpreetFaridkot The Punjab government will start its farmer loan waiver process in the state by Monday, state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal has said. Addressing a gathering on the annual Baba Farid Mela in Faridkot on Friday, Manpreet added that the government also wanted to give sugarcane farmers their due as the waiver will start from Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Ferozepur and Fazilka.The state government has prepared a notification that cannot be issued until the election commission of India clears it, as the code of conduct is in place with the Gurdaspur bypoll scheduled for October 11.Send children to school, even if you forego a mealSpeaking at the inaugural session of the 50th Kisan Mela of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, he said, farmers should rather forego a meal than not send their children to school.The state government has prepared a notification that cannot be issued until the EC clears it, as code of conduct is in place due to the Gurdaspur bypoll.Education will open floodgates of opportunities for your children in diverse fields apart from agriculture, he said, adding, farmers must skip one meal to educate their wards.The real development, he said, is not in terms of silver roads and golden walls, but in income enhancement, and a happy and respectable life.Punjab may progress, but if its farmers are not happy, then state can never be happy, he observed. The state has made substantial contribution in 70 years, but now farmers need to shift from paddy-wheat cycle to alternate crops, he added."

Picture by Ngangbam Indrakanta Singh Imphal, Sept. 5: Youths in Manipur are giving north Indian vendors a run for their money by attracting food lovers with their locally flavoured pani puri. Under the umbrella of Kanglei Economic Development Organisation (Kedo), a self-employed group based in Imphal, these youths are raking in a profit of Rs 24,000 per month by selling the savoury snack. At least three street vendors were seen selling pani puri at Khwairamband bazar in the heart of Imphal. They attract a large crowd in the afternoons and evenings. ""If we remain idle, we will face serious problems one day,"" Oinam Shantikumar, one of the three vendors, told The Telegraph . ""I sell between 3pm and 8pm every day and make a profit of Rs 800 per day."" ""I don't feel shy to be a vendor. I want to live with dignity, working in whatever trade suits me. Remaining shy will worsen our lives,"" said Shantikumar, who is also the publicity secretary of Kedo. Kedo was established on April 20, 2007, in Imphal with the motive to uplift the economy of the state by inculcating work culture and encouraging use of local products. The organisation has around 100 volunteers working in and around Imphal. They are engaged in various activities like selling tea, sugarcane juice, ice cream, milk, kerosene, edible oil, distribution of food products and working as night watchmen at Khwairamband Ima market. They also supply drinking water in the market. They have also opened a few salons in the city and are earning a good income. ""If the youths in the state follow Kedo's example, Manipur will prosper,"" said a pani puri customer. The members also carry out cleanliness drives in the city at regular intervals. They have also taken up a vegetable farming project at Irang Ahum Fangba at Lilong Arapti. Some have already started door-to-door vegetable supply. For this, the department of horticulture and soil conservation donated cycle rickshaws to them on October 14 last year. On Kedo's 10th foundation day celebrations on May 1, minister Th. Shyamkumar handed a four-wheeler to a member, Thokchom Sanathoi, which is being used to distribute drinking water. Parliamentary secretary L. Susindro Meitei has also assured them of a loan of Rs 20,000 each to Kedo workers in collaboration with Bandhan Bank. There are around 7.01 lakh jobless youths in the state with a population of 27.21 lakh. Vendors from outside the state have been selling the snacks, also called gol gappa, which is a favourite of the people here. President of the organisation Soibam Maniton said, ""If we inculcate work culture, there are many ways to earn. People of the state have been depending on outsiders for such 'low profile' jobs and that could be the reason of the high rate of influx. If we serve ourselves, we can contribute to the economy."""
5a114b379855b76bf13df179,Set your date with payasams,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/aug/30/set-your-date-with-payasams-1649824.html,2017-08-30,"KOCHI: Nothing can beat the sweet delicacies that payasams in Kerala are world famous for. And there is no Onam which is complete without it. So says Santhosh Thirumeni, of Thirumenis caterers, who has introduced his own line of Kappa (tapioca) payasams at the Ernakulathappan ground in Kochi this season.It is important that one selects the right tapioca if the payasam has to be a good one. Especially, avoid those tapiocas which have absorbed large quantities of water, said Santhosh.This time, he is also selling the apple payasam variety, made from fresh apples. We buy apples in bulk and grind them in the mixie. The essence is then added to jaggery, with helpful spoons of sugar, he said.Paalada payasamHowever, despite the city folks affinity to variety, the paalada still remains No. 1 in Kochi. People like sugar-sweetened delicacies better than jaggery dishes. It is something they have been accustomed and what caterers have been providing for a long time, said R Viswanath, of Kailasam caterers in Irumpanam, Kochi.And unlike what most families are accustomed to, the Paalada is cooked for five-and-a-half hours at a stretch. Many families cook paalada at their homes, but they are all made from instant cook mixes which can be prepared in half an hour. However, we prepare the ada from rice and wheat which is washed and then cut into small pieces. It is then dried in banana leaves, which is later put into the milk and cooked for five and a half hours, said Santhosh.However, none of the payasam sellers has stuck to the paalada despite its demand. There is a niche group of people who always come asking for the Amballapuzha paalpayasam, which is why we are selling it this time. I still remember how there was a time when this payasam was made from the fresh milk of cows in temples, immediately after it was milked. The speciality of the paalpayasam is that it is cooked in milk alone, said Viswanath.Towards central and southern Kerala, the peoples preference for items with Kadala parippu and cashew nut varieties are stronger. This is why people in Thiruvananthapuram would prefer an adapradhaman, which has a rich helping of cashew nuts and resins. Also, semiya paalpayasam has many takers, said Vishwanath.In many places in Kerala, jackfruit payasam is a variety many are experimenting with. Caterer H M Rafeeque says he is introducing the jaggery and sugar-coconut milk mixes for his jackfruit payasam. The payasam is made using both koozha and varikka jackfruits, he said.Pazzham payasamsKrishna Iyer of Akshaya caterers, Tripunithura said they stick to selling parippu, paalada, pazham and gothambu payasams alone for Onam. I think people equate the paalada with icecream, says Krishna, with a laugh. For the pazham payasam, Nethran bananas are used. We buy at least 1 and a half tonnes of 15-20 day ripe bananas, if the payasams have to taste sweet, he said.Nimy Sunil Kumar, a culinary expert, said that despite the many varieties that have been introduced over the decades, the latest being dates, pumpkins and carrots, nothing can beat the traditional savour of the payasams made exclusively from rice. The payasams (made with jaggery and only rice) were offerings made to the gods in the past. Today, it is the only sweet Malayalees are famous for, she said."

Bengal gram is not part of kootu curry, but a rather uncustomary uzhunnu vada is. Coconut in sambar? You ought to be kidding. No, parippu is not a side dish as we start our sadya with that, a generous dash of ghee over the canary-yellow curry. And when it comes to payasam, its the thick-dark ada pradhaman, not the overly-sweet palada.Served on a long plantain leaf, the traditional Onam spread is a delectable assortment of tastes and flavours. However, this festive fare is not the same across the state and in Thiruvananthapuram it comes with a distinctive Travancore twist.In Kochi, however, you see slight variations of the Travancore Onasadhya. For example, if the parippu curry is poured over the rice in the capital, in Ernakulam, it is served as a thick gravy with additional butter. Every district has a variation in their food and this is the same for the Onasadhya. While in Ernakulam, mangoes are used to make avial more sour, in Kottayam and other districts, yogurt is used, said Saji Alex, chef de cuisine, Cassava restaurant, Mariott Hotel.There are varieties also in the way payasams are served. For example, in Thiruvananthapuram, the payasam is served with a bolly and extra sugar, while in Ernakulam, payasam is able to stand on its own.Tamil Nadu influenceThiruvananthapuram has a strong Tamil population and you will see a slight influence of their cuisine in our sadya, says Hari S, a culinary enthusiast. He adds, Its just like the slang, subtle and unique. Though we all speak Malayalam, the local parlance of a place will be different. So our erissery or olan will not be the same you get in Kochi or Kannur, he explains.Vada kootu curry is one exclusive dish you find in the local spread, a signature item in the multi-dish sadya. You will not find vada kootu curry in any other place including the nearest locations like Kollam. Outsiders often think that its made of regular uzhunnu vadas. Actually we prepare small globs using the same batter and add them to this potato-onion masala. The small vadas will suck up all gravy giving you a scrumptious, almost-dry curry, says Swapna Rakesh, culinary expert and blogger.In her blog swadcuisine.com she explains how to prepare all traditional sadya items in the authentic style. She says parippu, one important part of southern sadya, goes missing in many parts of Kerala.For us one pradhaman, ada or pazham, is mandatory and if there is pal payasam it is always served with boli, she adds. Another dish you may across in the local spread is chakka kootu curry, the jackfruit delicacy seen as part of sadya in some areas of Thiruvananthapuram. Its made of half-ripe jackfruit. Its not a typical sadya item, but a dish thats usually made as part of the meals just like aviyal and thoran, says Radhamma, homemaker.Small limes are not used for pickle as this time its naranga curry made of big, wild lemons. We use this variety called vadukanpuli naranga for sadya. Its less tangy and more sour compared to your regular lime pickle. And then, the ingredients we use for avial are also different giving it a special tint and taste, says Jayalakshmi, a caterer.In the capital you cant imagine a sadya that comes with any non-veg accompaniment. In Malabar it may be customary to celebrate Onam with a non-veg sadya. But here its always a pure vegetarian spread and I believe that Onasadya is to be relished that way only, says Geetha, a retired school teacher."

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, Sept. 7: Balu Bazar Durga Puja Committee president S.N. Sangneria bears a grudge against the municipal corporation. At a time when the Mamata Banerjee government is providing Rs 2 lakh to all registered clubs and Durga Puja committees in Calcutta, authorities here are reluctant to extend even minimum support to such initiatives, said Sangneria. Whether government fund should be utilised for religious festival may be debatable, but the Cuttack Municipal Corporation is allegedly at fault and that has angered Puja committees. The civic body has allegedly failed to refund the security deposits collected from Puja committees while allowing them to build makeshift pandals and gates for the Durga Puja last year. Sangneria's grudge and that of many other Puja organisers sums up the issue. ""Earlier, the Puja committees used to get sugar and kerosene under a Durga Puja quota by the government. But for years, it has been stopped. And now, they are not even refunding the security deposits."" ""It is unfortunate that the civic body's failure to update the refund process has prompted Puja committees to question the rationale of the collecting security money again,"" he said. Over 50 per cent of the Puja committees have not got back their security deposits, corporation officials conceded on condition of anonymity. This has led to a piquant situation as the organisers have questioned the rationale for collecting deposits this year without refunding the amount collected last year. In 2000, Orissa High Court had banned digging up of roads in the city without prior approval of the corporation. The court had empowered the civic body to collect security money for giving permission to dig up roads and collect necessary funds for their restoration. The corporation had, however, started the practice of collecting security deposits from the Puja committees in 2010. According to the norms, the committees deposit Rs 10,000 while seeking permission from the corporation before Durga Puja to set up the temporary structures and are expected to repair and restore the damage caused to the roads for refund of the security deposit. The civic body has a squad consisting of officials of the engineering section to assess the damage caused to roads near the mandaps after the Durga Puja. A clearance certificate from the squad is necessary for refund. In cases where roads are not repaired or restored, the civic body attends to the damage and deducts the expenditure from the security money of the concerned Puja committee. Municipal commissioner Bikash Mohapatra said: ""We have decided not to collect security money this year from the Puja committees, who have not been refunded the amount. But this will be done only if they had repaired and restored roads damaged during the Durga Puja last year."" Explaining the reason for the money lying with the civic body, Mohapatra said: ""The refund was not possible as most of the Puja committees did not apply for it along with statement of road repair and restoration undertaken."" However, Cuttack Mahanagar Shanti Committee president Debendra Kumar Sahu said: ""The matter has already been taken up with the corporation for an amicable settlement."""
5a114c629855b76bf13df266,Farmers rue flood damage dole,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170908/jsp/bihar/story_171431.jsp,2017-09-08,"Farmers try to salvage crops damaged by floods in Laukariya panchayat in Raxaul. Picture by Jai Prakash Preliminary estimates suggest standing crops spread over 8 lakh hectares were damaged in this year's floods in Bihar. The figure assumes significance as the floods have, so far, hit only about half of the 38 districts in Bihar where kharif crops were sown in over 39 lakh hectares. Of the total sown area, paddy had been sown in over 34 lakh hectares, of which standing crops were damaged on 6.67 lakh hectares. According to early estimates made by the agriculture department, maize crop standing on 42.2 thousand hectares and sugarcane on 67.8 thousand hectares were damaged. If one divides the damaged crops in terms of irrigated and unirrigated fields, official figures say, of the total 8,10,453 hectares hit by the floods, 6,95,937 hectares were irrigated land and 46,675 hectares unirrigated. Also, standing crop of sugarcane on 67,840 hectares got damaged. This segregation of crops in terms of irrigated and unirrigated land assumes significance as the government would provide compensation to farmers on the basis of this categorisation. According to norms, a compensation of Rs 13,500 per hectare (upper limit 2 hectare for an individual) is provided for irrigated land for seasonal crops like paddy, maize and vegetables and in case of unirrigated land for seasonal crops the compensation rate for damaged crops is Rs 6,800 per hectare (upper limit being 2 hectares for an individual). In case of annual crops like sugarcane, banana, mango etc, the compensation is paid at the rate of Rs 18,000 per hectare. ""Based on preliminary estimates, we have asked the Centre for a compensation of Rs 1093.36 crore for farmers,"" agriculture minister Prem Kumar said. The minister also said he had asked department officials to keep close tabs on the ground and do extensive survey of areas from where floodwaters had receded so that the estimate of damage could be updated accordingly. ""The department has also set up a disaster management cell for collecting damage reports from the districts,"" Kumar said. Though the department is working fast to assess the damage caused to the agriculture sector, farmers feel the compensation offered by the government was not adequate to compensate the losses they suffered because of the floods. ""On an average, one produces around 40 to 50 quintals of paddy on one hectare, which would fetch around Rs 50,000. The state government would offer just Rs 13,500 in case of irrigated land and Rs 6,800 in case of unirrigated land, which is not sufficient anyhow,"" said Bhola Prasad Yadav, a farmer from Parihar in Sitamarhi district. Chandra Vijay Kumar of Banjariya in East Champaran district echoed the views of the Sitamarhi farmer and demanded the government review its compensation policy. Officials in the agriculture department, however, maintained that the department was seized of the farmers' concerns and special steps would be taken to ensure farmers don't suffer much at the end of the kharif cropping season. ""The cash compensation is just one of the steps we are taking and it aims to compensate farmers for their input costs. Once the floodwaters recede, the department would launch a special drive for alternative farming in the remaining months of the kharif season and seeds would be provided to farmers for this purpose,"" a senior official of the agriculture department said. The official pointed out that department minister Prem Kumar had already issued a directive in this regard and officials concerned had started working out the details of alternative farming which would be suggested to the farmers. The agriculture department has also come out with specially designed booklets, which would be circulated in flood-hit areas, which has suggestions for farmers in case of partial damage to their crops and alternative crops which farmers could go for in the remaining period of the cropping season. The department has also come up with a helpline, 0612-2217103, and a toll free number, 18001801551, on which farmers could share their problems and seek the advice of agriculture experts."

Picture by Gautam Dey Jamshedpur, Sept. 5: Jharkhand woke up to a stifling weather this morning, with home ACs running at full blast and thirsty commuters helping juice vendors do brisk business, as the monsoon trough shifted north to stall the shower show in most parts of the state. Weathermen said two weakening cyclonic circulations were pushing up day temperatures and raising the discomfort index, and that this rain-less phase would last for another 72 hours. Jharkhand today also lost the surplus tag in the absence of rainfall in the past 24 hours. Against a normal of 899.1mm, the state so far received 877.9mm, a deficit of two per cent. July and August had ended with surplus rain. ""The monsoon trough (a broad area of low atmospheric pressure running east to west through the tropics between June and September) had shifted towards the Himalayan foothills. Two cyclonic systems over northeast Bay of Bengal and Gangetic Bengal have also become weak. The weather will be primarily dry this week,"" said Upendra Srivastava of Ranchi Meteorological Centre. Bistupur homemaker Ragini Singh observed that September was feeling like May. ""It is hot like peak summer."" Agreed Sakchi resident Gurpreet Singh. ""We have rarely switched off the AC in the past two days,"" she said. Rohini Singh, a homemaker in Ranchi's Lalpur who was out to buy her monthly grocery this afternoon, said she had to gulp down two glasses of sugarcane juice. ""The sun was a scorcher today. It barely felt like the rainy season. The city was like a sauna,"" she added. ""I felt dizzy riding my bike around noon. Waiting at traffic lights was difficult in the heat and humidity,"" said Raj Mishra, a student of Marwari College in the capital, after he settled for a glass of lassi near Plaza Cinema. Met data suggest that daytime readings in most parts of the state have recorded a steady climb in the past two days. The local weather office in Jamshedpur today read 36C, four notches above normal. Despite its altitude advantage, the IMD observatory in Ranchi too recorded around 33C, two notches above normal. Palamau headquarters Daltonganj grappled with around 34C for the second consecutive day today. The reading is two degrees above the normal. Maximum temperatures also witnessed a rise in places like Deoghar, Giridih, Dhanbad, Bokaro, Dumka, Sahebganj, Gumla and Hazaribagh. Increasing temperatures, coupled with high relative humidity, jacked up the discomfort index in most parts of the state, with the average being a punishing 63 degrees, eight notches above normal. While the discomfort index in Jamshedpur was 63 degrees, Ranchi recorded of 60 degrees, five notches above normal. In places like Daltonganj, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Deoghar and Hazaribagh, the index stayed between 60 and 65 degrees. The Regional Meteorological Centre in Alipore, Calcutta, too has predicted a brief lull in rainfall. ""We don't see possibilities of heavy or even moderate showers in the next three days as the monsoon trough has shifted north. However, a few districts, particularly those in the hilly terrain, may witness scattered rainfall,"" said a duty officer."

The minister chaired a review meeting of the department in which he directed officials concerned to complete the crop damage assessment at the earliest. The floods damaged standing crops spread over 8,10,453 hectares of agriculture fields in 216 blocks spread over 19 districts of Bihar. Of the total affected agriculture fields, 6,95,937 hectares were irrigated land and 46,675 hectares were not irrigated. The floods also damaged standing crop of sugarcane spread over 67,840 hectares. ""Our field personnel, including block agriculture officers, have been directed to complete the crop damage assessment at the earliest and around 70 per cent of the work has been done. Only in those areas, which are still under water, the work has not been completed,"" the minister said. He added that after completion of the assessment work, the crop damage compensation funds would be disbursed among affected farmers. ""We hope to deliver the compensation money latest in a month's time,"" added Kumar. According to the norms, a compensation of Rs 13,500 per hectare (upper limit 2 hectares for an individual) is provided for irrigated land for seasonal crops such as paddy, maize and vegetables and in case of unirrigated land for seasonal crops the compensation rate for damaged crops is Rs 6,800 per hectare (upper limit being 2 hectares for an individual). In case of annual crops such as sugarcane, banana, mango, etc, the compensation is paid at the rate of Rs 18,000 per hectare. The compensation is paid only if the extent of damage is more than 33 per cent of the total crop. Bihar has demanded a fund of Rs 1,093.36 crore from the Centre under the crop compensation head. The fund would be released after a visit of the central team to the state. The team is likely to visit the state towards the end of this month or in the first fortnight of October. Farmers, however, are apprehensive. ""There have been occasions in the past when the officials expect some kind of palm-greasing from farmers for making a favourable report. The department should take steps to put a check on such practices if it really intends to help farmers,"" said Santosh Paswan, a farmer from Janerwa in East Champaran. The minister said those facing such a problem should inform the state headquarters using the department helpline number 06122217103. He said a probe would be instituted in all such complaints and action would be taken in case the field official is found to be indulging in such practices."
5a1153919855b76bf13df784,Operation Insaniyat and refugee flip-flop,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170915/jsp/nation/story_173351.jsp,2017-09-15,"Rohingya refugees stretch their hands to receive aid distributed by local organisations at Balukhali makeshift refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, on Thursday. (Reuters) New Delhi, Sept. 14: India today declared plans to fly in food and mosquito nets to help Bangladesh handle an influx of close to 400,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar even as New Delhi moved closer to deporting forced migrants from that community in Indian territory. The relief operation, titled ""Operation Insaniyat"", kicked off with multiple air force planes landing in Dhaka with 53,000kg of food - rice, pulses, sugar, salt, cooking oil, tea and ready-to-eat noodles. But in the evening, the Narendra Modi government tied itself in knots through a flip-flop over a petition it is required to submit to the Supreme Court, which is hearing arguments against India's plans to deport the Rohingya refugees. A draft of that petition appeared to justify the community's eviction on the ground that they represent a security threat. The home ministry subsequently claimed that the petition wasn't official. Senior diplomats confirmed to The Telegraph that the foreign ministry had communicated concerns to the Prime Minister's Office after reports of the draft petition emerged in the evening amid worries about uncomfortable questions it would spark. But the diplomats conceded that the flip-flop over the draft petition on a day India tried to project its humanitarian side underscored the fissures within the government on the Rohingya crisis. Today's consignment was part of a total of 7 million kilos of food, apart from thousands of mosquito nets that India has promised to Bangladesh, after intense pressure from Dhaka. ""We appreciate the actions of the government of Bangladesh in making every effort to deal with the urgent requirements of food, clothing and shelter for the large number of refugees that have placed a huge demand on its resources,"" Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Harsh Shringla said at Dhaka airport when the first IAF plane landed. ""It is in this context that the government of India, in consultation with the government of Bangladesh, has decided to provide urgent humanitarian assistance to support the efforts of Bangladesh."" But that projection - of gratitude towards Bangladesh and of humanitarian assistance to a community - was undermined by the draft petition that portrayed the refugees as potential terrorist recruits, the diplomats said. Bangladesh, one foreign ministry official argued, could then legitimately ask India why those that are a security threat to New Delhi wouldn't also be a concern for Dhaka. The supplies India is sending will be moved to an enclave that Bangladesh has created along its border with Myanmar's Rakhine state - the province from where most Rohingya refugees have fled following clashes involving security forces. The Indian supplies to Bangladesh follow pressure from Dhaka on New Delhi, which has muddied its own position on the Rohingya crisis through repeated confusing signals. At the heart of those mixed signals lies a divide within the government over priorities while handling the crisis. While the security establishment - the home ministry and intelligence agencies - have sought to unambiguously argue for the deportation of 40,000 Rohingya refugees in India, the foreign office has prodded the Prime Minister towards a more nuanced position. India, the foreign ministry is arguing, should quietly press Myanmar to adopt recommendations of a panel headed by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan on giving Rohingyas greater rights. But the home ministry has publicly stated it has plans to deport the refugees, while Modi praised Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi's handling of the crisis during a visit there earlier this month. Amid pressure from Dhaka, the foreign ministry issued a statement asking Myanmar to show ""restraint and maturity"" and prepared to launch the relief assistance. In the meantime, the home ministry drafted the petition."

The doctors said there is significant evidence that the reversal of diabetes is now ""clearly attainable"" for some, possibly many, but most patients and doctors remain oblivious to these developments and still consider the diagnosis of diabetes a permanent label. Well-designed, diet-based strategies have been shown to lead to rapid and substantial weight loss and get patients to maintain a 12kg to 15kg weight loss for periods of a year and sustain it beyond, the doctors said, citing studies in the UK#conducted over the past five years. ""It is not easy to achieve this, but every person diagnosed with diabetes should get a chance to try it,"" Mike Lean, professor of human nutrition at the University of Glasgow who is involved in such weight loss studies told The Telegraph over telephone. ""Unfortunately, most patients and many doctors still misleadingly view diabetes as an irreversible condition. A lot of people are being misled into believing that once they've been diagnosed with diabetes, they'll remain diabetic forever."" Lean and his colleagues are questioning a core concept in diabetes management which currently is focused entirely on controlling blood sugar through a mix of drugs and lifestyle management to avoid complications - cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage, vision problems, among others. The researchers, in a commentary published today in the British Medical Journal, said the scale of the diabetes market is illustrated by the existence of 488 drugs, excluding insulin, currently licensed worldwide for diabetes. They all lower blood glucose, but no trials have examined the drugs combined with diet and weight loss. Studies by Lean's collaborator and co-author Roy Taylor at the University of Newcastle have since 2011 shown that weight loss of about 15kg can produce ""total biochemical remission"" of diabetes and restore adequate functioning of insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas. ""There is sufficient evidence now to show that such remission can be achieved through general practice settings - without hospital admissions,"" Lean said. ""What it does require is professional diet and nutrition advice and a well-structured regimen to achieve and sustain the weight loss."" Doctors in India who are already encouraging patients with pre-diabetes - a precursor to diabetes - to adopt diet and lifestyle modifications to reverse their condition and prevent diabetes say the British findings are encouraging and warrant exploration in India. ""We should attempt major weight loss to reverse diabetes in any such patients - our recent diet studies involving high protein and low carbohydrate content have shown encouraging results,"" said Anoop Misra, the chairman of the New Delhi-based Fortis Centre for Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol. Doctors caution that the weight-loss strategy may not work for diabetes patients who already have a low body mass index (BMI) - a measure of body fat calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in metres. Weight loss is unlikely to help patients with low muscle mass. ""Most Indians with diabetes are likely to have BMI above 23 or so. They would probably be better with BMI of about 20 - that means losing eight to 10 kilograms, permanently,"" said Lean who is set to start a study involving Indian-origin and Pakistani-origin people in the UK. However, maintaining the loss of even 10kg may pose a challenge to most patients. ""The human brain is programmed to eat more - people tend to eat beyond their hunger levels. It is difficult for people to stick to low calorie diet for long periods of time and this makes most people to regain the lost weight within years,"" said Satinath Mukhopadhyay, an endocrinologist at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, Calcutta. Achieving remission will help patients avoid the complications of diabetes that are expensive to treat and, at times, life-threatening. Across populations, remission will mean savings in national health expenditures, the researchers said, calling for a global consensus for guidelines to document remission of diabetes. ""The economic burden on diabetes patients and their households can be considerable,"" Parikshit Gogate, a Pune-based ophthalmologist who had three years ago estimated the costs diabetes can impose on patients, calculating that medicines make up more than half the cost, surgery for complications 12 per cent. Doctors say the treatment of serious complications of poorly-controlled diabetes - ranging from heart disease to kidney failure to eye damage -could cost tens of thousands to lakhs of rupees. The World Health Organisation has estimated through health surveys that India had about 60 million patients with diabetes in 2015. The Glasgow-Newcastle team has proposed two normal blood sugar test results at least two months apart and annual reviews of glycosylated haemoglobin - a biomarker of long-term sugar levels - which may be used to detect and confirm remission of diabetes. Taylor and his colleagues had two years ago disclosed at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association that an extremely low calorie diet can help patients with diabetes remove fat in the pancreas and allow restoration of normal insulin secretion. In their clinical trial, 11 diabetes patients were prescribed an extreme diet of 600 calories a day consisting of liquid diet drinks plus 200 calories of non-starchy vegetables. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed the pancreas lost fat and the patients achieved blood sugar control. Blood sugar levels were normal within a week."

He said if the Akalis left money in the exchequer, the Congress government would have done more for the farmers.The Congress candidate for the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha by-poll further ridiculed Sukhbir for holding a Jabr Virodhi rally in Gurdaspur on Wednesday especially after destroying the state law and order.Despite their best efforts to put up a united front, there are fissures between SAD and BJP, neither of which understands the pulse of the people, said Jakhar.The absence of former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal from Sukhbirs rally shows that the latter has taken control of SAD, Jakhar said.The Congress government has transformed things for the better within six months, said Jakhar, pointing out the farm loan waiver and abolition of truck unions, as achievements of the current regime.Besides revival of Punjab Roadways and increase in the Gurdaspur sugar mill capacity, Jakhar promised that he will fight with the Centre for change in policy enabling industrial development and employment generation in state. He said that the central government failed to release (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee) MNREGA Act wages for the past six months.Jakhar vowed to take up the 32,000 crore food grain scam issue and bring every paisa of the state money. Pointing out that the central government had taken 1 lakh crore loan from Japan at 0.1% interest while charging 8.5% interest on loan from Punjab, Jakhar said Aarhitya ta BJP government bani baithi hai (The BJP government has become the biggest arthiyas for farmers)."

Balakrishnan and Justices R.V. Raveendran and Dalveer Bhandari decided to hear the petition, filed by advocate Z.K. Faizan, after it was mentioned on Tuesday for early listing.The petition sought a direction to the Election Commission not to permit the MPs and MLAs, numbering about 200, to cast their votes from prison.The petitioner referred to the discussion between Parliamentary Affairs Minister Priyaranjan Dasmunsi and Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami on arrangements for the MPs and MLAs in prison to vote under special circumstances. The petition mentioned, among others, Mohd. Shahabuddin, Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, Umakant Yadav, Mukhtar Ansari, Amarmani Tripathi, Anand Sen Yadav and Akhilesh Kumar Singh.Section 62(5) of the Representation of the People Act says no person shall vote at any election if he/[she] is confined in a prison, whether under a sentence of imprisonment or transportation or otherwise or is in lawful custody of the police.Since the provision was intended to prevent criminalisation of politics in elections, it would be applicable to the Presidential polls too, the petitioner said. The court, however, declined to give an urgent hearing to another advocate Manohar Lal Sharma, who appealed against the Election Commission order declining to go into allegations against the UPA-Left Presidential nominee Pratibha Patil. It would be heard in the normal course on August 17. The Commission declined to go into his representation on the question whether she is an undischarged insolvent or not in view of irregularities allegedly committed by her and her family members in a cooperative bank and a sugar mill in Maharashtra."

More so, if it is complemented with staple diet and half-an-hour physical exercises, medicos told the public, at the mega cardiac alert 2007 on Monday.The health check-up, organised by the Rajah Muthiah Heart Foundation of the Annamalai University, would be held for ten days.The camp, with a registration fee depending upon the packages, would witness heart check-ups for people above 45 and those who are prone to cardiac diseases. It would be followed-up with medical counselling with cardiologists.Inaugurating the camp, the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Ashok Kumar Das said that over 10 per cent of a familys income in the country was being spent on healthcare, but still the focus had been only on curative rather than preventive measures. Despite the increasing awareness level among the public, the proportionate increase in the sedentary lifestyle has worsened the health scenario. In his presidential address, the former president of State unit of Indian Medical Association, M.S. Ashraf, described the sedentary lifestyle, smoking, stress and sugar as culprits of cardiac disease.Over five-crore people in India were diabetic and many were getting into the threshold of diabetes, which was the gateway to heart diseases, Dr. Ashraf said.The Chairman of Kaveri Medical Centres Heart City, M. Chenniappan, urged the public to stay away from fat-rich foods and have a check on obesity.Fat gets accumulated in abdomen over a period of time, indicating the mounting cholesterol in heart channels, he said.The camp could be extended to 20 days, depending on the response, the special officer for the camp G.

GanesanFarmers are hopeful of a good samba seasonTIRUCHI: Farmers representatives of Tiruchi district have welcomed the Governments decision to open the Mettur reservoir on Wednesday.Though the district farmers have effectively lost the kuruvai crop, they are hopeful of a good samba season given the good inflow into Mettur. Samba is the main season for the district farmers. The normal area of paddy coverage under samba in the district is about 53,000 hectares (ha), while kuruvai is normally cultivate in just about 8,500 ha.Though the Agriculture Department had scaled up the target for kuruvai coverage to 10,000 ha for the district this year, farmers in most parts of the district could not take up cultivation owing to the delay in the release of water from Mettur. Kuruvai paddy was cultivated only in some filter-point areas of Anbil belt.However, the Governments decision to advance the opening of Mettur reservoir, against the previously announced date of July 25, has come as a huge relief for farmers in the district, especially those in Lalgudi areas where there has been a sharp drop in the ground water table.The release of water from Wednesday is definitely a welcome move. We were worried about the water table going further down over the next 10 days, said G.Kanagasabai, president of the District Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.Though kuruvai has been lost, we could now go ahead with samba cultivation confidently, he said and added that farmers are likely to commence preparatory works over the next few days.The Adi pattam is the right time for farmers to begin the farm operations.We hope to raise nurseries within the next 15 days, said R.Subramanian, Deputy Secretary of the association.The desilting of some of the major irrigation channels would benefit farmers of the district, he said.However, he insisted that water should be released continuously in all the 17 irrigation channels without resorting to turn system.C.Masilamani of the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), also welcomed the decision and said the move would benefit farmers all over the district. Farmers said the release of the water would also benefit sugarcane and banana growers too.Some of them expressed concern over the anticipated last minute mad rush for mining sand from the Cauvery bed, which has become a usual phenomenon in recent years when thousands of lorries converge on the river to carry sand before the water reached here."

The two groups had merged on August 21.Formation of the probe panel, however, failed to dissuade the opposition from targeting the government. The main opposition DMK reiterated its demand for a CBI probe into the death, while the others wonder why treatment were not arranged at her residence itself.The BJPs state unit president Tamilisai Soundarrajan questioned how the sugar levels of the chief minister went so high, asking who were treating her before she was taken to the hospital.Why her health condition was not monitored? Even a day before she was hospitalised, when she inaugurated the metro rail, I found her to be very alert, Soundararajan said questioning as to Why an ambulance needed to be called and was not kept stationary at the CMs residence?Precious time might have been lost because of this, she said.But it was DMK working president MK Stalin launching a scathing attack on the government said a CBI probe was needed to unearth the mystery surrounding the former chief ministers death as the people in very high places needed to be examined and their numbers to are large.A probe by a retired judge may not be able to ferret out the entire truth and unravel the mystery surrounding her death as many leaders needed to be questioned, Stalin said adding that union ministers, AIIMS doctors, the doctor from London and the state acting governor C Vidyasagar Rao needed to be questioned to find the truth.Only an impartial CBI probe can bring out the truth and bring to book those guilty, Stalin said.DMK president M Karunanidhi had, long before Jayalalithaa was hospitalised, demanded a white paper on the health of the chief minister asserting that she was a public servant and that the people had the right to know about their chief ministers health condition.The AIADMK came down heavily on Karunanidhi for the demand.State Congress chief S Thirunavukkarasar too felt that the current probe ordered by the government may fail to unravel the whole truth. It was said that Jayalalithaa held a meeting with senior officials when she was hospitalized, so all the officials must be questioned, he said.VCK leader Thol Thirumavalanan said that Jayalalithaas death was shrouded in mystery as every AIADMK leader was telling the people that she was recovering.Many VIPs visited her at the hospital and according to reports no one could meet her. Stalin too had visited her at the Apollo Hospital, where she was admitted, but was not allowed to meet her.The central government too had a lot to answer on this issue, the VCK leader said.Jayalalithaa died on December 5 last year."

The decline, though marginal, raises fears of increase in food prices because it comes at a time when the economy is under strain.Experts said the decline in production would lead to greater farmer distress which had led to a string of farm loan waivers by individual states.Till last week, the ministry had maintained production would be closer to last years production for the season and had set a target of 137 MT.The estimates show a decline of nearly 10% in kharif oilseeds and roughly 4% in coarse cereals. At the same time, production of sugar cane is pegged at 337.69 MT significantly higher than last years output of 306.72 million tones.The production of most of the crops is estimated to be higher as compared to their average production of the last five years, a ministry official said.Official sources also said rice production for the season is estimated at 94.48 MT, nearly 2 MT below last years figures while the total production of coarse cereals is expected to go down from 32.71 MT during the 2016-17 kharif cycle to 31.49 MT. Ministry sources said the decline will not lead to food security concerns due to the available buffer stocks.This is not unexpected. We had drought in many rain-fed areas, Siraj Hussain, former secretary agriculture told HT. The riddle, however, is that even the expectation of lower production has not led to increase in prices.That, he added, signals lower domestic demand and a shortage of cash in rural areas."

As it is very fine, it can settle in the lungs and worsen asthma and other respiratory problems.Auto exhaust pollutants that include sulphur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), diesel and sulphate particulates, hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and volatile organic compounds such as benzene in the air can cause heart diseases. In the past two decades, the numbers of patients in the city are increasing mainly because of poor air quality, said BK Rajora, chief medical officer, Civil Hospital, Gurgaon.Doctors were of the opinion that air pollution clubbed with lifestyle disorders are the reason that more young people are complaining of heart issues.Dr. DK Jhamb, director & HOD,cCardiology, Paras Hospitals Gurgaon, said, I have been attending to 40 to 50 heart patients on a daily basis. It has been observed that air pollution is significantly worsening cardiovascular health as has been reported in recent studies. Particulate matter and nitrogen oxides have long-term adverse effects on your heart. Along with other lifestyle factors, pollution is now believed to be playing a significant role in causing heart diseases.While pollution extends its fangs to the heart directly, factors such as obesity, blood sugar levels, lack of physical activity and hypertension continue to put the human heart at risk.Long commuting time, in addition to stressful sedentary working hours, are leaving people with less time for rest and healthy activities. Inactive lifestyle increases the incidence of developing obesity, high blood pressure, cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, stress levels and all these cause various heart diseases. They increase the chances of getting a heart attack, said Dr Sanjat Chiwane, heart specialist, interventional cardiologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon.Doctors advised people to have an active lifestyle with plenty of exercise and fresh air, followed by healthy dietary habits, which includes avoiding food with high fat, sugar and salt content. They have also advised increasing intake of vegetables, fruits and fibre in the daily diet.Lifestyle modifications such as regular blood pressure monitoring, maintaining cholesterol levels, diabetes, non-smoking, weight management and regular exercises can contribute to a healthy heart, Dr Sanjeev Chaudhary, director cardiology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said.Steps to be taken for healthy heart 30 minutes of activity a day can help prevent heart attacks and stroke Strength and stretching exercises are best for overall stamina and flexibility Reducing stress  do meditation/yoga If one stops smoking, the risk for coronary heart disease is reduced by half Learn how to swap unhealthy food with healthier alternatives Keeping a healthy weight and limiting your salt intake to control blood pressure Make sure that your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels are checked regularly and maintained within the normal range Increase intake of food such as green vegetables, fruits, grain/cereals, polyunsaturated oils such as mustard, olive, fish/seafood, blueberries, legumes, flax seeds and green tea."

It has been ranging around 145 Million Units to 152 MU for the last 10 days, with the increase in the demand mainly coming from the agriculture sector.As there has been no significant rainfall during the period except for some scattered showers till July 13, the farming community has been left with no choice but to utilise groundwater in the north and central parts of Telangana to meet the moisture stress being faced by standing crops such as cotton, maize, paddy, turmeric, sugarcane and others. The crops cultivated in the ongoing kharif season so far are in the vegetative and growth stages.In the absence of any significant precipitation since June-end, the crops taken up with the help of early monsoon rains are facing moisture stress in some pockets and they are being given periodical wetting to keep their growth healthy, a senior official in the plant protection cell of the Agriculture Department said. Had there been a couple of good rains in between the dry spell, there would not have been any need for wetting such crops. The dry spell has brought down the number of mandals with excessive rainfall, over 20% above the normal, from 411 out of 568 mandals in rural districts till June 30 to 235 till July 13.Energy demandAccording to the officials of power utilities, consumption of energy by the farm sector has gone up mostly in Mancherial, Nizamabad, Medak, Kumram Bheem-Asifabad, Nirmal, Jagtial and a few other districts. As a result, the energy demand, which dropped below to 133 MU on June 6 slipped further to 120 MU on June 11, remained below 135 MU till June 29. It has started increasing from June 30 and crossed 140 MU on July 3 and 150 MU on July 10, the officials explained. As the paddy nurseries raised early are reaching the transplantation stage in most parts of the State, the demand for energy is likely to increase further in the coming days, if monsoon continues to play truant since the nurseries and transplanted crop will require periodic wetting, the plant protection wing official explained. Cultivation of crops in the ongoing kharif season has crossed over 53% of the normal extent with cotton leading the table covering about one-third of the sown area. Against the normal extent of 43.24 lakh hectares for the season, sowing has been done in about 23 lakh hectares, including cotton, in about 14.5 lakh hectares already.Worrisome scenario118 mandals in districts except Hyderabad record rainfall deficit ranging from 20% to 59%.Nizamabad has 16 mandals out of 27 with deficit rainfall followed by 11 of 18 in Mancherial, 10 of 18 in Jagtial, 9 of 15 in Kumram Bheem and 8 of 20 in Medak.Six mandals have scanty rainfall with deficit ranging from 60% to 99% compared to normal."

He said the members instead of discussing the issue over the distribution of house sites to the poor and downtrodden they were more interested in taking up discussion on the Chief Ministers lands and other issues.Discussions in the Assembly should be on the welfare of the people and public issues and should give confidence to the poor. Unfortunately the debates and discussions in the House were becoming useless to the common people.Later in the meeting of the party representatives the BJP leaders criticised that the TRS and the Congress stating that they deceived the Telangana people in the name of bifurcation of the State.They reiterated that their party would support the Bill on Telangana if moved by the Congress in the Parliament.The meeting unanimously passed resolutions demanding remunerative prices to turmeric and sugarcane farmers and payment of arrears to the cane growers by the sugar factories.Former Minister D.K.

Sowing is likely to pick up during this month and August.Official sources told The Hindu here on Tuesday that sowing of kharif crops has been completed in 34 lakh hectares. The percentage was slightly lower than the previous years which was 36.32 lakh hectares during the same period.The sources said that up to July 9 the State had received a cumulative rainfall of 368 mm against a normal rainfall of 262 mm, from June 1.As many as 151 taluks had received excessive and more than normal rainfall, while 25 taluks received less than normal and deficit rainfall. There was scanty rainfall in only two taluks.Sowing of cereals has been completed in 13.64 lakh hectares against the target of 35.30 lakh hectares this year. The shortfall would be made good during this month and August when sowing and transplantation of paddy would be taken up in the irrigated areas in full swing.Similarly, there was time for sowing maize and ragi and in all probability, it would go past the target of 35.30 lakh hectares fixed for cereals this year.The sources said that sowing of pulses during the kharif season this year has been good and as against the target of 14.33 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in more than 8.25 lakh hectares.It is expected that the area under pulses would exceed the target fixed for this year.The increase in the area under black gram, green gram and red gram this year should send some good news to the State which had been witnessing a steady decline in the production of pulses.As against a target of 5.67 lakh hectares fixed for red gram this year, farmers have completed sowing operations in 2.63 lakh hectares. Sowing of red gram is taken up till the first week of August.However, an area of concern is the falling percentage of oilseeds coverage in the State in the past few years. The trend has continued this year also.As against the target of 17.99 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed only in 7.07 lakh hectares. The shortage is 1.64 lakh hectares than last years coverage during the same period.Among oilseeds, groundnut continues to lose its position as a major oilseed and is being slowly replaced by sunflower.As against 8.37 lakh hectares target fixed for groundnut, sowing has been completed in 2.07 lakh hectares. In the normal course, by this time sowing should have been completed in 4.33 lakh hectares. Last year, sowing was completed in 2.27 lakh hectares. The area under sesamum and castor is also going down sharply.Among the cash crops, including cotton, sugarcane and tobacco, sowing has been completed in 5.04 lakh hectares as against the target of 19,000 hectares. While sowing of cotton has been completed in 1.52 lakh hectares, sugarcane has been completed in 2.70 lakh hectares.Tobacco has been taken up in 81,000 hectares. Among horticulture crops, with an area of 1.76 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in 10,914 hectares."

I was very young, about their age, she said, turning her eyes to a group of school girls walking down the Collectorate road. She is in her late 40s now.Sitting in a tarpaulin-protected hut on that road side, she prepares and sells jonna rottelu every evening. Her husband, who lost his arm in an accident, cannot do much work. He only hands over the wrapped rotis to customers. An agri-labour family during the day, the couple serve the many diabetic patients in the area and are making a living through these millet flatbreads. A two-kg preparation makes about 30 rotis and leaves me a profit of Rs. 200 after meeting all the costs. The dough ball is flattened using fingers and flipped on the tawa with bare hands, often burning the fingers and leaving the palms hard. Neither my wife nor I will be able to make them. It demands skill and patience, Rajesh, a customer said. Town-dwellers, on a diabetic wake-up call, are increasingly taking to whole jowar, which was, till recently, labelled as peasant or tribal diet. There are about 30 women with small tables and a wood stove, or sitting in their roti hut hand-tapping the dough balls flat.In December 2016, 1002 people in the district had Diabetes-II. Since then the figures almost doubled in a span of three months to 1972 people in March this year. According to Dr. Sudhir G. Walde at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru, jowar is preferred for its increased starch digestibility over longer time. Amylose to amylopectin ratio (the two glucose components of starch) of jowar is different from wheat. The slower release of sugar (glucose) from the food into the bloodstream renders the blood sugar levels stable, he explained.I had rice, I had chapati, and I tried jonna rottelu. The difference was clear. I feel lighter and my mornings are happier, Ramchander Reddy, who is diabetic, said.

Bangarraju, Regional Director, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Hyderabad.At a press conference here on Tuesday, he said, already two such power plants were functioning in Vijayawada and Hyderabad and another 17 plants were proposed in various towns.Twin usesHe said the economic viability study was in progress and a decision would be taken shortly. Pointing out that the power plants would serve the two-fold purpose of solving the piling up garbage problem and also the power shortage problem.While solid waste would be utilised as fuel for the power plants, the remaining would be disposed of under scientific land-filling from which biogases could be produced. A few more mini-power plants were also planned as sugar co-generation units utilising bagasse.Mr. Bangarraju said that the government would extend subsidy to all the units based on non-conventional energy sources. He said three sugar co-generation mini-power units would be coming up shortly at three places in the district  Prattipadu, Tuni and Rajanagaram.He said that the present sugar co-generation plants capacity in the State was 250 MW and the government proposed to increase it to another 300 MW within next three years. He claimed that Andhra Pradesh toped the country in biomass power generation and also in usage of biogases as alternative fuels.The Godavari Fertilisers and Chemicals unit in Kakinada, he said, was having the countrys largest solar heater water system of 1,10,000 litres capacity, supplying boiler feed water.G. Satyanarayana, District Manager, said that as many as 18,490 biogas plants and 68,298 smokeless chullahs were installed in East Godavari district till March-end and a majority of them were functioning efficiently.Painting contestHe said painting competitions would be conducted on renewable energy sources for students at the mandal level from July 20 to 23 and the winners would be allowed to participate at the district level competitions on July 25.The first three winners at the district level would receive prizes from the Chief Minister in Hyderabad."

A higher crop output is anticipated following increased sowing of rice and pulses when compared with the last season.The latest Union Agriculture department data showed that across the country, kharif crops have been planted on 563.17 lakh hectares till now, as against 521.80 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year.Increase in acreageWith the sowing of crops apace during the past few days across the country, paddy (rice) has been sown in 125.77 lakh hectares in the current season till July 14, which is marginally higher than the 120.32 lakh hectares recorded in the 2016-17 season. The acreage under pulses has been recorded at 74.61 lakh hectares till now, as against the 60.28 lakh hectares of the corresponding period for the last season.The sowing of coarse cereals is up as well, at 113.06 lakh hectares against the 98.79 lakh hectares of last year. But the total oilseeds sown has come down to 103.92 lakh hectares, when compared with 115.75 lakh hectares of last year.Cotton acreage is up this season at 90.88 lakh hectares, against 73.93 lakh hectares last year in the corresponding period. Sugarcane, too, continues to see an increase in acreage and has been planted in 47.94 lakh hectares against the 45.22 lakh hectares last year. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), conditions are favourable for further advancement of the monsoon and overall rainfall activity is likely to be above normal over the next two weeks, from July 13 to July 26.Conditions favourableSowing of kharif crops has gained momentum during the past few days as the monsoon is progressing well. Paddy transplanting, though, has been a bit sluggish in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but it is likely to pick up in the coming days. Sowing of pulses is apace in the key growing states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, which is an encouraging sign, Anand Sharma, regional co-ordinator of the IMDs agricultural meteorology told, The Hindu .Apart from western parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the monsoon rains have covered most parts of the country, he added. The monsoon rain delivers about 70% of Indias annual rainfall and is critical for millions of farmers as nearly half the countrys farmland lacks irrigation and is dependent on rain."

The tank presents an ideal place for morning walk. As the tank is situated amidst busy residential areas, it is accessible to many people. About 700 men and women come regularly for a walk making the tank surroundings buzz with activity. But they face their share of problems too.Health campsOngole walkers club was formed with few members 10 years ago. It has been growing in strength year after year. When it became unwieldy with 1,000 members, about 250 women members got themselves separated forming Vanita walkers club three years ago. Both the clubs work in coordination to take up several activities. They conduct health camps every month in which blood sugar is tested free of cost and diabetic patients are given medicines for one month. Cardiologists, dentists and ENT specialists are invited to conduct free check up for the members.The walkers club formed an executive committee with 28 members and Municipal Commissioner as honorary chairperson. Association president, Ramesh, said that though the tank bund presents a idyllic place for walking, it is ill maintained causing problems to the walkers. There is wild growth of bushes and snakes cause scare among the walkers. The bund is strewn with pebbles which pose problems to the walkers.Though they prune the bushes, they grow up in no time. He requested the municipal officials to maintain the bund properly for the convenience of large number of walkers.Yet another strange problem confronts the walkers. While the committee decided that all the members should go round the tank in clock wise direction, some members wilfully defy the regulation causing inconvenience to others, mostly women members. They cite some superstitions to go round in anti-clock wise direction.InconvenienceUnable to put up with the inconvenience some women were forced to discontinue the walk at their favourite haunt.Mr. Ramesh expressed helplessness as the committee has no authority to enforce its decision. He wanted the municipal officials to take some initiative and enforce such guidelines for the convenience of the walkers at large.Similarly, as some people resort to open defecation on the northern side of the tank, it posed problems to walkers. He wanted the municipal officials to raise the height of the wall or fence off the surrounding area to put an end to the menace.He expressed happiness that Ongole is endowed with such a nice place for morning walk and appealed to the municipal officials to maintain it properly."
5a1265c59855b76bf13e0218,Where religion blends with real estate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/where-religion-blends-with-real-estate/article19287653.ece,2017-07-16,"Chairs are being laid out and banners and buntings line the way, as Ariel University (in picture) prepares for graduation ceremonies on its campus, which houses about 15,000 students. But for students, a degree from the university could become damaged goods, as movements to boycott factories, vineyards, and schools built on Jewish settlements in the West Bank grow. Since 2010, Israeli activists have held an academic boycott of Ariel U, with about 165 professors and researchers refusing to teach or attend seminars there, and dozens of artistes refusing to perform at its cultural centre.Ariel is the largest of all settlements. After the (1973) Yom Kippur war, it was felt that Israel must strengthen its security across its narrow shoulders, said Yigal Cohen-Orgad, Chancellor, who helped found Ariel in the early-1980s. Today, Ariel and other West Bank settlements represent some of the major stumbling blocks to the two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. About 4,00,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank, which is home to 2.8 million Palestinians. Mr. Orgad, who, as a member of the Zionist Betar Youth Movement and then as a soldier in the Six-Day War (1967) and the Yom Kippur War, has spent a lifetime fighting for the Jewish state, laughed at the suggestion that Ariel would ever move, or that the move for an academic boycott of the University would deter them. These are the thoughts of peace prophets, the octogenarian said. We have suffered and gone wrong at the hands of these peace prophets, referring to the Israeli settlements withdrawal from the Sinai in 1982, and then from Gaza in 2005.In another part of Ariel is the Achva Halva factory. Halva is a West Asian version of Indian Halwa, made with a sesame sauce base and mixed with sugar and nuts. But mixed in the sweetness is the bitterness that it is produced on occupied land. In 2005, several rights groups and NGOs began a boycott of all Israeli businesses that operate from settlements and areas that Israel controls but arent recognised by the UN, called the BDS movement (Boycott, Divestment, Sanction).The BDS movement has grown since then, with many international governments and NGOs proffering support. Several companies inside the settlements, including Achva that found its Halva offloaded from a European airlines menu last year, are feeling the pinch. In 2015, the EU also okayed the process of separate labels for Israeli products made in the settlements, and the pressure has forced a few businesses like the SodaStream factory in Maale Adumim outside Jerusalem to move into Israeli territory.Violent flashpointsThe borders of places like Ariel and other settlements, including in East Jerusalem, are increasingly violent flashpoints, and frequent stabbing attacks by Palestinians result in crackdowns on Palestinian areas by Israeli forces, setting off a cycle of violence. There is also the threat of violence from the settlers themselves. In February, police had to grapple with thousands of protesters as they carried out a court order to demolish the Amona outpost settlement, about 50 km south of Ariel. Jews dont evict Jews, the settlers chanted as they clashed with police.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces a tough balancing act, with demands for more protection for settlements from within his own Likud Party and the international community demanding that the growth of illegal settlements be curbed. In a country where religion and real estate blend into an explosive mix, it will be these very flanks that could be the most combustible for anyone speaking of a resolution or a lasting peace.Several rights groups and NGOs run a campaign to boycott all Israeli businesses that operate from settlements and areas that Israel controls but arent recognised by the UN"

Swaminathan said, The effect of increased temperature on crop yield is real. In the late 1980s we found that when the temperature increases by 1 - 1.5 C the duration of the crop reduces by one month. Since the duration reduces, the yield drops by 300-400 kg.Tamma A. Carleton from the University of California, Berkeley and the author of the paper, tested the link between climate change, crop yields and suicide by comparing the number of suicides across India between 1967 and 2013 with crop yield and climate data. Data on suicides were collected from the National Crime Records Bureau.An additional burdenShe found crop losses due to heat damage cause additional burden on farming households and this at times leads to suicides.Dr. Carleton found suicides reported when a single days temperature increased by 1C only during the crop growing season. Similar increase in temperature during other seasons did not result in a rise in suicides.Crop yield data from 13 States from 1956 to 2000 were compared with climate change data. Dr. Carleton found annual yield falling when the temperature was above 20C during the crop-growing season.An increase in rainfall by 1 cm during the growing season leads to a decrease of about 0.8 deaths per 100,000, thus lowering the suicide rate by 7% on average, she writes.The effect of climate variation reveals that past growing season temperature strongly influences suicide rates in the following years up to about five years.For instance, when there is abundant rainfall during one growing season, the suicide rates dip for the next two or three years. Drought apparently does not seem to have any effect on suicide rates, the researcher found.The study says South India, which is generally hotter, has higher farmer suicide rates.Comparing the yields to growing season temperature for 13 States, the author found that States where the yields are more affected by high temperatures are also the States which report higher suicide rates. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh not only show severe suicide responses to temperature but crop yield is also more negatively affected by higher temperature.The study did not find any adaptive behaviour to prevent suicides in response to climate change.Weak studies in IndiaWe must undertake anticipatory research using genetic checkmating for potential changes in climate such as changes in precipitation, and temperature. I dont think we have done such research as seriously as we should have, says Prof. Swaminathan. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are the most vulnerable regions and we would be the most affected.Indias average temperature is expected to increase by 3C by 2050."

He is always available to those who are willing to learn the skills he had acquired over the years from many well-known masters in Kanniyakumari district. In return, he accepts no money as fee.Before breathing his last, my master Chellaiah Asan from Thuckalay told me that I should teach the art to anyone who is interested. He also elicited a promise that I should not collect money for teaching the art. My wife sometimes says I should charge at least a nominal fee. But I cannot afford to violate the promise I made to my teacher, said Shenbgalingam Asan, who ekes out a living by working as a water pump operator in a local college. He is awaiting a government pension.He is so popular that even a child in Rajakkamangalam, a small town in Kanniyakumari district, knows the name of Shenbagalingam Asan. Hailing from Thekkurichi village, he first learnt silambam from Venkatachalam of Alathankaram, whom he called Annachi (elder brother).He told me that I should further improve my skills by learning from others. Fortunately for me, Minnal Thiraviam, an outstanding teacher of silambam and other martial arts, settled in my village. He shaped me well, recalled Shenbagalingam Asan, who is also adept at using his hand to ward off attackers with lethal weapons.Later he learnt from Stunt Thiraviam of Pattasalianvilai, Narayanan Asan of Moolachi and Chellaiah Asan.Martial arts as a form was once confined to the soldiers of the Travancore Army and reached others when Veluthampi Thalavai recruited a lot of people. That explains the presence of many martial arts masters in Kanniyakumari districts, explained Shenbagalingam Asan, who recommends a sweet made of palm sugar, rice, dried ginger and fenugreek to keep fit.On those who had learnt the art and then used it to intimidate others, he said everything depended on the mindset of the individual.We normally avoid such elements. If you acquire complete knowledge of the art, you will not waste your skills in creating nuisance for others. Never in my life have I hit anyone and have not been hit by anyone either. I have never stepped into a police station, laughed Asan."

Instructions, commands and cuss words fly thick and fast in Tamil, Rajasthani, Bengali, Malayalam and Telugu as specialised workers team up to execute various tasks.Every year, we begin work on Sarva Ekadasi (May 21 this year), which is three months before Vinayaka Chaturthi (August 25). The chief artist, C. Rajendran, who has been responsible for the appearance of Ganesh idol here for the past 30 years, brings a number of drawings and we choose one of them for the year, said G. Sandeep Raj, convenor, who has been part of the annual event for the past 40 years.First installed in 1954 by S. Shankaraiah at the same locality, the Ganesh idol grew in size to reach a mammoth 60 feet in 2015. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) asked the organisers to scale down the idol and the size has been shrinking ever since.Next year, we will have a 59-feet idol as many people want the idol to be grand. We have been carrying on this event with collections from Hundi. And if people want a taller Ganesh, we cannot ignore their wish, said Mr. Raj.With many firsts to its credit, this year the Ganesh idol will have a plaster of paris (gypsum) laddoo instead of the traditional edible one made of chickpea flour and sugar. We were getting Tappeswaram laddoo sent by Mallibabu, but this year, we will have a PoP laddoo and devotees can bring their laddoos and keep them near the idol which will be distributed later, said S. Raj Kumar."

However, there was disinflation in the food basket.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis points to 6%.Separately, skyrocketing tomato prices propelled inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% in July from 0.9% in June, with the food category overall contributing significantly to the uptick in WPI terms.Inflation in the food segment of the primary articles category in July came in at 2.15%, snapping a two-month contraction. Within this, the fruits and vegetables segment contributed the most, with inflation coming in at 29%.Seasonal, temporaryTomatoes witnessed blistering inflation of more than 209% in July, compared with a contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Brinjal, too, witnessed a sharp acceleration in inflation to 21.1% in July, from the previous months contraction of 3.1%. Okra ( Bhindi ) saw inflation at 32.4%.What we have to recognise is that these are seasonal influences and are therefore temporary in nature, D.K. Srivastava, chief policy advisor at EY India, said. We must look at core WPI inflation and see if there are any factors pushing it up. Otherwise, this increase will subside shortly. As far as fuel is concerned, there has not been any significant movement in crude oil prices, so that wouldnt put any pressure in either direction, Mr. Srivastava said.The index for Food Articles group rose by 6.2%... due to higher price of fruits and vegetables (29%), peas/chawali (6%), ragi (4%) and condiments & spices, barley, poultry chicken and paddy (1% each), the government said in its release. Inflation in the minerals segment of the primary articles category accelerated to 24.8% in July from a contraction of 2.02% while manufactured products saw a marginally lower 2.18% compared with Junes 2.27%, marking the sixth month of slowing inflation in the segment.Wholesale-based prices have edged up in the month of July on back of sharp increase noted in vegetable prices, Pankaj Patel, president, FICCI, said in an email.However, the broad conditions for agri prices remain conducive.( With inputs from Sharad Raghavan in New Delhi )"

The meeting resolved to ensure that the grand procession on September 5 would commence early in the morning so that the entire immersion programme could be completed on the same day without spilling over to the next day.The government, according to them, was focused on ensuring foolproof arrangements since the Ganesh festival would coincide with Bakrid on September 2. In all, 160 cranes would be put in place on the main procession day while arrangements had been made for a couple of dozens more as and when required. Given the vulnerable stretch on the NTR Marg where an old water connection had caved in previously, the meeting decided to restrict the movement of heavy vehicles on the road and divert them to Tank Bund instead.Start earlyThe Minister said the Utsav Committee and other organisations had agreed to extend full cooperation for an early start of the procession and sought the governments help in positioning the required number of vehicles, a day in advance. In addition, they wanted the government to ensure that there was continuous supply of drinking water besides availability of sugar and other commodities through the public distribution system.Mr. Mahender Reddy said the police had decided to utilise technology for geotagging all the pandals while the station house officers would be made responsible for coordinating with the organisers of the pandals in their respective jurisdictions.Applications for putting up pandals were available online and the interested organisers could download the applications and submit them to the officials concerned for obtaining permissions."

The court also said it would be ""completely difficult"" to control what a passenger intakes before entering the airport or after passing through security check. ""The petition has no merits,"" the bench said.The non-profit company, India Awake for Transparency, had in its plea claimed there was no point in prohibiting serving of alcohol on domestic flights if passengers were free to drink or purchase it from the bars or liquor outlets in the airport terminal. It had contended that as per aviation rules, the reason for non-serving of alcohol on domestic flights was to prevent drunken behaviour by passengers.The petitioner company had claimed the ban was brought into force after an airline had started serving alcohol on its domestic flights which led to several unsavoury incidents."

Deceptive clouds and dying water bodies have turned the once bountiful and lush districts of the Cauvery Basin and north Karnataka into parched lands, making it virtually impossible for farmers to grow a water-guzzling crop like sugarcane. Production is down by as much as 50%, say farmers and government estimates; crushing factories are mostly idle and prices in the wholesale market are likely to rise by at least Rs 10 a kilo.Sitting at a tea stall just outside Nelamane village in Pandavapura, 50-year-old Kasturi says: ""Siddaramegowda (chief minister Siddaramaiah) doesn't like the people of Mandya, just as (for mer CM) Devraj Urs didn't. Urs had once said that he would see to it that the farmers of Mandya sow horsegram. Siddaramaiah is making sure that happens.""Kasturi, who owns about 1.5 acres of land and mainly grows sugarcane, recollected Urs' statement made during one of his election campaigns decades ago to suggest that the neglect of Mandya was breaking the back of its once prosperous farmers, forcing them to give up cash crops like sugarcane and rice.It takes at least 25,000 litres of water to grow one tonne of sugarcane. Planting takes place in July-August and the cane is ready for crushing in about 12 months. While the average expected sugarcane production in the state is 420 lakh tonnes a year, this year, the figure is likely to drop to just 180 lakh tonne - a dip of 57% - according to the agriculture department.The situation in Mandya is grim -its canals resemble those in drought-prone north Karnataka. While monsoon has failed for the third con secutive year, other failures have been years in the making. Encroachment of catchment areas has put additional stress on the Cauvery and its tributaries. Overexploitation of groundwater continues as farmers have only borewells to turn to. There is not one government to blame; successive governments have presided over the deterioration over the years.Shambunahalli Suresh of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha says: ""There has been no yield in the past three years and this year offers no hope either. We used to grow nearly 5 lakh tonne of sugarcane earlier, now, that has come down by 40% to 50%."" Suresh pointed out that all 126 lakes in the district were dry and farmers were sinking borewells as deep as 1,200ft to 1,400ft. Joint director (agriculture) M N Rajasulochana said sugarcane cultivation was reduced this year, and worse, the situation was equally worrisome in neighbouring Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of All India Sugarcane Growers' Association, says: ""Lack of rain and water and increasing debts have made sugarcane less lucrative.It is called a cash crop but all the farmers growing it are cash-starved. Production in the Cauvery Basin and central Karnataka (Davanagere) has dipped by about 50%.""Sugarcane cultivation has also been hit in the north and Hyderabad Karnataka region -Belagavi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Bidar and Kalaburagi.Venkataram Reddy Patil, joint director (agriculture) in Belagavi said the government's target cultivation area had reduced in the past two years to just about 1.65 lakh hectare from 2.1 lakh hectare.""The overall production is down by about 40%. The Krishna river, which has almost never been dry was totally dry last year and with another monsoon failure, new planting of sugarcane by farmers has happened only in 30% of the land,"" Patil said.The situation in Bagalkot, which has about 1 lakh hectare of sugarcane has also seen a dip of about 40%, while Vijayapura, which has a little less than 1 lakh hectare has also not seen good sowing. ""Bidar and Kalburagi, which have seen slightly better rains may be better off,"" Patil said.Overall, sugarcane cultivation in the state is likely to dip by 58% this year, say government sources and farmers, with a major crisis unravelling in south and central Karnataka and north and Hyderabad Karnataka regions."

DeepakK_R_DEEPAKHoneybees visit an estimated four lakh flowers to collect nectar for producing one kg of honey but their hard work is going in vain due to a variety of factors.The number of honeybee habitats is under threat mainly in the Eastern Ghats due to excessive use of pesticides and degradation of flora.Honeybees, a highly organised community, are considered eco-friendly as they contribute to higher agriculture yield and maintain the ecological balance.In some places crude methods are followed to collect honey by the farmers as they dont follow scientific methods for sustainable beekeeping, Dr. N.B. Brundhavanam, Adviser, Dabur India Ltd, who was here to take part in the World Honeybee Day celebrations, told The Hindu on Saturday.Honeysbees, the native type of insects also known as rock and forest bees, are facing threat even as bees imported from Europe mainly Italy are getting domesticated in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab in the North and Bihar and Jharkhand in the East India.As per estimates, Dr. Brundhavanam says India produces 45,000 tonne, which can be increased to 1.10 lakh tonne if farmers are sensitised on the advantages of using organic manure. It also renders great pollination service.Citing an instance, he points out that in Himachal Pradesh, the apple growers spend money to attract the bee colonies to migrate to their area as it leads to increase in apple production by 35%.Because of health-friendly ingredients, honey has found a mention in ancient literature dating back to 5,000 years ago. The average consumption in India is just 49 grams as against the global average of 750 grams.The Girijan Cooperative Corporation, which procures non-timber forest produce from tribals to provide them remunerative price by keeping middlemen at bay, is planning to implement a comprehensive action plan to promote honey production in a big way.Our aim is to increase floriculture, facilitate bank finance and popularise scientific ways for sustainable beekeeping, A.S.P.S. Ravi Prakash, Vice-Chairman-cum-Managing Director of GCC.He says the GCC is producing 500 tonne of honey straight away collecting it from the forests in totally pure form as against the demand of 1,000 tonne in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The domesticated honey produced in North and East by using the European bees contains a lot of sugar content unlike the honey marketed by the GCC."

Palaniswami on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his intervention to extend the coverage of subsidised sugar to all priority households and enhance the subsidy to at least Rs. 28.50 per kg.The Centre has limited sugar subsidy to Rs. 18.50 per kg to beneficiaries under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY). The quantity of supplies has been restricted to 1 kg per family per month  a limit which the Chief Minister said is too low, as the States average family size is four persons.Poorest of the poorThe Chief Minister said that priority households under the National Food Security Act, 2013, have been identified in accordance with very stringent guidelines.They represent the most vulnerable sections of society. Exclusion of such poor and vulnerable sections of society from the opportunity to avail of sugar at a subsidised rate would lead to serious discontent among the public, Mr. Palaniswami said.The Government of Tamil Nadu has been distributing sugar at the scale of 0.5 kg per person, subject to a ceiling of 2 kg per card. It may not be desirable to bring down the current scale of supply to the poorest of the poor. Therefore, the present scale of supply may kindly be protected, he said.Mr. Palaniswami also noted that the subsidy rate of Rs. 18.50 per kg was fixed when the market price of sugar was Rs. 32 per kg. But now, the price has risen to Rs. 48 per kg. The level of subsidy, which was fixed way back in 2002, may be revised to at least Rs. 28.50 per kg of sugar, he said."

5a1283dc9855b76bf13e0cdb,Indian American develops breakthrough therapy for sepsis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/indian-american-develops-breakthrough-therapy-for-sepsis/article19527527.ece,2017-08-20,"Each year globally, more than 600,000 infants die of sepsis, a condition of bacterial infection that spreads fast and leads to organ failure. But a therapy developed by a team led by an American professor of Indian origin, Pinaki Panigrahi, over the last 20 years and details of which were published in Nature this week could do wonders. The therapy has been found to reduce the risk of infection by 40% in trials and it can be inexpensive  less than one dollar for a course  Dr. Panigrahi told The Hindu by phone.Dr. Panigrahi is a professor of epidemiology and paediatrics at the Child Health Research Institute and Center for Global Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Centres College of Public Health.The therapy is to feed the infant with good bacteria that will populate his/her gut and block harmful bacteria. The probiotic bacterial strain is aided with a non-absorbable sugar to enhance its ability to effectively colonise the gut  researchers call the probiotic-sugar combination a synbiotic. The oral therapy starts during day 2-4 of life, as a preventive measure, much like a vaccine.More than a quarter of neonatal deaths in India are due to sepsis, which is one of the two most common causes of neonatal deaths globally, according to a study published in the Lancet Global Health in 2016. In a significant number of cases, the infection probably begins in the gut.Dr. Panigrahi is happy about the outcome of the trials that began in 2008 in Odisha, where he grew up. But he is equally excited about the prospects of some unexpected and surprising collateral benefits that the therapy appears to provide. This includes a reduction in lower respiratory tract and other infections among the infants who were administered the synbiotic, indicating an overall improvement in immunity status.Apart from saving babies from sepsis and respiratory tract infection, this type of intervention has much bigger and wider ramifications. The most relevant is its impact on stunting, said Dr. Panigrahi, explaining the wide prevalence of stunting in India, which is due to gut dysfunction that starts early in a childs life.Tropical enteropathyEarly infections and continued exposure to a large bacterial load during the first two years of life results in tropical enteropathy (an intestinal disorder that affects the ability to absorb nutrients), which did not exist when I went to medical school in India 30 years ago. It was something we read about in our textbooks. Such tropical enteropathy and gut dysfunction is rampant in India now and 40% of children under the age of two are stunted, he said, adding that stunted children end up with low cognitive development. When coupled with intrauterine stress and fast accumulation of fat during early infancy, stunting leads to chronic disease such as hypertension and diabetes in adulthood. Dr. Panigrahi hopes to expand the therapys dose and duration to combat the prevalence of childhood stunting, which stunts the countrys economy and development too.The probiotic study in neonates, largest in medical history, covered 4,556 babies, and stopped short of the initial plan to cover 8,000 of them. The ethics of medical trials require that once it is found to be definitively good or bad, it must stop. In this case, the results were clear and undeniably good according to an independent data safety monitoring board. Dr. Panigrahis team screened over 280 strains of probiotic bacteria before hitting upon a specific strain of Lactobacillus plantarum, abundantly found in curd, and fermented fruits and vegetables. These bacteria populate the healthy infant stool rather quickly and the strain used in the experiment was isolated from the diaper of an 11 month-old healthy baby.Averting health crisisThe indiscriminate use of wide-spectrum antibiotics is causing resistance to many drugs and a probiotic solution such as this could avert a health crisis in the making, Dr. Panigrahi said. A graduate from MKCG Medical College in Odisha, Professor Panigrahis heart remains in India. He travels to Delhi, Mumbai, Puducherry and various sites in Odisha multiple times a year. He says the results of the trial are also an indicator of the unexplored potential of ancient Ayurvedic discoveries made thousands of years ago in India.The concept of consuming probiotics in the form of curd and the importance of gut health dates back to the originating days of Ayurveda that dates back to 6,000 BC, he said, adding that the current national interest in Ayurveda should expand to support modern clinical trials of traditional medicines.This study is a testament to the world-class research done by my colleagues at the Asian Institute of Public Health in Bhubaneswar, as well as U.S. collaborators at the Emerging Pathogens Institute in Florida and the Medical Center at Michigan State University. Whats more, it demonstrates Indias ability to find its own solutions with overseas collaboration, he said."

The crushing has only began this season and officials at the factory told TOI that so far, it was well below par.""Only one of our two boilers is working, sugarcane production is low too,"" said Rame Gowda, a former managing director of the factory who has now been roped in as adviser.A few kilometres away , the Pandavapura Co-operative Sugar Factory, remains shut.""There is no work happening here,"" said the security incharge, the only person on the premises. Four other factories in the region have shut over the past three years.Venkatesh Murthy, vicePresident of Bannari Sugar Factory and committee member of the South Indian Sugar Mills Association, said there was no way the demand for sugar would be met domestically this year.""The government has al ready imported around 5 lakh tonne of sugar this year. The situation in Karnataka, which is the third largest sugar producing state after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, is likely to further push sugar prices up,"" Murthy said.He added that the factories -which take stock of the sowing during the season -are expecting only 50% of the average sugarcane this year. ""Sugar price has already touched Rs 35 (in the wholesale market), and we expect it to hit Rs 45 to Rs 50 in the absence of timely imports,"" he said. In the retail market, sugar costs upwards of Rs 45 a kilo.""Last year too, crushing was poor with only about 50% having been achieved. The situation was particularly bad in south and central Karnataka,"" Murthy said.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of All India Sugarcane Growers' Association , said the trouble began in 201314 when sugar factories could not pay the farmers. The following year, sugar prices increased to Rs 35 per kilogram from Rs 25.""However, sugar factories could not pay the dues even that year, pushing several farmers into distress. And since that year, monsoon has failed,"" he said. Factories still owe some Rs 700 crore to farmers, he said."

A proposal had been forwarded to the government for giving Rs. 39 lakh as compensation to 691 farmers whose coconut, mango, sapota, lemon trees had withered due to drought.Officials attached to the Department of Statistics have been asked to estimate the quantum of loss suffered by farmers who had cultivated maize, black gram, green gram. The farmers will get compensation within 45 days from the date of submission of the report, he said.But farmers expressed displeasure over the inordinate delay in giving compensation for crop loss and compensation under crop insurance.Were not ready to accept the assurance given by the insurance company. What were the company and the Statistics Department officials doing all these days? While the insurance company should have disbursed the compensation and officials should have completed the survey.

Shaik Maideen of Vadakarai and others said.Collector Sandeep Nanduri said that the entire exercise would be expedited.When farmers alleged that the police were harassing them while taking silt or clay from dry water bodies for agricultural purposes and demanding bribe to get nod from revenue and mining department officials, the Collector assured that he would speak to the Superintendent of Police to sort out the issue.When some farmers complained that arrears to be paid by sugar factory for the sugarcane supplied were accumulating, an official representing the factory replied that 87% of the arrears had been settled. The rest 13% will be paid in the next 10 days, he said.But farmers said the official, who had no powers to give such assurance, should not be allowed to attend the farmers grievance meet. Instead, ask the factorys chairman to attend our meeting so that he can understand our problem.Mr. Sandeep told the official that there should be no more delay in settling arrears.The arrears should be paid along with interest within 10 days. If not, your chairman will have to come here, he said.After a few farmers complained that officials were not giving proper reply to their queries, Mr. Sandeep told the officials that every department, on getting queries from farmers, should reply to the farmer concerned. Moreover, an action taken report on farmers queries should be tabled in the subsequent meeting, the Collector said."

To the envy of other southern districts, this year too, the south-west monsoon in the district is bountiful and has already exceeded the average rainfall received during monsoon, official sources said.The district has received total rainfall of 904 mm from January to December  309 mm during south-west monsoon (June to September) and 413 mm during north-east monsoon (October to December). This year, the district has already received 384 mm of rain during the south-west monsoon, exceeding the average.With another one-and-a-half months left for the monsoon to retreat, we expect more rains, official sources said adding except Ilayangudi block, the rainfall was widespread in the district. Sivaganga district received 368 mm of rainfall in 2015, 378 mm in 2016 and set to record an all- time high this year, the sources said.The rains had brought cheers to farmers who began preparing the fields for raising paddy during the last week of September and first week of October, coinciding with the onset of north-east monsoon, S. Selvam, Joint Director of Agriculture, said.Well-suited for sowingThanks to the rains, the fields were wet and well-suited for pre-sowing ploughing, he said adding in some areas such as Singampunari, farmers have even started cultivating pulses. Farmers cultivated paddy through direct sowing in 78,000 hectares and the rains during south-west monsoon were extremely useful to them, Mr. Selvam said.Farmers who raised sugarcane in 3,000 hectares and groundnut in 2,500 hectares were also happy, he added.As the meteorological department has predicted a good north-east monsoon as well, we are hopeful of bumper harvest this year, he said. The department has enough stocks of seeds and fertilizers to be distributed to the farmers, he added."

Veera Raghava Rao, who chaired the meeting, explained that variations would be there between different villages since the compensation amount was calculated at village-level based on the average yield in a particular village for the past seven years. However, since some of the farmers complained that variations were observed even within the same village, Mr. Rao said that he would ask the respective Agricultue Officers in the areas to verify. He added that the insurance companies had agreed to pay the differential amount to affected farmers if variations were observed within a village.N. Palanichamy, State president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, brought up the issue of the rationale behind notifying certain areas in the district alone as insurance-covered areas for a particular crop.

Indoreans are gearing up to soak-in the spirit of the festival but with a bit of thoughtfulness this year. Having come to the conclusion that the immersion of idols made from POP, toxic materials and chemical paints results in water pollution, the city has vowed to go green and save the river. With a spurt in drives and initiatives on opting for eco-friendly Ganesh idols making rounds, more families in Indore have started making idols at home using shadu mitti. There are others taking the definition of eco-friendly to a new level with tree and fish food Ganesh idols. Indore Times finds out moreMore people have started making Ganesh idols at home. Dr Sonalee Nargunde, a senior faculty at DAVV has been making Ganesh idols from shadu mitti for past three years at home. She shares, ""Every year, ahead of Ganeshotsav, I try to urge as many people as I can to make their own eco-friendly idols. The shadu clay is easily available at the stationary shops and the colours could easily be made from turmeric, spinach and beetroot at home. So, it has become more feasible to make these idols."" Nargunde makes an assortment of idols, perfection notwithstanding and gifts them to her friends to spread the message of eco-friendly celebration.Not only Nargunde, many housing societies are taking out time to make the festival more eco-friendly. Seema Gupta, a resident of Sudama Nagar informs, ""Our society has vowed to keep the festival eco-friendly this year. I have a social gathering of women at my place a little ahead of Ganesh Chaturthi and we are making Ganesh idols together. We will also pledge to not play loud music during the celebration at our community Ganesh which we collectively put in in our society.""Workshops for making different kinds of eco-friendly Ganesh idols are also being conducted in colleges and other institutions. Rupesh Sharma, a sculptor and a faculty at a city college informs that their college has been conducting workshops on making eco-friendly Ganesh for past last three years. ""We not only teach our students and faculties to make Ganesh idol from shadu mitti but also help them prepare natural colours to colour them and make them as eco-friendly as possible,"" he adds.Sisters Rashmi and Namrata Gupta, an IT professional and an interior designer, respectively, have been making Ganesh idols for past five years. They recently conducted a workshop on making tree Ganesh. Talking about the idea of tree Ganesh idol, Rashmi says, ""This year we thought of making an idol using red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay mixed with seeds of plants. To finish the look we thought of using natural colours to paint and highlight the features of the idol. Earlier this month, when we finished making our first Tree Ganesh idol we thought of letting more people wake up to the concept and thus organised a workshop.""Namrata adds, ""Now, we have more people joining hands with us and we are making hundred such idols which will be up on sale for `400 each. The idol is supposed to be placed atop a clay pot and watered regularly once the festival is over. Gradually, the seeds inside the idol would begin sprouting. We are experimenting with Tulsi , marigold and petunia seeds as of now.""The concept is catching on amongst other locals as well who are also experimenting with making idols at home. Pranav Shrivastava, a 23-year-old architect is also making a tree Ganesh idols both for home and office this year. He reveals, ""I wanted to make an idol that is born from nature, for nature and by nature and thus thought of making a tree Ganesh. We will be using the soil of our own garden to make the idol. The top soil preferably since its consistency is good and can be moulded easily."" He is also working on another concept of eco-friendly Ganesh idol. ""For our office, we are planning on making an idol which is fish-friendly. For this, we are mixing different flours and fish-friendly food like corn, wheat and other vegetable powders with clay to make the idol. Once the idol is immersed in the river, the clay settles and the food can be eaten by the fish.""The city's chocolatiers and bakers are planning to add an extra sweet touch to the festival by making Chocolate Ganesh. Rakshita Mehta, a city-based baker shares, ""I am making chocolate Ganesh idol this year, which upon immersion in milk can become a perfect recipe for a milkshake and can later be consumed as prasad. I am using sugar c onfetti and golden sugar to give the idol some final touches."""

Hence, rice production in the district may be adversely affected this year.Somasundra, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu that paddy was grown in over 88,740 hectares during 2015-16 and there was a rice production of over 3,00,709 tonnes during the year. He said that over 35.67 quintal rice was produced per hectare last year and he said farmers had grown paddy in many taluks despite drought.The Agriculture Department, at the behest of the State government, is prevailing upon farmers not to cultivate paddy this year owing to failure of rain.The department, through Raitha Samparka Kendras (farmer contact centres), and through other various other platforms had insisted the farmers not to grow paddy this season and it also made it clear that government was not responsible if farmers grew paddy and the crop got damaged for want of water.Apart from instructing the farmers not to grow any water intensive crop such as paddy, and sugarcane, the department had also called upon the farmers to grow ragi, hybrid maize, jowar, pulses, cotton, and oil seeds, which require less water. Many farmers had cultivated the above crops in most parts of the district. Hence, most of the farmers did not take up paddy this season and only a small number of farmers in the rain-fed area and are dependent on their borewells have cultivated paddy this season, Mr. Somasundra said. He said that water being let into the canals would be used to fill the tanks for drinking purposes.In K.R. Nagar taluk, paddy cultivation is down to 2,384 hectares as against the target of 26,500 hectares, in Mysuru it is 160 hectares as against the target of 8,000 hectares, while in Nanjangud only 53 hectares has been brought under paddy cultivation this year as against the target of 17,000 hectares. In Periyapatana 325 hectares has been brought under paddy cultivation as against the targeted 8,400 hectares and paddy has not been cultivated in H.D. Kote, Hunsur, and T. Narsipur."

However, some critics took to media channels to highlight the hypocrisy at the heart of it all: that the Games biggest sponsors included McDonalds and Coca-Cola, not exactly the patron saints of healthy food.Dr. Aseem Malhotra, an outspoken cardiologist, championed the call for such organisations to be banned from Olympic sponsorship, highlighting major diabetes and heart disease problems that existed in Newham, the East London Borough, where the Games were scheduled.The model villagePointing out inconsistencies between health policy and the road map to achieving improved health is a theme that Dr. Malhotra has returned to time and again, most recently in his book,The Pioppi Diet, where he and anti-sugar campaigner and filmmaker, Donal ONeill, return to Pioppi, the Italian village with strikingly high life expectancy and low rates of cardiovascular disease.Protected by UNESCO  first made famous by Dr. Ancel Keys in the 1970s  for new takeaways on the secret to living a well and healthy life, the book outlines a 21-day lifestyle plan. This includes weeding out processed sugars and refined carbohydrates from diets, and incorporating breathing exercises, fasting and specific movements. This, they argue, can help reduce the risk of type-2 diabetes and heart disease.Intriguingly, the book does not rule out saturated fats (ghee, butter, and cheese are among the ingredients included in recommended recipes), arguing that fat in unprocessed food is a crucial provider of essential fats, while dietary fat has little impact on raising glucose and insulin. Saturated fat does not clog the heart arteries, the book advises. They also argue that cholesterol has been wrongly vilified since Keys correlated heightened total cholesterol concentration with coronary heart disease. If you havent had a heart attack and you dont suffer from heart disease, taking a cholesterol-lowering statin will not prolong your life by a single day, Dr. Malhotra emphasises.While the dangers of overmedication are an issue touched upon in the book, its a topic close to Dr. Malhotras heart, and one that hes visited on a number of occasions, including most recently in an article inThe Pharmaceutical Journal. Published earlier this year (alongside two other medics), it challenges the medical wisdom of wantonly prescribing statins, arguing that despite the extensive developments of medicines to reduce LDL cholesterol there is no consistent evidence for clinical benefit with respect to either events or mortality.There are so many things wrong with modern medicine what we do often has marginal benefits at best, he said at a meeting in central London, estimating that at least 50% of our health care problems would be resolved if we changed lifestyle and reduced prescribed drugs. In fact, he argues, the cost of overmedication and consequent side-effects adds greatly to the pressures on already-stretched health-care systems much more than acknowledged. The medical worlds relationship to statins are a clear example of this, he argues, with the drugs giving patients the illusion of protection, often leaving them with the feeling that they can simply continue to eat as they wish rather than adopting a healthier lifestyle.The same goes for diabetes, he argues. Ive seen people come off type-2 diabetes with simple lifestyle changes after being on insulin for over 20 years.Teaching lifestyle practicesKey to changing things will be revamped government policies (he points to Britains plans for a sugar tax as of 2018 as an important forward development) and a reappraisal of medical education. The significance of lifestyle simply isnt taught at medical school, he says. But thats probably due to a system of distorted incentives among medical specialists, he averred. Doctors have a responsibility to protect people from the misuses of medicine but its difficult to get a person to understand something when their salary depends on not understanding it."

Of the registered 530 units across all seven taluks, at least 65% are facing acute shortage of sugarcane and over 50% have become non-functional in recent weeks, officials at the District Industries Centre and Department of Agriculture said.The arrival of jaggery declined by around 50% in the last few days, said D.R. Pushpa, secretary, Mandya APMC. Speaking to The Hindu on Saturday, she said: The APMC used to get around 30 loads [around 2,400-2,600 quintals] of jaggery every day. But, the arrivals have been hovering between 1,200 and 1,300 quintals a day in recent days.Currently, the prices are quoted at Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 4,050 a quintal at the APMC in Mandya, Ms. Pushpa said.The trend is mainly attributed to lower acreage of sugarcane and farmers switching over to less water-intensive crops as Mandya district is witnessing severe drought for the sixth consecutive year.A target of cultivating sugarcane on 24,829 hectares was set for the current season. However, just 3,100 hectares have been covered till Saturday, said sources in the Agriculture Department.The district has five sugarmills. While first grade of the produce is supplied to mills, the remaining cane is procured by the aalemanes.While a small unit can produce around 2 quintals of jaggery a day, big units can produce up to 35 quintals. There is a greater demand in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh for bucket-shape, box-shape and cube-shape jaggery that is produced in Mandya.APMC used to get 2,400 to 2,600 quintals of jaggery every day.

A recent report by the Cooperation Department shows that a host of chemicals and adulterants go into it in several jaggery-making units.Jaggery units in Karnataka, particularly in Mandya region, have been using different types of chemicals/additives, including calcium hydroxide, sodium hydrosulphite (hydrose), sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate (safolite), ortho-phosphoric acid, seashells, baking soda, oil (castor/coconut), and orange-red powder (artificial food colouring), reveals the report submitted recently to the government.The main purpose behind using these additives is to remove impurities easily and give it the desired colour. Sugar is also added as a thickening agent, reducing the processing time, says the report by Additional Secretary, Cooperation Department. It also notes that some manufacturing units, in contrast, have also been using ladys finger stem and powder as safer alternative clarificants.Karnataka ranks third in sugarcane cultivation that is concentrated in Belagavi, Bagalkot, Mandya, Bidar, Ballari and Vijayapura districts. Mandya district alone has 532 jaggery manufacturing units with an output of at least 10 lakh tonnes of jaggery a year. Jaggery samples were collected from Mandya, Yeshwantpur and Mahalingapur and tested at the Regional Agmark Laboratory, Guntur. The tests revealed that higher level of sulphur dioxide residue was found in light coloured jaggery samples from Mandya market than the samples collected from Yeshwantpur and Mahalingapur markets. This could be attributed to the excess use of chemicals such as hydrose and safolite, the report said.The report said sodium hydrosulphite (commonly used as a reducing/bleaching agent in textiles, dyeing, leather, paper pulp and other industries) was used as bleaching agent in jaggery manufacturing. These sodium-based chemicals also lead to the reduced shelf life of jaggery, as sodium being highly hygroscopic in nature absorbs moisture from atmosphere that softens the jaggery and makes it mushy.The sulphur-based chemicals (sulfoxylate) leads to increase in sulphurdi-oxide residue in jaggery. Ortho-phosphoric acid is also used as bleaching agent and when it exceeds the limits, it is harmful.Use vegetable clarificantsCFTRI, Mysuru, has recommended the use of vegetable clarificants as alternative to chemicals.Indiscriminate use of the chemicals is not only harmful for consumption but also reduces the shelf life of the product forcing the farmers to distress sales within a week from processing, irrespective of the prevailing price in the market, says the report.The demand for jaggery was usually based on colour. Jaggery with light golden yellow colour and firm hardness fetched more price in comparison to other varieties. The next preferred colours were kesari and golden yellow. Dark brown coloured jaggery had the least demand, which the report says in the main reason for chemical additives. On an average, price difference of Rs. 100 to Rs. 500 per quintal was found between different varieties of jaggery based on variation in colour and shape.India accounts for over 70% of the total global jaggery production. India exports jaggery to many countries, including Bangladesh, the U.K., Canada, Chile, Egypt, Fiji, Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Nepal, and the U.S.Sodium hydrosulphite is used as bleaching agent in jaggery manufacturing. These sodium-based chemicals also lead to reduced shelf life of jaggeryCooperation Departments Report"

The tobacco-to-FMCG-to-hotel-to-agri business major is likely to enter the market with fresh potato  a first-of-its-kind in India  followed by some more fresh vegetables. The company is also planning to launch fruit pulps and juices in order to become top food company in India.Devising the India First strategy for the future, CEO Sanjiv Puri (in pic) said: Currently, we rank No. 3 among the food companies in India with a total Rs 8,000-crore consumer spends and two Rs 3,000-crore plus brands  Aashirvaad and Sunfeast. ITC has always preferred to create indigenous brands for its new businesses that include foods, personal care products and stationary. The two Rs 3,000-crore plus food labels are also indigenous brands, which were created in the last decade.Puri pointed out that going forward, the focus will be on fruit, vegetables and sea foods because only 2%-3% of the perishables are now being processed in the country. We shall bring some food products in the fresh form or in shelf-life-enhancing form. Like, we are planning to introduce fresh potato soon, he added.The company is planning to launch low sugar potato and anti-oxidant potato soon. Besides potato, as indicated by Puri, ITC might come out with dehydrated onion later this year.The Kolkata-based company had created a brand called ITC Master Chef for prawn and blended spices earlier this year. The divisional chief executive of the agri business of ITC, S Sivakumar , said the dehydrated onion could come under the ITC Maser Chef brand. We are planning to launch more food products in fresh, semi-processed and in puree form. We are also launching mango pulp soon. This could be under B Natural brand, he added.The food brands of ITC include Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo, Yippee!, ITC Master chef B Natural, Aashirvaad Swasti Ghee, Mint O, Sunbean and Fabelle. Besides Sunfeast and Aashrvaad, the two other over Rs1000-crore brands are Bingo and Yippee!.Candyman has also crossed Rs 500crore mark in terms of consumer spends. Aashirvaad is alredy No. 1 in branded atta while Sunfest is among the leaders in biscuits.The ITC CEO argued that one of the main reasons to come out with semi-processed and fresh vegetables is to reduce colossal waste in fruits and vegetables in India. There is an annual loss of Rs 90,000 crore in perishables. This can be brought down by devising a proper strategy. Food is a very big opportunity for us. ITC has a very strong agro backend as well as trade marketing network, which is required for this, he added."

""Under no circumstances should it be used for agriculture,"" he said. Siddaramaiah followed it up with an appeal to farmers to stop growing paddy and sugarcane, and switch to semi-arid crops such as ragi and millet. ""We've had the lowest rainfall in 46 years, and have water available only for drinking,"" he said.Last month, Karnataka was staring at the possibility of drought--rain seemed to have failed, legal compulsions limited the amount of Cauvery water the state could use, dams In partnership with had hit dead storage, and farmers were enraged. Recently though, it has rained enough for water in Krishnarajasagar dam to cross 100 ft. Now, farmers want government to let them sow one paddy or sugarcane crop. But the state is hesitant to yield. ""We are trying to promote crop diversity with millets, pulses, jowar and maize in the Cauvery basin for long-term water stability,"" says agriculture minister K B Gowda.This is happening because the Cauvery has about 40% less water than it did 50 years ago.A 765-km-long river originating in Talakaveri in Kodagu district, deforestation, dams, hydroelectric and agricultural projects, and sewage discharge have reduced its size and altered its course over the years.One of the main reasons for st cover its decline is loss of forest along its course, says professor ofes T V Ramachandra from IIS IISc's Centre for Ecological Sciences al Scie who is leading a study on n the basin. ""Just 15% of its s 34,000sqkm catchment area in n Karnataka is forested againstgainst the required 33%,"" he says. ys He gives the example of Lakshmkshm anatirtha, a tributary , and says ays the study proved that feeder er streams with more vegetation on have water throughout the year. ea ""Att places where forest cover has been en degraded for agriculture and plantations, streams dry up during non-monsoon months,"" he says.The other reason is exploitation. When rain was plentiful, many dams and irrigation projects were built and areas that traditionally grew millet switched to paddy and sugarcane. Ramachandra says it is time to introduce curbs on sugarcane and paddy cultivation. ""Only that need less water nly crops t must be allowed,"" he adds.mus Downstream, tributaries are all but dead under an onslaught of untreated sewage and industrial effluents. University of Mysore researchers found lead, cadmium and magnesium in the river bed this year. They categorised the river as `yellow', which means the water can turn toxic if corrective measures are not taken. If discharge of effluents and unvi able agricultural practices were not enough, coffee curing in Kodagu is adding to pollution.The construction of three dams --Harangi on the Mysuru-Kodagu border, Hemavathi in Hassan and Chiklihole in Kodagu--has also submerged vast tracts of forest, affecting rainfall in catchment areas.""Habitat manipulation in the name of development, including expansion of agricultural practices, has reduced rainfall and inflow in the Cauvery,"" says P M Muthanna of Wildlife First.A former forester says the shift from agriculture to tourism has also hit water levels.""Kodagu has 32% forest cover but the Cauvery catchment area is mainly private and revenue lands. In many places, revenue department is allowing conversion from agricultural to commercial use without control.This should be stopped to save the Cauvery ,"" he says.The Karnataka government along with Isha Foundation will plant 25 crore saplings on river banks across the state, chief minister Siddaramaiah announced at an event held in Bengaluru on Saturday as part of spiritual guru Sadhguru's Rally for Rivers. At a similar event in Mysuru on Friday, Sadhguru met farmers from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu caught in a four decade-long dispute over sharing of Cauvery waters.""I need water and you need water and therefore dividing water for use is not justice. But nourishing water resources is true justice for water,"" he said. On Sunday, the rally reached Chennai, where Sadhguru met TN chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.The Vrishabhavathi, which runs through south Ben galuru, supplied a third of the city's drinking water till a decade ago. Today , a third of the city's sewage flows into it every day . Bengaluru's river is now popularly known as Kengeri mori (Kengeri's gutter).Waste and effluents combine to cause occasional frothing in it.Three rivers served as water sources for Bengaluru, but the burgeoning city has consumed them all.

It would create water shortage and possibly heighten the Cauvery water dispute with Tamil Nadu.According to data provided by the agriculture department, the Cauvery water dispute tribunal has permitted Karnataka to irrigate 18.85 lakh acres for both kharif and rabi seasons in any given year, with an estimated water requirement of 250.62tmcft.However, statistics suggest that in violation of these permissible limits, during a rather normal year like 2015-16, the basin has seen nearly 28.41lakh acres being cultivated for paddy and sugarcane alone. This year, despite Karnataka on the verge of being declared a drought year and the ban in place for sugarcane crops, the total acreage already under cultivation is 32,941 acres as on September 6. For paddy , the acreage as on July 31 was 8.7 lakh acres.Agriculture minister Krishna Byregowda said that the government will not encourage cultivation of the two water-intensive crops of paddy and sugarcane.""We cannot afford to release water despite the healthy levels of our reservoirs, for paddy and sugarcane. With the situation very uncertain and the time to cultivate paddy well past its deadline, it is difficult to meet the expectations of farmers in the basin,"" he said.Mandya-based farmer leader C Kumari told TOI there have been several petitions to the deputy commissioner for relaxing the ban on growing paddy and sugarcane.

Instead, it is scattered into all possible directions, said Mr. Rotter.For years many different attempts have been made to outwit this kind of scattering, creating a cloak of invisibility. Special materials have been worked out, for example, which are able to guide light waves around an object. Alternatively, also experiments have been performed with objects that can emit light by themselves.No obstructionWhen an electronic display sends out exactly the same light as it absorbs in the back, it can appear invisible, at least when looked at in the right angle.We did not want to reroute the light waves, nor did we want to restore them with additional displays. Our goal was to guide the original light wave through the object, as if the object was not there at all, said Andre Brandstotter, one of the authors of the study. To make the laser shine, energy has to be supplied by means of a pump beam. Otherwise, the laser material behaves just like any other material  it absorbs part of the incident light.The crucial point is to pump energy into the material in a spatially tailored way such that light is amplified in exactly the right places, while allowing for absorption at other parts of the material, said Konstantinos Makris from the University of Crete in Greece.To achieve this, a beam with exactly the right pattern has to be projected onto the material from above  like from a standard video projector, except with much higher resolution, said Mr. Makris.If this pattern perfectly corresponds to the inner irregularities of the material which usually scatter the light, then the projection from above can effectively switch off the scattering, and another beam of light travelling through the material from one side can pass without any obstruction.A beam with exactly the right pattern has to be projected onto the material from aboveKonstantinos MakrisUniversity of Crete"

But the things you cant find in Venezuela any more, like milk and sugar, means the landmark has had to close.When Manuel Da Silva first opened its welcoming yellow doors in 1981, the Heladeria Coromoto offered its clients the tried and trusted: vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and coconut flavours.Until one day, Mr. Da Silva tried out an avocado sorbet on his customers. It was a success! said Jose Ramirez, his son-in-law.He had a crazy idea and he started to invent, to try things with meat, with fish, said Mr. Ramirez.He might have stopped at chipi-chipi, a small Caribbean mollusc, but Mr. Da Silva was clearly not a man to hold back on a hunch. New flavours followed when he experimented with garlic as well as onion flavoured ice cream. Soon his imagination knew no limits and the number of wacky flavours, and his reputation, grew.People were coming to try some strange things, said Luis Marquez, a young local in the mountain town of Merida who grew up with frequent visits to the Coromoto.Set a recordIn 1991, just a decade after opening and a world away from plain old vanilla, the Heladeria Coromoto got an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for providing the most flavours of any ice cream parlour in the world  at the time, 386.But Mr. Da Silva, a Portuguese immigrant, continued to innovate and play with peoples taste buds.Black bean ice cream soon followed, chilli, beetroot.. up to a staggering 860 flavours.The shop quickly became a key attraction in Merida, an Andean city of 4,50,000 which is also known for having the worlds highest cable-car ride, 4,765 metres above sea-level.Now it comes highly recommended in tourist guides such as Lonely Planet and TripAdvisor.But Venezuelas deepening economic crisis since the collapse of crude oil prices in 2014 meant it became an ordeal to source raw materials over the last few years.On the first Monday in September, Mr. Ramirez hung up his scoops and closed Heladeria Coromoto, defeated by the impossible task of getting the essential raw materials of ice cream in any meaningful quantity in Venezuela.For years we have been suffering from shortages and we buy on the black market. We can not get products from our traditional suppliers, said Mr. Ramirez, 56.Up to now, he has always managed to scrape by. But the situation got more complicated this year....Many Venezuelans battle hunger and malnutrition because of the economic and political crisis.We made efforts, we tried to keep going to the maximum, but the time has come when I cant resist anymore, Mr. Ramirez said."

Pariyasamy said that all the 45 private and cooperative sugar industries in the state are in doldrums for the last three years.The entire sugar industries in the state has suffered a loss of Rs. 1300 crore for the last three years.Mr. Periyasamy said that the SISMA was for getting fair and remunerative price (FRP) for the farmers and hence it urged the government devise a mechanism to offer subsidy to the subsidise the farmers.He said the SISMA has invested Rs. 50 lakh for research and development through Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) to develop high yielding varieties of sugarcane.SISMA also funded the sweet bloom, a five-year project focussing on promoting cultivation of local-specific cane varieties that are non-flowering and drought and red rot resistent.The trials are being conducted at nine places across the state. The end result is awaited in another two to three years.Addressing at the seminar, Director of Sugar, Anu George, said that the state government has launched Sugarcane Intensification System in 40,000 ha and had launched micro irrigation in a big way to maximise sugarcane production.Director of the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation Robert Henry was the chief guest."

In nearby Mumbai, awill be one of the tallest in the megacity. In a swanky suburb of Delhi, two Trump partners have big plans. And in Kolkata, a new Trump tower is under way.Three years after Donald Trump arrived on his private jet for a deal-making tour, India has become the only major developing country where his business is roaring. It has the most construction projects with Trump licensing deals of any country outside of the U.S.After his election, Trump abandoned a number of international projects and promised not to engage in new foreign deals that could trigger conflicts of interest. With the Indian deals struck earlier, his company is barreling ahead. While in office, Trump has been building a strong bond with Prime Minister Narendra Modi  as his company builds ties with some partners who have faced legal troubles., on June 26.Modi was one of the first to visit Trump after he took office and invited daughter Ivanka to lead a delegation to a business summit in November. All of this has raised fresh questions about whether Trump Organization's deals with politically-connected foreign tycoons could put his interests ahead of the nation's and entail special treatment by foreign authorities.India is a key US ally in Asia and its rivalry with both Pakistan and China fosters many areas where Trump and Modi need each othernuclear weapons, anti-terrorism, Afghanistan and trade, among others. So far, Trump doesn't seem to have spared India in policies ranging from visas for technology workers to the Paris climate accord. Still, the risk that he might let his business interests outweigh national needsor that Modi might cut him a break on taxes or permits in exchange for policy tweaksremains a big concern for government ethics experts in the US. A spokesman for Modi did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Asked about potential conflicts in India, the Trump Organization said it's ""very proud of the success we have achieved in that market with five active properties under various stages of development."" The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization.Trump's Indian partners Atul and Sagar Chordia celebrated the U.S. victory by flying immediately to New York to congratulate the president-elect, increasing congressional calls for Trump to divest his businesses. He opted instead to hold onto his assets and hand management to his two older sons.Whatever concerns have been raised in the U.S. regarding the blending of business and policy, Trump's election seems only to have increased the value of his brand in India, though some voices in the Indian press have begun to question the effects of politics and well-publicized conflicts of interests on his brand. Here, political ties have long been the fastest route to get approvals for big projects. Only Afghanistan is more burdensome when it comes to dealing with construction permits, according to a ranking of 186 nations in the World Bank's 2017 Doing Business report.In fact, the link between construction and politics is so tight in India that research by political scientists Milan Vaishnav and Devesh Kapur shows that cement consumption declines in the lead-up to state assembly elections because firms redirect cash from construction to campaigns.""No one in India would think twice about him being engaged in politics on the one hand and real estate on the other,"" said Vaishnav, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It's an open secret that to be successful in Indian real estate, you have to be well connected in politics.""In a more surreal display of Trump's allure in India, a small village, encouraged by a charity group, renamed itself Trump Village and put up a Trump billboard to help get much-needed toilets. A local commissioner lashed out at the stunt and ordered the billboard removed. Bindeshwar Pathak, an activist who led the effort, expects the name will stick, however: ""You can now say 'I want to go to Trump Village' and people will tell you how.""One question facing Modi is to what extent his changes in real estate policy could impact the bottom line of Trump Organization or its partners. Last year, he ended a tax loophole often used by the rich to buy property in someone else's name.In his high-profile visit to Mumbai in August 2014, Trump praised Modi for winning the country's first single-party parliamentary majority in 30 years.""India is a great place to invest, especially after the elections,"" Trump told reporters. He held a banquet attended by 500 of Pune's rich and powerful, in which TV cameramen pushed for position while a Bollywood star interviewed the American tycoon.Trump spoke about his global ambitions to build towers in China and South America. As it happens, those projects have largely failed to materialize. His group scrapped deals in Brazil last year after being cited in a local corruption probe, in which the group hasn't been charged with any crimes, and several projects in China and Russia have floundered.Not so in Modi's India, where an extended economic boom and the political influence of Trump's allies have helped his business flourish.In Pune on a recent afternoon, men in military uniform guarded the entrance of the Trump towers as auto rickshaws buzzed about on the street outside. The twin 23-story buildings stand out in the city's unremarkable skyline. They were erected by Panchshil, the real estate business of the Chordia family. Patriarch Ishwardas Chordia, who hailed from a family of sugar traders, was college buddies with a powerful political broker, Sharad Pawar, whom Modi has lauded for his guidance in his early days in politics, and whose family members have shared business interests with the Chordias.When Chairman Atul Chordia, his brother and an associate visited Trump days after the election, Trump praised Modi. The Chordias had been negotiating a second deal, which Trump scrapped along with other projects days before his inauguration. Chordia declined to comment.In nearby Mumbai, Abhishek Lodha is trying to secure approvals for the last few floors of the Trump Tower Mumbai. The managing director of Lodha Group said in an interview at the firm's office that he negotiated the tower deal over six months prior to Trump's election, which included a visit to Trump Tower in New York for meetings with Donald Jr. and Ivanka. Once in Mumbai, Trump the elder made a few tweaks to the project: bigger kitchens, air-conditioning in the lobbies and kitchens, and he picked out the facade design.Lodha is no political novice. His father is the deputy boss in Maharashtra state for Modi's Bharatiya Janata party. After the government revised rules to allow transfer of development rights to the city of Mumbai in November, Lodha was the first to take advantage and surrendered some mill land. The group gained rights to more floor space in the city but hasn't said how it will use it.Almost 900 miles to the north in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, Pankaj Bansal is one of two Trump partners in a city where a Dubai-style boom of sky-rises emerged almost overnight out of farmland. Bansal, who traveled with Modi in business delegations to Russia and Japan, agreed to meet at M3M's Golf Estate, though declined to comment on his Trump tie-up.The entrance to the resort is flanked by shanties of workers. Bansal collects cars and likes to sky dive, and his company sells dreams to those fancying themselves as ""the gentry""a promotional video by his Polo Suites project offers a chance to ""breathe the air of nobility, and live your life king-sized, to walk like gods amongst men.""Gurgaon's market is tough at the moment, but Bansal said he expects the family-run company to weather India's economic slowdown by delivering on projects as competitors face crises. Two managing directors of Unitech Limited, for example, are fighting allegations that they duped customers after they were arrested in April over a delayed project. Unitech, which is not a Trump partner, did not respond to requests for comment.""People who are delivering are doing okay,"" said Bansal. ""People who aren't are bleeding blood.""The nameM3Mtells something about the company's self-image. It stands for Magnificence in the Trinity of Men, Materials and Money. The group has been facing some legal troubles of its own. It has denied allegations in a police report in March that an executive bribed forestry officials to clear 2,200 trees at a development site. The company says the allegations are completely false.The company was entangled for years in a tax investigation into the suspected use of fronts in land purchases, a practice which is banned in India. M3M's chairman offered to pay millions in advance tax when investigators raided group offices and seized funds and valuables in 2007, though court documents show the funds were later recouped after no incriminating evidence was found. The company said an appeal by the income tax department was dismissed in its favor in 2015.Trump's other partner in Gurgaon, IREO, also had its offices searched by tax investigation in 2010. The group said in an emailed response that it complied with tax authorities and provided all of its relevant shareholding details. No charges were filed. The executive who announced the Trump deal for the private equity real estate firm is the brother-in-law of Sudhanshu Mittal, a ruling party leader, though the company said he is not associated in any ownership or management capacity.Harsh Patodia, chairman for Unimark Group, who has an arrangement with the Trump Organization in Kolkata, declined to comment by phone. Tribeca Developers, whose founder Kalpesh Mehta is a Trump representative in India who visited Trump Tower in November with the Chordias, also declined requests for comment.During his 2014 visit, Trump knew how to flatter his audience.""I don't consider this an emerging market, I consider this an amazing market,"" he said in an interview with NDTV, citing real estate prices that are cheap by his standards, though out of reach for most Indians. ""India was very divisive at one point and people were afraid to invest and I think people have great confidence in the new prime minister.""Trump's courting of India is already paying off: his personal financial disclosures, which released details of his income in ranges, show India deals bringing in between $1.6 million and $11 million in royalties since 2014."

The victim, Moonam Yadav, was allegedly murdered by five persons from her neighborhood who have been arrested.Lokender, a lawyer known to the victim's family, said: ""The girl, whose father Naresh Yadav is a vegetable vendor, lived in a rented flat in Modinagar's Umesh Park which belonged to one Hari Om Sharma. Sharma, who is married, had befriended the girl and due to this the girl's father shifted out of the house four months ago. However, Sharma kept on meeting the girl and threatened the family when they objected. It was because of this that he harboured enmity towards the family and killed her in a gruesome manner.""The girl went missing while going to school. Her father said, ""We lodged a missing complaint with Modinagar police station and suspected Sharma, following which he was summoned to the police station. However, he was soon allowed to go because of his connections with a local politician. On September 6, we went with our neighbours to the police station but were shooed away.""But the family kept up the pressure following which Sharma was again summoned by police. ""We called the accused on September 11. We checked phone records and confirmed that he regularly spoke to the girl. During interrogation, he confessed to the crime,"" said Sanjay Verma, SHO, Modinagar police station, adding: ""He along with four others, identified as Dharmender, Subash, Kapil and Harish, strangled her after luring her to a nearby forest in Kalcheena village and hid her body in a ditch.""The police then set out to trace the body and on Thursday discovered the decomposed, severed head of the girl. ""On Friday, we discovered the torso after which the body has been sent for postmortem,"" said Verma. ""All five have been arrested under sections 302, 201, 120(b), 313, 366 and under POCSO provisions.""Meanwhile, SSP H N Singh suspended chowki-in charge of Shahbagh Nagar and has removed the SHO of Modinagar police station.

The floods had otherwise hit four other districts. On the agriculture land in the core Supaul and Araria districts, four to six feet of sand deposits had been caused by the flood that occurred due to breach in eastern Kosi efflux bund in 2008.""The purpose of the project is to remove the sand deposits and reclaim the land concerned for agriculture purposes,"" Prem said, adding that the agriculture department has prepared the project with World Bank aid worth Rs306 crore.

An unidentified person took the call and said that Shiva had been kidnapped and will be released if they pay Rs 45 lakh. Later, some residents of Shiva's village, Navipur, about 10km from the city, informed his family that they had seen him return from school on his bicycle. They argued that even if he was kidnapped, he must be in close proximity. The teenager's family and villagers began a frantic search and found his body in a nearby sugarcane field late in the night.The postmortem of Shiva's body was conducted at 2 am on Tuesday, but his family refused to take the body till the killers were found. Meanwhile, police have assured them that the case would be solved within three days and are combing the area on foot and with drones for further clues.""A case has been registered against unknown persons under IPC sections 302 ( murder ) and 364 A (kidnapping for ransom) at Bhawanpur police station. On Tuesday, the teen's family refused to cremate his body. It was only after SSP's assurance that they performed the last rites. We will crack the case in three days,"" said Kartar Singh, SHO, Bhawanpur police station.According to the FIR, Shiva's sister Shikha called him at 3.30pm on Monday when he did not return from school. She was surprised to hear an unidentified man on the line who asked for a ransom of Rs 45 lakh and wanted the money to be delivered in the neighbouring state of Haryana.Sources said that Shiva's kidnappers got a whiff of the manhunt and so shot him dead inside a sugarcane farm. A local had seen four men go inside the farm, after which the villagers surrounded the area. That was when they heard a gunshot.""Drone cameras are being used to check for clues. A water bottle, a shirt and a pair of slippers have been found from the spot. Some people have been detained for questioning and efforts are being made to arrest the culprits,"" said Meerut SSP Manzil Saini."

The land affected in Khed, Maval and Mulshi talukas is hilly and blessed with heavy rainfall, forests, wildlife sanctuaries, major and minor dams. The land here is fertile, suitable for growing rice and sugarcane, practice floriculture, dairy and poultry farming, develop nurseries and practice other agricultural activities.""Paigude said, ""The state government implemented many projects like creating industrial areas, IT parks, affecting many villages. The government plans to implement more development projects in these areas, which will destroy the livelihood of the remaining farmers . If the urbanization and industrialization continues, it will lead to massive increase in population, crime, destruction of environment and other problems.""Villagers have suggested that the road pass through barren land instead.""A letter has been sent to CM Devendra Fadnavis opposing the project. These three talukas must be excluded from PMRDA limits. Instead, villages in the eastern parts of the district, which have undeveloped talukas like Baramati, Daund, Indapur and eastern parts of Shirur, must be included.

Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said September 15 was the cut-off date from which water could be released for single crop. Water could not be released to the 45,000 acres of double crop areas in July this year (for kuruvai) owing to lack of water. The PWD should release water on time at least for both the double crop and single crop areas for samba, he said.With rains becoming erratic, there is a possibility that the storage may not improve significantly. The available water should at least be made available to farmers, he added.Politicising releaseM. Murugan, president, Periyar Single-Crop Area Farmers Association, said some tanks had filled up. If the water was released, loss due to evaporation and percolation would be less. M. Tirupathi from Kulamangalam charged the PWD of not independently deciding the date of release and politicising it. Two years back, we had to protest for the release of water despite adequate availability in the dam, he said.R. Mahalingam, president, Periyar Irrigation Farmers Association - Vadipatti, said water should be released only for the 45,000 acres of double crop area from Peranai to Kallandiri. If the water is released for the entire 1.5 lakh acres, including single crop areas, none will get benefited. Instead, if it is released to the double crop areas alone (for the second crop), at least the farmers there will get a good yield, he said.T. Subramanian, Executive Engineer (Periyar-Vaigai Circle), PWD, said they had just made a proposal for releasing water to the 14,707 acres of double crop area in Cumbum Valley from September 25. For releasing water to Cumbum Valley, the water availability should be at least 1,200 mcft. However, for releasing water for both the single and double crop areas in Madurai, the storage should at least be 6,000 mcft.

Krishnappa Gowda Paddambail, who works at the Government College of Teacher Education here, has been cultivating 30-50 kilos of paddy on the roof of his home in the Maroli area for five years. He does not sell his produce.Childhood memories of paddy cultivation at his familys ancestral farmland near Sullia, and the memory of waiting for hours at a place of worship to procure stalks of paddy for a ritual, made him plant paddy in ten grow bags in 2014. The number of bags increased as his home-made bio-manure gave him bountiful harvests, free from paddy blast fungus and other diseases.Unlike traditional cultivation, Mr. Paddambail uses water minimally, and his bags of soil mixture, sand and cow dung last four years with careful maintenance. He turns coconut husk into hanging planters. After de-husking, he fills soil and ties up the husk to hang it around the house.Crop rotationThe 120-day paddy cultivation cycle begins in April-May and he grows only one crop, distributing the harvest among friends and relatives. He then uses the same bags to grow radish, a three-month crop. Last year, I harvested 10 kilos of radish, Mr. Paddambail says. He also grows fruits, vegetables and turmeric on his 1,200 sq. ft. terrace. Last year, he got eight kilos of turmeric.The urban farmer has three grow bags of sugarcane, which he has stopped purchasing for the Ganesha festival. The garden provides drumstick, yam and guavas, too.Mr. Paddambails garden boasts a pomegranate tree, although the coastal region is a non-traditional area for the fruit. The yield is low. I have been getting five or six fruits for three years. Unlike pomegranates of the dry belts in central and north Karnataka, its taste is very sour. But it makes a good juice, he says."

Karjol said in the Legislative Council on Tuesday.Mr. Karjol told Shashil Namoshi (Bharatiya Janata Party) during question hour that many people had applied for cards meant for families living below the poverty line (BPL) even though they were not eligible. While not a single BPL card was issued in Bangalore Urban and Rural districts or the Informal Ration Area and the new areas under the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, the distribution of such cards to ineligible families was found to be rampant in all other districts.Mr. Karjol said more than 1.18 crore cards, including Annapoorna, Anthyodaya, Akshaya and APL (above the poverty line) cards had been issued. About 4.3 lakh applications had been received for new cards in the Bangalore Informal Rationing Area, and 1.93 lakh applications from people in the former seven City Municipal Council areas. The applications were being processed, he said.Leader of the Opposition H.K. Patil pointed out that there were many complaints from the public that they had not received ration cards, and the reason given by officials was that the cards were being computerised. This had put people to great inconvenience, and the Government should take action, he said.CoD inquiryCooperation Minister G.T. Deve Gowda told Quazi Arshad Ali (Janata Dal-S) that an inquiry by the Corps of Detectives had been ordered into irregularities in three cooperative sugar factories in Bidar district. The charge against one of the factories, Mahatma Gandhi Cooperative Sugar Factory Ltd., was that it had incurred a wasteful expenditure of Rs. 38.37 lakh on the purchase of substandard machinery in July 2003. Contractors and gangmen who cut sugarcane had incurred losses of Rs. 1.5 crore, while Rs. 71 lakh was spent on civil works without clearance from the State-level Advisory Committee. False claims had also been made that share certificates had been issued to shareholders.Molasses decontrolWhen the discussion touched on the molasses decontrol policy and the Chief Ministers announcement on decontrol of molasses a few months ago, Chairman B.K. Chandrashekar said the subject deserved to be taken up for a lengthy discussion as it concerned lakhs of farmers.Mr. Deve Gowda told M.P. Nadagouda (Janata Dal-U) that the Government would soon implement the recommendations of the Prof. A. Vaidyanathan Committee set up by the Centre to revitalise cooperative institutions.ConditionsAbout Rs. 450 crore would be available from Central funds as a one-time package, but this would be conditional. Mr. Patil said the Government was being deliberately coy about admitting that the condition was that the Government should give up nominating officials to the boards of the cooperative institutions, and this dithering was causing untold misery to the lakhs who depend on cooperative institutions for short- and long-term finance."

After 132 days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), he now weighs 3.72 kilos, and is out of intensive care. the his parents will take him home on Sunday. Doctors at Surya Hospital in Santacruz, which treated Nirvaan, said that he is probably Indias most premature baby to have survived.Nirvaans mother, a 34-year-old Bandra resident (who has asked not to be named) had what seemed to be a normal pregnancy, but on May 12, she suddenly went into labour. Nirvaan was born with extremely underdeveloped organs.In the NICU, 14 doctors across specialities and over 50 nurses took care of Nirvaan around the clock. He spent six weeks on a ventilator and another six weeks on a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine. He also needed steroids for a month (to reduce lung inflammation and bring him off respiratory aids), antibiotics and insulin therapy (to handle rising sugar levels from the steroid treatment), multiple blood transfusions, laser treatment (he had developed retinopathy).He had to be closely monitored all the time, says neonatologist Dr Nandkishor Kabra. He required high intensity respiratory support as well as several doses of surfactant injections for development of lungs. At times, we lose our fight when such babies develop internal bleeding or air accumulation in the lungs but fortunately the baby did not develop any such complications.Dr. Haribalakrishna Balasubramanian, neonatologist, says, For the first six weeks, we could not say anything about the outcome. We had found very limited evidence worldwide about the survival rate of such babies. But this one was a fighter.Nirvaan is going home with a completely clear heart, brain and bone scan, says Dr Bhupendra Avasthi, director of Surya Hospital.Nirvaans name means bliss, and thats what his parents are feeling. His mother said, Since his birth, I never let even one negative thought cross my mind about him. We have seen him gone through a lot, but finally we can now have some parental bonding that we missed out as he was in the NICU. The parents spent an estimated Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 lakh for the NICU care. His father refused to divulge the exact amount but said, It was expensive, adding, Those who have the resources should definitely give their babies a chance.Infants born between 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy are termed periviable, which means that the foetus may not survive outside the mothers womb. Medical experts say that nearly 50% babies delivered at 22 weeks are born dead; of those born alive, less than 5% survive."

Roadside vendors have put up makeshift counters, especially in the Tamil inhabited tea estate area of Elappara.Palmyra jaggery was once used abundantly in the High Ranges as a sweetening agent in coffee. It was gradually replaced by sugar in households. Now, again it is the turn of palmyra jaggery. There is wide belief that palmyra jaggery prevents diabetes and contains minerals required for the body.Kannan, a palmyra jaggery vendor at Karuntharuvi, said he procured the product from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu where it is homemade. The price is Rs. 120 a kg for jaggery, Rs. 220 for palm sugar crystals, and Rs. 250 for palm jaggery mixed with pepper powder. If bought in bulk, vendors offer discount of Rs. 20 for each item per kg, said Kannan.Like sugarcane, jaggery can also be derived from Palmyra sap, date palm and coconut tree sap. Tirunelveli is known as a major supplier of palmyra jaggery in the country.Though palm jaggery production is round the year, sale in the district is limited to the monsoon and winter seasons."

Mr. Madhwaraj said an expert report would be sought on whether the factory can restart operations in its existing building and equipment, or if a new building and new equipment were required.The report will also focus on the amount of funds required for reviving the factory. After getting the report, a delegation of legislators from the district, under the leadership of Oscar Fernandes, MP, will meet the Chief Minister, the Minister said. He directed the board of directors of the factory to submit the expert report to the Director of Sugar through the Deputy Commissioner. It is essential to increase the sugarcane crushing capacity of the factory to 1,500 tonnes a day. The defunct equipment should be disposed through an auction, Mr. Madhwaraj said.Mr. Fernandes said the factory used to operate at a time when farmers could not make use of the Varahi riverwater. Now, farmers could take advantage of the Varahi Irrigation Project, the first stage works of which has been completed. The project is providing water to 3,800 hectares.Generating fundsThe funds required for rejuvenation of the factory could be generated by selling 25 acres of land belonging to the factory. This could also be used for construction of a government medical college and hospital. A plan should be drawn to make the factory run 10 months a year. This will help farmers to grow sugarcane throughout the year, he said.Pratapchandra Shetty, MLC, said that already 2,800 farmers in the district have pledged to grow sugarcane. Prompt payment should be made for the cane supplied by the farmers, he added.Satyanarayana Udupa Japti, general secretary of the district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangha, said sugarcane cultivation requires only half the investment of paddy cultivation. Farmers can cultivate the cane required for the factory. There is no question of cane growers facing losses, he said."

But the dairys business turned dull and it currently owes about Rs. 7 crore to farmers for the milk procured in the last six months and another Rs. 1 crore to the employees who remain unpaid in the last two months.Detailing the efforts being made to put the dairy on recovery path, its Managing Director Dr. K. Prasad says, We are in an advanced stage of negotiations with the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), which had been providing 3 to 4 lakh litres per day to the milk powder unit earlier, to get enough orders to keep it running again.We are also in touch with private dairies like Heritage, Dodla and Creamline dairy to run the milk powder unit to its full capacity from October when the slack season ends, he explains. The dairys turnover fell from Rs. 175 cr. to Rs. 150 cr. last year and the downturn continued during this year as well.Loan requiredEfforts are also being made to secure a loan of about Rs. 15 crore from financial institutions in about a fortnight to clear the dues of farmers and step up milk procurement to at least 40,000 litres per day during October-March period to break even. A team from Ongole dairy is likely to visit Anand in Gujarat shortly for a possible tie-up for a turnaround, Mr. Prasad adds in a conversation with The Hindu .Echoing similar views, TDP affiliated union leader B.V. Srinivasa Rao says it was the NDDB which had bailed the Ongole dairy from an earlier crisis in the 1980s when the milk powder unit was dysfunctional. The intervention of NDDB, which propelled the operation flood programme, is necessary at this stage to bring the dairy out of the red at a time when it faces stiff competition from 60 to 70 private dairies, he adds.The cooperative dairy should be saved at any cost to ensure a fair competition with private dairies and in the process ensure a decent return to the dairy farmers in the drought-prone district, feels Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham district secretary P. Venkat Rao.The dairy had a modest beginning in 1972, procuring 12,000 litres of milk per day. The procurement rose to 50,000 litres per day in 1980s and NDDB sanctioned a loan of Rs. 21 crore to start a milk powder unit, but it remained in disuse till 2005 when the NDDB, as per an agreement, took charge of it after waiving interest on the loan and ensured regular orders for it."

After 132 days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit , he now weighs 3.72 kg, and is out of intensive care. His parents will take him home on Sunday. Doctors at Surya Hospital in Santacruz, which treated Nirvaan, said that he is probably Indias most premature baby to have survived.Nirvaans mother, a 34-year-old Bandra resident (who has asked not to be named) had what seemed to be a normal pregnancy, but on May 12, she suddenly went into labour. Nirvaan was born with extremely underdeveloped organs.In the NICU, 14 doctors across specialities and over 50 nurses took care of Nirvaan around the clock. He spent six weeks on a ventilator and another six weeks on a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine.He also needed steroids for a month (to reduce lung inflammation and bring him off respiratory aids), antibiotics and insulin therapy (to handle rising sugar levels from the steroid treatment), multiple blood transfusions, and laser treatment (he had developed retinopathy).He had to be closely monitored all the time, says neonatologist Dr. Nandkishor Kabra. At times, we lose our fight when such babies develop internal bleeding or air accumulation in the lungs but fortunately the baby did not develop any such complications.Dr. Haribalakrishna Balasubramanian, neonatologist, says, For the first six weeks, we could not say anything about the outcome. We had found very limited evidence worldwide about the survival rate of such babies. But this one was a fighter.Nirvaan is going home with a completely clear heart, brain and bone scan, says Dr. Bhupendra Avasthi, director of Surya Hospital.His mother said, Since his birth, I never let even one negative thought cross my mind about him. We have seen him go through a lot, but finally we can now have some parental bonding that we missed out as he was in the NICU."

5a144e139855b76bf13e31b9,Sugarcane farm labourers rescued,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/sugarcane-farm-labourers-rescued/article19740123.ece,2017-09-23,"Nearly 25 labourers working in allegedly exploitative conditions on a sugarcane farm in Margowdanahalli in K.R. Nagar taluk near here were rescued by the police and officials of the Mysuru district administration recently.The labourers were sent to their respective houses in Hunsur, Mandya and Tamil Nadu, the contractor, Ramaiah, and his son, Ravi, who had employed them, were arrested and remanded in judicial custody.An official from the Saligrama police station told The Hindu the contractor, who had taken up the work of harvesting sugarcane from the local farm owner, had paid the labourers between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 20,000 in advance.Though the understanding was that their wages would be deducted from the advance the contractor did not pay them the minimum wages and was prolonging their work, the police official said, adding that the allegation was that the labourers had been trapped in the situation and were unable to clear their advance and free themselves.Four persons working on the farm were found to be minors.The labourers, who were shifted from one farm to another for work, were allegedly not provided proper accommodation.Though the minimum wages is Rs. 320 per day per person, the labourers were deprived of their due wages. The contractor would deduct money for various purposes, besides his own commission, police said.The police has booked cases under various provisions of Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act 1976, Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Act and Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act 2016.Meanwhile, the International Justice Mission (IJM), an NGO, said the labourers were forced to work about eight to 12 hours on an average daily.Sugarcane cane harvesting is a labour-intensive process that involves careful cutting and handling procedures to maintain high sugar content and cane quality. Each bundle is expected to weigh around 10 kilos and the contractor demanded that 100 such bundles should be stacked by each labourer daily. If the weight of the bundle fell below 10 kg then the contractor would deduct a count of 30 to 40 bundles from the total bundles lowering their final wages, he said.IJM representative William Christopher, in a statement, said the local residents claimed that there are thousands of people working in bondage in many farms."

The department had fixed Rs. 242 crore for 2016 season. But, it could not achieve the target due to failure of both South West and North East monsoons. Cooperative institutions had extended crop loans to the tune of just Rs. 90 crore in 2016.Of the current year target, the department has so far disbursed crop loan to the tune of Rs. 105 crore to the farmers, who have raised paddy in the kuruvai season in a few areas mainly in Lalgudi. Similarly, farmers, who have raised various crops such as sugarcane, tapioca, groundnut, turmeric, maize and onion in Musiri, Thuraiyur, Uppiliyapuram and Lalgudi, have also been extended crop loan.K.C. Ravichandran, Joint Registrar of Cooperatives, told The Hindu that the distribution of crop loan would gain momentum once the Stanley reservoir in Mettur was opened for delta irrigation. The increasing water level in the dam had raised the hope that it would be opened shortly.Crop loan target had been fixed for all 140 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) depending upon the coverage area. Out of Rs. 276 crore, about Rs. 170 crore would be disbursed for raising samba crop. Instructions have been given to the PACS functionaries for avoiding controversies and complaints while disbursing loan.Mr. Ravichandran said the societies would not charge interest from farmers for crop loan as the government would pay the interest to the PACS on behalf of farmers."
