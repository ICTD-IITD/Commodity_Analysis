He was addressing cooperatives in New Delhi at a function marking the the birth centenary of Maharashtra-based cooperative leader Laxman Madhav Rao Inamdar.It is natural for the cooperative sector to grow and shine in India. There are several sectors where the cooperative sector can help make a positive difference. See what best practices to adopt and give up the old ones and move ahead, he said.Boost economyHe asked cooperatives to venture into new business areas like beekeeping and seaweed farming to help farmers double their income by 2022 and boost the rural economy. Stating that farmers are facing many problems, Mr. Modi said there was a need to establish a system to ensure farmers buy and sell at wholesale rates.Observing that cooperatives were mainly present in sugar and dairy sectors, the Prime Minister said the cooperative system suited to India and there was a need to foray into new areas.He said sectors like neem oil production and beekeeping are fertile grounds for cooperatives to step in. Even in fishery sector, additional work can be provided to fishermen during off-season by encouraging them to go in for seaweed farming, he said, adding that seaweed was in great demand in the pharmaceutical sector."

Kedar, CEO of JSW Foundation.Addressing a meeting at Vasavya Mahila Mandali (VMM), Dr. Kedar said their mission against malnutrition was a blend of action-research and evidence-based advocacy.Explaining how the award-winning project was being implemented in Karnataka in partnership with the State Department of Women and Child Development, he said the unique CSR project was fighting malnutrition and bringing radical changes in the practice and policy framework.He said spirulina was an algae, bluish green in colour which had plenty of nutritional values.Pointing to the fact that 38% of children suffered malnutrition in the country, he said a childs brain fully develops in the first 1000 days of birth. Malnutrition at this stage would result in serious problems in future for the child, he said.He said spirulina was a supplementary food which showed good result.BenefitsSpeaking about the many benefits of spirulina, he said it was inexpensive, easy to produce locally had long shelf life and was easy to store and transport.He said national institutions like Central Food Technological Research Institute and National Institute of Nutrition were recommending spirulina as a micronutrient supplement.Member Secretary, AP State Planning Board and CEO of Smart AP Foundation B.

5a1458729855b76bf13e36d7,Make the rules for nutrition security,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/631278/make-rules-nutrition-security.html,2017-09-03,"By Shweta Khandelwal, Sep 3 2017, 22:18 ISTIndias epic regulation to prevent more than 800 million people from starvation on the one hand, via the national food security act, and a proposal to impose as high as 28% sin tax on tobacco, alcohol and other unhealthy items, on the other, needs huge applause.Even the recent shutting down of multiple outlets, in excess of 160, of a junk food corporate, although over alleged financial disputes, is a brilliant move in the arena of public health and nutrition regulation. Although late, these regulatory and policy endeavours may go a long way in improving Indias currently abysmal public health and nutrition scenario.More than two decades old now, the national nutrition policy (1993) failed to provide any substantial leadership or results in tackling the multiple forms of malnutrition in the country. We only saw an almost stagnant undernutrition rate during this time, along with a rise in the obesity burden and pervasive, multiple micronutrient deficiencies.Well-intended, evidence-based regulation and its effective implementation will lead to sustainable gains in public health by reducing the morbidity and mortality burden, empowering consumers to make informed choices, keeping the industrys misleading conduct and dubious practices in check, and translating into economic benefits.Consider smoking, for example. No one stopped when they were told that smoking may cause cancer. But taxing cigarettes, banning advertising, setting age limits for selling tobacco products and restricting smoking in public places made it both an imperative and easier for many people to stop, and also discouraged new ones from taking to the habit; obesity and chronic diseases have dropped after enforcement of strong policies (restrictions on trans-fats in Denmark; taxation of carbonated and sugar-sweetened beverages; mandatory front-of-pack labelling; workplace interventions, physical activity promotion, breastfeeding promotion).Industry endorses self-regulation but spends billions of dollars on misleading advertising in the name of innovation and creative independence, which encourages us to overeat unhealthy foods. They portray government regulation as a feature of a nanny state that deprives people of the freedom to exercise their will.We all know that the meal with free toy becomes the default choice of the kids and thus their parents. Advertisements blatantly showcase that consumption of cool  read ultra-processed foods, high in sugar, salt and fats) foods and drinks will lead to better social acceptability. Is this not arm-twisting using marketing and advertising gimmicks? Is this not leading people to make unhealthy choices?Economists say that just obesity and its related consequences can cost us $190 billion annually. Modelling estimates suggest that interventions as simple as mandatory food labelling may reduce obesity prevalence by 2.5-6.5%. About 15 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life year, a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death) per annum can be averted by simple policy interventions. Research also shows that several simple public health and nutrition (PHN) interventions can be clubbed for a cost-effective response.Threats and possibilitiesSome challenges that merit our attention when we think of PHN regulation: a) the regulations coverage, format, who will be excluded and why? b) Synching advertising guidelines with proposed regulation (for example, banning junk food advertisements and their sale near or in childrens spaces); c) how will we include or bring in restaurants, small joints, takeaways, unorganised sector as stakeholders? d) Collaborations (vendor/small manufacturers associations, civil society, licences); e) Implementation and surveillance.Some strategies that may enhance the impact of regulation may include strengthening regulatory agencies like the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India; state-wise compulsory participation, empowering nutrition research institutions which may provide high quality evidence to influence what works and what doesnt in local context, constituting independent unbiased group of experts and advisers to collate evidence and present to decision-makers, partnerships among stakeholders, reducing corruption, consumer awareness camps, short-term licensing and renewal based on compliance with set criteria or guidelines for food safety, transparency and accountability checks, time-based outcome analysis results, setting up robust and sustainable surveillance system.Above all, efforts to make all involved bodies work in-sync with opportunities to constructively criticise and discuss issues. In fact, it will be good to invest in a baseline (pre-regulatory landscape) and then make periodic changes in key health outcomes. The states can standardise these measures and the Centre can collate these as a part of standardised surveillance system to monitor PHN.We must collectively advance from mere feeding to nurturing. Let us broaden our focus to care about public health and nutrition security than mere food security. As the legendary German writer and statesman Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.(The writer is Associate Professor, Public Health Foundation of India)"

It makes four 'advance estimates' in the course of the year.This is expected to hit rural incomes in some areas, although the government said the harvest of 134.67 million tonnes, estimated with the help of inputs from states and other sources, would still be 5 per cent higher than the five-year average of 128.24 million tonnes.""The country has adequate stock of foodgrain. So on food security front, there is nothing to worry about. But farmers in rain-fed areas may be hard-hit and their income might go down if prices don't recover,"" said former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain.He said lower production may hit rural economy and buying capacity of farmers. ""The government has to ensure farmer gets minimum support price for pulses, soyabean and cotton . Also, a stable trading regime needs to be ensured for commodity prices to recover.""Experts said food prices are likely to remain steady. This year's monsoon is about 5 per cent below average, but some parts of the country were flooded while others were relatively dry, hurting kharif output.However, the recent surge in rainfall will help the winter-sown, or rabi, crop because of good soil moisture and more water in reservoirs.Production of rice, the main kharif crop, is estimated to be 94.48 million tonnes, or 1.98 per cent less than the previous year. There was a small drop in paddy acreage, to 37.68 million hectares from 38.18 million hectares a year earlier, on account of deficient rains in a number of districts in Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.""Rice is one commodity in which we have been self-sufficient since 1991-92,"" grain analyst Tejinder Narang said. ""There are unlikely to be a spike in prices. In winter, planting of rice will take place in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which can make up the deficit.""Output of kharif pulses such as tur, moong and urad is estimated at 8.71million tonnes against 9.42 million tonnes last year. The ministry cited a shift by farmers to more remunerative crops like sugarcane and cotton for this 7.5 per cent fall in production.Lokesh Goenka, managing director of U Goenka Sons that trades in agriculture commodities, said this would have no major impact on prices in the short run. Area under pulses this season was 14.12 million hectares, 3.47 per cent less than last year.Production of oilseeds such as groundnut, soyabean and castorseed is estimated to decrease by 7.68 per cent over the previous year to 20.68 million tonnes, with farmers shifting to urad, sugarcane and cotton on expectation of higher profitability, the government said.Solvent Extractors' Association of India president Atul Chaturvedi said the Indian farmer was losing interest in the oilseed crop as it was not remunerative compared with others.Sugarcane production is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes, higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year. Area under sugarcane has increased by 9.4 per cent .According to Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association, ""The government's estimates are very similar to ISMA's which was 340-345 million tonnes. ""Despite an 18.68 per cent increase in area coverage this season, lower productivity of cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales in 2016-17, said the ministry."

A majority of people in the country consume green leafy vegetables, milk and milk products, sugar and jaggery and other nutritious foods in quantities lower than recommended daily allowance ( RDA ).This has been telling on the general health of people in India, leading to non-communicable or lifestyle diseases. One in every three people in urban areas suffers from high blood pressure while one in four complains of high blood sugar levels. One in three men consumes alcohol and one in seven smokes. Coronary heart diseases occur in Indians 10 to 20 years earlier than people in West.Only half of 1-3 year old children (56%), two-third (68%) of 4-6 year old children and half of pregnant women (56%) in India consume adequate amounts of both protein and calories. Even though the prevalence of underweight (25%), stunting (29%) and wasting (16%) among under five is lower than rural and tribal children.The city-based National In stitute of Nutrition (NIN) has compiled a database on diet and nutritional status of urban population. . It is based on a research study lead by Dr Avula Laxmaiah, head of the Division of Community Studies.Various ICMR and non-ICMR institutes participated .The report said the prevalence of stunting is the highest in Uttar Pradesh (40.8%), followed by Maharashtra (36.4%), New Delhi (35.7%) and West Bengal (34.4%) and lowest in Puducherry (11.6%).The prevalence of hypertension among urban men and women is 31% and 26%, respectively.

As far as diabetes is concerned, AP and Telangana together have 22.7 per cent of men and 8.6 per cent of women, who reported high blood sugar levels. The city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), which entered its 100th year on Tuesday, has released updated data with regard to nutrition and non-communicable diseases among urban men and women in the country. According to the report, the overall prevalence of hypertension among men and women is 38.5 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Among men the prevalence is high in Kerala 46.6 per cent), followed by Assam (45.8 per cent) and Maharashtra (43 per cent). Among women it is high in Kerala (38 per cent), followed by Assam (36 per cent).

It came to light during the recent collectors conference held here. On the underweight and acute malnutrition among children below five years in the State, the ICDS has submitted the 2015 data to show that the situation is improving in the State. When asked to a senior official regarding presenting the 2015 data, he said that they used the data to compare it with the 2005 data to show improvement in the span of 10 years. He further claimed that the 2015 data is almost similar to that of 2017.Going by the 2015 data, 36.8 per cent of children in Vizianagaram district are underweight or malnourished. Krishna district has only 17.5 per cent malnourished children - the least in the State.The rise of malnutrition among the children is reportedly due to the short break given to the Balamrutham scheme after the bifurcation of the State. However, the AP government brought back the scheme in July 2017.Under the scheme, baby food (balamrutham) is prepared with roasted wheat flour, roasted Bengal gram flour, skimmed milk powder, sugar, refined palmolein oil and fortificants like vitamins and minerals at 50 per cent as per the Central government norms. Each pack of the 2.5 kg balamrutham is filled in a 2-layer laminated flexi pouch as a take-home ration and each pack meets the requirement of one child for a month  100 grams a day for 25 days. The Anganwadi centres are distributing the balamrutham mix to the children aged between 6 months and 3 years.Similarly, as part of the mid-day meal scheme, children aged between 3 years and 5 years are being served with spot meals with rice and vegetables with four eggs in a week at the anganwadi centres. The severe malnourished kids will be served with milk in addition to the daily diet.H Arun Kumar, Commissioner of WD&CW department, said, We are strictly monitoring these two projects with special teams from village-level to district-level. Soon, we will implement some real-time monitoring on these projects. Malnutrition doesnt solely depend on the food, it also related to sanitation, genetics etc. We are trying to make healthy children in the State."

Pictures by Ashwinee PatiBhubaneswar, July 17: Sushama Mishra, 55, a diabetic, had to browse through almost all medicine stores in the city today to find the drugs prescribed to her, thanks to the short supply of medicines since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into force from July 1. The GST replaces the multiple taxes levied by the central and state governments and has subsumed all the indirect taxes. ""My doctor prescribed me Galvus Met, an essential drug to control blood sugar. I went to drugstores at Capital Hospital, but to no avail. I visited several stores at Kharavela Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Acharya Vihar and Saheed Nagar, but in vain. Finally, I found it in a medicine shop at Khandagiri, that too, after looking for it for at least five hours,"" she said, blaming the government for the poor implementation of the GST. This is not an isolated incident as many customers and suppliers continue to suffer from the post-GST impact. Among them, patients appear to be the worst hit. Things have become difficult because of the short supply of drugs by pharmaceutical companies, which, according to the city-based pharmacists, have either not updated the post-GST prices or are still confused about its impact and hence remain far from making a re-assessment of the medicine prices. Many medicine stores here have run out of stocks. A medicine store owner at Kharavela Nagar, Bidyadhar Bohidar, said problems with regard to over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol and Saridon were few, but short supply of medicines for diabetes, blood sugar, and cancer was causing hardships for many. ""Tenomac is a frequently used drug for high blood pressure. It is a daily medicine for a patient. Irregularity in its dosage might lead to serious health problems. I have at least 10 customers, who take this medicine from me regularly. But, I am unable to provide them the medicine since it is in short supply since the past fortnight,"" said Bohidar, adding that he managed it in the first week by borrowing from other stores. Amid such a scenario, the only stores that remain unaffected by the new tax structure are the Janousadhi shops of the Indian Red Cross. ""We have the stock of medicines according to our list of essential drugs. Our sale remains the same both before and after the implementation of the GST. It has not been affected in any manner,"" said a Janousadhi store operator at Unit-IX. However, with most of the doctors not prescribing generic drugs, many patients find it almost futile to visit the Janousadhi stores. ""I was diagnosed with Type-II diabetes last month. Since then, I have been taking Glucophage, a drug meant to control my sugar level. My medicine stock was exhausted a day ago. When I visited the Jan Ausadhi store, I was told that they did not have the drug and instead asked me to purchase the generic drug called metaformin. I am confused,"" said Unit-IX resident Nihar Patra."

Structural changes to capitalism in today's age, he said, have resulted in the persisting world economic crisis. ""The persistence of the world economic crisis, which is now spreading to countries like India and China can be attributed being rooted in certain structural changes in world capitalism in the current period of globalisation,"" said Patnaik. ""It has for the first time in the history of capitalism that a significant relocation of activities has been noticed from the north to the south through the agency of metropolitan capital. Neo-liberal capitalism, even before the crisis, had entailed a major shift in income distribution away from the workers towards the surplus earners in metropolitan economies. The social gulf between the workers and these groups has widened in advanced countries under neo-liberal capitalism. Increase in income inequality, and its implications for democracy are matters of concern. ""Class organisations such as trade unions have weakened under the neo-liberal regime. The intelligentsia has lost its moral credibility. The world of mediapersons, literati, and even academics - whose social distance from the working people widens under the neo-liberal regime - is perceived as beneficiaries of neo-liberalism and hence a part of the 'establishment'. The fact that all over the world, from the US to Europe to India, fascist and semi-fascist forces are on the rise, it is the outcome of this particular conjuncture,"" he added. Fresh start Commerce and vocational course students of Patna Women's College organised a welcome for the freshers on Friday.

The dozen-odd RJD ministers assembled there and went in unison to the old secretariat, the venue of the cabinet meeting. Sources said Lalu instructed them not to say anything in haste and keep quiet when facing journalists. The RJD ministers' cavalcade clearly spelt out Lalu's stand - that were Nitish to ask deputy chief minister Tejashwi to put in his papers, all RJD ministers would also quit - not withstanding entreaties by Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Ashok Choudhary, who was working overtime as a peacemaker in the ruling Grand Alliance. Tejashwi was recently booked in a CBI case for possessing disproportionate assets after the agency raided a dozen locations in various parts of the country connected to Lalu and his family members. RJD ministers murmured about Nitish's ""non-democratic"" style of functioning, pointing out how they are treated as lesser ministers and never primed about agendas taken up for discussion in the cabinet. ""Mostly, we get to know about the cabinet agenda only after we sit at the meeting,"" said a senior RJD minister. ""Ever since the Grand Alliance government was sworn-in, cabinet agendas have been discussed only at five or six meetings. We grope in the dark and look like fools at the meetings, as we are unable to prepare anything on the agendas that are related to public welfare,"" a senior RJD minister said. ""Old-timers said that earlier, agendas were circulated three days before cabinet meetings to allow ample time for ministers to evaluate them. But the tradition has been done away with. We, too, are part of the cabinet and the issues should be discussed for democracy's sake."" Labour resources minister and RJD leader Vijay Prakash said: ""Many times, we get the agenda just before the cabinet meeting and are unable to understand anything or speak on the matter. Our ministers raised the issue a few times, but nothing changed."" However, all RJD ministers participated in today's cabinet meeting, which took up 17 agendas, among them creation of Bihar Vikas Mission, prohibition laws and other new laws made by the state government. The state government has decided to constitute committees at the panchayat, block, urban local bodies, district and headquarters levels to keep a tab on public distribution system (PDS). ""The state level committee on PDS will be headed by the concerned minister, while district committees will be headed by ministers in-charge of those districts,"" cabinet secretariat principal secretary Brijesh Mehrotra said. In another decision, Bihar has decided to purchase software from the Odisha government to bring transparency in the mines and minerals department to curb misuse of challans and other such documents unscrupulous elements use to siphon off natural resources. At times, more than one truck is used on a single challan to transport minerals. The software will cost Rs 50 lakh, and its installation another Rs 49 lakh. The cabinet also decided to give relief to sugar mills in the state from ""purchase tax"" on sugarcane for the financial year 2016-17. After the cabinet meeting Tejashwi and health minister Tej Pratap, led by BPCC chief Ashok Choudhary, met Nitish in his chamber. It is believed they discussed the assets case."

""We will encourage such teas in the future too,"" he added. Handcrafted teas are hand-rolled. Normally teas are rolled on rolling tables. When manually rolled, it is important to know just how much pressure to apply so that the leaves do not break. ""The plucked leaves are withered by placing them on shallow bamboo trays or mats for 14 to 16 hours under ceiling fan. After they wither to the desired level, the leaves are hand-rolled on bamboo mats. The oxidation process follows. Finally, they are dried in a small cabinet drier. Handmade teas are graded as whole leaf teas,"" senior manager of Donyi Polo garden, Manoj Kumar, told The Telegraph.

Nirav Patel of Nilkanth Enterprise said the tea has got a very nice taste with a good body. ""The strength is just perfect here. One doesn't need to add sugar while having the tea,"" he added. Teas from Arunachal Pradesh fetch an average price of Rs 140 at the GTAC. In 2016-17, 2.68 million kg of tea from Arunachal was sold at GTAC. The average price that orthodox tea from Arunachal Pradesh fetches is Rs 258.48.

Picture by Ashok Sinha Diabetic Prashant Kumar and leprosy patient Nikita Ranjan recently had to run around several stores in the city to get their medicines, and many in the trade said there was a drug shortage because of the goods and services tax (GST). Nikita, an Anandpuri resident, went to three shops last week in vain to get Dapsone, her skin medicine. She finally got the drug from a shop on Govind Mitra Road. Boring Road resident Prashant too could get his blood sugar medicines only on the fourth try. ""I first went to Navrup Medico near the planetarium but the person at the shop said there was a shortage of a few medicines because of billing issues with the introduction of GST,"" said Nikita. Navrup Medico owner Sunil Kumar admitted some drugs were unavailable at his shop, and blamed GST-implementation hiccups. ""Under the new system, the harmonised system nomenclature (HSN) code of each product has to be mentioned in the bill,"" Sunil explained. ""As the code is different for different drugs, it becomes a cumbersome job for stockists to make the bill - they have to feed the different HSN numbers for the products. It's a time consuming job. This is why drug warehouses are also taking time in billing because of which we stockists are getting less stocks and what we get are exhausted soon. At present, I don't have a few diabetes medicines and skin medicines. The medical representatives have, however, assured us that things will improve."" A person at Dadiji Medical Store on SP Verma Road admitted there was a shortage but said the situation had improved from around a month ago. ""We are facing little problem in procuring drugs,"" he said. ""Earlier, we would get all kinds of drugs from one distributor. Now we have to approach five to six of them. The problem was worse when distributors were confused about the post-GST prices and no one was purchasing any new stock. Now, the flow of medicines has improved. The shortage is likely to be over within a fortnight."" Another shopkeeper at Janata Medical Store on Boring Road blamed the crisis on chemists and wholesalers: ""Many drug sellers have not updated their software. Under GST, they won't be able to sell medicines until and unless they generate a proper bill."" Parsan Kumar Singh, president, Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association, said chemists who did not generate bills for medicines sold in pre-GST days were the ones facing problems now.. ""Those who sell drugs with proper bills shouldn't face any problem,"" he said. ""They only have to make little changes to the billing procedure.

The study ruled out the possibility that the results can be explained by unhappy men comforting themselves with sugary treats.Lead researcher Dr Anika Knuppel, from University College London's Institute of Epidemiology and Health, said: ""High sugar diets have a number of influences on our health but our study shows that there might also be a link between sugar and mood disorders, particularly among men.""There are numerous factors that influence chances for mood disorders, but having a diet high in sugary foods and drinks might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.

5a1477d49855b76bf13e47aa,"Wholesale, retail prices firm up",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170815/jsp/business/story_167318.jsp,2017-08-15,"New Delhi, Aug. 14: Retail as well as wholesale inflation turned sharply higher in July, but remained far below the RBI's comfort level of 4 per cent, adding noise to the clamour for lower rates. Retail inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), jumped to 2.36 per cent in July on a yearly basis after easing for three straight months. The rise in the CPI was driven by hardening of prices in sugar and confectionery items, pan, tobacco and intoxicants. However, there was disinflation in the food basket. The RBI, which factors in CPI for arriving at its monetary policy, had earlier this month slashed the key interest rate (repo rate) by 25 basis point to 6 per cent. However, the industry expects a bigger rate reduction. Another macro-economic indicator for July showed that the wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose sharply to 1.88 per cent - the first rise in five months - as some food articles turned dearer even as the industry pitched for a cut in interest rates citing weak industrial activity. With the prices of tomatoes jumping up sharply in July, WPI inflation in vegetables shot up 21.95 per cent. According to CPI data released by the Central Statistics Office, food inflation saw deflationary pressure at (-)0.29 per cent in July against (-)2.12 per cent in June this year. While vegetable prices in July were 3.5 per cent lower than the same month last year, they have been rising on a sequential basis. The RBI had noted this in its bi-monthly policy review. ""There are now visible signs, however, of the usual seasonal price spikes, even if with a delay and especially in respect of tomatoes, onions and milk,"" the RBI said. However, India Inc believes that there is room for further rate cut by the RBI to boost investments from the private sector and revive industrial growth. Industrial output had hit a four-year low and contracted 0.1 per cent in June, mainly on account of a decline in manufacturing and capital goods sectors. ""Given the trend and outlook for inflation, we see clear space for a more accommodative stance in the monetary policy. This is all the more important, given the state of industrial sector where growth is anaemic,"" said industry chamber Ficci. The mid-year economic survey tabled in Parliament last weak had said that with inflation ruling low, there was scope for reducing the RBI's key policy rate by 25-75 basis points. On the inflation data, economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg in a tweet said: ""Both WPI and CPI inch up in July at 1.88 per cent and 2.4 per cent year on year. But still below the comfort level of 4 per cent."""

There are several sectors where the cooperative sector can help make a positive difference.""He asked cooperatives to assess how farmers' income can be doubled by 2022 through their movement. ""See what best practices to adopt and give up the old ones and move ahead,"" he said, while asserting that rural India should not be left behind in the growth path.Stating that farmers are facing many problems, Modi said there is a need to establish a system to ensure farmers buy and sell at wholesale rates. ""Today, farmers buy at retail rate and sell (their produce) at wholesale rates. Can it be reversed? If they buy (inputs) at wholesale rates and sell at retail price, then nobody can loot them, not even middlemen,"" he said.Farmers associated with dairy cooperatives have grown as they buy and sell milk at wholesale rates, Modi said adding that farmers would not have earned more had they sold their produce to private firms. There is a need to build such cooperatives to ensure better income to farmers, he added.Observing that cooperatives are mainly present in sugar and dairy sectors, the Prime Minister said the cooperative system suit to India and there is a need to foray into new areas. He also gave examples of sectors in which cooperatives can help farmers in raising additional income.For instance, he said, there is demand for neem oil for coating of urea fertiliser and woman farmers can collect the key basic ingredient required to make the oil. Another area is beekeeping, where farmers can bring 'Sweet Revolution' through cooperative movement. It is not only honey but there is a big market for beewax worldover, he said.Even in fishery sector, additional work can be provided to fishermen during off-season by encouraging them to go for seeweed farming. Modi said there is huge demand for seaweed in pharma industry and its juice can be used to boost soil health. ""Cooperatives can bring change in rural economy through small initiatives like this,"" he noted.The Prime Minister also asked cooperatives to self-reflect whether the ""cooperative spirit"" has got lost in its legal structure. It is important to keep the spirit intact, he added.Modi recalled his association with cooperative leader Inamdar saying that he was a person of inspiration and learnt many facets of his life after his death. Stating that Inamdar was an ""unknown"" figure but he contributed immensely to the nation through cooperatives, Modi said. ""The first success mantra of cooperative is that the leader works behind the scene taking everyone along.""Inamdar led cooperative movement and formed 'Sahakar Bharati' way back in 1979 in Mumbai, Maharashtra.The Prime Minister also released two books on Inamdar and other nine important leaders of cooperataive movement. He also gave mementos to seven cooperatives for excellent work.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and two Minister of States, Krishna Raj and Gajendra Singh Shekawat, were also present."

(File photo | Reuters)NEW DELHI: India's rice output is likely to fall by 1.9 million tonnes (MT) to 94.48 MT in kharif season this year on account of poor rain as well as floods, official sources said.The production of pulses and coarse cereals is estimated to have fallen, dragging the overall foodgrains output in kharif (summer-sown) season to 134.67 MT from a record 138.52 MT in last kharif, as per sources.Kharif foodgrain basket comprises of rice, pulses and coarse cereals. Harvesting will start from next month. Barring sugarcane, the production of all major kharif crops is likely to decline.The Union Agriculture Ministry will release its first advance estimate on Monday.Rice ouptut is estimated to fall at 94.48 MT in the kharif season of the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the record 96.39 MT in last kharif, the official who did not wish to be named said. Pulses output could drop to 8.71 MT from the record 9.42 MT due to depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur and urad are pegged at 3.99 MT and 2.53 MT, respectively. Coarse cereals output is also seen lower at 31.49 MT against 32.71 MT in last kharif season.Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69 million tonnes from 306.72 million tonnes.Oilseeds output is estimated to be down at 20.68 MT in the kharif season of this year from 22.40 MT in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22 MT.The fall in kharif output is attributed to dry spell as well as floods in some parts of the country. The overall southwest monsoon, crucial for rain-fed kharif crops, was projected normal, but till first week of this month it was less by five per cent.Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states.The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting."

5a147bae9855b76bf13e4ac6,Herb link to anti-ageing,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170803/jsp/nation/story_165295.jsp,2017-08-03,"(From left) Steve Thomas Pannakal, Subarna Saha, Daryl James and Namita Misra New Delhi, Aug. 2: Scientists with L'Oreal, the world's largest beauty company, have discovered that an extract from an ayurvedic herb can extend the lifespans of yeast cells and roundworms and activates anti-ageing effects in human skin cells. The scientists at the company's Research and Innovation Centre in Bangalore had set out to study the effects of the herb Chlorophytum borivilianum, commonly known as safed musli and described in ayurvedic texts as a health promoter that delays ageing. Their studies show that yeast cells gain about 30 per cent and roundworms an extra 10 per cent in lifespans when exposed to a polysaccharide, a chain of sugar-like molecules, extracted from the herb's roots ground to powder in a household mixer. While the longevity effects might appear alluring, the researchers say it is the effect on the skin that might be relevant to the cosmetics industry. The polysaccharide appears to activate biological pathways that contribute to maintaining moisture and reversing age-associated alterations in human skin. ""These lab results look promising, but they need to be further validated,"" Namita Misra, a senior biologist who led the studies told The Telegraph. Misra and her colleagues have just published their findings in the journal PLOS One. Ancient ayurvedic texts classify safed musli in the armamentarium of Rasayana medicines that have long been claimed to enhance immunity against diseases, rejuvenate the body and delay ageing. Scientists have known that safed musli is rich in polysaccharides. And studies in the past have hinted at anti-ageing effects of polysaccharides isolated from other sources. In 2003, scientists at the University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris demonstrated that a polysaccharide from a bacteria slowed down skin ageing and reversed age-related changes in the geometric features on human skin through tests on 20 women volunteers aged between 39 and 71 years. Five years ago, a team of researchers at Nanchang University in China found that a polysaccharide from a mushroom called Ganoderma atrum improved age-associated changes in cells. The Bangalore researchers collaborating with colleagues in France and the University of Oxford crushed the roots of the herb and extracted a polysaccharide-laced liquid which they dropped into petri dishes containing yeast cells and Caenorhabtidis elegans, or roundworms, both popular species in longevity studies. Their studies have also pointed to the likely molecular mechanisms through which the polysaccharide extends the lifespans of the yeast cells and the roundworms. ""The polysaccharide appears to act on the complex biological pathways that lead to ageing,"" said Steve Thomas Pannakal, a team member in Bangalore and the lead author of the paper. On human skin, the researchers detected activation of the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and a protein called CD44. In ageing skin, the levels of both are reduced and, the scientists believe, the polysaccharide's effect on the skin may work through improved moisture and reversal of age-associated skin changes. ""These are very interesting findings - we need to be doing more such studies to understand the molecular basis for claims made in ayurveda,"" said Subhash Lakhotia, a professor emeritus at Banaras Hindu University who was not associated with the Bangalore study."

There wont be any inquiry against anyone and no one would be expelled from this organization, Khot said while avoiding a direct criticism of Shetti. We have a target of raising a force of 17 lakh members from 353 talukas of Maharashtra, he added.Khot also said he would contest the Lok Sabha polls from Hatkanangale constituency in Kolhapur district in 2019. Shetti currently respresents the constituency in Lok Sabha.Last time, I contested the Lok Sabha election from Madha. I had no network in that area and still I was able to get 4.64 lakh votes. However, Hatkalangale constituency is close to my heart. I have worked there so I will easily defeat anyone, Koth said.Khot and Shetti started out together in politics, especially farmer agitation, in Kolhapur district as part of the Shetkari Sanghatana started by the late farmer leader Saharad Joshi in the 1980s. In the late 1990s after differences arose over an agitation for better sugarcane and milk prices, they formed a separate organization.Initially they aligned with local Congress leaders but drifted away to join hands with the BJP just ahead of the 2014 elections. After Khot became a minister last year, differences between him and Shetti started surfacing."

Naidu offered holy water laced with turmeric, kumkum and flowers to the river before performing the harathi.Later, he inaugurated the Narasapuram anicut (barrage) constructed with an estimated `16.17 crore which aims at providing irrigation to nearly 3,500 acres in and around Kasimkota and Anakapalle mandals. Later, Naidu visited a photo exhibition and addressed a public meeting at Gobbooru. He announced `27 crore for a new irrigation project at Tummapala under the Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi scheme, ensuring irrigation waters for 19,541 acres.Women offer harathi to Sarada river at Narasapuram | ExpressI have sanctioned the fund and the works will begin at the earliest, the Chief Minister said.Naidu said that the government had undertaken Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi project to ensure adequate irrigation and drinking water from Godavari river at an estimated budget of `22,002 crore.He promised that the land acquisition process would be completed soon and the project will be ready before the next general elections.During his address, the Chief Minister rolled out statistics to explain the importance of water resources and the measures initiated by the government in this regard. The government is already spending nearly `40,000 crore on irrigation sector and ready to allocate `10,000 crore more. Additional funds of `10,000 crore available under the NREGS can also be utilised for the works, he said. As many as 4,017 village tanks, 15 lakh borewells, 1,135 lift irrigation units, 5,500 connecting tanks and 58,000 check dams have been set up in the State. Recently, we have finished the project of 6.16 lakh new connecting tanks. Fortunately, the North Andhra districts have a good groundwater reserve and farmers should dig for borewells to increase the crop acreage, but the water must be used prudently, he said.In a bid to create awareness among people about the importance of water and other natural resources, Naidu said the government has introduced three festivalsYeruvaaka, Jalasiri Ki Harathi and Vanam-Manam to safeguard the natural resources, especially water. Only half of the total 2 crore acre fertile land in the State have access to irrigation water. Another 20 lakh acres will be benefited after all the proposed projects are grounded. I suggest farmers to go for fruit cultivation so that the acreage can be increased from the present 40 lakh acres to 1 crore acres. Farmers must also concentrate on dairy trade, Naidu said.He exhorted the people to make use of the Praja Parishkara Vedika helpline (1100) to register complaints about the inconvenience at government offices. I promise that each complaint registered through 1100 toll-free number will be solved, he said. Later, he administered the Jalasiri Ki Harathi pledge to the gathering and assured that funds for the next phase of DWCRA loan interest waiver amounts would be released soon.

Internet services resumed in the hills for the first time since the June 15 agitation last night - coinciding with Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung's decision to withdraw the strike. People, too, flocked to the main market in the heart of the town to shop for dresses for the Dashain festival. The district administrations of Darjeeling and Kalimpong had imposed the ban on Internet services, including mobile data, on June 18 after media reports that the scattered Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leadership was devising strategies for the agitation through WhatsApp. ""Since early this morning, I started receiving pending messages on my WhatsApp. It was a pleasant surprise,"" said Rajesh Tamang, a Darjeeling resident. The residents of the hills had faced a lot of inconvenience following the embargo on Internet. The ban had impacted the filling up of online forms for college admissions and banking facilities. # ""The first thing I did after Internet resumed was check all my emails and reply to the important ones. This is such a relief,"" said a hotelier. The businessman said he had faced major problems in filing or paying sales taxes, provident fund, professional tax and income tax returns. ""Only I know the hardship I had to face. At times, I had to go to Siliguri just to access the Internet. Sometimes, I went to vantage points to receive signals from mobile towers in Sikkim,"" the hotelier added. Another Darjeeling resident said: ""I could not renew my life and health policies when the Internet was shut. That was the first thing I did even though Internet speed was not very good in the morning."" With the Dashain festival having started, a large number of people thronged the streets of Chowk Bazar in Darjeeling where many shops reopened today. The traders said there was little prodding from the administration to open shops, unlike on Sunday when the police had banged on the shutters. ""Some traders opened shops fearing their shutters would be banged again. Slowly, a lot of shops reopened today. In fact, today saw the highest number of shops reopen at Chowk Bazar,"" said another trader. About 60 per cent of the shops at Chowk Bazar were open today. ""There was a movement by the general public. Since the shops in my area opened, I, too, decided to up my shutters,"" said a shopkeeper. Yesterday, just a handful of shops had opened in the Darjeeling market, fearing attacks on them by statehood supporters. Senior police officers, including Darjeeling superintendent of police Akhilesh Chaturvedi, stationed themselves at Darjeeling Motor Stand till late afternoon. Scenes were similar in Kurseong and Mirik. ""With Phulpati, which is part of the Dashain festival, just a day away, many residents seemed to have started preparing for the biggest celebration,"" said a businessman. Phulpati is a unique custom of the Gorkhas in which they collect flowers, petals and other offerings like sugarcane from their homes and take them to temples to pay obeisance to goddess Durga. The items are then wrapped in a red cloth - the colour symbolising the goddess - and carried in a decorated palanquin, which is accompanied by an ornate umbrella."

The initiative received a great response from the public at the sales mela held at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI).Around 1,000 people visited the mela and purchased nearly 2,000 packets of the product. The mela was conducted as part of popularising the new soil-less medium among the public. In addition, bookings were made for around 5,000 packets.The Ernakulam KVK, functioning under the CMFRI, developed the soil-less medium by using composted pressmud, a by-product from sugar mills along with coir pith, powdered cow dung, neem cake, dolomite and biocontrol agents. Around 70 people approached the Business Desk at the mela expressing willingness for commercial production of the soil-less medium. They were provided technical details regarding investment and raw materials needed to manufacture the product.We are happy the product has been well-received. Many people have approached us for using KVK technology to manufacture the product on a commercial scale. KVK will provide training to them in immediate future. With the scarcity of quality soil posing a challenge to the organic farmers in the city, the new soil-less mix will be a great advantage to them for growing vegetables and other plants. One packet of the product weighing 10 kg can be used to grow one plant and no grow bag is required, said KVK head Shinoj Subrahmanyan. KVK will conduct another mela on September 26, Shinoj said.

5a1481959855b76bf13e4fdd,The thrill of surrender,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/opinion/story_174792.jsp,2017-09-25,"Now the fun starts... We have been waiting all year. The Pujas. Everybody in Bengal knows what that means and savours the magic sound of that endearing word. The pull towards Calcutta, to 'home, sweet home', becomes irresistible. Planeloads land from New York and Los Angeles, from Singapore and Bangkok, every passenger with the Pujas ""written on his glad brow"". It is a homecoming not only to family and friends, but to the para and to Bengali food, to syrupy Bengali sweets, and, of course, to the pandals with Durga and her famous retinue... to these oh-so-familiar vibrations of exuberance in the air. Students, whose noses are being pushed down to their books all year by their parents and teachers, can look up and disembark from their torture chambers and, with no feelings of guilt and remorse, abandon themselves to all the distractions, holy and worldly, that come their way. After all, their teachers let themselves go in much the same way. The Pujas are a time out of time. They are basically a celebration of family life. Look at the pantheon of gods... They, too, have sons and daughters. This time of the year it is not just Kali and Shiva, Krishna and Radha, but the entire divine joint family taking up position as if for a group photo. Next we will see Kartik taking selfies of his clan. Bengali society is so family-friendly that the celestial population has just no choice but to mirror this trait. As in life on earth, the gods too are not known simply by their names, but by their ranks in the family hierarchy and their relation to the seniors. Isn't it heart-warming that the gods are so human? The gods descend on earth to assume the life of humans or, more precisely, of Bengalis. Our gratitude goes to the gods that they love exactly what Bengalis in their festive moods love: brightly coloured saris, creme-coloured dhotis and wide panjabis. Do they also like Bengali sweets? Rosogolla, sandesh, payesh? Look how they gobble them up when these are reverently placed in front of them. The only difference is that the gods never get a tummy upset even after eating so much sugary stuff. It proves that they are truly divine. Bengalis are tremendously fun-loving. After Durga Puja follows a string of other pujas; the purna kumbha forever overflows. The energy infused into fun and banter, into the pride of new clothes and the camaraderie never seems to ebb away. It's a gift which is one of the reasons why, in all these decades, I have never wanted to move away from West Bengal, it's why I live here: to savour the joyous energy, particularly of young people. When I arrived in India at the age of 24, I participated in every puja available in the course of the year. I lived in the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narendrapur where certain pujas were celebrated in a very different way from the para pujas in the city. They had a sattvic atmosphere of sanctity and reverence. Extrovert enthusiasm was muted, but the vibrations of otherworldliness were all the stronger, supported by wafting scents and music, by bells and an abundance of flowers. Which did I love more, the para pujas with their deft charm, or the ashram pujas? I enjoyed them both for what they are... Where in Germany would we have milling crowds as in Calcutta, such a sea of gleaming faces with glittering white teeth? In German we have that picturesque expression, to take ein Bad in der Menge, literally meaning, to take ""a bath in the crowds"". It is that feeling of letting oneself be pushed and shoved by wave upon wave of human bodies and yet not get drowned. But we do need such teeming crowds to conjure up that special celebratory mood. We need the glaring lights and the blaring noises to give us that overwhelming sensation of ""too-muchness"" (as Salman Rushdie characterized Indian city life) to which we surrender our senses. It is like in a Bollywood blockbuster which drives the story from one climax to the next at a frenzied speed. 'Mood' is the key-word here. Oh, don't Bengalis have their moods... That make them amiable and that make it sometimes difficult for them to steer an even, disciplined course. Those moods give the city the gift of celebrating with abandon. True, it makes people prone to forgetting practical considerations, but it also makes them less money-minded, less consumerist, less ambitious for quick and easy recognition. It makes them inclusive, reaching beyond one's own community of caste, class and religion. These moods are normally graced by magnanimity. Moods are, alas, also a good reason to shirk hard work and adamant perseverance. Khushwant Singh related the following episode in his autobiography: after Partition when all educated young people in India grabbed any work they could get, the young men in Calcutta were choosy; many said, on being offered a particular job, that it did ""not suit their temperament"". On the one hand, it is the reply of a proud and confident mindset, on the other, it is fraught with dangers if you have material survival or even a career on your mind. Looking at them with the calculating mind of an economist, the Pujas are a colossal waste of money. So much could be done with it. The hungry fed, the unhoused sheltered, the sick given medicine, the illiterate schooled. But on the balance sheet of life not only rupees figure. I imagine that the thrills of the Pujas, enjoyed to the full, give many Calcuttans the will and fortitude to persevere during the coming months, maybe the entire year, accepting the many obstacles and vexations that they must overcome daily to just survive with dignity. The Pujas are a therapy, a tonic, a consolation in the face of the inequalities and inequities of one's life. It is an investment in mental equilibrium and strength. It is also an investment in the artistic qualities of common people who have so little opportunity to develop and express them in their humdrum daily life. The Pujas give us the opportunity to be, for once, in harmony with ourselves, our human environment and with cosmic reality, including the gods and goddesses, the asuras and the rishis. The Pujas envelop us with a grand universe of symbols and meanings, reviving them, making them relevant for us once again and thus nurturing our souls. Even the noise and the fun, the hoi-halla of the Pujas are part of establishing that harmony all around us and feeling one with it. Yet, I will be excused to insert a 'but' here. This feeling of being in harmony with ourselves and with the universe can be obtained only at a price. That is: only after hard and dedicated work can celebrations be enjoyed. It is like breathing: we can breathe out only after having breathed in first. Habitual loafers are unable to celebrate; superficial and insincere persons cannot really surrender themselves to the cleansing waters of celebrations. Their sense of celebration will, too, remain superficial, and the benefit they reap from it will be minimal. So the agenda of the Pujas is simple: let us work sincerely and earn the grandness of the celebrations and their spiritual benefits of being one with family, friends and all humanity."

He was 95. His fiance of 25 years, Denise Baker, said he died of dysphagia pneumonia at Palm Garden Nursing Home, where he been admitted for hospice care recently. A ""good-for-nothing bum kid"" with a terrible temper, as he later described himself, LaMotta learned to box in an upstate New York reformatory, where he had been sent for attempted burglary. After going undefeated as an amateur after his release, he turned pro in 1941 and unleashed his enmity on dozens of ring opponents. He ultimately became a pop culture symbol of rage when the director Martin Scorsese told his story in his 1980 film Raging Bull, based on LaMotta's 1970 memoir of the same title, written with Joseph Carter and Peter Savage. Robert De Niro won an Academy Award for his portrayal of LaMotta. LaMotta was able to absorb a flurry of punches only to unload a more brutal barrage on an opponent. He would, as he wrote in his memoir, ""charge out of the corner, punch, punch, punch, never give up, take all the punishment the other guy could hand out but stay in there, slug and slug and slug"". Ray Arcel, one of boxing's most renowned trainers, said of LaMotta, ""When he was in the ring, it was like he was in a cage fighting for his life."" Best remembered for his six bouts with Sugar Ray Robinson, LaMotta won 83 fights (30 by knockouts), lost 19 (including a ""fix"" to which he belatedly confessed), and had four draws. He captured the middleweight championship in June 1949, stopping the titleholder, Marcel Cerdan, and was knocked down only once in his 106 fights. Scorsese made his film long after LaMotta had squandered his money - he said he made $1 million in the ring - and had gone through a series of stormy marriages, been sent to prison once more and ballooned into obesity. ""I would think that Jake thinks it's a movie about himself,"" Scorsese told The New York Times shortly after Raging Bull was released. ""But those who think it's a boxing picture would be out of their minds. It's brutal, sure, but it's a brutality that could take place not only in the boxing ring but in the bedroom or in an office. Jake is an elemental man."" LaMotta boxed more than a thousand rounds with De Niro, tutoring him for a role that brought him the Academy Award for best actor. Cathy Moriarty, in her professional acting debut, played LaMotta's second wife, Vikki, a beautiful blonde who endured a chaotic marriage. LaMotta had mixed feelings about the film. ""I kind of look bad in it,"" he told The Times. ""Then I realised it was true. That's the way it was. I was a no-good bastard. It's not the way I am now, but the way I was then.""

5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."

Salaria was booked for rape on the complaint of a former airhostess working in his airline in 2014, and now Langah is facing same charges. This has exposed the SAD-BJP alliance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks about empowering women, but see what the alliance leaders are up to, said Sidhu.There is nothing more important than the character of man. It is up to you to decide whom you want to see in Parliament, a characterless leader or Sunil Jakhar, who is a senior Congressman with a clean image, Sidhu asked voters.JAKHAR QUESTIONS SUKHBIRS SILENCEMeanwhile, Jakhar questioned the silence of SAD chief Sukhbir Badal on Langah.Addressing party workers during a series of meetings in Batala, the Punjab Congress chief said Sukhbir had not bothered to utter a single word on the issue though two days has passed since the police filed a rape case against Langah.Charging the Badals with destroying Punjab, Jakhar attacked former CM Parkash Singh Badal and accused him of garnering votes in the name of the Panth and farmers and failing to do anything for them, as exposed by incidents such as Behbal Kalan (Fardikot) firing and farmer suicides.He also came down heavily on the Badals for tagging him as an outsider, saying he had been taking up issues of all areas of the state first as the leader of opposition and now as Punjab Congress chief.Describing BJP candidate Swaran Salaria as a sarmaydaar (businessman), Jakhar said a person who did not understand the pain and anguish of the people could not take up their issues with the Centre.The ill-conceived and anti-people policies of the SAD-BJP government had led to the closure of 80% of the industry in Batala. Also, sugarcane farmers had not got their dues for the past two years, forcing them to commit suicide, Jakhar said.(With PTI inputs)"

Picture by Hardeep Singh Ahead of Durga Puja, Bihar-based Sudha Dairy milk pouches will be dearer by Rs 2 across Jharkhand from Friday, but Jharkhand's home-grown rival Medha decided not to increase prices right now and instead introduced two products, ghee and peda, on Thursday. The CEO of Jamshedpur Dairy, the Adityapur-based plant of Bihar State Co-operative Milk Producers' Federation (Comfed) that markets products under Sudha brand, Md Zamiruddin said after the Rs 2 hike a litre of plain milk would cost Rs 38, Sudha tea special Rs 40 and full cream milk (Sudha Shakti) Rs 42. Pouches of 500ml of plain, tea and full cream milk variants will cost Rs 20, Rs 20 and Rs 21, he added. Justifying the hike, he said, ""Diesel prices are on the rise, electricity tariff was recently revised and we are paying more to farmers from whom we procure raw milk."" Sudha supplies around 3 lakh litres milk on an average to Jharkhand a day while demand peaks by 25-30 per cent in the festive season, Zamiruddin said, but they were ready to meet extra demand. Ranchi-based Medha managing director B.S. Khanna said they would take a call on hiking prices after the festivities. ""We won't increase price as yet,"" he said, anticipating an increase in demand for Medha after Sudha's hike. Right now, Medha, a smaller company, supplies 75,000 litres of milk a day, with its plain variant costing Rs 36 and full cream variant Rs 40 a litre. On their two new products that hit retail shops on Thursday, Khanna said an 500ml jar of Medha ghee came for Rs 500 and a 200gm box of pedas for Rs 70. ""On ghee, we are giving Rs 10 off as an introductory discount,"" he said. Ranchi sweetmeat shop owners also said a price hike was likely.

According to the first advance estimate released today by the agriculture ministry, the production of all kharif crops - rice, pulses and coarse cereals - is projected to decline from the record 138.52mt last kharif. Harvesting will start from next month. According to the latest data, rice output is likely to fall by 1.9mt to 94.48mt this year from the record 96.39mt in the previous kharif. Pulse output could drop to 8.71mt from the record 9.42mt because of depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur is estimated to be lower at 3.99mt from 4.78mt, while urad output may rise to 2.53mt from 2.17mt in the last kharif season. Coarse cereal output is also seen lower at 31.49mt, against 32.71mt in the gone-by kharif season. Maize output is pegged at 18.73mt against 19.24mt a year ago. Oilseed output is estimated to be down at 20.68mt compared with 22.40mt in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22mt against 13.79mt last kharif. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the earlier 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69mt, from 306.72mt before. Production of jute and mesta is estimated to decline to 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) from 10.60 million bales last year. The overall monsoon was projected normal, but till the first week of this month, it was less by 5 per cent. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced a dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states. The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting. Sugar production The government is expecting about 24 per cent increase in the country's total sugar output to around 25 million tonnes in the marketing year beginning next month on likely higher output in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra following good rains, an official source said. This is an initial projection based on the inputs of the state governments. The estimate, however, is in line with the industry body ISMA's projection. The country's sugar output in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) is estimated to be lower at 20.2 million tonnes because of poor rains. India is the world's second biggest sugar producer. In a meeting with state cane commissioners called by the Union Food Ministry, official sources said state governments have submitted the sugar production figures after assessing the likely sugarcane output and recovery level. Based on their inputs, the country's overall sugar output is expected to be around 25 million tonnes in 2017-18 marketing year, the sources said."

And the panel will seek answers for the delay, if any, said a Noida authority official.Apart from discussing homebuyers issues, the ministers also discussed civic issues in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas.The committee took up civic issues as the three industrial development authorities which had been formed for industrial development also take care of the civic work.Residents complain that the three authorities are allegedly unable to address civic issues adequately and, hence, they have demanded a municipal body to be formed to properly look after civic issues.Keeping in mind this demand, the ministers panel formed two separate committees with an aim to address civic and traffic issues.The committee headed by Dr Prabhat Kumar will work to streamline municipal functions in the three authorities. Noida authority chairman and chief executive officer Alok Tandon will head the committee that will work on improving traffic management.The panel formed two committees for better municipal functioning and addressing traffic congestion issues. Now, detailed terms and reference will be drafted under which two committees will function. Once terms and reference will be made, we will select the members of these two committees to start our work, said Kumar."

The suspects told them that the Ganga canal bridge on the main route was damaged and suggested a back road.The victims took the detour and it was there that they forced the motorcycle to pull over, beat up the husband and dragged the three to a sugarcane field, police said.After this, one of the men placed a sharp-edged knife against the victims sons neck as they took turns raping her. After committing the crime, they escaped uninterrupted, said an officer at the Bhopal police station, the closest to where the incident occurred.According to him, the barely-conscious woman approached a passerby farmer who called the 100 emergency line.Circle officer, Bhopa, Rijwan Ahmad, said that on the basis of the FIR, a case had been registered under sections 323, 376D and 506 of the Indian Penal Code.Police inspected the crime scene with the victim and collected evidence.Senior superintendent of police Anant Dev Tiwari also reached the spot and instructed Bhopa police to speed up the search for the suspects."

Following committees visit to Greater Noida, chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow announced that the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway will deliver 50,000 flats in three months. However, the builders did not have an action plan for the delivery of flats.In the run up to the ministerial panels visit, the Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon on Tuesday evening met with 15 builders and discussed the action plan of delivery of the flats to homebuyers. Supertech, Amrapali, Jaypee Group, ABA Corp, Gardenia Glory and Antriksh among others met the CEO in his Sector 6 office.The CEO discussed problems of each project with the respective builders. He met three builders at a time and heard problems that are delaying a housing project. We hope that now builders will start delivering flats because the new policy of clearing 10-15% of the land dues for obtaining occupancy certificate will help them a lot, said Amit Modi, vice-president of CREDAI (western UP) and director of ABA Corp.Greater Noida has 203 housing projects out of which 82 are critical in nature and builders owes 7,200 crore debt to pay to the government. The Noida authority in around 90 housing projects needs to recover 10,215 crore land dues from the builders. The Yamuna authority struggles to recover around 3,000 crore from 13 builders. In the three areas, thousands of homebuyers suffer as the builders have delayed housing projects for four to eight years.Officials said that if the builders are unable to deliver their respective flats even after the new scheme, it would mean they do not wish to deliver the flats.I do not think the builders will not deliver now. I am very positive about the new scheme and hopeful of it working out well for both the builders and buyers, said Manoj Rai, director of Gardenia Glory housing project stuck due to financial crisis in Sector 46."
5a148eb09855b76bf13e5898,Does Noida need a municipal body? Panel set up to look into need for one,http://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/does-noida-need-a-municipal-body-panel-set-up-to-look-into-need-for-one/story-bJYfgJ73eWFs7UNtHoqrYN.html,2017-10-07,"A committee has been set up under the leadership of the divisional commissioner (Meerut) Prabhat Kumar to analyse the municipal work in Gautam Budh Nagar.The report to be submitted by Kumar will suggest whether there is a requirement for a separate municipal corporation in the district or not.Details on the other members of the committee have not been released and a notification in this regard is likely within a week, Noida authority officials said.The Noida authority has been drawing flak from residents welfare associations and the district magistrate for not being able to perform civic duties in an efficient manner.District Magistrate BN Singh had written to the state urban development minister Suresh Khanna highlighting alleged shortcomings of the Noida agencies in handling civic responsibilities.The DM, in his letter, had clearly said that during an inspection, he found out that the Noida authority has failed to clean the drainage system.He had also mentioned that the slum areas are in a bad shape.Encroachment on the sides of the road was also mentioned as the failure of authority. People defecating in open was also a matter of concern in the letter.The district magistrate had also mentioned that the authority has failed to address the ongoing massive issue between the builders and the buyers so its obvious that it cant pay much attention to the civic work.Singh had said that the Noida authority has failed in the upkeep of the city as it also had to handle several other responsibilities such as industrial development.Following the criticism, chief executive officer (CEO), Noida authority, Alok Tondon took a serious note of the issue and assigned the complete responsibility of municipal work to additional chief executive officer (ACEO) RK Mishra.Earlier, too, Mishra was looking after the municipal work but he had other responsibilities as well.Now the ACEO will now only be focusing on municipal work. Issues such as parking was previously handled by another department of the authority but from now on, it will come under Mishras supervision.We have given all responsibility related to municipal work to a dedicated ACEO in order to make him a centre point. Previously, he had other responsibilities also. Now, we have added all the possible municipal work to his portfolio, Tondon said.Tondon confirmed that a committee has been formed to analyse the municipal work in the district.The committee will be analysing the municipal work to decide whether there is a requirement for a separate municipal body or not. We are trying our level best to come up with every possible measure to ensure better municipal functioning, he said.When asked about the criticism by the DM and the suggestion of having a separate municipal body, Tondon said, When the authority was founded, municipal work was an important part of it. To create a separate municipal body, the state government will have to come up with a proper Act and/or amendments. I believe the authority is capable of handling this work, but the final decision will be of the government.The issue of having a separate municipal body was raised in a recent builder-buyer meeting in Delhi featuring state industries minister Satish Mahana, urban housing minister Suresh Khanna, cane development and sugar mills minister Suresh Rana, BN Singh and other officials of the Noida authority.It was after this meeting that it was decided that a committee would be set up to study the need for a separate municipal body.RK Mishra was not available for comment."

Here are excerpts from the interview.For the past two years, your Dussehra rally has been quite controversial. Why insist on holding it when the spiritual head of your community has opposed it?I have been going to Bhagwangad  the Vanjari communitys pilgrimage site  for the Dusshera rally for the past 15 years. After I joined politics, my father and I made it an annual ritual. His idea was that younger generation should get attached to Bhagwangad. Beyond politics, it was a way to bind people together in support of a good cause. I wanted to take that tradition forward. This Dussehra rally today is a matter of prestige and empowerment for lakhs of poor people, such as sugarcane cutters. I didnt want to disrespect Mahant Namdeo Shashtri, but lakhs of people wanted to attend this rally. So, we finally decided to hold it at Savargaon in Beed, which is where Bhagwanbaba, was born, instead of at Bhagwangad.Despite being a senior minister in the BJP-led government, your rally did not get a go-aheadI personally did not petition anyone, be it the superintendent of police, district collector or even the chief minister, for permission. Even before we could start preparing for such a rally, the mahant had sent a letter saying such a gathering would lead to a law-and-order situation. We were denied permission to hold the rally over security concerns. The BJP kept its distance as this was not a party issue.Do you see politics behind the opposition to you ?I think there has been a great deal of strength behind this opposition. Whoever is responsible for it will be exposed in the future.How do you respond to detractors, who often say your clothes and hairstyle are the reasons why you will not be accepted as the leader of your community?Yes, I have heard such loose talk. My people have accepted me with my open hair, in a salwar suit and with my attitude. They have accepted me because they see my father in me. Those who talk about my fashion sense or my hair are probably insecure men. Early in my political career, my father told me that I should not pretend to be someone I am not. I think that has worked for me quite well.There is a perception that you havent done as well in local elections.I have lost just one election  the Parli municipal council. I have won my zilla parishad, my district co-operative bank. Today, in Beed, five of six legislators are from the BJP, one MP is from the BJP. Our party has won six of eight municipal councils. I split the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in half. The one election I lost is discussed more than my victories.. that upsets me.Your stint as women and child development minister has been controversial. From the anganwadi sevika strike to allegations over take-home rations and the chikki scam, there have been several issuesI have proven all the allegations against me wrong. I contested the take home ration tenders issue in the Supreme Court. Though it shocked me initially, I decided early on not to hide I decided to face the media and these allegations head-on. I am in charge of the rural development department, which has not faced any allegations. This is because of the absence of lobbies right up to the taluka level. Within two days of the anganwadi sevika strike, I hiked their salaries by 35%. They now get paid Rs6,500 a month. When I took over, they were getting Rs4,000 a month. During my tenure, I gave them two salary hikes and have budgeted Rs363 crore for them. I am open to more discussions."

In 1972, his father Brig RS Randhawa (retd), an Armoured Corps officer commissioned into the 8th Cavalry, was camping near Nanpara village of Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh during a field exercise. The village falls in the Terai region and abounds in the jungles and wildlife immortalised through the shikar tales of Jim Corbett.After partition, many Sikh farmers settled here and turned an inhospitable terrain, swarming with perilous creatures, into profitable, agrarian tracts by sheer guts, blood and hard work. Senior Randhawa was hooked to Nanpara as wild boars, red junglefowl and even an occasional tiger roamed freely. He set up a farm here. Jyoti, thus, grew up with the many sounds and spectacles afforded by the Terai wilderness, especially on magical moonlit nights when hog deer and grunting boars would crash through vast sugarcane tracts.This childhood passion for wildlife evolved into an easy accompaniment to Jyotis travels across India and the globe to play professional golf. On one such golfing odyssey, he took time off to visit the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.Five of us got onto a machan made near a waterhole. A tigress and a cub came to drink water. After they left, a majestic male arrived. The male eased into water backwards to cool down and drink water, which was fascinating. One of my friends made the slightest of sounds, but that did not escape the tigers attention. After his bath, the tiger came lumbering towards the machan to investigate. One of my friends, whose legs were dangling down from the machan, quickly pulled them up, Jyoti recalls.Perched on the machan and holding on tightly, we shuddered at the thought of what would happen if any one of us were to be caught alone on the ground with this brute. But the funny thing was that as the tiger came under our machan, he somehow got unnerved. The king of the jungle turned tail and bolted from the spot like a stray dog, leaving us equally puzzled but thrilled to bits by this once-in-a-lifetime experience! Jyoti told this writer while playing the championship at the Chandigarh Golf Club.UNPROVOKED ATTACKThe dog bite mark on Rajiv Kumar Jatiwals leg. (VIKRAM JIT SINGH)You never know which stray dog is grinning at you in abject servility and which one may suddenly pounce on you and hack your flabby calves without so much as a warning bark. On October 8, professional golfer Rajiv Kumar Jatiwal Boney was playing a practice round ahead of the 1 crore Take Open Championship at the Chandigarh Golf Club. He mounted the vacant tee at the eighth hole bound to the west by thick bushes, and sought shade under a tree.A brown dog emerged from the bushes and quietly came up to me. I noticed it had a redness around the face and carried bite marks on the body. There was a look of madness in the dogs eyes. I turned and ran to get a golf stick, but the dog chased me and bit me under the right knee. I fell down, tearing a muscle in the left leg. I have spent Rs 18,000 on rabies and allied injections and have missed the championship due to this unprovoked attack, Jatiwal told this writer.On Friday, ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singhs path to the sixth hole tee was blocked by a dog. Uncertain of the strays intention and the Boney attack fresh in mind, Jeev was naturally apprehensive, as have other golfers been on numerous occasions.The areas dogs are neither neutered nor vaccinated and the adjoining Sukhna Lakes multiplying strays spill over to dig retreats in cool sand bunkers. Under the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, the club can get dogs trapped, neutered and vaccinated but they must be released back at the same spot.THE MARIGOLD HONOURA portrait of a long-tailed shrike atop marigolds (NITIN SONAWANE)If all goes well, the humble marigold will soon be declared Indias National Flower of Remembrance and December 7 as the National Day of Remembrance for soldiers who sacrificed their lives in wars. It is learnt that the Ministry of Defence has already accorded approval to these remembrance symbols and the three chiefs of the armed services are scheduled to meet on October 18 to sanctify the noble initiative.As part of the evolving India Remembers project, the marigold symbol is modelled on the same concept as the flaming poppy, which is the Commonwealth Flower of Remembrance, and November 11, which is established as Remembrance Day in western nations.The idea behind the project is that on December 7, which also marks the annual Armed Forces Flag Day, Indian citizens will be encouraged to identify a serving or retired serviceman or servicewoman, present them with a marigold flower and thank them for their service and sacrifice for the nation. The marigold has been chosen as the flower due to its rich resonance with Indias cultural and social life as also at funerals. It is an inexpensive, fine cut flower found across India, and blooms throughout the year.(The writer can be contacted at vjswild1@gmail.com)"

THR is a dry mixture of wheat, gram and soya bean flour, sugar and edible oil.Under a pilot project launched on October 5 in Banswara district, the woman and child department was providing four packets of THR to pregnant women for a month so that they need not visit centres four times, an official said.Pregnant women seldom visit aganwadi centres even though THR is given free of cost. We want to cut their visits to centre and give them four packets at one go for a month, said ICDS director Suchi Sharma.If the pilot is successful, the new system will be implemented across the state, she said.Sharma said malnutrition in Banswara is a big problem. One reason for this is women share the THR with their family when it is meant only for them, Sharma said.Sharma said the ICDS was also planning to involve NGOs to deploy nutritional advocate who will tell these women about the nutrition they require during pregnancy and while breastfeeding their child and efforts will be made to for behavioural change.Apart from pregnant women, the ICDS also provide supplementary nutrition to children up to 3 years, lactating women and adolescent girls.The pregnant woman, lactating mothers and adolescent girls get a pack of 950 grams and the children get 750 gm of the supplement every week.Each 100 gram of nutritional supplement has powder of wheat (50gm), chana dal (5gm), soybean (11gm), sugar (29gm) and edible oil (5gm).Rajasthan has 61,000 anganwari centres and Banswara has 1,979. Each anganwari centre has an anganwari worker and an anganwari helper.There were 3.6 million beneficiaries between January 1 and December 31, 2016. During this period in Banswara, 41,309 pregnant women and lactating mothers, 3,241 adolescent girls, 26,351 boys and 26259 girls were benefitted."

From hartals and satyagraha against the British rule, to movements after independence like the Emergency protests, kisan agitations, Mandal Commission protests, Jan Lokpal andolan, and the December 16 gangrape protests, Delhi has witnessed several shakeups that have had far-reaching social consequences. Because of the citys expansion in the last 70 years and with concerns about security, the venue for such events has undergone several changes.With the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banning dharnas at Jantar Mantar, which has served as the unofficial site for demonstrations for the last 25 years, Hindustan Times tracks the history of places for assembly and dissent across Delhi.Gandhis salt satyagrahaOn the final day of Dandi Satyagraha when Mahatma Gandhi produced salt from seawater in the coastal village of Gujarat on April 6, 1930, scores of Delhi residents gathered at the banks of Yamuna to defy the British legislation introducing tax on salt production.A few of them were subsequently arrested. However, the satyragrahis soon outnumbered policemen and the force had to back off.The same day, a public meeting was held at Queens Garden (now called Azad Park) located behind Town Hall in Chandni Chowk to mobilise support for the movement. The gathering here was addressed by senior city leaders of the time including Desh Bandhu Gupta, who pledged allegiance to the Mahatma.Queens Garden had become the epicentre of the freedom movement where political activities and agitations were frequently held after the imperial capital was shifted from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911.It was at Queens Garden when Kasturba Gandhi, on June 22, 1930, urged the nation to join the freedom movement after Mahatma Gandhi was arrested.Several public meetings during Khilafat and non-cooperation movement were also organised at Pataudi House near Daryaganj. It was here, that Mahatma asked people to boycott foreign goods, government services, schools, and colleges in November, 1921.Several such incidents are documented in the book Struggle for Freedom, the Role of Delhi: 1919-1934 by Reva Dhanedhar, director of History division at the Ministry of Defence.Sporadic protests would also be held at Town Hall Clock Tower, Feroz Shah Kotla, Jama Masjid, and in a park opposite the old St Stephens College building at Kashmere Gate. In the 1920s, a few rallies were organised outside the then city limits at a ground in Karampura, now west Delhi.Mirza Nasim Changezi (107), a freedom fighter living in Old Delhi, says indoor meetings were held at the residences of nationalists in the Walled City  Dr MA Ansari (Daryaganj), Hakim Ajmal Khan (Ballimaran), Asaf Ali (Kucha Chelaan), or Jugal Kishore Khanna (Dariba), which were frequently attended by Moti Lal Nehru, Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Maulana Mohammad Ali, Maulana Shaukat Ali, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and Mahatma Gandhi.Freedom fighters would also meet secretly at Fateh Garh in northern ridge area near Hindu Rao Hospital. The other places were the residences of Nawab Bangash at Chitli Qabr or Nawab Loharus havelis in Gali Qasim Jaan, where they schemed against the British administration. Meetings were held under the garb of mushaira and in the end, the messages were delivered, says Changezi, who claims to have worked closely with Bhagat Singh.Protest at Parliament HouseAs the character of protest changed post-independence, the concentration of dissenters also shifted to from Old Delhi to New Delhi, the seat of power. Agitators would often march till the gates of Parliament House to express disagreement with government decisions.Recalling his initial days of political activism in the 1950-60s, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader professor Vijay Kumar Malhotra (86) says there were no security issues back then. We could gather right at the threshold of Parliament House or Vijay Chowk, he said.Many of us would take scooters till the gates of Parliament House. I participated in agitations against the government decision of auctioning of plots and dwelling units to migrants. We would carry portable microphones. Sometimes, parliamentarians came out to hear our grievances, Malhotra said.Violence during demonstration seeking cow protection in 1966 led to restrictions on dharnas at Parliament, he adds.Some protestors tried to scale the gates of Parliament House. To control the crowd, the police had to resort to firing which killed 5-6 people. After the incident, protesters were barred from reaching the gates, he says.OP Jain (88), heritage conservator, says for big political rallies, Ramlila Maidan was the venue of choice. However, he adds, people who wanted their voices to be heard, would go to Patel Chowk, or sometimes they managed to reach the PTI Building at 4, Sansad Marg, near Parliament House.The presence of All India Radio and the offices of news agencies lured protestors to march towards Patel Chowk, he says, adding that there were hardly any non-political protests at the time.Till 1960-70s, Ramlila Maidan also served as the venue for non-ceremonial state functions. In 1961, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru hosted Queen Elizabeth II here during her state visit.Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri delivered his slogan, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, in 1965 at Ramlila Maidan and a mammoth rally led by Jayaprakash Narayan was also held here in June, 1975, before Emergency was imposed.Social activist Jayaprakash Narayan addressing a public meeting at Ramlila Maidan in 1975. (Rane Prakash / HT FILE)Meanwhile, small-scale or union protests continued around offices of ministries and those who wanted to gherao the Parliament would throng the Boat Club near Rajpath.Former Doordarshan anchor, Shammi Narang (61), said that while large agitations were organised at Ramlila Maidan, sometimes at Rajghat or Boat Club, small marches were carried out in New Delhi.No such event would take place then like we have at Jantar Mantar now. Employees of different ministries or departments would gather outside their respective offices to raise their voice. Industrial labour would stage sit-ins outside their factories, says Narang, who read news on DD for 19 years.He adds that dissenters from outside Delhi would usually camp at Rajghat. Maybe, Rajghat was the obvious choice as it was conveniently located near the (Old and New Delhi) railway stations and the interstate bus terminal at Kashmere Gate. At that time, there were no political provocations to reach to heart of the city, he adds.Ban on Boat Club agitationAround the 1980s, the Boat Club became the most sought-after venue for a show of strength. However, the government imposed ban on any gathering at the Boat Club in 1993 following the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid movement.Another reason for the ban was the violent 1988 kisan agitation led by powerful western Uttar Pradesh (UP) leader Mahendra Singh Tikait. Demanding higher sugarcane prices and waiving of electricity and water charges, farmers who were camping at Raj Ghat initially thronged the Boat Club. Around five lakh protesters are reported to have reached India Gate lawns riding bullock carts where they camped for a week with their cattle. The sprawling lawns along Rajpath virtually became open toilets for cattle.They created a kind of blockade at Rajpath. Soon, the agitation turned violent. The central part of the city was virtually cut off from the rest. Several policemen were injured, after which the government decided not to allow such assemblies at Rajpath, says retired IPS officer Amod Kanth (69), who was then posted as deputy commissioner of police (DCP) crime at headquarters.After the restriction on assemblage at Boat Club, a handful of events were organised behind Red Fort on Ring Road and in Burari briefly. However, soon after, the agitations were moved back to New Delhi where they were located currently  Jantar Mantar."

Beware of cheap mawa. Activists have written to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about more than 15 tonnes of adulterated mawa being allegedly sold in sweet markets across Maharashtra.Activists wrote to FDA minister Girish Bapat and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis,saying an illegal mawa racket has been running in Maharashtra and Gujarat for the past two years.While mawa is usually made from milk fat, it is adulterated using vegetable oil, milk powder and sugar. More than 40 trucks of adulterated mawa have been travelling from Gujarat to Maharashtra before Diwali for the past two years, said RPY Rao, president, Society for Social Awareness of Civil Rights, an NGO that works in the field of public health.Rao said the adulterated mawa is distributed in Thane, Ghatkopar, Kurla and Mumbai Central, using which barfis or pedas are made and are sold during Diwali.It is packaged under an unknown brand name, and sold in packets of 5kg and 10kg at almost half the market rate. I have urged the minister and the CM to carry out an inquiry with the help of the FDAs vigilance commissioner, Rao said.Pallavi Darade, FDA commissioner, Maharashtra, told HT she hasnt received any notification yet. I will definitely look into the issue, she said.She said the FDA has been seizing adulterated sweets and other edibles since August 20.We have seized more than 2,44,888kg sweets across Maharashtra as a part of our festive drives.

The company has signed two agreements for sale of power to PSPCL  one agreement was in December 2012 and second in May 2005 for a period of 12 years, for sale of power to PSPCL.The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), which determines power tariff, is bound by policy decisions of the government. Singh has conflicting interest, as an individual and as a cabinet minister. Such a person should not have been given the portfolio as power minister, Arora said.The government is in the process of deciding about shutting down thermal power plants run by the state. The power ministry is to take a final decision in this regard, Arora said, adding that closing thermal plants under the state sector will directly benefit to private companies producing power.Singh has a large amount of shares in three other companies  Rana Power Limited, Rana Energy Limited, Rana Green Power Limited.Thus, all such private companies producing power will benefit from closing state-run plants. Hence, Singh should be restrained from participating in any such decision making process, Arora argued."

The party workers also put up black lanterns outside residences of some ministers as mark of protest.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said while inflation has made life miserable, people have lost jobs because of layoffs and got no increments. In Maharashtra, the situation is worse, as people have to face loadshedding. The state government stopped distributing sugar through the public distribution system (PDS) that could have been used to make festival delicacies. The promise of farm loan waiver, too, proved to be false as waiver certificates issued by the government didnt have any mention of the amount, Malik alleged.NCP leader Chitra Wagh put up black Diwali lanterns outside official residences of ministers, namely revenue minister Chandrakant Patil and water supply minister Babanrao Lonikar.In the past few weeks, the party has upped the ante against the BJP government and has become more aggressive. The party had said it would launch a non-cooperation movement against the Devendra Fadnavis-led state government, if it failed to disburse loan waiver.In the recently-held executive committee meeting, Supriya Sule, senior leader and daughter of party chief suggested the NCP take on the BJP government aggressively. Sule said the partys equation with the BJP and its inconsistency over taking on the government has created confusion among the cadre and masses."

As the festival, ending Friday, demands, many are observing fast and following all the rituals that go with it.In the 58 jails, including eight central jails spread across the state, prisoners, cutting across religious beliefs have geared up for the strict Chhath rituals. On their part, prison authorities are extending all help to them.The devotees prepared kheer, made of milk and rice, on Wednesday, to offer it to other prisoners, as well as officials.In view of the strict norms associated with Chhath, the jail administration has banned non-vegetarian food until the completion of the festival. The inmates have been singing devotional songs over the public address system as part of the rituals.Over a dozen Muslim convicts, serving life term in Beur model jail in the outskirts of Patna, besides several in Muzaffarpur and Bhagalpur central jails, are also observing fast and performing other rituals of Chhath, the most popular Hindu festival of Bihar, prison authorities said on Wednesday.This has strengthened the bonding. Prisoners of all communities are helping each other on the occasion. Chhath demands a very high level of purity and hygiene. All jail inmates - whether Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs - have been actively engaged in cleaning and decorating the premises. There is a complete change in the environment. It doesnt look like a jail at all, said Beur Jail superintendent Rupak Kumar.Manoj Kumar, superintendent of Motihari central jail, said why Chhath was such an important religious festival was evident in more ways than one. It has a huge spiritual impact. Those facing serious charges also seem completely taken over by the Chhath spirit, which calls for utmost devotion. As it is a matter of faith and piety, jail authorities provide all help to the devotees, he added.The Muzaffarpur jail superintendent said that a pond had been dug up inside the jail premises and filled with fresh water mixed with Ganga Jal. All devotees have been provided new clothes and puja material, including fruits, milk, sugar, rice and flour, he added.A senior official of home department told HT that though no centralised data regarding the number of Chhath devotees in the prisons is maintained, it was a fact that several of the inmates in various jails undertook fast and performed rituals on the occasion.Many prisoners volunteered and cleaned the campus as well as decorated the premises. May be it is also a way of performing penance and reforming. The entire environment here has turned spiritual, he added."

Till late in the afternoon  when HT visited the spot  the garbage had not been removed. Only tents pitched for the occasion and chairs set up at the venue were taken away, with no concern for the unholy mess.Chhath Puja is dedicated to the Sun God and his wife Usha in order to thank them for bestowing the bounties of life on earth and to request the granting of certain wishes.With no one ready to take responsibility  some say the devotees along with the organisers should have cleared the area after the rituals while others say it is the municipal corporations duty to maintain cleanliness  the lake presented a sorry picture, like every year.Earlier, the devotees  mostly comprising those hailing from Bihar and neighbouring areas  used to perform the rituals at Sukhna Lake, but now the Sector-42 lake has been designated for the purpose.Devotees offering prayers to the rising sun on the last day of Chhath Puja at the Sector-42 lake in Chandigarh on Friday.

Not only this, we also kept making announcements on keeping the area clean.The rituals comprise fasting, cleaning, holy bathing, standing in water and offering prayers and sweets to the rising and setting sun; so water bodies play an integral role.Shahi claimed the association got the area cleaned by 11am after the rituals ended. However, when told that the lake remained littered till the afternoon, he said: This time, three to four other organisations had also participated in the Chhath rituals. They had put up their stalls and must have left the litter.The association had even claimed to have put up Swachhta Abhiyan banners in the area, though no temporary dustbins were installed for the devotees to throw the garbage. Even the roads in front of the Dr Ambedkar Institute of Hotel Management, where stalls had been put up, were strewn with garbage.The MC has outsourced the cleanliness work to an outside agency, said Dr PS Bhatti, medical officer, health, MC.

Every month, we end up imposing about Rs 3-5 lakh fine on the agency.The agency has about 900 workers, who are supposed to keep the city clean, said Bhatti.

Sugar factories often set up distilleries for the production of liquor from the molasses generated in the process of producing sugar.Citing examples of the brands by some of the factories in western Maharashtra, the minister said the Satpuda factory should have named its liquor brand as Maharani instead of Maharaja. He said factories in Kolhapur and Sangli have named their liquor brands Julie, Bhingari and Bobby, and were doing good business.His comments drew sharp reaction from activists and the opposition. Social activist Paromita Goswami ,of NGO Shramik Elgar, filed a complaint against the minister in Mul Police station in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha. She demanded the case be registered under sections 504 and 509 of IPC for public provocation and insulting the modesty of women. The police are checking the legal standing of the complaint before registering it.Mahajan sought to control the damage, saying he would apologise for his first mistake in a political career spanning more than 25 years.It was a statement made in a lighter mood in response to the complaint by the factory members about poor sales. I have personally seen the response to the brands of the factories run by senior politicians such as Shankarrao Kale and Kolhe in western Maharashtra. Having said that, I admit it was an unintentional mistake and I should not have said it. I am issuing an apology tomorrow, Mahajan told HT.The womens wing of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) held a protest against Mahajan in Nashik and burnt his effigies. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also demanded an immediate apology by the minister.It represents the mindset of male politicians and the way they view women. It is a shameful statement in a progressive state like Maharashtra which has the legacy of Mahatma Phule and Chhatrapati Shahu Mahraj. Mahajan should immediately apologise for the statement, Pratibha Shinde, social activist from Nandurbar, said.Mahajan is no stranger to controversies. He had reportedly attended the wedding ceremony of a relative of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim earlier this year.

Zaids name surfaced during the interrogation that followed, and a lookout notice was issued.Zaid was arrested as soon as he landed in Mumbai from Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, where he had set up base. He had allegedly formed a social media group to radicalise disgruntled youngsters and lure them into the Islamic States fold. The suspect will be brought to Lucknow after a transit remand is obtained from a Mumbai court, and he will be further interrogated, Arun said.The police officer identified the four terror suspects arrested earlier as Umar and Mufti (both residents of Bijnore); Ghazi Baba from Unnao; and Zaqwan from Narkatiyaganj in Bihar. They used to communicate through a special application on the Internet, and Zaid was the key operator in the group.Arun said the four were arrested in a joint operation with police teams from five other states. The four were involved in recruiting youths, generating funds and arranging arms and ammunition to carry out terror activities, he added.Questioning of the arrested suspects revealed that they wanted to eliminate six targets, including Pakistan-born Canadian writer Tarek Fatah, as part of a plan to showcase their presence as a domestic terror module. Umar, who was employed in Mumbai, had even allegedly conducted a recce to target the writer during one of his visits to India. The suspect used to watch the writers television show on a popular channel and keep tabs on his movements in India, the inspector general said.Fatah figured in their hitlist because he opposed the shariah, and propogated a liberal and progressive form of Islam. The suspects, however, realised that targeting the writer was no easy task. So, they prepared an alternative plan to attack other people and places, the officer said.Among the new targets was a Shia shrine at Amrohas Naugawa Saadat; a crowded area at Haridwar, Uttarakhand; a sugar mill at Narkatiyaganj, Bihar; and a gas cylinder shop at a congested area in Uttar Pradesh. They also allegedly planned to eliminate a police officer in Mumbai, among others."

But after that, the realtors did not do much to resolve the issues in their projects, which are stuck, mostly due to funds crunch, a Greater Noida authority official said.According to officials, builders in Noida had promised to deliver 16,000 flats in three months while builders in Greater Noida had assured delivery of 34,000 flats in three months.We have delivered 1,500 flats in the last two months.

The camp would be held from 6.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m.Sai Ravishankar, organising secretary, said according to the WHO statistics, one heart attack was occurring at every 33 seconds across the world.Smoking, consumption of alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, lack of exercise, stress and strain were some of the factors affecting the health of the heart.He said 33% of heart attack patients were less than 40 years of age and cardio-vascular disease among young people would have a catastrophic effect on the community and hence the emphasis on preventive measures.Jyotsna, vice-president and cardiologist at NIMS, said good dietary habits and physical movement in daily routine along with 30 to 40 minutes of walking, running, swimming, or any physical exercise and yoga would keep the heart healthy."

Sugar factories often set up distilleries for the production of liquor from the molasses generated in the process of producing sugar.Citing examples of the brands by some of the factories in western Maharashtra, the minister said the Satpuda factory should have named its liquor brand as Maharani instead of Maharaja. He said factories in Kolhapur and Sangli have named their liquor brands Julie, Bhingari and Bobby, and were doing good business.His unsolicited advice drew sharp reaction from activists and the Opposition. Social activist Paromita Goswami of NGO Shramik Elgar filed a complaint against the minister in Mul Police station in Chandrapur district of Vidarbha. She demanded the case be registered under sections 504 and 509 of IPC for public provocation and insulting the modesty of women. The police are checking the legal standing of the complaint before registering it.Mahajan sought to control the damage saying he would apologise for his first mistake in a political career spanning more than 25 years.It was a statement made in a lighter mood in response to the complaint by the factory members about poor sales. I have personally seen the response to the brands of the factories run by senior politicians such as Shankarrao Kale and Kolhe in western Maharashtra. Having said that, I admit it was an unintentional mistake and I should not have said it. I am issuing an apology tomorrow, Mahajan told HT.The womens wing of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) held a protest against Mahajan in Nashik and burnt his effigies.The Aam Admi Party (AAP) also demanded an immediate apology by the minister. It represents the mindset of male politicians and the way they view women. It is a shameful statement in a progressive state like Maharashtra which has the legacy of Mahatma Phule and Chhatrapati Shahu Mahraj. Mahajan should immediately apologise for the statement, Pratibha Shinde, social activist from Nandurbar, said.Mahajan is no stranger to controversies. He had reportedly attended the wedding ceremony of a relative of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim earlier this year. He also invited criticism for attending a function meant for children with hearing and speech disabilities, with his revolver tucked at his waist, visible to everyone."

In a letter written to the Chief Secretary of the State, the U.P. Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA) said that any increase in cane prices would hit them hard as the cane industry has been going through losses for last three consecutive yearsFarmers in distressThe request comes days after distressed farmers of the State alleged that the present rate of Rs. 305 per quintal of cane was much lower than the total input cost that goes into the farming of cane in U.P.Farmers have waged a campaign to increase the State Advised Price (SAP) to Rs. 400 per quintal.Uttar Pradesh became the highest producer of sugar last year, contributing close to 42% of the total sugar production in India.To push forth its request, the UPSMA reminded the Chief Secretary that the present Chief Minister Adityanath had, on several occasions, said that increasing the procurement rate for sugarcane was not the solution to the problems of the industry.Last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) government increased the SAP of sugarcane by Rs. 25 and fixed it at Rs. 305 per quintal.The UPSMA also urged the government to give the mills the option of paying sugarcane prices in two installments, and decreasing the commission paid to cooperative societies to Rs. 2 per quintal from the present Rs. 7.65.The cane crushing season is expected to start from October.The letter said that sugarcane prices in U.P. are undoubtedly higher as compared to other major sugar-producing States.Excess productionThe overall increase in sugar prices have been marginal when compared to the substantial rise in cane prices. Though sugar prices decrease, cane prices continue to go up. Main reasons for this has been excess production and increased supply, said the UPSMA letter.The industry has been suffering continuous losses from 2011 and is barely able to stand on its feet, the letter added."

Locals claim that the prices have gone beyond the budget of commoners as no vegetable is available at a rate below `60 per kg. The highest price is of tomatoes, which are selling at `80 per kg in Baripada town and nearby haats. The situation is no better at Rairangpur, Karanjia and Udala sub-divisions . Prices of locally-grown vegetables have also increased, locals said.The traders have linked the price rise to poor supply of vegetables from other States due to erratic rainfall. Contradicting traders, sources, however, claimed that local businessmen have created an artificial shortage of vegetables and managed to hike the prices, taking advantage of the huge demand for vegetables in the holy month. Meanwhile, commoners have apparently cut down their vegetable consumption.The price rise of vegetables has come as a major shock for my family, said Sumati Singh, a housewife. Almost all the vegetables were priced between `30 and `40 per kg three months back. Now, the prices of most of the vegetables have been doubled. Nowadays, a small family has to spend at least `500 to `600 for vegetables for an entire week. Earlier, we used to spend only `300 to `400 for a weeks consumption, said Manoj Sethi, a resident of Purunahatsahi Ward No. 6.At least 20 to 30 per cent vegetables demand is usually fulfilled by vegetable growers of Khuntapal, Kuliona and Pratapur from Barasahi area. The rest is met by supplies from other States. Now, the vegetable sellers of Gopiballhavpur in the neighbouring State of West Bengal and Tata in Jharkhand have been sending supplies to Baripada market and the three sub-divisions of the district, said a vegetable wholesaler.Locals, however, alleged that unscrupulous traders have hiked the prices in the absence of a proper market regulation mechanism. The district civil supply department cannot regulate the prices of vegetables, unlike dal, onion, potato, sugar and wheat, sources said."

The governments argument is that the JPHNs are being used only to distribute the NCD drugs dispensed by pharmacists at the district level to patients coming to the sub-centres.The Union Health Ministry decided to bring the drugs to patients in sub-centres nearer their homes to ensure uninterrupted treatment. The guidelines of the NCD programme state that every sub-centre should have NCD drug stock for three months and that these are to be distributed through JPHNs, a health official said.Pharmacists caseThe court, however, seems to have seen merit in the pharmacists argument that the wrong dispensation of medicine or distribution of medicine by an unqualified person may lead to disastrous consequences.Health officials are concerned that the order could affect the drug distribution under national programmes  filariasis control, de-worming, iron and folic acid distribution, school health programme, and even the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP)  wherein the drugs are distributed by trained health workers.The Kerala Government Pharmacists Association (KGPA) points out that such apprehensions are misplaced. The order will not affect drug distribution under any of the national programmes involving mass drug administration. However, the common NCD drugs  for controlling blood sugar, hypertension or cholesterol  distributed under the national programme are to be dispensed only by a qualified pharmacist because a patient might be on several drugs and has to be monitored regularly, says K.M. Muralidharan, general secretary, KGPA.In other StatesThe State government should see if a common pool of pharmacists whose services can be hired on need-basis can be created, says K.G. Ravikumar, former Professor of Clinical Pharmacy, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College.While it will not be feasible to appoint pharmacists in all sub-centres, one suggestion is that the panchayats appoint a pharmacist each so that he/she can be utilised for dispensing drugs for all health-related programmes implemented at the grassroots.Sub-centres do not have posts of doctors or pharmacists"

They had sharp weapons and they put a sharp knife on my childs neck and warned that they would kill him if I shouted, the victim told the media.The culprits took us to a nearby sugarcane field where they tied my husband and put the child on one side. After that they took turns to rape me one by one for over an hour and half. After that they fled and warned us that if I inform the police, they will come and kill us, the woman said.Circle Officer of Bhopa Rizwan Ahmad told The Hindu , It seems the culprits could be from areas in the vicinity like Bhopa, Jansath and Meerapur.

Andaman and Nicobar Islands reported the highest intake of flesh foods, including meat and fish, while Odisha has the highest consumption of green leafy vegetables (GLV). On an average, while the recommended dietary intake of GLV is 40g/Cu/day, the consumption in the country is 24g/Cu/day.Madhya Pradesh has the lowest intake of flesh foods, and Kerala consumes the least green leafy vegetables.If Madhya Pradesh has a sweet tooth with the highest intake of sugar and jaggery, Odisha and Assam have the highest intake of salt. Rajasthan is high on the intake of fats and oils as well as milk and milk products.The study, led by Avula Laxmaiah, scientist (Director Grade) from the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), the countrys premier nutrition research institute, was released recently.The researchers used the method of a 24-hour dietary recall to collect food and nutrient information from 1.72 lakh people in 16 States.While the average intake of cereals and millets was found to be 320g/Cu/day, which is lower than the recommended dietary intake (RDI), the intake of pulses and legumes was about 42g/Cu/day.This is on par with the suggested level of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said Dr. Laxmaiah."

This year, the World Federation for Mental Health has given a call for improving mental wellness at workplaces for World Mental Health Day on October 10.The theme this year is to remove the stigma, and help people share their problems with colleagues.The Federation has quoted studies that say six out of ten people have certain mental health condition that they hide from their employers.The study by Silver Ribbon Singapore, a non-profit organisation, says some people (23.4%) tend to hide these conditions because of the risk of losing jobs while some (12.8%) believe that employers will not understand their condition.Mental health at workplace can be seen in two contexts. One is the condition at workplace affecting an individuals mental health, and the other is the mental health of an employee that helps him or her adjusting to the workplace, said Dr. K. Vidhukumar, Additional Professor, Government Medical College, Ernakulam.The stress at workplace will increase hypertension and affect blood sugar levels. It will also affect mental health. As it happens in the corporate world, demands and pro-management attitude of superiors are among the major causes of mental stress, he said. There are also issues of burn out faced by many individuals who had probably shown a promise in the beginning of their career, he added.Ajeesh Ramachandran, Head of Psychiatry, General Hospital, said all functions of the body get affected because of mental strain at work. As physical symptoms, it might come as muscle aches and gastric disorders. It could also cause a few psychosomatic disorders, he said.Most of the time, opening up with colleagues about anxieties and problems at work would help team leaders tap a persons efficiency in the right manner. Instead of blaming a person for being inefficient, support could be provided to improve efficiency. A persons talents can also be utilised in other areas instead of labelling the person as Not fit to work, he added."

(Above): Workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in Ranebennuru in Haveri district, Karnataka. (Below) The gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. A farm hand in Ranebennuru, Haveri district.Sudhakara JainManzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. He scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. I know for sure you cant eat this, he says. He speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. It is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. When he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. Pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.Neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. Water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.Manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. No one has told him that in the West, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. Confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village Thimmapura in Haveri district, close to the River Tungabhadra in Central Karnataka. They laugh. No, it cannot be. When our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. If they eat it, they will fall sick. It fills the stomach with gas, says Rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.The recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. In these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. Its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.But the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. The three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from April to June, August to October, and December to February.Discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. Amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in Karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. These range from the Goods and Service Tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over Russian military aggression, to even the weather in Vietnam. A bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in India, and thus the lives of Manzoor and Rajappa.A crop like no otherWith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the State, and perhaps in the country. Seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from Europe. Export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of Karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.The fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of Madrid to the supermarkets of Manhattan.In the 1990s, as information technology (IT) and the outsourcing boom transformed Bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as Kolar and Bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. Just like the IT boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.For more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. Export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and SEZs. While banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the State. The gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 2006.By 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern India were engaged in gherkin cultivation. The sectors exports touched Rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth Rs. 180 crore.When it was dropped into the State two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. Now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. Most say that it is a corruption of the Kannada word,midi, meaning small. Farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.Karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of Indias production, with the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu chipping in.Similar to the dynamics in the IT sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of Bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.The Russia problemIn 2014, parts of central Karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the State battled drought. The perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. But just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: Russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of Crimea.The Russian annexation of Crimea had begun. Despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. Eventually, a pro-Russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.As Russia faced sanctions from Europe and America, suddenly, Indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. Thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of Karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the Russia crisis.A conversation in Hemodre, a village in drought-prone Sira taluk near the Andhra Pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. Beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.Beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. He has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. The credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. With the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. He is now in a debt of more than Rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.About 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern Ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.Srinivas R., the factory manager, explains what happened when Crimea was annexed. In 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. We prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. The rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. The Russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. We had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. Within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.The setback reverberated through company balance sheets. Exports to Russia came down from Rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just Rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. Russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by European buyers.The crisis devastated the industry. At least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. These are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says Mune Gowda, who heads Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd., and is the Treasurer of the Indian Gherkin Exporter's Association. Even the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. In the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. Production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. Making up for the loss of the Russian market by tapping the European one proved difficult as the latter is choosy and has strict compliance norms and certification requirements.The foreignerDomestically, cultivating gherkins comes with its own problems. Unpredictable weather takes a toll on the crop. The gherkin itself is a demanding crop that takes its pound of flesh from the land on which it is sown. It acts like a foreigner who lives here, says Ranganath at Hemodre village. He is relatively less enamoured of the cucumber. He is not taken in by the promise of high yields. If the wind changes direction for an hour, it falls sick, he says.Gherkins need constant care, which isnt easy given the harsh realities of farming in India: monsoons are erratic and prone to failure; rural distress has sparked large-scale migrations and reduction in the availability of labour; tropical diseases sweep across large tracts; and groundwater reserves are dwindling. This constant battle has made the farmers christen the fruitkiri kiritarakari(irritating vegetable) andsoutekaye savasa(problematic cucumber).A little more than a month after the seeds are sown, gherkins pop out of the base of the flower, yielding fruits incessantly for the next two months.It is here that the trouble begins. If it is not picked within a few hours of flowering, it grows exponentially in size, and for the farmers, the bigger it is, the smaller their returns. The gherkins are graded according to their size and there are five grades in all. The smallest gherkins (160 of them can fit in a crate) could fetch Rs. 32 per kilo. The biggest (less than 30 in a crate) fetch just Rs. 2. If transportation of the plucked gherkins is delayed, up to one-third of the produce could be lost.We need 15 labourers a day just to pick the fruit. Most of the youth have gone to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs. If we delay the picking by one day, the gherkin grows and becomes unviable for us, said 41-year-old Siddarameshwara in the remote Udramappanahalli village of Sira taluk. His crop this year has been ravaged by mildew, which sets upon gherkins when it rains.Its because of these reasons that despite his success with the crop in the past 10 years, he has confined gherkins to just 0.5 acres of his 12-acre farm. As white, stringy fungus envelops the gherkin, he hopes that the winter crop can compensate for his loss. However, in the slight chill of the winter lurks the melon fly which, farmers say, no quantity of pesticide can effectively contain.More disconcertingly, the crop guzzles water. If the field is not irrigated daily, gherkins become shrivelled and bent, unsuitable for export. For the 50 days or so that it flowers, farmers have to draw water from their borewells. If maize needs water thrice in two weeks, the gherkin needs it every day. Maize is grown twice a year; gherkins thrice a year. For all the three seasons to yield sizeable profits, it needs more than 150 days of irrigation.The guru of gherkinsEight years ago, it was the sight of a group of Spaniards inspecting gherkins in Bagepalli, just 100 km from Bengaluru close to the Andhra Pradesh border, that enthralled villagers. Taking them around the clusters of gherkin villages was B. Srinivas, whose company acted as a conduit for the bigger companies and farmers. The Spaniards had told the gherkin growers that the produce here was the best they had seen.Having taken to the gherkin sector in 1998, it was he and a small band of agents who persuaded farmers to try this new crop. Agents and company facilitators propped up. Bollywood-style films on gherkin management were shown to farmers to attract them to the crop. Gherkins, it was believed, could lift the region out of poverty.Srinivas remembers the gherkin rush. Farmers would line up for seeds. We could even do large swathes of 30 acres in each village. Things were easy back then.Over 1,000 acres of gherkins  a limit constrained only by the volume of the companies export orders  were sown in 2006-07. Money flowed as advances to farmers, agents kept a steep commission from the output, and for farmers, gherkins did translate into money.Then the inevitable happened. By the late 2000s, the rains started failing, and one by one, the borewells went dry. Groundwater dipped in places from 400 feet to more than 1,200 feet. In places where the borewells ran through the summer, they now stopped two months before the rains, and later, didnt function even in the winter. Gherkins, with their immediate need for water, were the first to be affected.By 2011, the number of red farmers  those with debts  rose dramatically, and the agents had to look farther for suitable land, with some going as far as Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. It just didnt work out. We would get half an acre in one village and a couple of acres elsewhere far away. The debts kept rising. I had to get out, Srinivas says.In the hustle of the Bagepalli market, the man who many farmers and agents say was the guru of gherkins in the region now runs an agro-business focussing only on traditional vegetables and maize seeds. Just three agents operate now, and struggle to cumulatively cover 50 acres.Cycles of debtDrought and international price fluctuations have left behind a cycle of debt  unpaid loans for field agents and gherkin farmers, who, in turn, have to pledge a greater share of future gherkin production.In the past decade, the prices of the seeds, all imported, went up from 6 paise to 68 paise per seed. If tomato seeds cost Rs. 700 for 10,000, the cost for gherkins is up to Rs. 10,000. The returns, however, havent kept up. In the same period, the price of premium gherkins has gone up from Rs. 8 to Rs. 32 per kg.In some areas, agents have racked up debts of more than Rs. 50 lakh. Agents like Gangappa in Bagepalli who claims to have nearly Rs. 70 lakh in debt from farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have pinned their hopes on the recent rains that have filled up tanks. They hope that these farmers can repay the debt by cultivating gherkins again.The rains have indeed given life to the dry lands of Bagepalli, Sira and central Karnataka, which glimmer now in various shades of green. There is slight optimism in the corporate offices of exporters too: a steady year can blunt Indias reputation as an uncertain producer that frequently misses shipment dates. But is it possible that, somehow, the U.S. and Russia would normalise relations and bring Indian gherkins back on Russian tables?Well, the fruit is fickle and vulnerable, and uncertainties loom, much like the dark vestigial monsoon clouds that threaten to wash out this seasons crop.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough.BeereshA local agentEven the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production.Mune GowdaHead, Exotic Agro Pvt.

Poojary, president of the district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, standing up during the speech and telling the Minister that wild animals were destroying crops at many places in the district.Another farmer, Venkatesh, said the district administration should provide them with gun licences so that they could shoot in the air to scare away the wild animals. Mr. Madhwaraj said the Wildlife Protection Act was strong and killing of wild animals was not permitted. However, he said he would soon arrange a meeting of farmers and legislators of the district with Forest Minister B. Ramanath Rai.The farmers then said that they required more support price for their crops. Mr. Madhwaraj said that the issue of support price depended on the funds made available by both the State and Union governments. Already the State government was providing more funds for support price, he said.The farmers finally demanded to know if the Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory would be revived. The Minister said that the government had asked the Board of Directors of the factory to arrange for a feasibility study on reviving the factory and funds required for it. Further action would be taken based on the feasibility report, he said.The factory stopped functioning 13 years ago. It had 110 acres of land. Of this, 25 acres would be used for construction of a medical college and a super-specialty hospital, and the rest 85 acres will remain with the factory, Mr. Madhwaraj said."

5a14cfc69855b76bf13e8213,is it difficult to clean up the Ganga?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/is-it-difficult-to-clean-up-the-ganga/article19899358.ece,2017-10-22,"How polluted is the river?Coursing about 2,500 km, the Ganga is the longest river within Indias borders. Its basin constitutes 26% of the countrys land mass (8,61,404 sq. km.) and supports 43% of Indias population. Even as its basin traverses 11 States, five States are located along the rivers main stem spanning Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Much of the rivers pollution load  from chemical effluents, sewage, dead bodies, and excreta  comes from these States. In the Ganga basin, approximately 12,000 million litres per day (mld) of sewage is generated, for which there is now a treatment capacity of just 4,000 mld. Particularly, on the stretch spanning Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, approximately 3,000 mld of sewage is discharged, and a treatment capacity of just 1,000 mld has been created to treat it. Though the contribution of industrial pollution, volume-wise, is about 20%, its toxic and non-biodegradable nature has a disproportionate impact. The industrial pollutants largely emanate from tanneries in Kanpur, distilleries, paper mills and sugar mills in the Kosi, Ramganga and Kali river catchments. Then there is the municipal sewage which, at about a billion litres a day, generates 80% of the pollution load. This spans a wide range, from run-off in rural settlements to carcasses floated down the river.What is the government doing?The BJP included the cleaning of the Ganga in its 2014 election manifesto. The Narendra Modi government earmarked Rs. 20,000 crore for the clean-up and promised that the river would be clean by 2020. Former Union Minister for Water Resources Uma Bharti said the river would be clean by 2018 but the new Minister, Nitin Gadkari, indicated that this deadline was unlikely to be met. He, however, said the river would be noticeably clean by March 2019.What has been done so far?The government has set up an empowered authority called the National Mission for Clean Ganga. This is a dedicated team of officers who are responsible for disbursing the Rs. 20,000 crore fund towards a variety of projects that involve setting up of sewage treatment plants (STPs), replacing woodfired crematoriums with electric ones or those that use fuel more efficiently, setting up biodiversity parks that will enable native species  from the Gangetic river dolphin to rare turtles  to replenish their numbers and planting trees to improve the water table in the surrounding regions and prevent soil erosion. The authorities focussed on having trash skimmers ply along the river and collecting garbage, and improving crematoria. However the big task  of installing sewage treatment plants  is grossly delayed. Barely Rs. 2,000 crore of the Rs. 20,000 crore has been spent so far. The government says this has taken time because it wanted to put in place an extremely transparent tendering process. It has also established a system called the hybrid-annuity model, used in commissioning highways, for selecting firms that will manage STPs. Under this, firms would be given nearly half the money upfront to set up a plant and the rest (with a profit margin included) at regular intervals, provided they meet certain criteria over 15 years. Sixty-three sewerage management projects are being implemented in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Last week, STPs to treat 1187.33 mld were cleared for Hardwar and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.What are clean river criteria?The ultimate objective, for the river to be clean, would be to ensure that the coliform bacteria level, biochemical oxygen demand, pH and dissolved salts remain within the standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board.Can the government meet its targets?A lot will depend on how soon the STPs are commissioned. On average, they will take about a year-and-a-half to work at their optimal capacity. The tanneries, a major polluter, will have to install new systems to ensure that no discharge leaches into the river. Given that several employ techniques that have not been tried on a large scale in Indian rivers, it is unclear how soon they will deliver results. Moreover, a clean river also implies that it maintains minimum levels  called ecological flows  across all stretches of the river. This requires management on a larger scale, including controlling the several dams along the river that bring with them their own challenges.Jacob Koshy"

Under this, non water-guzzling crops in command areas will be supplied with one or two rounds of irrigation water if required.This is to ensure some income for farmers in the wake of a large number of them missing out on agricultural operations during kharif season owing to severe drought then.Our normal target for rabi sowing is about 33 lakh hectares. But this time, we want to add another 6 lakh to 7 lakh hectares to this from the traditional non-rabi areas in the command zone so that more farmers would benefit, Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told The Hindu .According to him, the Agriculture Department would identify farmlands that have been left fallow during the kharif season. These lands would be included under rabi sowing by encouraging farmers to take up agricultural operations through supply of subsidised farm inputs.The rabi sowing would be taken up during October and November in the State.The trend of leaving the lands fallow was widespread especially in the Cauvery basin, in this kharif as water from dams was not released for irrigation purposes in the wake of drought. The new initiative was also aimed at creating awareness among farmers that they could earn incomes even by growing non-water guzzling crops. We want to convince them to look beyond the traditional commercial crops of paddy and sugarcane, he said.The rabi crops would mainly comprise rain-fed crops such as pulses like Bengal gram and horse gram, millets like ragi and jowar, besides groundnut. As the storage in most reservoirs is better than that of the previous year, rabi crops could be provided with a couple of rounds of supply of irrigation water if the rains fail again, the Minister said.The department has already commenced a special campaign to bring fallow land in non-rabi crops under rabi area in the Cauvery basin. The campaign would soon begin in Northern command areas too. The campaign being taken up at the level of village panchayats would also involve innovative farmers.In the present scenario marked by climate change, weather vagaries are bound to haunt farm sector. Hence, it is essential for farmers to tackle climate change impact through necessary modifications in crop pattern. The campaign as well as the initiative to expand the rabi sowing area is an effort to prepare farmers to make such modifications in their crop pattern, the Minister said.Weather vagaries are bound to haunt farm sector. It is essential that farmers tackle climate change impact through modifications in crop pattern. Rabi expansion is an initiative in this direction.Krishna Byre GowdaAgriculture Minister"

For a while, scientists have known about the Warburg effect, a phenomenon in which cancer cells rapidly break down sugars and stimulate tumour growth. However, evidence for this has been elusive until this study (reported in Nature Communications) . Yeast cell research was essential to the discovery, as these cells contain the same Ras proteins commonly found in tumour cells, which can cause cancer in mutated form. Using yeast as a model organism, the research team found that sugar degradation is linked via the intermediate fructose 1,6-biophosphate to the activation of Ras proteins, which stimulate the multiplication of both yeast and cancer cells. This discovery may also have far-reaching impacts on tailor-made diets for cancer patients.  Eurekalert"

Does the first syllable sound like true?Thats right! The t..r..u is pronounced like the word true, and the following a is like the a in china. The word is pronounced TRUE-ent with the stress on the first syllable. It comes from the Old French truant meaning beggar.I see. So, can I refer to beggars as truants?No, you cant. Nowadays, truant is mostly used to refer to children  especially those who stay away from school without permission.Like my friend who tells his parents hes off to school, and goes to the movies instead.Exactly! According to the police, many petty crimes were committed by truants.In the article that Im reading, the writer uses the expression play truant. What does...When a child plays truant, he stays away from school for no valid reason  without the permission of his parents or the school authorities. Im told that my genius cousin used to play truant when he was a kid.The only time I played truant, the teacher gave a surprise test. I ended up getting a zero.Tough luck! Heard your grandfather arrived this morning. Hows he doing?Hes his usual jolly self. As soon as he arrived, he asked me to go to his favourite sweetmeat shop and get him some pedas. Tell me, why does he call it sweetmeat?In the past, native speakers of English used to refer to any sweet as sweetmeat.But why? Did all sweets have bits of meat in them or something?No, thats not the reason. You see, the word meat actually comes from the Old English mete. The original meaning of this word was food. So any item of food that tasted sweet was called sweetmeat  meaning sweet food.I see. So, candies and toffees were called sweetmeat?Not just candies. Even a piece of fruit dipped in syrup or coated with sugar was called sweetmeat. With the passage of time, however, the meaning of meat changed.Nowadays, the word is usually used to refer to the flesh of an animal.But the old meaning of meat meaning food is still retained in some words. For example, we have mincemeat, nutmeat...Im a vegetarian, so no meat, please. Tell me, what happened yesterday? Did you manage to beat your friend in...No chance of that happening. He plays tennis like a dream.Dream gamePlays like a dream? How can anyone play tennis like a dream?When you say that someone does something like a dream, what youre suggesting is that the person does it extremely well  without any problems. For example, Virat batted like a dream yesterday.He did, didnt he? My mother tells me that her grandmother cooked like a dream.This informal expression can be used with things as well. Why would I want to sell my old motorcycle? It still runs like a dream.Meaning, that your motorcycle still runs very well.Exactly! Jayanthi convinced everyone on the Board that her plan would work like a dream. When it didnt, she was immediately fired.Another example of a dream turning into a nightmare, I guess.* * * * *Forget love  Id rather fall in chocolate!

Pandian, president, Madurai District Farmers Association, said that he was receiving complaints from farmers in Saptur and nearby villages that the insurance amount for paddy had not been credited to many.I can say for sure that none of the farmers in Saptur had got the amount, he said.He alleged that he had not received proper response from the Agriculture Department despite bringing the issue to their notice.N. Palanichamy, State president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, alleged that many villages in Madurai North Taluk, including Periyarpatti and nearby villages, were yet to get the insurance amount.A.N.M.

Ramesh, a farmer of Vadipatti, said that a number of farmers, including those who did not take crop loans from Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS), enrolled for PMFBY in 2016 with the hope that they would be compensated for the loss.We hardly received insurance claims in the previous schemes. In PMFBY, we were assured that claims will be settled within few months in case of failure, but it has not happened, he said.Acknowledging that there were issues in disbursal of the amount, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said in the meeting that the district had been largely successful in disbursing the insurance claim amount worth around Rs. 9 crore so far to the farmers.The amount has been released only for the samba paddy crop. The insurance companies are yet to settle the claim for other crops, he said.Stating that complaints of claim amount of as low as Rs. 400 per acre of paddy had been brought to his notice, he said that he had sought explanation from the insurance companies on the differences.It is true that farmers might lose confidence in the scheme if the issues were not sorted. We will ensure that the correct amount is disbursed to all farmers, he said."

In response, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) last year conducted pilot tests in several schools in Bengaluru by supplying milk flavoured with chocolate, rose, badam and cardamom.A majority of the students liked the chocolate and cardamom flavour. So we have decided to distribute these flavours on a pilot basis to students in Mysuru and Raichur, a KMF official said. For every student, 18 gm of milk powder will be converted into a 150-ml portion.Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Tanveer Sait said that based on feedback for the pilot project, it would be extended to other parts of the State.An official in the Department of Public Instruction said although they had given milk in flexi packets during the trial run, it was decided to supply flavoured milk powder as disposing the packets posed a problem.The scheme has been tweaked in Mysuru and Raichur for now, with an eye on elections. While Mysuru is Chief Ministers home turf, Mr. Sait is the district in charge Minister of Raichur.V. Sumangala, director of the midday meal programme, said schools were until now being given full-cream milk powder, which was mixed with hot water and sugar and served to students.

5a14e31c9855b76bf13e8c7a,do GST rules need to be tweaked?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/do-gst-rules-need-to-be-tweaked/article19942472.ece,2017-10-29,"What is the problem?Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia recently said the Goods and Services Tax rate structure needed to be tweaked, prompting the question why this is the case, and if it were to be revised, what would those changes involve. Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on October 4 that GST procedures would be reviewed and bottlenecks removed, the GST Council has taken decisions and its officials have made comments that underscore the aim of this revision. At the last GST Council meeting on October 6, a slew of decisions was announced, from rate reductions to the easing of compliance norms.The way the GST is structured now, there are seven rates  0%, 0.25%, 3%, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%  applicable to various goods, not counting the various cesses levied over and above the highest rate of 28%. This is a far more complex rate structure than that applied in the 160-odd countries that have implemented a unified tax structure like the GST. Most of these countries have two rates of tax, while some even have one.This multiplicity of rates has created a huge compliance burden on companies, since the classification system is not always easy to understand. For example, soon after the launch of GST, the government had to clarify that chocolate-covered barfis would be taxed at 5%, the same rate as normal barfis. The confusion arose because the GST Council had said anything that used cocoa as an input would be taxed at 28%.The Revenue Secretary also suggested that, going forward, the GST Council would look into pruning the number of items in the 28% slab. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, at a recent press conference, confirmed that Mr. Adhias comments were in line with the governments stated objectives.Are there many rates?The revision of rates matters for several reasons. The whole point of implementing such a Good and Simple Tax, as Mr. Modi dubbed it, was to reduce the compliance burden on companies and improve the ease of doing business. The multiplicity of rates is hindering this, since companies are having to spend more on preparing themselves for the inevitable litigation, not to mention hiring of tax consultants to oversee the monthly filings of detailed returns.Being an indirect tax, the GST affects each and every person during almost every transaction they conduct over the course of their normal day  whether it is at a restaurant, barber, cigarette shop or movie theatre. A revision of rates would thus affect the common man directly. In this context, the people of Gujarat  the Prime Ministers home State, which is going to the polls soon  are particularly sensitive to the GST rollout. In line with that, the Gujarat government has announced that all GST payments on drip irrigation equipment would be borne by it. Another important aspect to keep in mind while discussing the revision of GST rates is the other party involved in taxation  the government. The governments argument for the number of rates in GST is that the higher 28% luxury and sin rate offsets the loss of revenue due to most items of common use being placed in the 5% or exempt categories. The government needs to maintain its tax collections, so any rate revision needs to be informed by that imperative.What is the road map?Mr. Jaitley has also spoken about the possibility of collapsing the 12% and 18% rates into a single slab once the implementation of the indirect tax regime settles down. So, eventually, we could see a GST rate structure with at least one fewer rate.Another problem that may be addressed, according to Mr. Adhias statement, is the categories of items themselves. He said: There is a need for harmonisation of items chapter wise, which means similar items now in different tax slabs  like chocolate syrup and sugar syrup, for example  could be brought under a single rate. At its next meeting on November 10, the GST Council could revise the rates on more items and even include real estate in the ambit of GST. With the Gujarat election schedule announced, it is not clear how much more relief the Centre can give traders from the State on the GST till the results are announced on December 18. For now, the Prime Minister has asked traders wary of joining the GST net not to worry about their past operations being under the scanner  taxmen will not be allowed to scrutinise their past records.TCA Sharad Raghavan"
5a14e5aa9855b76bf13e8dd6,PepsiCo eyes more from ‘hydration’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pepsico-eyes-more-from-hydration/article19942595.ece,2017-10-29,"Yen for health:PepsiCo is working on products that have flavours of herbs and fruits, with vitamins added to them.PepsiCo India Holdings, a fully-owned subsidiary of New York-based PepsiCo Inc., plans to double its revenue from the hydration segment of beverages from the current Rs. 1,000 crore in the next five years, Vipul Prakash, senior vice president, Beverages, India, said in an interview.The fastest growing categories are the hydration, juices and dairy, which offers a very small base right now, Mr. Prakash said. Carbonated soft drinks are also growing but growing slower in the last five years. The beverage category is growing in high single digits and within that, carbonate soft drinks will be in lower single digits, hydration would be in double digits, and juices in low double digits.Increasing awarenessAn increasing health awareness among Indian consumers and their preference for health and wellness products may be the reasons for a strong demand for juices, according to research firm, Euromonitor International. Carbonates, both cola and non-cola, are likely to see sustained slowdowns.Juice and juice-based carbonates remained the most important priorities for Indias soft drink companies last year, which also saw new entrants such as Manpasand Beverages and Hector Beverages fighting for shelf space with PepsiCo India and Coca-Cola India, according to Euromonitor.PepsiCo would reduce the calorific value in its drinks as part of a global commitment that two-thirds of the companys beverages will be less than 100 calories per 355 ml by 2025, Mr. Prakash said.We will reduce the sugar in our carbonated soft drinks. We launched 7UP with reduced sugar, 30% less, in Gujarat. We launched it as a a test pilot a year ago. The pilot has been a success and we will be extending it to many more parts of the country in the first quarter of 2018, he said. Similarly we are working on Mirinda, Mountain Dew and Pepsi.Zero-sugar productsThe company is also working on how to accelerate zero-sugar products, Mr. Prakash said.Things like Pepsi Black come in there. We have other products such as Tropicana Essentials which do not have added sugar. That is a very small portion of the portfolio now. Another element is..., how do you introduce beverages which are inherently lowe [in] sugar? That is where hydration becomes extremely critical.Hydration is the largest in the liquid refreshment category today and the fastest growing. The strange thing is that (in India) 99% of it is plain water. If you go to any other country it will be between 60-70%. About 30% is what we call value-added water. We want it to be 80:20.PepsiCo is also working on products that have flavours of herbs and fruits with vitamins added to it. It aims to add one new product every 6-12 months on the Aquafina platform, such as the recently introduced Aquafina Vitamin Splash with Kiwi lime and Raspberry mint flavor  both fortified with vitamins.The Splash range of beverages took about 18 months to develop, Mr. Prakash said. It is the first time we are calling out a benefit and a claim on the pack. One is for immune function and one is antioxidants. It is India-specific and was developed for people with certain deficiencies like B12, Vitamin E.He said PepsiCo was taking baby steps in the dairy business. At least for the next two years, we will be in a learning space. We have much to learn in this segment.The firm has 62 manufacturing plants in India  43 for beverages and 19 for snacks. The factories are a mix of company-owned plants, franchisee or bottler-owned, co-packers and bulk water units.The franchisee business is about two-third of our overall business and one-third is the company-owned bottling units, which is mainly in the south, Mr. Prakash said.The franchisee bottling plants are owned by Delhi-based billionaire, Ravi Jaipuria of Varun Beverages, C.K. Jaipura in coastal Andhra Pradesh, S.K. Jaipuria in central India, parts of Maharashtra, Dharwad area, Jharkhand and Anurag Jaipuria in Jammu. Lumbini Beverages, run by Ravi Khilani, owns a plant in Bihar.Varun Beverages holds a significant portion of the business. They have the whole of north India  in New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajastan, Goa, West Bengal and they have recently acquired plants in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha from S.K. Jaipuria, Mr. Prakash said."

The two projects that the university completed last month are being tailored into training modules for small farmers and dairy farmers.Scientists T. Thirumalesh and Ramachandra Sangam and research scholar S. Jayashankar used residue from various dry land and irrigated crops and proved that they could be turned into fodder.Dried roughage is cleaned and cut or powdered. It is then mixed with urea dissolved in water in the ratio of 1:10. The mixture is packed and kept in an air-tight enclosure for three weeks. This breaks down bonds in the crop residue and makes nitrogen available. The animals digestive tract converts the mixture into protein and other nutritious material.A farmer with one acre of land can feed up to three large animals or six small animals.Crops like sugarcane, banana, rice or maize on one acre each yield enough crop residue to feed two or three large animals or six or eight small animals for a year. With minimal cost of processing, the farmers can save money on fodder or nutrition inputs, Dr. Thirumalesh said. Once the processed fodder is taken out after three weeks, it can be kept for months and fed in small portions daily.Though we started with crops like sugarcane, banana, rice and maize, we have realised that residue of most crops can be treated this way, he said. The research team has also achieved success with cellulose containing material like wood shavings.Training has already started in Bidar and Shivamogga. The other five colleges of the university and 10 information centres are gearing up to train farmers, S.M. Shivaprakasha, director of extension of the varisty, said.Developing new methods by research is easier than making farmers adopt those methods, says Ramachandra Sangam, head of the department of nutrition in the university.The research project was completed in two years.We have been telling farmers not to burn stubble and crop residue. Experiments by us and agriculture scientists have demonstrated that 100% of the crop residue can be reused for fodder or for mulching, he said."

The boats were parked in protest against the cases registered against fishermen who had taken part in an agitation against high-speed Chinese engines. They wanted the cases to be withdrawn and the remaining engines to be seized.Sources in the Fisheries Department said that if the block is not removed, the help of the Coastal police would be sought to remove the boats on Thursday.Notices have been issued to all the associations. The blockade is unnecessarily affecting the livelihood of other fishermen, said an official.We cannot withdraw any cases since public property was damaged, and triggered a law and order situation. As far as the boats are concerned, three engines have been removed, four boats with their engines have been seized and they have scuttled one engine by pouring sugar and iron filings into it, said the official.1,500 boats with 240 HPEstimates show that there are nearly 1,500 boats that have engines with 240 horse power in the State. Even these fishermen who are objecting to such boats have engines with 190 HP, which is also illegal. Engines with higher HP are allowed under the amended Fisheries Act but the date of the rules coming to force is yet to be decided, said a source.Fishermen, meanwhile, refused to move the boats. If boats with higher horse power are being allowed in other places like Thoothukudi, it is because they have only one day to fish and have to return in 24 hours. But even that is being disputed by a section of fishermen. Whereas in Chennai, there is no restriction to their time in the sea. They can fish throughout the year. Such boats would only further affect the catch, said a fisherman."

Lakshmi NarayananThe two day 48th meeting of the sugar cane research and development workers of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry which commenced here on Wednesday focussed on the problems of the surgar cane farmers and sugar industry for evolving appropriate strategies to improve the sugar cane productivity in the state.The meeting also provided an interface between the researchers and the development personnel and discussed the timely and effective transfer of the latest technologies developed at the research stations to the sugar cane growers.The meeting was organised jointly by the ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University and was hosted by the Kallakurichi II Cooperative Sugar Mills Limited, Kallakurichi.Government officials, scientists, progressive farmers discussed the topics soil fertility based fertigation for sugar cane; review of sugar cane mechanisation initiatives including mechanical harvesting; current varietal position and performance of new sugarcane varieties; sugar cane seed nursery programme; current varietal position and performance of new sugar cane varieties.M. Senthamil Selvan, Additional Director of Sugar, in his inaugural address, said that the production of cane has come down during the current year due to the prevailing severe drought conditions. About 155.86 lakh tonnes of cane was crushed in 2015-16, and 119.04 lakh tonnes of cane during last year. Due to steep fall in cane production, the sugar mills in the state are expected to crush only about 79.10 lakh tonnes of cane during this year.The production of sugar in the state stood at 13.63 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 and 10.62 lakh tonnes last year. The expectation for the current year 7.14 lakh tonnes of sugar.He said that the steep fall in the production and crushing of cane is only a temporary phenomenon and good monsoon will once again augment cane production in the state. The cane farmers will not be suffering much financial loss due to the fall in production. They will be getting adequate revenue due to the increase in the price of sugar.Mr. Senthamil Selvan said the state accounted for 43 sugar mills  cooperative sugar mills 16, public sector mills 2 and private mills 25. Of them, five cooperative sugar mills have already settled all the dues to the farmers. The government has already given instruction to the other cooperative sugar mills too to settle the dues of the cane farmers.Bakshi Ram, Director, ICAR- Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, said that the institute has tried about 20 new varieties. They have been presented to the farmers and their characteristics, yield, cost-effectiveness have also been explained in detail. The introduction of new varieties is expected to augment the production of cane.He said that the cane farmers opting for other crops is only a temporary phase and they will return back to the original crop, once new varieties were introduced.A.Ramamourti, Director of Agriculture and Commissioner of Sugar, Government of Union Territory of Puducherry, said that mechanisation will prove beneficial only to the farmers having large land holdings. The farmers with small land holdings should join together for the introduction of new technology.M. Maheswaran, Director of Research, TNAU; K. Ganeshmurthy, Director, Centre for Plant Breeding and Genetics, TNAU, S. Pandian, a progressive farmer of Siruvangur also spoke.An exhibition of recent and popular sugar cane varieties, sugar cane machinery, drip irrigation technologies and other agricultural inputs formed part of the annual event."
