Her prescription has been named Rainbow Project because it contains seven principles packaged exclusively for Malayalis and has proven to yield results in terms of disease prevention, which can be understood and practised by making small changes.Seven principlesThe seven principles have been arranged in the VIBGYOR colour format of the rainbow in the reverse. It begins with red, calling for avoiding all toxins, particularly tobacco, recreational drugs and excess alcohol. Orange suggests an increase physical activity in daily life by incorporating physical activities such as gardening, cleaning, walking to shops within one km and using public transport.Yellow suggests at least one hour of sun exposure daily for vitamin D and non-vitamin D benefits because vitamin D deficiency is now quite rampant in Kerala, leading to widespread pain and undiagnosed disability. Moreover, deficiency of the vitamin is linked to many chronic diseases and cancers.Green prescribes a largely plant-based well-balanced diet incorporating good plant protein sources prepared mostly at home but with no processed food and little animal meat.The prescription under blue is water; plenty of water stored in reusable containers made of steel or glass and do avoid drinks with added sugar.Indigo calls for good quality and quantity of sleep, at least seven to eight hours a day, and violet prescribes activities and relationships to reduce stress and importance of purposeful living. Stress has been shown to increase inflammation and incidence of autoimmune diseases and cancers, Dr. Jacqueline says."

Ramadoss urged the Tamil Nadu government to cancel the upcoming MGR centenary celebrations in 11 districts including Chennai, and use the allocated funds for the welfare of the people instead.In a statement, he charged that the taxpayers money was being wasted on the pretext of the centenary celebrations, that too at a time when there were many issues that the State government was not focussing on.Claiming that the conduct of such events had caused undue hardship to the people, he said, The States finances are under stress and sugar prices have increased steeply. In such a situation, it is not acceptable for Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his deputy O. Panneerselvam to be seeking publicity in the name of the MGR centenary celebrations."

Diabetes type-3c, also commonly referred to as diabetes of exocrine pancreas, is a consequence of damage to the pancreas that produces insulin. A recent study published in American Diabetes Association journal Diabetes Care suggests that this type has been misdiagnosed for type-2 diabetes in England. The study found that as many 559 cases of type-3c diabetes were misdiagnosed as type-2 diabetes in the last 10 years.Doctors in the city concur misdiagnosis can occur, sometimes at the cost of patient health, if a course correction does not quickly ensue. If a diabetics pancreatitis goes undetected, it is possible that a misdiagnosis can occur. In roughly about half the cases of chronic pancreatitis in south India, a condition that we call tropical pancreatitis does not produce apparent symptoms in affected individuals, said K.S. Soma Shekar Rao, a gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals.He added that such patients, if they fail to follow up on their treatment, continue to be treated as type-2 cases, increasing risk of organ damage, besides missing out on treatment necessary for pancreas. Type-3c diabetes treatment often needs insulin administration, unlike type-2 diabetes that is treated with medications to overcome insulin resistance in the body, Dr. Soma Shekar said.Studies indicate that the link between diabetes and chronic pancreatitis can be missed, leading to diagnosis of type-2 even if an individuals pancreatic history is known. This has been attributed to high prevalence and likelihood of type-2 in the middle-aged and elderly populations, that are also likely to have pancreatitis.According to Harith Reddy, diabetologist at the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, a physicians diagnosis depends on the patients presentation.Increasingly today, we are not labelling the type of a patients diabetes up on diagnosis. Type-3c diabetes requires certain criterion to be fulfilled which can only be assessed during a series of check-ups after diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, Dr. Reddy said.Doctors say that the scope for missing type-3c diabetes is greatly reduced when a patient follows up on treatment. If high levels of blood sugar do not respond as expected to treatment for type-2 diabetes, subsequent assessments can show a physician if the problem lies in the pancreas. If imaging and blood tests reveal pancreas insufficiency, a diagnosis of type-3c may be made."

The jaggery produced in Bhadravathi is sold in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra.

It wished the recipient good health -- defined by an ideal waist-hip ratio, body mass index, good and bad cholesterol level, and normal blood sugar and blood pressure. Its popularity on social media is an indication of increased health awareness among at least urban Indians.Unfortunately, awareness alone is not enough. There is little matching action among urban Indians to ensure for themselves a healthy diet. Worse, rural India is fast catching up.Medical research illustrates overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases and cancers are not only on the rise but have already assumed epidemic proportions among city dwellers. Nutrition transition, coupled with sedentary and unhealthy lifestyles, are to blame.Maternal and childhood undernutrition are also among the causes triggering a rise in non-communicable diseases. About 2.6 million Indians are forecast to die of coronary heart disease, which constitutes some 54% of all cardiovascular deaths in India by 2020.A recent survey by the National Institute of Nutrition in 16 states waves the red flag. Among urban population, between a third to half the men and women suffer from overweight and obesity-related problems. One in three urban men and women have hypertension, and one in four men and women have diabetes. Hyperlipidemia afflicts one in three men and women.In summary, its a public health disaster on our hands. Lack of time, coupled with easy availability of convenience foods and misleading advertisements, drive the nutrition imbalance in the cities, said Neelanjana Singh, nutrition consultant at Heinz Nutrilife Clinic in Delhi and a member of the Indian Dietectic Association.Indias growing prosperity therefore comes at the cost of the health of its citizens. Take diabetes, for example. The NIN survey showed overall prevalence of diabetes among urban men and women was 28.1% and 23.3% respectively. Among men, prevalence of diabetes was the highest in Puducherry, followed by New Delhi, Karnataka and Kerala. Among women, the trend was almost similar  Puducherry, followed by New Delhi.A separate study commissioned by the Indian Council of Medical Research on Indias diabetes trend came up with the disturbing finding on how the lifestyle disorder is affecting more urban poor. The diabetic epidemic shifts towards the poorer section of the society living in affluent states including Karnataka.Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat are among the states and union territories with the highest prevalence of diabetes, according to the ICMR survey. Tripura is an exception as the north eastern state has one of Indias highest diabetes prevalence despite not being a rich state.Cities in more affluent states have transitioned further along the diabetes epidemic. As the overall prosperity of individual states and the country increases, the diabetes epidemic is likely to disproportionately affect the poorer sections of society, a transition that has already been seen in high income countries, said Viswanathan Mohan, president, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai.But the nutrition imbalance in the cities is only half the story as overnutrition and undernutrition coexist in India. The NIN survey also points out how the prevalence of low body weight, stunting (low height for age) and wasting (low weight for height) remains high among children from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It found 39% stunting among boys below five years from Dalit households and 34% among those from tribal families. For the backward classes and the rest of the population, the corresponding figures are just under 28% and 27% respectively.Poor nutrition was higher in kids from households with low per capita income, illiterate fathers and lack of access to sanitary latrines.A comparison between urban and rural children show those from the cities enjoy a better nutrition profile. But pitted against the children of the developed world, the same set of urban boys and girls turn out to be malnourished. Even in affluent families, there areshortage of micro-nutrients in diet though there is no shortage of food, said Singh."

When injected into rabbits, the vaccine candidate stimulated antibody responses against the sugar shield in four different HIV strains.The protein fragment of the vaccine candidate comes from gp120, a protein that covers HIV like a protective envelope. A sugar shield covers the gp120 envelope, bolstering HIVs defences. The rare HIV-infected individuals who can keep the virus at bay without medication typically have antibodies that attack gp120.Small fragmentResearchers tried to create an HIV vaccine targeting gp120, but had little success as the sugar shield on HIV resembles sugars found in the human body and does not stimulate a strong immune response. Over 60 strains of HIV exist and the virus mutates. As a result, antibodies against gp120 from one HIV strain will not protect against other strains.small fragment To overcome these challenges, researchers focused on a small fragment of gp120 protein that is common among HIV strains."

The priests adorned the presiding deity as Mahishasura Mardini and the temple was kept open from the early hours of the day.The temple was opened with Suprabhata Seva at 3 am, and Balabhoga Nivedana at 6.30 am. Devotees, in large numbers, thronged the hill from the early hours of the day and continued till the night. The queues, prasadam counter, and bathing ghats witnessed high devotee influx. The VIP turnout was also normal and actor Rajendra Prasad, Minister for Labour Pithani Satyanarayana and others were among the prominent people who visited the temple.The Bhavanis, who were relinquishing deeksha, were seen visiting the temple in the wee hours. Bhavani rush during the daytime was insignificant compared to the previous years. Temples across the district have geared up for Vijaya Dashami, the most auspicious day of the nine-day Dasara festival. The number of devotees visiting temples in the last few days has already swollen and the festive mood is set to reach its peak. All major temples are virtually packed as there has been a heavy rush of devotees.Special rituals such as Laksha Kumkumarchana are being performed in all temples to invoke the blessings of the goddess. Spiritual discourses and cultural programs are being organised in temples and at important junctions. The festive mood is all pervasive and traders are doing brisk business. The markets are bustling with activity.

On Dashami, she sits on the throne holding Ikshu kaanda (sugarcane) in one hand and giving blessings to devotees with the other in abhaya mudra (no fear). Sweet juice of Sugarcane symbolizes the juice of bliss (atma jnana  self realisation).She whips those who are wicked and arrogant or harmful to others. Her peaceful, smiling and benevolent looks mesmerize the devotees.. She killed and defeated many demons in many kalpas. Hence, she is known as Aparajita Devi, one who cannot be defeated.

5a14fe019855b76bf13e9aee,Anaesthesiologists: unseen heroes of OT,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/639548/anaesthesiologists-unseen-heroes-ot.html,2017-10-26,"Anaesthesiologists: unseen heroes of OTDr Olinda Timms, Oct 27 2017, 0:02 ISTOctober 16 marked the anniversary of the first successful demonstration of ether anaesthesia at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846, celebrated annually as World anaesthesia Day. The possibility of surgery without pain was considered one of the greatest contributions to humanity and the practice of medicine.Transformations in the field of clinical anaesthesiology followed rapid advancements in medical technology and pharmacology, and a better understanding of human physiology and disease. Its complexity and diverse applications resulted in the creation of anaesthesiology as a distinct medical speciality, a much-coveted professional choice after graduation.From the perspective of patients, however, there is apprehension about going under anaesthesia and the anaesthesiologist remains an enigma. Lack of general information has resulted in common myths and misconceptions that cause unnecessary fears at the time of admission into hospital for surgery. Let us look at a few:Are they doctors? Anaesthesiologists are not just doctors, but they are specialists like surgeons, orthopaedics, or gynecologists. They have undertaken the same number of years of study and training, and have comparable experience and authority. Today, there are even super-specialities like neuro-anaesthesia, cardiac anaesthesia, intensive care and paediatric anaesthesia.When do we meet them? Patients may only remember the masked and capped head in the operation theatre, with the kindest eyes and voice, asking them to count backwards from 10 In fact, the anaesthesiologist is one of the consultants who visit you before surgery to examine you, ask about your past medical history and evaluate your physical fitness for anaesthesia, and describe the plan along with some instructions.What do anaesthesiologists do? Depending on your medical condition, general health and proposed surgery, anaesthesiologists will ensure that you experience no pain during surgery and the surgeon can operate efficiently. Under general anaesthesia, you will be unconscious, and will only be woken up after the surgery is over. In regional anaesthesia, the sensation is blocked only on the operated part of the body, but you will still be comfortable.Will I wake up during the surgery? The anaesthetic drugs are titrated so that you will not be conscious during general anaesthesia. Studies reveal that less than 0.05% of patients wake up during surgery. Even when they do, it is possible for the anaesthetist to recognise and correct this situation.Is it always the anaesthesiologists fault? Just as the risk of surgery is explained to you depending on the type of surgery and your physical condition, there is also risk associated with anaesthesia. Some risks can be minimised by simple measures like rehydration, controlling high blood sugars and blood pressure, and using medications. Risk can be higher in elderly, emergency surgeries, complicated surgeries andvery sick patients. This is always explained to the patient or relatives before consent is signed. Every care is taken to use appropriate anaesthetic drugs and monitor patients throughout. For this reason, blaming the anaesthesiologist for every death in the operating room would be grossly unfair.Do they only work in the operation theatre? While most of the work happens in the operating room, emergency and intensive care is another medical discipline that requires the unique expertise of the anaesthesiologist. Here they are involved in resuscitation, artificial ventilation, invasive monitoring and medicating patients who are critically ill, terminally ill, or accident victims. Anaesthesiologists also work in pain clinics using medications and other procedures that relieve pain in chronic or terminally ill.Is there anything patients can do? Always request to see your anaesthesiologist if you have a surgery planned and ask about the kind of anaesthesia, the procedure and the risks. Share information about your medical history, allergies and medicines you are taking, including previous operations and family medical history. Follow instructions carefully regarding fasting and medications before surgery.Anaesthesiologist are the unseen, unsung heroes of the operating room, working with other surgical specialists for your well-being. Technology may have invaded the operating room in the form of high-tech monitors, anaesthesia delivery machines and ultrasound guidance, but the best protection for the patient is always an experienced anaesthesiologist; ever watchful and swiftly responsive. A patient fully awake after the operation, pain-free and comfortable, is ample reward.(The writer is member, Indian Society of anaesthesiologists, Bengaluru)"

Despite a royal rollout here proclaiming that the once-insular kingdom was open for business, the prince's grand economic plans have proceeded haltingly. nytSaudi Arabia is throwing an economic coming-out party of sorts this week, hawking its efforts to liberalise its conservative society and diversify its economy in a sweeping overhaul of the way the wealthy Arab kingdom has long operated.In a glittering conference centre in Riyadh, slick videos promised a gleaming, $500 billion city of the future, powered by solar energy and run by robots. The crown prince lauded a moderate Islam that embraces the world. And members of the global business elite attended standing-room-only sessions on sustainable energy and the future of urbanisation.The message to bankers, businesspeople and high-rolling investors was clear: The once-insular kingdom is now open for business.Today we have a people who are convinced that by working very strongly together, Saudi Arabia and all of its projects and programs can reach new horizons in the world, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said at the conference on Tuesday.But despite the royal rollout, including a lavish dinner with sushi, lamb and overflowing trays of chocolate truffles, the princes grand plans have proceeded haltingly.The government, in an effort led by the 32-year-old crown prince, has made some remarkable social changes recently, including promising women the right to drive and curtailing the powers of the religious police. But it has so far failed to make much progress on transforming the kingdom from a petro-state into a diverse, productive economy capable of growth at a time of cheap oil.It remains unclear to what extent top-down decrees and dramatic announcements will spur meaningful change in a society long characterised by deep religious conservatism and heavy dependence on the state.Still, many people are taking the new push more seriously than previous efforts. More than 3,500 private-equity investors, corporate chief executives, heads of global organisations and government officials from dozens of countries flocked to this weeks conference, making Riyadh a whos who of international business leaders studying the kingdoms moneymaking prospects.Historically, the countrys vast oil reserves, estimated at one-fifth of the worlds total, made the Saudi government the primary engine of the economy. The state employed most working Saudis and financed elaborate projects, meaning that even the private sector depended heavily on government spending.But the drop in oil prices has undermined that model, shrinking the state budget at a time when hundreds of thousands of young Saudis are entering the job market every year. Growth has slowed drastically, large projects have been suspended and unemployment is a growing concern.To address these challenges, Prince Mohammed has proposed a range of changes under the banner of Saudi Vision 2030 that would once have been unthinkable: increasing the number of Saudis in private employment, including women; soliciting foreign investment; and selling shares of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the state oil monopoly, to raise capital to invest elsewhere. The breadth of the proposals has created a rare sense of dynamism among Saudi watchers.The crown prince is a change agent on a very big scale, and this conference is a very big signal about how rapid is the pace of change, and that it is really happening, Daniel Yergin, a prominent energy strategist who attended the conference, wrote in an email.This is driven by the recognition that an economic model based largely on oil, which worked for four decades, is no longer sufficient when 70% of the population is 30 years or younger, oil prices are volatile and the world is going digital.But the obstacles to economic change are many, starting with a culture that often discourages risk-taking and innovation. With the government cutting costs, Saudis who could once count on secure state jobs must now compete for more demanding ones in the private sector. Moves to undo generous subsidies or reduce the number of foreign workers could destroy businesses reliant on such perks.Increased transparency could deprive members of the royal family their control over lucrative pieces of the economy. And even middle-class Saudis have grown used to subsidised energy, making them vulnerable to changes to the system.After the government tried to cut bonuses for its employees, it caused such widespread grumbling and a drop in spending that in April King Salman backed down, restoring the perks. An increase in water prices was quickly reversed after similar complaints, although higher fuel prices and some so-called sin taxes on sugary drinks and other items appear to have stuck.Despite reports to the contrary, the government insists that it will hold the initial public offering for stock in Saudi Aramco next year, although much about the move remains unclear.Encouraging entrepreneursFor Saudi Arabia to thrive in an era of cheap oil, more Saudis will need to work for private companies, and Prince Mohammed has spoken about moving young Saudis into new industries and helping them become entrepreneurs.But the number of Saudis in such jobs remains small. Most working Saudis are employed by the government, and private companies rely heavily on foreign workers. Foreigners make up about a third of Saudi Arabias population of 31 million, and most are labourers who do jobs many Saudis would avoid for wages they would not accept.The Saudi government has tried to push more citizens into private-sector jobs. But true labour reform will come only through measures like reducing the number of visas for foreign workers or forcing employers to pay salaries Saudis will accept, said Jean-Franois Seznec, a senior fellow at the Global Energy Center at the Atlantic Council.The primary engine of the proposed economic transformation, and the sponsor of this weeks conference, is the Public Investment Fund, which invests in both Saudi and foreign entities and has recently announced a series of multimillion- and billion-dollar initiatives.These include investments in energy efficiency, dairy, entertainment and waste management companies; a fund to support small and medium-size businesses; and other investments in infrastructure, technology and the ride-hailing company Uber. The pledging of so much money has piqued the interest of international investors in Riyadh this week.This country can pull off whatever it wants to pull off, Mary Callahan Erdoes, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chases asset and wealth management division, said before the investment conference began in earnest.The kingdoms reform push remains tightly linked to Prince Mohammed, who is seen by many as the kingdoms de facto ruler, with the blessing of his elderly father, King Salman.After failing to appear as planned to open the conference Tuesday morning, he unveiled an ambitious plan in the afternoon to create a new city from scratch on Saudi Arabias Red Sea coast that would rely on renewable energy and be staffed largely by robots.The project, Neom, would cost $500 billion and seek to create a leading global hub that exemplifies the future of human civilization by offering its inhabitants an idyllic lifestyle combined with exceptional economic prospects, according to promotional materials distributed by the Royal Court.Its head-spinning in its ambition, wrote Yergin, the energy strategist. This is taking on a very big challenge that will be measured not in decades, but over a generation."

He called upon the party cadre to participate actively in the door-to-door campaign of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and evolve measures to address the grievances of the public at the earliest.He directed the leaders to ensure the completion of vermicompost yards and also directed the civic body to augment revenue by producing organic fertilisers from the vermicompost plants.Lokesh also called upon peoples representatives to participate in the Swachh Bharat campaign at village and mandal levels to make their surroundings clean and tidy. Measures will be evolved by the government in collecting `10 crore from the SPM company which needs to pay the Subabul farmers. He directed booth level party cadres to evolve an action plan for the upcoming elections in 2019. On the occasion, peoples representatives also appealed to the minister to supply essential commodities as part of the Public Distribution System (PDS). In return, the minister said that the Central Government has stopped providing kerosene and sugar as part of the PDS. A representation will be submitted to the Centre seeking for the supply of essential commodities through ration, he said.He also took a dig at opposition party MPs for delaying the release of NREGA funds by making false claims in the letters shot to the Centre. Despite the letters, the Centre has sanctioned `337 crore towards NREGA for the State, he added.152 acres alloted to 15 organisationsThe State government has allocated 152.93 acres of land to as many as 15 organisations in the capital region of Amaravati. The government, which constituted the Group of Ministers (GoM) to study allocation of lands to institutes of Centre and State governments, public sector undertakings, corporations, private organisations and individuals, took the decision as per the recommendations made by the GoM last month."

It did not totally abandon the loyal ones in its lowest hierarchy, either after their death or retirement, often giving a job to a dependent.Our office gardener, who looked anywhere between 50 and 60 when I joined, opted for premature retirement, bequeathing the position to his son. The boys upper chamber vacuum was offset by his will power and physical prowess. Then came outsourcing, when gardening was mandated for entrustment to competing contractors. Our cub gardener trembled on the edge of getting dislodged but the employer entertained him as a cook in the subsidised office canteen.Now feeding humans instead of plants, he played his role to everyones satisfaction as even tough jobs like distinguishing sugar from salt he could do this by tasting just a pinch of each  were well within his competence.One day, the cook detected a small leak from a gas cylinder. Networked with several electrical gadgets, exposed wiring areas, etc., and capable of converting hearth fires into pyres at the slightest slip-up, the building risked an all-devouring conflagration. Unperturbed, the cook, on his own steam, accomplished 100% damage control solely on intuition.After the all clear whistle, he gave his superiors a detailed account of the incident. Upon listening to him, they felt that a conduct so exemplary should not go unhonoured and unsung. The chief issued him a congratulatory letter, expressing the hope that he would continue to show such efficiency and resourcefulness in the future as well.Unfortunately, the English letter carried no Malayalam translation, though there was one in Hindi. The cook had a mentor in his office, in whose case the upper storey was even more cavernous. He began where the other left off. The saying there is plenty of room at the top fit him perfectly. Further, the guru could not read or write his own mother tongue. Undeterred by such trifles, the disciple showed the letter to the wise man, humbly soliciting an explanation.After giving the letter a once-over, the sage, quick at the uptake, sat up. (Rough details of the incident had reached him by word of mouth.) Blowing smoke rings from the leisurely beedi he was enjoying and with a sombre look clouding his face, he said in solemn tones, that the employer had condoned his lapse just this once, with a warning that any repetition of such a grave misconduct would be severely dealt with!The cook heaved a sigh of relief. Solace was all he wanted and the interpreter had not stinted on it. And sublime, soul-lifting poetry is often a source of solace to many. Who said the translators job is tough? And that poetry gets lost in translation?"

Apart from being a healthy alternative to soft drinks, the production of the drink, tapped from the inflorescence of coconut, was expected to revolutionise the coconut farming sector of the state. Many farmers were attracted to the option and took up coconut farming. Training for tapping the drink was actively carried out in various parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. While many processing factories emerged in south India, the industry quickly lost the initial euphoria and moved into a debt trap.We gave tapping training to 20 Neera technicians four years ago, said K K Titus, secretary of Kerapriya Federation, a coconut producers federation at Thuravoor in Alappuzha. After three months, the demand for Neera reduced and payments were delayed, prompting them to abandon the job. We wound up the project after we suffered a loss of Rs 24,000 in labour and other charges. There were no takers for the energy drink.T S Viswan, director board member of Karappuram Coconut Producers Company, Kanjikuzhi said, The company set up a plant for processing Neera at a cost of Rs 1.75 crore, with Rs 50 lakh subsidy from the state and Central Governments. The balance amount was taken as loan from various banks with director board members as guarantor of the loan.Now, we are nervous about how we will repay the huge amount. The lack of consumers is the main reason for the failure of Neera production. While soft drink manufactures offer 1.5 to 2 litres for Rs 60 to 70, 200 ml of Neera costs Rs 30 to 35; so people choose the former. We destroyed lakhs of litres due to a shortage of consumers.Viswan said while earlier there were more than 50 tappers in various federations under the company, now there are only four tappers. The company processes and sells Neera in four outlets in Cherthala taluk. We also make value-added products like Neera sugar, jaggery, chocolate and vinegar, he said. But the lack of marketing facility is a constraint and the absence of government support is also a problem for survival. The change of guard in the Coconut Development Board (CDB) is another reason for the setback to the industry."
5a1504c09855b76bf13e9ff3,Nutrition: junk food is consuming us,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/636631/nutrition-junk-food-consuming-us.html,2017-10-06,"Nutrition: junk food is consuming usDH News Service, Oct 7 2017, 0:31 ISTFile image for representation.The National Institute for Nutritions Urban Nutrition Report provides worrying but useful insights into what is making urban Indians unhealthy. Drawing on a survey involving almost 1.72 lakh subjects from 52,577 households across 16 states in the country, the report highlights the role of unhealthy lifestyles and food and drinking habits in triggering illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. Long hours at work, eating junk food and drinking carbonated beverages, along with lack of exercise, are making urban Indians obese and unhealthy, the report says. Consumption of high fat, high salt and high sugar diets, which is common among our urban populations, is significantly linked to hypertension and diabetes. The survey reveals that Kerala and Puducherry lead the country with regard to prevalence of hypertension (31-39%) and diabetes (42%), respectively. Some 60% of women and 42% of men in Puducherry are overweight. Karnataka has a lot to worry about, too. Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels among men and women in urban Karnataka are high; the state tops the country with regard to triglyceride levels. Added to this is widespread smoking and consumption of alcohol in the state, making urban Karnataka highly vulnerable to multiple health risks. Worryingly, 97% of urban mothers in Karnataka start complementary feeding of babies before they are six months old, leaving babies vulnerable to diarrhoea and consequent weight loss.The study makes important links between nutrition indicators among children and socio-economic variables. Child nutrition standards are lower in households with low per capita income, illiterate fathers and no access to sanitation facilities. It is lower, too, among Dalits and Adivasis than in other communities. Children from poor families and marginalised communities are often underweight and stunted because they lack access to nutritious food.Meanwhile, rushed lifestyles are undermining the health of rich and middle class urban Indians. Many prefer eating pasta or pizza to a wholesome meal. They have little time to cook or even eat, and even less for exercise. Life on the fast lane is proving costly and, increasingly, young adults are grappling with obesity and hypertension, which were once problems that did not appear before middle age. Indeed, even children are struggling with obesity, thanks to junk food and sedentary lifestyles. And then there are those who are into fad-diets to lose weight. In their bid to become thin, they skip meals and starve themselves. They are vulnerable to an array of problems like chronic fatigue, irregular menstrual cycles, osteoporosis and decreased attention span. India must take the nutrition reports warnings seriously. The food we eat should be building our resistance to disease, making us energetic and extending longevity. Instead, we are consuming junk, and junk is consuming us."

The Crime Branch has recommended registering a case against him under sections IPC 120, 506 and IT Act (67).In the report, it is said Sulfikar should be booked for threatening Vijayan through phone and this worried Vijayan, worsening his health condition. Sulfikar, who is also the chairman of Kerala Agro Industries Corporation, is alleged of making life-threatening calls to Vijayan days before the latter died in the hospital in Kochi on July 23.Uzhavoor Vijayan was allegedly facing threats within the party for opposing Thomas Chandy to become a minister as a replacement for former Transport Minister A K Saseendran. Saseendran stepped down from the minister post after he faced allegations over an obscene phone call with a woman. When Chandy became the minister, Sulfikkar allegedly began to threaten Vijayan.Sources from the Crime Branch said the investigators will record the statements from Thomas Chandy. The sleuths will also send the recorded telephonic conversations between Sulfikkar and Vijayan to a forensic lab for further examination. However, Sulfikkar said the allegations were false and the conversation was edited.Earlier, the NCP Kottayam district committee had approached Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan with a complaint alleging that Uzhavoor was subjected to mental harassment. The complaint also said Uzhavoors health condition deteriorated after he received a phone call. The NCP leaders had also urged the government to remove Sulffikar from the post.The controversy regarding the death triggered after a television channel aired an audio clip of a conversation between Vijayan and Sulfikkar Mayoori. The audio clip reportedly revealed Sulfikkar did not mind spending a crore or two in killing Vijayan. After the clip was exposed, NCPs official group state president T P Peethambaran Master demanded that a police case needs be registered against Sulfikkar.The said audio clip justifies the allegation Uzhavoor met with an untimely death because of the mental torture meted out to him by a section of the party members. It is being evaluated that Uzhavoor got exhausted by the alleged abuses and insults hurled at him over the phone. Uzhavoor, who collapsed after his sugar level went high, was first rushed to a private hospital in Kidangoor, and was later admitted to a private hospital in Kochi, where he breathed his last."

(File) Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis. (File)FUNDAMENTAL changes in the functioning of the agrarian economy to benefit small farmers was a key promise made by the Bharatiya Janata Party when it rode to power in Maharashtra in 2014. Three years down the line, the state government appears to be perplexed with the challenges that the fickle agrarian economy has thrown at it. In its first year, the government was forced to tackle negative growth in agriculture and scarcity due to drought. This year, an oversupply of produce such as tur dal (pigeon pea) brought in a fresh set of problems.The governments inability to address these vagaries of the agrarian economy had led to an unprecedented farmers agitation, with the simmering discontent threatening to weigh the BJP government down.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has tried to fight his way out by announcing a Rs 30,000-crore farm loan waiver that will further deepen the states debt burden of around Rs 4 lakh crore.Another criticism has been the agriculture departments operations. The state Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar has often been described as too low profile. His deputy Sadabhau Khot, while more visible, has had to focus on his own political survival after quitting his party, the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, which supported the farmers strike earlier this year.The agriculture sector is like one big giant wheel rolling down a hill. It will move ahead even if you do not do anything. The real task is to stabilise this motion and ensure that it does not crash. The policies of this government, however, are such that they have left this sector to fend for itself. There is not much difference in how previous governments and this government have addressed the agrarian issues, said Dr Giridhar Patil, a farmer leader.Despite a decent monsoon this year, sowing area for kharif declined marginally. As per the Maharashtra governments economic survey, the kharif season of 2016-17 saw sowing on 152.12 lakh hectares of land. This year, agriculture ministry data shows that sowing has been completed on only 146.49 hectares of land.Farmers say the pinch from demonetisation last year, which threw APMCs out of gear, has continued to manifest in the complete paralysis of district cooperative banks and credit societies.Their paralysis meant drying up of institutional finance for most farmers in the state. Four days after demonetisation, the RBI had imposed sanctions on district cooperative banks on the assumption that money could get laundered through these banks.A lot of time was taken to address the issues of district central cooperative banks, which did create problems in the rural areas, Chairman of the Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank Narendra Darade said.Another crisis was the massive glut of tur dal and the poor price realisation.In Maharashtra, the production of tur went up to 11.71 lakh metric tonnes against 4.4 lakh metric tonnes last year. Due to improved rainfall, the tur sowing increased sharply but the market could not absorb the excess supply.This meant that farmers were getting rates well below the Minimum Support Price. The government subsequently sanctioned a market intervention scheme to purchase tur stock from farmers, but this was mired in allegations that a large chunk of the tur dal procured by the state had been purchased from traders who had, in turn, got it from farmers at well below the MSP.The state has also not been able to reverse the low coverage of crop insurance in Maharashtra, where it presently stands at less than 30 per cent of farmers.On the positive side, the government launched the farmer-to-consumer markets alongside more APMC reforms for more barrier-free markets. It also started an innovative reform of giving 10,000 solar pumps for agriculture, offering round-the-year power, a reduced demand-supply gap and a lower subsidy burden on the state electricity board.Another important decision that the government took this year was to make drip irrigation mandatory for the water intensive sugarcane cultivation. There had been rising concerns about over-exploitation of water in cultivation of sugarcane.The government has also started a bid to encourage group farming, and the Maharashtra government plans to give Rs 1 crore in incentives to farmers who will pool 100 acres of land and common resources. The government aims to create 200 such farmers groups in the state so that resources can be used in common and farmers can derive more profits.We believe that this sharing of resources and knowledge will help farmers attain better productivity and profits. We need to bring in newer ideas to maximise returns of farmers. The governments endeavour has been to ensure that farmers get returns, which commensurate with the hard work they put in, Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal)Her hair brushed back, a comb tucked in her bun, Gudiya (26) is at ease this Tuesday afternoon. People from the administration are hovering around her, while six policemen keep a vigil on visitors. Officials from Jaldega block in Jharkhands Simdega district, a Naxal-dominated area, have come to the house in Karimati village to help the family encash a cheque of Rs 50,000 given by the administration to Gudiyas mother, Koyli Devi (45). They escort her to the bank located at Jaldega, where Koyli is told she can withdraw the money next week.Breastfeeding the youngest of her children, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, half-an-hour later, Koyli talks of all she can buy with the money. Or could have bought for Santoshi. On September 28 night, her 11-year-old daughter died  Koyli says of starvation  seven months after the family stopped getting their rations as their Aadhaar wasnt linked to PDS. Later, the familys name was struck off the ration card list. Santoshi was the third child Koyli lost; the other two died of illness.Read | Santoshi died of starvationApart from the Rs 50,000 cheque and the Rs 15,000-odd in aid given by visiting leaders, Santoshis death has brought the family 75 kg of rice from the government and other benefactors, 20 kg of potatoes, two litres of edible oil, adequate kerosene oil, 10 soap bars, some green vegetables and tomatoes. Koyli is planning to stock up on more vegetables and pulses at the Wednesday haat.Then, once the cheque is encashed, Koyli will make other purchases. Family members are saying I should get a mobile phone. Also, we need things for the house. We will buy a box (suitcase), she says. The family, including Koyli, husband Tatya Naik, daughters Gudiya and Chando Kumari, and son Prakash, lives in a mud house, with mud-baked tiles for roof. The house comprises a large room, with a small area partitioned off as kitchen.The rest of the money she would keep in the bank, Koyli says, as saving  a new luxury for her.Earlier that day, Koyli indulged in another small luxury. When Chando, 8, asked for something to eat, she gave her Rs 10 to buy coconut biscuits. She likes fancy things to eat and was crying, Koyli says, with a faint smile.Santoshi was never fussy about food, the 45-year-old adds. She only kept asking for rice, but there was not a single grain at home.***************Rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for dinner. Thats been Hemanti Kumaris routine all 10 years of her life. She is in Class 5 of Upgraded Primary School, Karimati. Santoshi cleared Class 5 from here too early this year, but never went on to the middle school (Classes 6 to 8), in the nearby Pangur hamlet.A sprightly girl, barely over 3 ft in height in her slippers and school uniform, Hemanti is happy as today has been a special day. In the morning, she made herself two chappatis and boiled some potatoes  that will be her evening snack, a rare fourth meal.Read | After starvation death case: Jharkhand minister scraps top state officials order on Aadhaar-PDS linkHer mother Padma Devi sits next to an earthen chulha, dug in the verandah of their mud house. She has placed twigs as cooking fuel, and from time to time, stirs a potato curry with tomatoes on the chulha.Hemantis father Gurucharan Mahato works as a labourer, taking up odd jobs. Padma cant do much work as both her legs are amputated. They live at her brother Nareshs home, and are grateful they have only two children to raise. Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Traders had expected the storm to delay harvesting, but were not sure whether it would damage the crop.The government said thousands of hectares of sugar cane, rice fields and rubber plantations had been damaged. More than 40 flights were cancelled.Floods killed more than 80 people in northern Vietnam last month while a typhoon wreaked havoc in central provinces in September.

He made it possible. My mind is clear. I thank the Almighty. I thank the government of India, of various other countries.""The Hindu brothers who worshipped for my well-being, the Muslim brothers who prayed to Allah for my safety.

At no point of time did I lose hope,"" he said in response to a question.The Sacred Heart Cathedral in Delhi held a special mass this evening on his safe return which was also attended by the Vatican's Apostolic Nuncio Giambattista Diquattro.Besides, many nuns, pastors and other faithful from Delhi and other parts of the national capital region, flocked to the imposing red-and-white church to attend the congregation.The priest, dressed in a black robe with a golden ornate cross dangling from his neck, said he prayed even for his captors and hoped God will ""appeal to their good senses"".""I was kept in a room. I had no communication with the world outside for 18 months. I had a small sponge-like mattress on which I used to sit and sleep. I had fever twice but it did not persist. My captors gave me medicine to control my sugar level,"" he recalled, adding, ""they never tortured me"".""They however, made me say certain unpleasant things on video.

The government has made it mandatory to blend 5 percent ethanol in petrol.However, oil companies find it hard to source the sugar byproduct cheaply due to high state duty it attracts because of its use in the heavily taxed liquor industry, hindering its wide acceptance as an automotive fuel.Sugar mills, on the other hand, prefer to sell to higher-paying spirit distilleries, where they get a better and quicker deal.Unlike Brazil, where sugar firms produce ethanol directly from cane juice, Indian millers use molasses, a by-product of sugar-making, to produce the chemical, so a rise in sugar production will also boost ethanol output."

We are cultivating water guzzling crops like sugarcane and paddy in areas where there is no water. We have never produced crops as per the climate,"" Dalwai said addressing an event here.Farm practices need to be adopted as per the climatic conditions and availability of natural resources, he said, adding that there is a need to change the farm policy keeping in mind the future challenges of climate change.Climate change is a reality, he said adding that southwest monsoon, which was to withdraw by September-end, is still active in South India and affecting harvest-ready kharif crops and the farming community.The need of the hour is to adopt science-based agriculture, he said while suggesting shifting some area to tree-based agriculture from water-guzzling cereals to contain green house gas emissions, and growing crops with water-use efficiency.Speaking on the occasion, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) chairman Harsh Kumar Bhanwala said the farm policy should be framed to promote water-based productivity of crops instead of land-based.Since 52 per cent of agri-land is rainfed, farmers' distress can be mitigated by promoting water conservation, constructing watersheds, among other climate-smart farming practices.Farmers' distress and suicides are more in areas with no forest cover and watersheds. ""In north east which has more forest cover, there have not been incidents of farmers' suicides so far,"" he observed.Minister of State for Agriculture Krishna Raj was also present at the two-day event that will deliberate on climate- smart farm technologies and innovations."

You can find out for yourself at Desi Klub, a three-month-old restaurant in the city, which has a special chocolate thali on their menu.Desi Klub is a Mumbai-based restaurant that has franchises in Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai and they are looking to expand. Five partners  Sushil Mehta, Arvind Baheti, Suresh Gundecha, Pavan Surana and Abhishek Bokadia, are happy to have brought the concept of Mumbai street food with a twist to the city.Though chocolate thali was always a part of the menu, we never publicised it much before. It is only now that we have started putting it out on our Instagram and Facebook pages and are getting rave responses, says Shrey Mehta who takes care of operations.Disclaimer: The thali is only for hardcore chocolate lovers. There are eight items in the thali: Chocolate khakhra, chocolate shrikhand, chocolate kheer, chocolate gulab jamun, chocolate swiss roll, chocolate barfi (truffles), chocolate ice cream and a white chocolate lollipop. It has a mix of dark and milk chocolate with infused flavours, that doesnt give you a sugar rush, says Shrey, but we are not convinced till we take a bite of the items on the thali. And boy was he right!First up is the chocolate khakhra, where a plain khakhra is coated with chocolate sauce. Shrey tells us he cant share the recipe, for obvious reasons, but that everything is prepared in house, except the ice cream and khakhra. We source the chocolates from abroad. We make sure that there is a balance of sweet, bitter and other flavours, he adds.The chocolate truffle aka barfi, is made of dark chocolate and coated with chocolate powder, the swiss roll has an orange filling in it, the gulab jamun oozes chocolate as you cut into it...aah its pure bliss even to watch the plate!The thali menu is decided by the main restaurant and the Chennai team had to do a small survey to see if it will work in the city. It is definitely a different concept and nowhere in Chennai do you have a chocolate thali. We tapped that, adds Shrey. Now, they have a minimum of five orders everyday, and they are also quite popular on social media. Most of their customers who prefer chocolate thali are the youngsters. The next step is delivering their food, including chocolate thali, and they are currently in talks with Swiggy, Zomato and Foodpanda.If you are a choco lover, flip right to the end of the menu, to the desserts section, where it is listed. It is intended as a dessert where people can either share or relish individually. But some have had it as their main course itself. We still havent had a customer who could finish the entire thali on their own after the main course, says Abhishek. Why not keep a contest? He laughs, We are planning on it!Have the thali when it is hot...the chocolate gulab jamun just melts in your mouth. As its a dessert, it doesnt matter what you eat first or last. Another tip they give us; dip the khakhra in chocolate kheer (warm dark chocolate sauce). It gives sinfully sublime a new meaning!Priced at `415, the thali is available at Desi Klub on Harrington Road (opposite MCC School).For details, call: 30853689"

My passion for food led me to Bengaluru, where I completed hotel management course in 1990s. I started my career from Ludhiana as kitchen executive in 2000. After two years, I moved to Shimla, where I worked for two years. From Shimla, I moved to the UK for three years and from there to Bangkok for a year.After years of exploring international cuisines, I decided to come back to India and came straight to Hyderabad, where I worked for two-and-a-half years. From there, I moved to Fairmont Hotel in Jaipur, where I worked for five years and then joined Inter Continental, Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort, as executive chef.I have been learning and cooking a lot of different cuisines ranging from Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, Peshawri, Asian, Continental and so on. Because of my extensive travels to different regions and countries, I got various opportunities to learn newer cuisines. My cooking style has improved so much. The more you travel, the more you learn about the flavours, ingredients and the culture of the food itself.Whatever cuisine I cook, I am particular about using fresh ingredients and also maintain the authenticity of the flavours and the cuisine itself. Earlier acquiring the right kind of spices and ingredients were a bit difficult, but today everything is easily available in every place.Its fascinating how one dish can be cooked in different ways, depending on the region it comes from. In Hyderabadi biriyani for instance, the raw meat and raw rice is cooked together and it is spicier. Whereas in Lucknowi biriyani, the chicken and rice are cooked separately, after which it is layered. And the flavouring is little bit on the sweeter side they use ingredients like saffron, star anise and cinnamon, hence giving a sweet flavour to it. My favourite biriyani is Hyderabadi because.I cook a lot of Asian as well, and that is one of my favourites  Chinese, Thai, Sichuan, Cantonese, etc. If you ask me my favourite dishes, it has to be the Hon Shimeji, Baby Sea Bass and Pan-fried Chicken Shanghai. Authentic Chinese food too differs in terms of flavouring and ingredients depending on the region  using of wild herbs or using a different method to cook like pot-roasting or stewing, etc. Flavours are altered according to the taste the people prefer.There have been several embarrassing mistakes I have made. One in particular was during my initial days of training when I was on a night shift. I was supposed to boil potatoes that night for the next day. So I put them in the container for boiling and I just stepped out for a bit, only to return four hours later and realise that I had left the potato. By then, it was too late!

Beaches, history, music, culture or temples? 27-year-old anonymous artist Chitra Iyer, an illustrator, associates herself with the food and food joints in the city. And mind you, they are not just the popular ones. From filter kaapi to dosai at Sangeetha, Chitra recently did a series of 25 drawings called Chennai Doodle Series, where she takes you through her food memories in Chennai.A true blue Chennai girl, she started this series as timepass. ""My initial idea was to do a recipe blog; instead of taking pictures I wanted to draw them. But then I realised they are aplenty and are too common. I wouldn't be able to do anything new with it. Hence I started this series for fun,"" she says. The series not just has hotels and shops on paint and paper, but also food items that she relished as a kid. Thaen mittai, vadai and kuzhipanniyaram made the cut.The series includes Sathyam popcorn, Grand sweets murukku, Frankie, and Jigarthanda. So what are her early food memories in Chennai, considering that the scene is changing frequently and rapidly? ""Early food memories definitely include the masala dosai from Saravana Bhavan that was right next to our house; the small family-owned sweet shops; the roadside sundal especially near Marina Beach and of course panju mittai and kuchi ice,"" she shares.As there are umpteen favourites in the city, Chitra had to make tough choices sometime. ""My idea was to paint those that look visually appealing. I wanted to draw the Murugan Idly Kadai but it is just a white building with a white board, so I had to choose something colourful, like the Balaji sandwich shop,"" she says. The series also involves her favourites from Coimbatore, where she spent a few years. ""It is mostly all Chennai, but some memories from Coimbatore too. I didn't want to call it Tamil Nadu doodle series.""Chitra has been sketching for quite some time and has taken to painting only now. While she took close to two hours at the beginning of the series, now she finishes them in 30 minutes. It was easy for her to get ideas, as she has been to all these places. Yet, she did put out tweets for public opinion. ""Most of it were my ideas. Many wanted me to draw the Venkateswara Boli Stall, but I have never been there. And there were polls on choosing between Mansukh Chat and Balaji Sandwich Shop,"" she says. There were some that didn't make the cut. ""Some of them were Ratna Cafe, The old Grand Sweets and also the small shops I visited as a child. They are no longer existed and I don't have any photographs of them too.""Among all the hardest was sundal! ""Can you believe that?! They are all the same colour and it was very hard to give dimension to it. As much as I wanted to do, I had to drop it. Even bhajji is hard to paint. But my latest one was a molaga bhajji but water spilled over it and I replaced it with sugarcane juice. I will do a bhajji series soon; it's my favourite beach food,"" she smiles.The series has 25 photos and she will now move on to series on other cities she lived in- Hyderabad, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The series has received good response but there are a few who have asked why certain other favourites were not included. ""I might do a separate series but not include it in this set. I might call it 'favourite restaurants of India' or something,"" she points out.Follow her on Instagram at @analiensart"

The last few days have been all about Chhath with breathless Biharis from all over the country hanging on to every available mode of transport to come home for Chhath. The end of the 36-hour fasting ritual saw Patnaites make a beeline to the Ganga's shores to offer arghya to the sun god.Malls rise to ChhathBut the marketplaces and streets in Patna have been overcrowded since two days before Chhath Puja as people scurried about to stock up for the festival. As traffic slowed to the proverbial snail's pace, many Patnaites avoided stepping out altogether. Happily, goods like earthen ovens and sugarcane required for the four-day annual festival were available in malls for the first time. The well-heeled were happy enough to shop for Chhath in air-conditioned malls. The festival is held in honour of the Sun God and his consort Usha, and the strict rituals are observed by rich and poor alike.Cheers over cleaner airPatnaites were glad to have cleaner air to breathe on the morning after Diwali this year unlike in previous years. Although Diwali night noise levels in this perennially noisy city were slightly higher, the cleaner air was a pleasant surprise. Respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) on the morning after Diwali was recorded at 379.72 micrograms per cubic metre against 685.97 last year. This welcome change was the result of young people shunning firecrackers in significant numbers after the Supreme Court banned sale of fireworks altogether in the Delhi-NCR region. Data from the Bihar State Pollution Control Board showed the RSPM levels in the city started falling even before Diwali.Goddess Kali's popularityWhile Diwali has long been big in Patna, Kali puja fans have been increasing in recent years. Earlier it used to be the lesser festival as it often coincided with the festival of lights. this year, more than a dozen Kali puja pandals cropped up in the city this year, though the number is still short of the Durga puja pandals. One reason why Kali puja was less popular earlier is that priests skilled in the stern rituals involving Tantric mantras were not easily available in Patna. The city's small Bengali community has, however, been observing Kali puja with great fervour for close to a century.Univ drive against graffitiKnown as the cradle of many top politicians in Bihar, the century-old Patna University seems to have been energized after PM Narendra Modi's recent visit to its portals. The university's administration, after supervising a major facelift of the premises for the centenary celebrations, is now keen on keeping its surroundings thoroughly clean. No more defacement of hostel walls with graffiti. ""We will meet student reps shortly and ask them not to scribble graffiti on the walls anymore,"" said registrar Birendra Kumar.

Picture taken October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir HossainRefugees in IndiaThe Qissa-i Sanjan (Story of Sanjan) recounts the early years of the Parsees in India. After the fall of the Persian Empire to the Arabs, the Persians fled to the mountains of Khorasan. They lived a nomadic life for a few decades. In 785 AD, they reached Sanjan, a small fishing village on the Gujarat coast.When the Parsees requested asylum, Jadi Rana, the ruler of Sanjan, gestured to a vessel of milk that was full to the brim. His kingdom was already full and could not accept refugees. In response, one of the Parsee priests added a pinch of sugar to the milk. This was to indicate that the Parsees would not make the vessel overflow. Rather, they would make the lives of the citizens sweeter.Over the years, millions of similarly situated communities have found refuge in India. In the process they have added to our culture and economy. The Tibetans, persecuted in China, have found homes in Dharamsala. Thousands of Afghans live in relative peace in New Delhi. There have been instances, though, of India having deviated from her traditional hospitality. For example, asylum-seekers from Burma were jailed, and approximately 5,000 Burmese refugees were pushed back home between 1995 and 1997. However, Indias record with refugees remains largely one of acceptance.And yet, there exists a surprising contradiction. Successive governments have refused to sign the Refugee Convention of 1951. Even today, Indian domestic law does not have a formal mechanism to deal with refugees. These issues have been brought back to public attention by petitions that are pending hearing before the Supreme Court. The petitions seek a stay on the deportation of the members of the Rohingya community living in India.The RohingyaThe Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim minority group from the state of Rakhine in Myanmar. Today, close to a million Rohingya survive as a stateless race. No country will accept them as citizens. They have suffered rape, torture, forced labour and murder. Hundreds of thousands have fled to Thailand, Bangladesh and India. However, they have received little support from the governments or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR). The United Nations has described the Rohingya as the worlds most ignored and persecuted minority.Efforts to deprive the Rohingya of citizenship began shortly after Myanmars independence in 1948. In 1977, the military government commenced Operation Nagamin (Dragon King) to identify illegal immigrants. The violence and religious persecution that followed forced more than 200,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. In 1982, former dictator General Ne Win enacted the Burma Citizenship Law, which identified 135 official ethnic minority groups as citizens. The Rohingya were not among them.The 1982 law, thus, rendered the majority of Rohingya stateless. The international communitys silence has made matters worse. A 2015 study by the Yale Law School has concluded that the acts committed against the Rohingya, individually and collectively, meet the criteria for finding acts enumerated in the Genocide ConventionThe Stand of the Central GovernmentBefore the Supreme Court, the central government has taken a stand that the Rohingya are illegal immigrants. Their presence is a threat to the countrys security. The government also states that providing refuge to the Rohingya would deprive citizens of resources. It asserts it right to deport them in accordance with procedure established by law. Significantly, the government has contended that India being a non-signatory to the Refugee Convention, the principle of non-refoulement is not applicable.This contention appears to be untenable. Simply put, non-refoulement refers to the system of not forcing refugees or asylum seekers to return to a country in which they are liable to be subjected to persecution. The UNHCR asserted the status of non-refoulement as a principle of customary international law as far back as 1977. Thus, it is applicable to India, notwithstanding the fact that it is not a party to the refugee convention. Many recent commentators even hold it to be a jus cogens norm  a peremptory norm of international law from which no derogation is permitted.An exhausted woman is carried after a group of Rohingya refugees arrived by a wooden boat from Myanmar to the shore of Shah Porir Dwip, in Teknaf, near Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh, October 1, 2017.

REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain TEMPLATE OUT An exhausted woman is carried after a group of Rohingya refugees arrived by a wooden boat from Myanmar to the shore of Shah Porir Dwip, in Teknaf, near Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh, October 1, 2017. Picture taken October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain TEMPLATE OUTIt is true that some treaties (for e.g. Article 33 (2) of the 1951 convention) allow refoulement in the interest of national security. However, the general consensus is that the exception is narrowly tailored, and is to be interpreted restrictively. Developments in the field of human rights law also exclude exceptions to non-refoulement. Jurists like Sir Elihu Lauterpacht have stated the essential content of the principle of non-refoulement at Customary Law is that:No person shall be rejected, returned, or expelled in any manner whatever where this would compel him or her to remain in or return to a territory where substantial grounds can be shown for believing that he or she would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This principle allows of no limitation or exception.Principles of customary international law or jus cogens norms have to be read into domestic law, when there is no conflict between the two. Two High Courts  Gujarat (1998) and Delhi (2015) have held that the principle of non-refoulement is a part of the guarantee of life and personal liberty under the Constitution. However, significantly, neither of the Courts have gone ahead to stop deportation. The ultimate decision has been left with the Government in both cases.One cannot say with certainty if the Supreme Court will allow the deportation of the Rohingya to Myanmar, Bangladesh or Thailand  countries where they have faced mass human rights violations. Principles of law aside, the scarcity of resources in countries receiving a mass influx of refugees cannot simply be ignored.It is clear that forced migrations will continue to grow over time. There is pressing need for a more institutional response to the problem of refugee resettlement in South Asia. India, given its position in South Asia can exercise considerable influence. The limitations of international law  a law largely without sanction are well known. The necessary implication of these limitations is that any solution to the Rohingya problem must be based on mutual cooperation. Whether such a solution is found in time to prevent more death and despair, is something only the future will tell.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Source: Reuters) When the unpronounceable Sukadelappen was being cooked in Amsterdam, a beep replaced the naming of the meat. (Source: Reuters)There is a very good reason why those who watch too much television are called couch potatoes: Its the food, stupid. The food we eat while consuming TV and the food we see cooking on TV which only makes us (want to) eat more.Masterchef Australia, into a new season (Star Plus), is one of many shows contributing to an alarming increase in our girth. With several dedicated food channels and others with food shows (TLC, Travelxp), our TV screens are bursting at the seams  no wonder every new TV in the market comes with a wider screen. Yes, Kitchen Chronicles (Living Foodz HD not Living Foodz which serves a different menu) are Pure Sin  Food Porn (Food Food) filled with Food, Dudes & Tattoos (TLC) or almost nude people: Hosts like the lady in Backpack (Travelxp) appear in a bikini plated on an ocean wave.The food, well, theres everything you could, would ever want to chew on and more. From mussels to muscles, from fruit and flower to fowl, from cattle to cattlefish, accompanied by gallons of alcohol for the Spirited Traveller (Fox Life) with a sweet tooth.Nobody told chefs on TV that sugar is bad for you, kids and the teeth? Just watching a chocolate brownie with meringue gives you a cavity (Food Porn, FYI TV 18). And the cheese oozing from every pore of a sandwich in USA Cheese (FYI TV18)  kya cheez hai! makes you exclaim before heading for blocked arteries. Or theres the buttery slope for you to slip on and break your neck.Theres something very fishy going on here; thats because every conceivable creature living (a thousand leagues) under the sea is on the menu: Oysters appear like pebbles on a beach. Consequently, less meat on the burner, unless its mutton curry or biryani.Even fishier? When the unpronounceable Sukadelappen was being cooked in Amsterdam, a beep replaced the naming of the meat (Fox Life); ditto Australian meat pie  pure sex to a satisfied customer (FYI TV18). Is beef being censored on food shows?Indian food channels cook Indian food and Western dishes as we like to call them even if they are Eastern. So there was cinnamon French toast with sponge cake instead of bread (Food Food); Tofu with Chiu spinach sauce (Living Foodz). Health food is a fad: khandvi fruit salad, anyone (Ranveers Caf)? Healthy and exotic? Fish sans oil cooked in sulphur fumes from an Italian volcanic eruption. Or spiders and bee larva (Fox Life)?A few other points: Difficult to follow some recipe because Indian food, in particular, can have too many ingredients. Or this health dish of water melon, melon, pineapple, papaya, mango, plums, cherries, pomegranate, chia seeds, walnuts, gold leaf, etc. (Health Maange More, Food Food). Hosts frequently dress like theyre Nigella at a banquet: One wore a crimson kurta, yellow jacket with a blackish pocket kerchief  trying to rival the red chillies and haldi in the recipe (Dussehra Special, Food Food)? Another, stirred ingredients with a fork, her finger, a spoon and a spatula  in that order  while a third wore a chunni close to the gas range. Hygiene and safety first, please. Hosts also go wow, beautiful at their own handiwork  decidedly tasteless. Embedded ads: A host used Savlon soap and praised it  germ free. Not done.But lets not quibble: Cookery shows are a feast for the eyes, a sort of comfort food even if at the end of it, we are dying of hunger.Speaking of health, a gargantuan thank-you to BJP leader Yashwant Sinha. His opinion piece in this newspaper last week compelled the republic of English news channels to deliberate the well-being of the Indian economy on their newshour debates that very evening  and to interview Sinha himself.Even News 9, which normally confines itself to glad/bad tidings south of the Vindhyas, weighed in on the issue.

It took a certain kind of person to battle the odds and emerge victorious. It took a person like LL Narayan, affectionately called LLN, who made the bold decision of transforming what was purely a trading enterprise into the manufacturing entity that Rane Group is now.A man who was much ahead of his time, LLN knew that low fixed costs and overheads were crucial to a successful enterprise. 2017 marks his birth centenary, which was observed at a small gathering in Chennai recently. He developed an asset-light business model and practised frugal engineering much before they became watchwords for modern businesses, said Laxman, his son and current chairman emeritus of the Rane Group.French Parade in MadrasA botany graduate, one of LLNS strengths was his attention to detail. As a salesman, he was a forerunner of flamboyance, much ahead of the start-up billionaires of this new millennium. In 1948, Rane was a trading company for automobiles and parts. When LLN took over a consignment of 300 Renault cars, the salesman in him realised the potential it held.It was not to be a cargo transfer from the port to garage, but a statement, probably without much additional expense  he simply arranged for young men to drive those cars from the harbour, down Mount Road, through Pattulas Road like a parade. Even in an age devoid of mobile phones and social media, the news of the French parade spread like wild fire, and the vehicles were sold from Cape Comorin to Hyderabad in a matter of a few days!But that was LLN, the sales professional. As a person, he was simple, like many of the visionaries of his time... He operated without a calendar and his doors were always open, Laxman added.Tight purse stringsLLN joined Rane in 1940, when the trading firm was run by TR Ganapathy Iyer. So impressed was Iyer by the skill and potential of the young man, he was keen to have Narayan as a son-in-law. Soon, LLN married Saraswathy, Iyers eldest daughter. When Iyer died in 1946, LLN took over Rane. His management style was different from Iyers, and though it was touted as flamboyant, LLN was very particular about keeping a close watch on the funds.Soon, despite his success in the trading business, Narayan began dreaming big, of becoming the manufacturer of products that countless traders like him sold. But, the business atmosphere in the 1950s was not the most conducive.In the 1950s, the backdrop was that of the establishment of the permit raj and licences, where entrepreneurs were not encouraged but controlled, and all auto companies were restrained due to the exceedingly high taxation on passenger vehicles, narrated Abhay Firodia, chairman of Force Motors, at the event. The odds were against any entrepreneur. But we saw a few companies like Rane that successfully battled these obstacles to create a legacy that stands till today.LLN brought the doggedness and personal networking of a salesman to the new job. He made the effort to visit plants regularly and went the extra mile to keep up business relationships, recalled N Sankar, chairman, SANMAR group.Head and HeartDuring one of his interactions, Laxman recalled something he was told. He said while his father did business with his heart and head, the next generation did business only with their head. Thats why he was able to generate immense goodwill with the other businesspersons of his time, he pointed out. Sankar agreed, and added, The moment he saw the plot of 15 acres on OMR, he thought it was completely unnecessary and told me I had wasted money.But herein lay the greatness of the man: he called the next day and said that he had studied my project report and felt it held promise. He encouraged me a lot, but his views on unnecessary wastage in the project stage stuck with me. I always sought advice from him and could count on him because he would not sugarcoat his opinion."

The idol at the Mahakal temple is one of the twelve Jyotirlings in the country.Under the new norms, devotees would now be allowed to offer only half a litre of RO (reverse osmosis) water as jalabhishek and only 1.25 litres of panchamrit (a mixture of milk, curd, honey, sugar and ghee to be allowed per devotee). The idol would have to be completely covered with dry cotton cloth during Bhisma Aarti, exhaust fans should be installed inside the sanctum sanctorum and it should be kept dry when jalabhishek is not being done. Jalabhishek should not be allowed throughout the day, according to the new rules. Other rules include flower offerings to be made only on the top part of the idol, the sanctum to be cleaned after 5 pm everyday and permitting only dry offerings after 5 pm.The order came after a committee of experts consisting of officials from the Archaeological Survey of India and Geological Survey of India had looked into the causes that were leading to the shrinking of the Shiva lingam in the temple. The committee was formed by the apex court after the court was petitioned by the Ujjani Vidwat Parishad that claimed that the Shiva lingam was shrinking because of excessive bhang offerings. The temple which was rebuilt in the 18th century, in Ujjain, was corroding due to pollution, moisture and the offerings, the committee had told the apex court."

On of the best part about Diwali is food. Aromas of the lip-smacking gulab jamuns, jalebee and malpuas breeze through almost every home. Each community in chennai has its traditional set of sweets and snacks which they make during this festive occasion. Most recipes are guarded like family heirlooms and passed on from one generation to next. And the unwritten rule dictates that ingredients, portions and taste have to remain the same every Diwali! Thushara Ann Mathew brings you a taste of how Chennai celebrates Diwali.BengaliNeela Ganguly Sundaram, Cooking enthusiastOne sweet that is specially made for Diwali for Bengalis is the famous Malpua  a delicacy that is made with rice flour and milk; and in snacks it is Nimki  a triangle or diamond-shaped snack made out of maida, ghee, jeera, etc. Diwali is the time to munch on sweets and snacks. We also make other delicacies such as payesh and sandesh. I make them every year. Although I do not do it as a business, I do make them for friends and others because I want people to know more about such Bengali delicacies. People give me really positive feedback. The recipes have been passed on to me by my mother and grandmother, and although the quality and taste remains the same, today we tend to add some extra ingredients to enhance the taste. The malpua that my grandmother made used to be white in colour, but since we add khoa to it these days, it comes out in a yellow shade, but the taste remains the same. These days we garnish it with almonds or pistachio, etc.MalpuaMilk: 1 litre, Plain Flour: 100 gramsSemolina: 2-3 spoons, Fennel Seeds: 2-3 spoonsGhee, Oil, Dry fruits: for ganrishBoil the milk and condense it to half the quantity, cool it for a bit. Mix the plain flour and semolina into this and blend it well into a proper consistency. Now add the powdered fennel seeds into this mixture and stir till there are no lumps. Keep aside for 10-15 minutes.Take a flat pan, mix a bit of oil and ghee in half proportion each and heat it well. Take a small-cupped ladle and take one scoop of the batter and cook both the sides until golden colour.Prepare a syrup of sugar with a bit of cardamom and saffron.Once the malpuas are made, put in the sugar syrup for a while and serve it with dry fruits garnished over it.RajasthaniVineeta Jatia, Spoonful CateringRajasthani food is supposed to be extremely rich in flavour and taste. And on a festive occasion such as Diwali, the level of richness just increases, as it is a part of the tradition that we are supposed to eat good and really rich food on this day. Traditional Rajasthani sweets and savouries that are prepared on this day include besan laddoo, gond ka laddoo, shakkar para, mathri/ suhali, etc. During the festival we mainly have three days of puja, what we call as Dhanteras, Roopchaudar and Badi Diwali. We even worship Lord Yama, Ganesha and Lakshmi, along with worshipping Ram. Some of the snacks and sweets are kept aside for the Gods as an offering on this day. Like I mentioned earlier, Rajasthani food is quite heavy and usually doesnt suit Chennais climatic conditions. But we cannot have a Diwali without these delicacies, and since most of the ingredients are easily available here, it becomes easier to make it as well.Besan ladduFlour: 2 cups gramGhee:  cupSugar:  porousCardamom powder:  tspAlmonds and pistachio for garnishRoast the gram flour in a pan by adding little ghee for about 30 minutes. To this mix, add the porous sugar. You can add few small pieces of almond into it(optional). Cool the mix for a bit and make small balls out of it. Garnish with pistachio/almonds or even kesar.Kumbakonam Tamil BrahminR Prabhuram and Kala Jagannathan, Svadishta FoodsThe main sweets and savouries that we make and sell for Diwali are rava laddu, badusha, jhangri, boondhi laddu, gulab jamun, kara sev, mixture, ribbon and omapodi. Traditionally we also prepare a special Diwali leghyam (Diwali medicine), a day before Diwali, with all the herbs  this helps in balancing the excess food that we tend to consume during such festivals and also avoids any stomach uneasiness. Although the above mentioned are the traditional sweets and savouries that are prepared for Diwali, the trend keeps changing according to demand. Today, people prefer to eat other sweets such as Mysore pak, kaju katli and other cashew and milk based varieties as well. We prepare traditional Kumbakonam Brahmin style food and stick to our authentic recipes for all the delicacies, which have been passed on from generations.Rava LadduRoasted rava (sooji):  Kg,Powdered sugar:  KgGhee:  Kg,Broken Cashews: 100 gms.Cardamon powder: 2 pinchesRoast the rava and make a fine powder. Into this, add the powdered sugar and cardamon powder. Roast Cashews until light brown and add to the powder mixture. In a pan, melt the ghee for few minutes and pour this into the powder and mix well. Make the laddus before the mixture cools.GujaratiParul Bhatt, authoring a cookbookDiwali is the most important festival for Gujaratis and our celebrations last for five days. I make traditional sweets and savouries every year which sweets include delicacies like ghughra, Magas and sweet sakkarpara, and the savouries include poha chevada or mixture,7 pad Farsi puri, methiya,chorafali etc. The five-day long festival includes  Dhanteras, Kalichaudash, Chopada Poojan, Govardhan Pooja and Bhaibeej. And each day includes a set of worship and we also make sweets like sooji halwa to give as an offering to the god. I have been cooking for several years now and distributing the same with friends and family. Most recipes have been taught by my grandmother and mother. So I am particular about the authenticity of the recipes, as that is exactly where the taste lies.MagasBesan(chickpea flour): 3 cupsMilk: 2 table spoon, Ghee:  cupSugar: 1 cup, Cardamom: 4, powderedAlmond and pistachio: 10 each (soaked, peeled and cut into long strips)Warm the milk and add two teaspoons of ghee in it. Add the chickpea flour and milk and mix well. Let it rest for 20 minutes, before sieving it well and ensuring there are no lumps. Heat some ghee in a heavy bottom broad pan, to this add the flour and keep stirring. Cook on low heat,till pink and then take the pan off the gas. Let it cool and add sugar, cardamom powder, almonds and pistachio and make small balls/laddus out of it.KannadigasPavithra Lakshmanan, PR professionalWe make traditional Kannada sweets and snacks based on demand, and that seems to be more especially during Diwali. The traditional sweets have a background story. We make Somasi (that resembles Lord Krishnans Shanka  shell) and Chakli, a savoury that resembles Chakra. So it is believed that Lord Krishna used these as the weapons to kill the demon Naragasura. We also make the Kanadigas go-to dish Obatu (sweet poli) and Hayagrivamidi. We have not deviated from the traditional recipe as it simplest wont taste the same. Also in a way it is remembering our lineage Every Diwali, my mother makes the same sweets besides the other fancy ones (like badam halwa). She has so many stories about cooking with fire wood during her childhood days. I guess that is the only thing that has changed in todays scenario.SomasiMaida: 1/2 cup, Roasted rava: 1/2 cupBaking Soda: a pinh, Ghee: 2 spoonsSugar: 1 cup, Fried gram: 1 cupGrated desicated coconut (kopparai):  cupDry fruits, Cardamom powder: to tasteMix maida and rava with a pinch of baking soda and ghee. Make a dough and keep side for two hours. Prepare the filling powdered pottukadalai and sugar. To this add the grated coconut and mix well. Add fried cashew, raisins and grated almond. Finally add some cardamom powder, mix well and keep side.Take a lemon size ball of the dough roll into thin puris, put a spoonful of the powder and fold to half to get a semi circle. Seal the edges tightly with little water, and cut the edges with a somasi cutter so that it looks like a semi circle.Heat oil in a kadai, and fry the somasi one by one, till golden brown. Arrange them in a plate and sprinkle some powdered sugar on top.PunjabiSurbhi Vohra, Food enthusiastPunjabi cuisine, like we all know is heavy on ghee and butter. And all the ingredients we use are in its purest form. For Diwali, we prepare sweets like red gajar ka halwa, rice kheer, besan ke laddu, gulab jaamun, pinni (a sweet made out of wheat, dry fruits, ghee,etc) and savouries like mathri and also food items like chole bathure and rajma chawal is a staple in most Punjabi houses, during the festive season. We also have a tradition of buying silver coins every year on Diwali and we clean it on the day of Lakshmi puja with milk and water. Apart from this, we also make a special delicacy called as charnamrith  which is made out of milk, curd, honey, sugar, rose petals,etc and we add the new silver coin into it as well. After the puja is performed, this is then served to everybody. Although I make Diwali special sweets and savouries for people, I miss the flavours of the ingredients I get back home in Punjab. Especially, while making the gajar ka halwa, we dont get the red, long carrots here, like we get back home, and that really makes a difference in the taste and flavouring of the sweet.Red gajarka halwaRed carrot: grated 1 kgMilk: 2 kg, Sugar: 1 kgCream of milk:according to tasteGhee:for garnish and fryingDry fruits: for garnishIn a pan, fry the grated carrot in little ghee. Now pour the milk into the grated carrot and mix well. Add some of the cream/malai into it. Stir well, till the milk is reduced and the mix becomes thick. Keep stirring as you add the sugar into it. Stir and put 2 spoons of ghee just for the flavouring. Garnish with dry fruits like cashews and raisin."

The number is reducing every year as the department is trying to take measures, he said.A senior official from the department, on anonymity, said that on an average, every year in Karnataka, 200 new boilers are added.These boilers need routine inspection. The wear and tear also cause damage. We can prevent accidents, provided it is routinely checked and maintained.The owners focus more on production than maintenance, official said.Further, an official said, though there are 3,000 boilers, there are hardly 10 officials, including the Joint Director, Assistant Director. Normally the inspection is conducted by inspectors, with one inspector for every 300 to 400 boilers. How can one person inspect so many boilers in one year? Some boilers need inspection twice a year to get certified. We need people to conduct a routine inspection. The department is planning to hire three more people, but even then it wont be enough, he said.When contacted T G Manjunath, Director of Factories, Boilers, Industrial Safety and Health, said, there is a shortage of inspection staff but they are trying to manage. The government of India has also given some relaxation on inspection.All these years, it was a department official. Now, third-party inspection is also possible, where an external private agency is given authorisation to do a periodic inspection. This will certainly lessen the burden, added the official."

Imagine their surprise when they found out that in many places, jaggery was being made without its main ingredient  sugarcane juice.This situation is the result of the closure of MPM Sugar Mills in Bhadravati when almost all sugarcane growers turned to making jaggery on their land. Some got together to set up their own Aalemanes while some did it individually.Along with Mahalingapura of Bagalkot district and Pandavapura of Mandya, Bhadravati is the largest producer of jaggery in the state.Earlier there were more than 150 Aalemanes in the taluk, but now the number has dwindled to 92. As the quality of jaggery is good, the price too is high. So, to encash on this, new jaggery makers started producing spurious products.This came to light when authorities of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India and police raided some of the aalemanes in Aralihalli and Thiplapura of the taluk on the direction of the Additional Deputy Commissioner.We were shocked to see that inferior quality jaggery was being made using chemicals and fertilizer. We will bring this issue to the notice of the DC and necessary steps will be taken, said Shankarappa, district officer of FSSAI.The members of Aalemane Owners Association have urged the authorities concerned to take necessary steps to stop the manufacture of inferior quality jaggery.Zilla Panchayat member and Jaggery unit owners society president Manishekhar said, Today we have convened a meeting of all our members. We have reprimanded those who were engaged in making spurius jaggery. The society will not support such people.How inferior jaggery is madeThe jaggery makers would bring residues of jaggery made in Mahalingapura and Pandavapura and very low quality sugar that was rejected by factories and mix them with water, fertilizer and other chemicals to make jaggery.While traditional jaggery makers use residues of sugarcane as fuel for boiling the cane juice, new jaggery makers use tyres, plastic and other such wastes as fuel. Several loads of tyres and plastics at the aalemanes caught the attention of people, said an aalemane owner.Many villagers and residents started complaining about the smoke emanating from such aalemanes to police, which also blew the lid on the manufacture of sub-standard jaggery.After the raid, the FSSAI and police recovered huge stock of tyres, chemicals and fertilizer."

On Sunday, the family performed the  S e ema n t a Shastra (baby shower) to bless maharani Trishika Kumari, wife of Mysuru maharaja Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar. The couple is expecting their baby in two months. The public and the media were kept out of the ceremony as Palace officials considered it a family function. Trishika, who hails from the royal family of Rajkot, married Yaduveer in June 2016. Members of Dungarpur palace, seers from Parakala Mutt and palace priests held special pujas recently and blessed Trishika.Its after more than six decades that the family has performed the traditional baby shower. The last time the family celebrated in a grand manner was the birth of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar in February 1953. Mysuru Palace staff then had distributed sugar in trucks and bullock carts in Agrahara and other localities to share their joy. Legend has it that the royal family had gone heirless, believed to be a curse of queen Alamelamma. In 1612 Raja Wadiyar took over Mysore, then under the Vijayanagara Empire, after dethroning an ailing Tirumalaraja.Tirumalarajas wife Alamelamma then took all ornaments and escaped. Historians say she was upset over the Wadiyars usurping her husband. When Wadiyars soldiers tracked her down, she committed suicide by jumping into Cauvery river. But not before she uttered the ominous words cursing the Wadiyars to an heirless future. But historian Nanjanraj Urs said there was no Alamelamma. He said Thammaiah Shastry who penned Rajavamsha Rathaprabha had come out with the story of Alamelamma; it has not figured in the second edition in 1897. Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar believed that as 16 generations had passed after the curse, he would have a biological son. However, his sudden demise made wife Pramodhadevi Wadiyar to adopt Yaduveer Gopal Raj, son of Swarup Anand Gopal Raj Urs and Tripurasundari Devi."

With basic facilities to treat patients just like primary health centres (PHCs), the transit health centres will have a small dispensary with basic general drugs.Some fatalities can be prevented if treated at the primary stage. We did not have space to park ambulances inside BMTC bus stations as they are already congested. We will soon have full-fledged PHCs and we will put up direction boards on all platforms, said a senior officer.

He was my inspiration. After my stint at Taj, I have worked for cruise lines for 10 years. I came back to Bengaluru and joined The Pride Hotel as a Kitchen Executive, where I got the opportunity to work with Chef Jason, my mentor. Chef Jason later moved to Clarks Exotica and recommended me to join the newly launched resort  Clarks Exotica Convention Resort and Spa back in 2011. I thus began my journey here as a Sous Chef.Being a chef is not as glamourous as it seems on television. We work under constant pressure to deliver the food fast without sacrificing on the quality, standing on our feet for long hours and suffering cuts and burns, noise, heat, smokes and fumes. We work in the evenings and on weekends and holidays.On the other hand, being a chef has many advantages. You will never be bored, as there is always something going on in the kitchen. You will always be trying to outdo yourself and cook the most memorable meal possible for each of your patrons. The good comments from your customers, job satisfaction, companionship, teamwork, applying creativity to what you do and a mind open to lifelong learning and prospects of advancement are the right ingredients to become a chef.I specialise in Continental and Fusion cuisines. I like to experiment with various global cuisines and try to serve something new to the guests. While experimenting, I came across many unique ingredients, one that fascinated me a lot is water chestnut. Water Chestnut commonly known as Paniphal or Singhara in Hindi is a vegetable that is native to China.I have experimented and created different dishes with water chestnut such as salads, stir fry recipes and even dessert. Personally, my favorite dessert is Red Ruby. Red Ruby is a dessert served with coconut milk. It is made with wasabi, a Japanese sauce made out of cabbage and mustard that makes food more flavourful and spicy and water chestnuts which is white in colour and gives a fresh mild and crunchy texture.Immerse the water chestnuts in freshly made beetroot juice for a few minutes so that it is bright red in colour and then coat it with the wasabi paste. Soak it in sugar syrup so that it gives a flavour of both spice and sweet. Freeze it after adding coconut milk for 30 minutes and serve it cold.

A week after the transfer, on Tuesday the officer submitted a detailed report to the CS detailing the irregularities taking place at the department. Express had published a report Shunted out for highlighting wrongs, IAS officer writes to Chief Secretary about Nagabushans letter on Thursday. Following the report, several people came out in support of Nagabushan and demanded the Chief Secretary and the CM to take up the issue and order a probe into all the issues raised by the officer.Speaking to Express, Justice N Santosh Hegde said, Transferring such an eminent officer is nothing but a conspiracy. The officer was handling important files and had also ordered inquiry into some of the scams. Meanwhile, there were hands which tried to put pressure on him to stop the probe, and when he refused to yield to their pressure, he was shunted out. Hegde added that the CS should give reasons for any officers premature transfer.It is the responsibility of the CS to give reasons for the transfer of an officer when it is premature. Being a public official, I can say that transfer of officers is being misused in the state. The CS has all the right to oppose such transfer recommendations, provided there are valid reasons, he said. M Madan Gopal, retired IAS officer, demanded the Chief Minister to take a call. Such incidents in the state will demoralise officers. Ajay Nagabushan is one of the finest officers we have in the state and the CM should order an inquiry into the allegations raised by him. When there is no immunity for a government officer, who will provide good governance? It has become a trend in the state to transfer honest officers. Honest officers should be protected.BJP MLC Arun Shapur said they will raise this issue in the next Assembly session. The government has rights to transfer him. But our concern is over the issues raised by that particular officer. The CM must take note of it and order a judicial probe into this, Shapur said.Need for constitution of Civil Services BoardThe state government has put on hold an executive order by the Supreme Court on constituting the Civil Services Board (CSB). The apex court while hearing a PIL against political interference in functioning of the bureaucracy had issued orders to the Centre and state governments to constitute CSB to oversee the issues related to transfer of IAS, IPS and IFS officers. The order had also advocated the need for fixing a minimum tenure for officers in any post and that no officer shall act on oral directions. The Chief Secretary is to be the head of the CSB with senior IAS officers as members.FALL FROM GRACESenior IAS officer Ajay Nagabushan transferred on October 17Few weeks before the transfer, higher education minister had warned the officer during a press conference, asking him not to get involved in some mattersRecently, some MLCs too held a press conference where they verbally abused the officer and called him mad and sadistAfter taking charge as the commissioner of Collegiate Education, Nagabushan decided to probe the fakeM.

There was pressure on me to take a package and give piece-meal tenders instead of the global tender I pushed for.The officer highlighted about the financial loss which the government will suffer if the global tender is cancelled. He even mentioned the alleged irregularities in release of funds to Ambedkar School of Economics. Though there is no administrative approval for the construction of Ambedkar School of Economics, the state higher education council has recommended release the funds.

5a151ea39855b76bf13eb464,"For Yogi, the Modi model",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-yogi-adityanath-uttar-pradesh-bjp-for-yogi-the-modi-model-4885810/,2017-10-12,"Yogi Adityanath with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yogi Adityanath with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In my book, The Monk Who Became Chief Minister: The definitive biography of Yogi Adityanath, I argued that the state of Uttar Pradesh, with 22 crore people and 80 Lok Sabha seats, is a crucial political piece in Indias electoral puzzle. With a history of producing many prime ministers for the country, UP may have given yet another prospect for the prime ministers office in the post-Modi era.Narendra Modi and Yogi have some similarities, which force political pundits to make the Modi-Yogi comparison. The media has created a Hindu hardliner image around both. Both are extremely popular among their supporters. Modi and Yogi are both bachelors and have minimal involvement with their families, which make them free from any obligations or nepotism. Both are extremely hard working, disciplined human beings in their food habits, yoga routine and work ethic.Yogi Adityanath completed six months as Chief Minister at the pancham tal on September 19. Modi inherited a decent Gujarat to be turned into a good, even best Gujarat, which he did meticulously and there emerged a Gujarat Model of development. Yogi got a miserable Uttar Pradesh, where showing instant results will be very tough. Yogi needs to focus tactically on the low hanging fruit, along with long-term strategic initiatives. Its too early to pronounce a verdict on his performance but the initial days look promising. In a state marred with corruption, mis-governance, nepotism coupled with a Bimaru and dysfunctional machinery, the initial months, maybe years in office, will be spent in basic housekeeping. Even Yogis detractors have commended his work in the power sector, his transparent procurement policy, streamlining the transport department, cracking down on bogus ration cards, making long-pending payments to sugarcane farmers and initiating the process of recruitment of 1.5 lakh police personnel.Yogis main difference from Modi, and a challenge for him, is that in a very disciplined cadre-based party like the BJP, Yogi has never held a party position. This makes him a bit distant from the party. Modi, an RSS pracharak, had held various important positions in the party throughout the country before taking over as the chief minister of Gujarat. Chief ministers of the BJP manage their state through a combination of factors  their political acumen, administrative ability, effective use of the bureaucracy, a set of confidantes among ministers and most importantly, their connect with the party cadre, who act as their eyes and ears on the ground. While Yogi seems to score well on all counts his connect with the party cadre is not the best.In UP today, the organisational secretary and Amit Shahs strongman, Sunil Bansal, is filling this gap for Yogi and providing the much needed connect with the party cadre. The new state party president, Mahendra Nath Pandey, will also get into action soon.In the BJP, most sustained political journeys have been undertaken by a pair. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had L.K. Advani as his close confidant and PM Modi has Amit Shah as his alter ego. But Yogi still seems to lack a close aide in the party. He should soon identify someone from his set of ministers to be his partner in this long political race.Even Modis critics commend him for the effort he has put in over the years to groom himself for office. Be it his effort to constantly hone his oratory, the use of technology to connect with his followers, his command over the English language or his ability to attract the best teams to work with him, Modi has stood ahead of the pack. Journalists covering the 2014 elections were amazed to see the multiple teams that Modi was operating in parallel for his campaign  first, the party and RSS cadres, then came the BJPs IT backbone lead by Arvind Gupta, there was data crunching by Rajesh Jains team and on top of all this, Modi utilised the services of the likes of Prashant Kishor for communicating his aspirational message far and wide. Yogi has the image of a champion of the Hindu cause. Going forward, he needs to access the best new-age support teams, technology interventions and communication channels to race through the governance track, along with his hardliner image.Despite these challenges, Yogi has his own set of achievements. At 44, he is one of the youngest chief ministers, that too of a humongous state like UP. When the age of 75 is an internal ceiling in the BJP for active politics, Yogi has age on his side. At a young age, he already has two decades of gruelling experience as a parliamentarian. His performance in terms of questions, debates and private members bills is among the best in Parliament. His natural ability to connect with the people, through his janta darbars at the mutt, is paralleled only by a long-time RSS pracharak.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a151ee09855b76bf13eb490,Walk your way to good health,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/oct/26/walk-your-way-to-good-health-1683161.html,2017-10-26,"BENGALURU: Recent research suggest that 10,000 steps a day is the key to good health. According to American Heart Association adults should get at least 150 minutes or more of moderate-intense physical activity every week. This can be best achieved by walking 2 miles briskly for about 4 miles/hr.Physical activity is a must to maintain good health. For people who have sedentary work life, walking is the simplest way to keep active. Moderate intensity exercises have enormous health benefits and can halve the risk of major diseases in people of all age groups.Walking is a good aerobic exercise that improves blood circulation and allows body to use oxygen better.If you feel 10,000 steps at one go is too much of exercise to begin with, adapt small changes, practice mini exercises throughout the day.Give up the elevator for stairs; park your car half a kilometre far from your destination, and while at work take short breaks and go out for 10 to 15 minutes of walk.Warm up your body before a brisk walk and remember these benefits to keep yourself motivated:Burns extra calories and blood sugarKeeps joints and muscles agileImproves good cholesterol or HDL levelsLowers blood pressureImproves insulin sensitivityHere are better walking techniques that can be followed to reap maximum benefits and avoid injury:Walk on flat surface: Make sure that you walk on a flat surface as brisk walking on an uneven terrain can be quite difficult and can cause injuries to spine and knee joints.Use comfortable clothes and footwear: Keep in mind to wear comfortable and supportive footwear. Walking elevates bodys temperature, so ensure to wear loose clothes. It is best to wear shoes designed for walking or jogging to avoid formation of blisters.Begin with small steps: Start with small steps in terms of both frequency and distance. For initial few days stick to a stroll of 5-10 minutes and then increase the time along with intensity of walking.Maintain right posture: It is important to select a comfortable natural length step along with right body posture. One should remember to keep the head straight, tummy pulled in and relaxed shoulders.Focus on breathing: While walking avoid talking to people or indulging in other distractions like using mobile phones. Keep your mind clear and focus on breathing. If you start gasping stop or slow down the speed and rest a while.Note: People with osteoarthritis of knees should opt for exercises other than walking in order to prevent further wear and tear.The author is a General Physician at Columbia Asia Hospital"

Thats why Sugarmyylove, a company that makes handcrafted soaps, body scrubs, lip scrubs made of natural and organic ingredients has been welcomed by 10,000 customers till now.It was founded in 2014 by Himra Minhaj when she was a 17-year-old BBA student preparing for Entrepreneur Development bazaar conducted by Ethiraj College for women. I reluctantly enrolled myself because my teacher compelled me. Afterwards, I figured out that my stall has to be unique to fetch me the first prize and thats when my aunt in US told me about homemade body scrubs. That small step ensured that I won the first prize in the bazaar for three consecutive years...and now I make `70,000-`80,000 per month, she says.Photos: D SampathkumarWith a team of four part-timers including marketing executives Akshita and pooja, marketing head Hisham Rahil and a packer, the company runs active Instagram and Facebook pages posted with product list and reviews for the same along with the contact number. Thereafter, customer contacts are handled personally through the Whatsapp group where the team explains about the skin types and suitable products for the demands of the customer. The company caters throughout India but the response from Kerala and Chennai is better than other places. I dont have a website because customers may not understand what their skin needs and may conclude in a product that wont work for them. I always want to guide them personally, she shares.College library laid the foundation for the company. Ayurveda books from Ethiraj Library, professors from Government Siddha University and my diploma in Acupuncture contributed much to my research. I experimented with the ratios and gave away samples to my family members in the beginning, she says.When asked about investment, she says, I started Sugarmyylove with `1,000 and now I spend `50,000 to make a turnover of `2 lakh. Fortunately both were from my pocket that grew gradually. The independent and young woman who developed her production size from 100 gm to 10 kg has a different perspective on approaching for sponsorship. I dont want to be liable to anyone. When I can bring it till here, I can take mine far by small steps, she says.And the secret of her success is? With the help of reviews on social media and word of mouth references, I took small steps to reach here. I started off with sugar scrubs for the first years bazaar, soaps for the second year and face packs for the third year. Patience and perseverance crafted my success, she beams.According to her, the company was started to prove to her parents that she was capable to doing better things in life. I didnt realise what I do has reached far until my cousin Aleenas college mate walked up and asked her surprisingly if her sister owns Sugarmyylove. When she told me about it, I had tears, she adds.One another future plan is to bring Sugarmyyloves helpline number in place and to create a blog for the expansion of customer base.The plus & minusCopy right issues: People follow my recipes, label them the same and price them `20 less and the packaging jars are broken as couriers mishandle them.Products in demand: Lip scrub, toxic pack, skin lightening face pack, under eye cream, tan removal and face clay & skin brightening.Unique products: Whipped soap butter (creamy texture soap) and cupcake soaps."

While it is a common problem in the developed nations, it is a rising concern in India and is majorly due to unhealthy lifestyle and westernization; obesity affects more than 5 per cent of the countrys population.With easy access to processed food in the country due to global integration of food market, there is an increase in consumption of high sugar and low nutrition diets. With changing lifestyle, people are more stressed than before. Irregular sleep cycles and anxiety disorders is one of the main reasons of being obese.Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little. Obesity doesnt happen overnight. Unhealthy eating habits tend to run in families. It develops gradually over time, as a result of poor diet and lifestyle choices, such as:Eating large amounts of processed or fast food and  that is high in fat and sugarDrinking too much alcohol  alcohol contains a lot of calories, and people who drink heavily are often overweightEating junk food and eating larger portions than actually needed The amount of food that we take in a restaurant as a starter or dessert is high in fat and sugar. Drinking too many sugary drinks such as soft drinks and fresh juices also adds to obesityComfort eating People suffering from low self-esteem or depressed eat a lot to feel better Sedentary lifestyle of people is yet another factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk for most of the day. If you are not active enough, does not use the energy provided by the food we eat, the extra energy we consume is stored by the body as fat and this leads to obesity.Symptoms of ObesityObesity can cause a number of problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions. Day-to- day problems related to obesity includeBreathlessness, increased sweating, snoring, difficulty in doing physical activity, feeling very tired, joint and back pain and feeling isolated, low esteem and depression.Being obese can also increase the risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, likeHigh cholesterol, asthma and atherosclerosis (where fat deposits narrow the arteries), which can lead to coronary heart disease and strokeMetabolic Syndrome and several types of cancer  a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesityGastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD)  where stomach acid leaks out of the stomach and into the oesophagus (gullet)Gallstones  small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladderSleep Apnoea  a condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep, which can lead to daytime sleepiness with an increased risk of road traffic accidents, as well as a greater risk of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease and osteoarthritis a condition involving pain and stiffness in jointsPregnancy complications, such as Gestational Diabetes or Pre-Eclampsia (when a woman experiences a potentially dangerous rise in blood pressure during pregnancy).(Dr Satish N is Senior Consultant (General & Bariatric Surgery) and Pavithra N Raj is Executive (Diet & Nutrition) at Columbia Asia Referral Hospital in Yeshwanthpur)Know your weightIt is significant to know your weight and one of the most widely used method is body mass index(BMI). BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. Here is an indication of what your BMI meansFor most adults, a BMI of:18.5 to 22.9 = healthy weight23 to 27.5 = overweight27.5 to 32.5 = Class I obesity32.6 to 37.5 = Class II Obesity37.6 or above = Morbid or Class III obesityMore than 50 = Super obeseIndias Fat CountStudies show that in India, nearly 15% to 20% of children are overweight and 30% are in the risk of falling in this category. It is these statistics that ring major alarm bells; and as per recent reports as high as 60% to 70% may continue to be overweight or obese in adulthAlert  Avoid Quick Fix Diets to Reduce WeightMaintaining a healthy weight is important for preventing cardio vascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and other chronic conditions. There are quite a few short term diets that are doing the rounds and people should be aware that sustaining these diets can have long term implications on their health. For example, being on a ketogenic diet for long may have some nutrition deficiency and other effects on health including heart palpitations, constipation, muscle cramps and sleep issues.Management of ObesityManagement of obesity is a multi disciplinary approach. It includes dietician, physiotherapist, physician, endocrinologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist and psychiatrist. Weight loss surgery, also called bariatric or metabolic surgery, is sometimes used as a treatment for people who are excessively obese. It can lead to significant weight loss and help improve many obesity-related conditions, such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure."

Flax seeds has been consumed as food for around 6,000 years. It could very well be the worlds first cultivated super food. Their benefits help you improve digestion, rejuvenate the skin, lower cholesterol, reduce sugar cravings, balance hormones, fight cancer and most definitely promote weight loss. Often called linseeds, they are the richest source of plant based omega-3 fatty acids, called alpha linolenic acid.There are many ways to add this super seed into ones diet. I prefer to add them into muffins, flat breads, breads and cookies. However, the best way to consume them is in its sprouted form. Soaking flax seeds and then sprouting them eliminates phytic acid and may greatly increase mineral absorption. My favourite incorporation of flax seeds would be Roasted Peppers & Lemon Rind Scented GreekChicken SaladIngredients:Chicken breast - 200gLemon Rind - 5gWorchestershire Sauce - 5mlGarlic - 5gOlive Oil - 5mlIce Berg lettuce - 30gLollorosso Lettuce - 30gGreen Lettuce - 30gRocket Lettuce - 20gRoasted Bell Peppers - 100gEnglish Cucumber - 60gCrumbled Feta - 20gCherry Tomatoes - 30gToasted Flax Seeds - 5gOlives - 10gThyme - 5gLemon Vinaigrette - 20mlSalt to tasteMethod:Marinate the chicken breast with a marinade of olive oil, salt, thyme, lemon rind, Worcestershire sauce and garlic for an hour.In a grill pan, add a few drops of olive oil and grilled the chicken breast on both sides until done. Shred or slice and set aside in the pan juices.Wash and clean the lettuce with ice cold water.Slice the cucumber into triangles. Roast the bell peppers in an oven until done or over a naked flame, peel the skin and cut into rough wedges. Cut the cherry tomatoes into half.Toast the flax seed in a pan until it begins to crisp up. Prepare the lemon vinaigrette with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and a dash of honey. In a mixing bowl, lightly mix the lettuce with the chicken, cucumber, roasted bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, olives, thyme and lightly toss in the lemon vinaigrette.Serve in a salad bowl with a generous topping of toasted Flax seed.

Her young mother sobbed nearby.Her skeletal thighs poked out of a nappy way over her size. Placed on the scales, she weighed less than two kilogrammes (just over 4 pounds).Like hundreds of children in Ghouta, Sahar was suffering from acute malnutrition.Her mother was too undernourished to breastfeed her and her father, earning a pittance at a butcher's shop, was unable to afford milk and supplements.Sahar died at the hospital on Sunday morning and her parents took her -- their only child -- to their nearby town of Kafr Batna to bury her.Her death came after another child in Ghouta also died of malnutrition on Saturday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.""Residents suffer from severe food shortages, and when goods are available in the markets, it's at a crazy price,"" the Observatory said.- Ghostly faces -Medics at hospitals and health clinics in Eastern Ghouta say they examine dozens of malnourished children a day -- and that the number is on the rise.Images taken by an AFP correspondent show skeletal infants with ghostly faces.One has breathing difficulties, another has a feeding tube in its mouth and a third has a bandage wrapped around his tiny arm.Yahya Abu Yahya, doctor and regional head of medical services for Turkish NGO Social Development International, which has several medical centres in Ghouta, said the group's centres had examined 9,700 children in recent months.""Of these, 80 were suffering severe acute malnutrition, 200 had moderate acute malnutrition, and about 4000 were suffering from nutritional deficiencies,"" he said.The UN children's fund UNICEF defines ""severe acute malnutrition"" as the most extreme and visible form of undernutrition.""Its face is a child -- frail and skeletal -- who requires urgent treatment to survive,"" it says.Abu Yahya said that many children in Eastern Ghouta are suffering from ""deficiencies, migraines, vision problems, depression, psychological problems"".According to UN figures, some 400,000 people live in besieged parts of Syria, the majority in Eastern Ghouta.Despite agreement on de-escalation zones backed by regime supporters Russia and Iran and rebel sponsor Turkey, the region still has very limited access to aid.Abu Yahya said the region was not receiving basic foods children need, such as sugar, sources of protein and vitamins.On September 23, a convoy carrying food and medical aid for some 25,000 people entered three besieged areas of Eastern Ghouta, according to the UN.But Abu Yahya said what aid does reach the region covers just five to 10 percent of the needs of malnourished children.Sahar was the latest victim of Eastern Ghouta's food crisis.On Sunday, her father carried the tiny child to her grave. Behind him, relatives walked with Sahar's mother, nearly collapsing with grief."

(BCCI Photo) Kane Williamson (L) admitted that New Zealand were bad in fielding. (BCCI Photo)Kane Williamson was quick to admitted that New Zealand were outplayed in all three departments of the game. Fielding, which is one of the strong points of the former world number one team in T20 format, let them down on Wednesday in the first T20I against India in New Delhi.Three catches dropped and other fielding let offs gave India the much needed lukc. Opener Shikhar Dhawan was dropped in the second over by Mitchell Santner and he went on to score 80 runs. Rohit Sharma also scored the same number of runs and got a life as Tim Southee dropped him.The conditions are tough to prepare for exactly but given the experience within our side, were certainly not using that as an excuse, Williamson said. Most of the time when you come here and play in the evening, theres dew as there is on a number of other grounds that guys have played at. Not going to sugarcoat it but we were below par and came up against what is a very good Indian side that played very well in all the areas.Like I mentioned, we were outplayed in all the areas, fielding included, which is something we pride ourselves on and something we need to be much better at in Twenty20 cricket. That made the difference as we saw today that proved to be vital in a lot of ways. Guys went on to score big scores for their side in the Indian team and 200 on that surface was a very big total, he added.New Zealand were put under pressure from the start of their chase. Ashish Nehra bowled a decent first over before Yuzvendra Chahal came up and replicated. Two early wickets and New Zealand were pushed on the back-foot and India team gained the upper handWe were under pressure pretty much from the word go. Losing early wickets puts you on the backfoot and on the surface, there it was stopping and turning. Trying to accelerate the run rate when you are under pressure is not an easy task. That was the nature of the batting innings. We were never able to get momentum in our batting against them to try and get close to the total. Every time we attempted to increase the run rate, we lost wickets. A lot of it is our fault and then India bowled very well as well so the combination of that certainly didnt allow us to get close to the total.New Zealand were, as Williamson said, outplayed by India. They were chasing a target of 203 runs but Indian spinners contained the runs. Even the pacers were not as expensive as the New Zealand ones who went for over 11 runs per over.Theyre both very good bowlers (Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar). Because they got off to a good start, we were on the backfoot. The surface was seaming around, offering a bit to the seamers, but we had to have a defensive approach to try and combat their aggression because they were putting us under pressure. I guess the other side of that coin is when the bowling side is on top and theyre able to hit the wicket and use the surface like we saw Bumrah and the others in their bowling attack, which was very difficult. Thats Twenty20 cricket. You do need to be aggressive to try and take on bowlers and weve seen Bhuvi and Bumrah throughout not just the one-dayers, but for a long time in the IPL. Ive been fortunate to play with Bhuvi and against Bumrah and theyre the most consistent bowlers in world cricket.Its also sort of the nature of T20 cricket. Its such an aggressive format that no matter who you are, you can go for a few runs. It is fickle in terms of the results and how guys approach it. Batters need to be aggressive. If they come off, then the bowler sort of loses it like we saw tonight. India batted very, very well and put our bowlers under pressure. But both of those bowlers (Boult and Southee), as we know, are very good operators and will look to make amends going into the next game. Not just them, all of us want to be better in all three areas of the game, Williamson concluded.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Source: AP) Chile looked clueless and failed to counter the wave of English attacks. (Source: AP)Salon frequenters: The team hotel has a sassy salon. The crew-cut Nigeriens just loitered around the salon. The North Koreans are strictly proscribed to enter salons or even move out of their rooms. They were mostly in the swimming pool. Brazilians and Spaniards though frequent often. The day before the opening match against Brazil, most of Spains players visited the salon. Language, of course, was a barrier, but the players googled images of the hairdos they wanted. The finickiest of them, apparently, was Spains goalkeeper Alvaro Fernandez, who wouldnt sit still for a second!. A couple of Brazilians had to be told to remove their headphones.Kahn didnt: The approach to the DY Patil Stadium has a new banner that covers a foot-over bridge. The giant poster that runs the width of the highway has the image of a diving Oliver Kahn  the same the Germans had set up on their roads when they hosted the 2006 World Cup. FYI: Kahn never played the Under-17 World Cup.Shock therapy: The Paraguayans had devised a plan to allow players a chance to adjust to the eight-and-a-half hour time difference between India and home, before travelling for the World Cup. Reporting on the training pitches at 2:00 a.m. was one thing, but it was crucial for the acclimatization strategy to have the Paraguayan players remain awake till 4:00 p.m. But the support staff had a unique plan to ensure that the players didnt doze off  screening movies. So the team would sit together in a hall, after their 4:00 am lunch, and watch horror movies. They wanted us to get scared by watching the movies. If we were scared, we could not sleep, says Antonio Galeano. Once in a while the team would also use the time to take lessons in Hindi  covering the namastes to the dhanyavaads. After the nights horror flick they would ask each other: tum theek ho?Compressed anthems: The FIFAs 90-second National Anthem rule created an emotional moment before the start of the Chile versus England match at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. The FIFA limits National Anthems to 90 seconds to get the matches rolling quickly. But Chiles anthem, Himno Nacional de Chile, is about 120 seconds longs. So even after the FIFA cut off the music after 90 seconds, the Chile colts sang along in chorus.

Chile did it at Confederations Cup also this year.Fan takes a dig on FB: The Local Organizing Committee has come under a lot of flak for its mismanagement on the opening day. The security has been so tight that fans have not been allowed to carry anything except their mobile phones inside the stadium. Even coins have been confiscated. But there always some scope for humour. Ahead of Kolkatas opening night, a spectator  Prasenjit Chakraborty  sarcastically asked them on their official Facebook page if he will be allowed to carry his heart and kidney inside the stadium along with an umbrella and water mixed with salt and sugar. The organizers replied: Heart and Kidney allowed. No umbrellas unfortunately. We would recommend just taking your salt/sugar water before entering the stadium perimeter Prasenjit. Enjoy the game.were hoping weather clears. Whats football without some banter!Mystery of moving tent: From the aisles littered with garbage, lack of drinking water to non-functional baggage scanners, plenty of issues had piled up for the organizers after the first match day at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. However, one issue stood out in particular. For the convenience of the teams, a tent was pitched at one of the training grounds. It was there till Friday but the following day, it was placed under a giant tree near one of the entry gates. How the giant tent moved from one place to another overnight remained a mystery to many, especially the US team, for whom the volunteers arranged another makeshift one. It later emerged that the security personnel had done that to protect themselves from the harsh sun on Friday, when they were deployed as a part of the elaborate security for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

5a1549869855b76bf13ecf0a,Network issues scuttle cashless drive in this Maharashtra village,http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Q5mhB4pa4UP2O9aQ1aA2mJ/Demonetisation-anniversary-Network-issues-scuttle-cashless.html,2017-11-06,"A resident of Maharashtras Dhasai village counts the cash he withdrew from a an e-kiosk. Photos: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintDhasai (Maharashtra): Anant Bhoir, a 46-year-old farmer from Dhasai village in Maharashtras Thane district, opened an account with Bank of Baroda four months ago just so he has a backup option to his Vijaya Bank account. Plus, he was super excited at the prospect of using his ATM card at the smart-looking Bank of Baroda Express kiosk inaugurated in June by veteran anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare.On 2 November, when Bhoir went to the kiosk to check his savings account balance, it said: Transaction not allowed. This has been the refrain these past four months. He has learnt from experience that the same internet service provider serves both the Vijaya Bank branch and Bank of Baroda kioskstate-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd or BSNL.So what does he do? He goes back to Vijaya Bank, fills up a withdrawal slip, takes a token, and awaits his turn in the queue.At the banks Dhasai branch, officer Ravi Gaikwad is used to negotiating long queues of account holders like Bhoir. BSNL internet is down as usual. If you go to the BSNL office, you wont find a soul there who can attend to these daily complaints. The story about cashless Dhasai is for all to see here, Gaikwad says.Dhasai went cashless on 1 December last year amid much fanfare in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modis 8 November demonetisation announcement. Today it is back to its old ways of dealing in cash.Back in December 2016, even a roadside shack selling snacks boasted of an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) machine that Bank of Baroda distributed free of charge then. In fact, the bank gave away 50 such EDC machines in the village.The machine has not been used for more than two months now. People give cash because they have cash now. Why would people want to swipe a card when they have cash and when they know that the machine wont work because network is down, asks shack owner Vijay Sukose, who got an EDC.Salman Sayyad, who runs a meat shop, says his machine has gone for repairs. Soon after notebandi (withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1000 currency notes), 70% of my sales were executed on the machine. But its usage dropped to 15% by August when it developed snag, he says.A resident of Dhasai pays his electricity bill in cash at Maharashtra State Electricity Board counter.Sayyad adds that the idea of going cashless will work only if all agenciesBSNL most prominent among themwork towards it.Dhasai sums up the quintessential Indian way of doing things with great fanfare only to undo them later. If in December 2016 it enthusiastically joined Modis cashless and digital drive and attracted nationwide attention, a year later the exercise hardly merits mention.According to Ranjit Savarkar, chairman of the Maharashtra Military School near Dhasai and the main agent of change last year, It is like keeping the milk container on the stove and then stepping out to buy tea and sugar. Things have fallen apart because the right sequence has not been followed. Last year when the government was keen to showcase Dhasai as a cashless village, I told them to put in place a system first so that other things follow as a logical corollary. But that has not been done for a variety of reasons.Savarkar believes the Dhasai story has not turned out the way it should have because of the dearth of imagination on the part of banks and government agencies like BSNL as well as the absence of follow-up action.They can still redeem the situation by issuing as many debit cards as the number of applicants. Debit cards will enable not only Dhasai residents but tribals who live in 60 hamlets around Dhasai to access the Bhim app. And for Bhim to run efficiently, they must provide wi-fi at least in select locations, Savarkar says.Bhim or Bharat Interface for Money app, launched on 30 December last year, enables users to send and receive money over the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platform.He proceeds to transfer a small amount to grocery shop owner Swapnil Patkars account using the Bhim app. Both Savarkar and Patkar run the app using their mobile data network.Mobile data does not work in interior parts and that is why wi-fi should be provided. Imagine a tribal woman getting the remuneration for the forest produce she sells directly deposited into her account. That will give her access to her money which, if given in cash to her husband, mostly gets wasted in drinks. Give her a debit card and access to Bhim app and she would be on her own, says Savarkar, who thinks some smaller policy interventions like these and a concerted technological push could permanently make Dhasai a cashless but also help nearby hamlets use digital transaction.Patkar, president of Dhasais retail merchants association, says 60 of the retail establishments had been issued EDC machines. But very few are using them now. The real culprit is the network problem. BSNL only has to only extend the broadband cable 3km from nearby Umroli village but that has not been done for two years now, he says.It is like keeping the milk container on the stove and then stepping out to buy tea and sugar. Things have fallen apart because the right sequence has not been followed. - Ranjit Savarkar, chairman of the Maharashtra Military School near Dhasai.Ashok Warghade, branch manager of Thane District Central Cooperative Bank, says the network issue should have been sorted out to ensure Dhasai consolidated the gains it made during the initial months of demonetisation. Of our 27,000 account holders who are from nearby villages, 2,500 have ATM cards. We have also issued 3,000 RuPay cards. But due to network problems and availability of cash, people dont tend to use ATM cards. Also, there has there been no rise in the number of applications for debit cards, he says.Dhasai resident Rajendra Joshi mocks the villages cashless tag, saying it was true just for the month of December. Government agencies and people who are at the forefront of this initiative are well aware of all the problems.Network problem also predates demonetisation. But at least after the village was declared cashless, all agencies and elected representatives should have worked together to address the problems and ready Dhasai for digital transactions. But nothing has been done by way of follow-up and things have gone back to their default setting, he says.Savarkar, who remains hopeful that the cashless dream can be realized, says all the training and awareness that locals carried out in schools on cashless transactions will go to waste if students are not kept invested in the project. Now, banks come up with all sorts of rules... That students cannot be given debit cards and so on. What use is mere theory if students are not allowed the practicals, he asks, standing in front of a poster from 2016 which hails Dhasai as Rokhmukt gaav (cash-free village)."

About 200 people turned out in al-Qaryatayn on Sunday to welcome home the returning hostages, according to Reuters reporters who visited the war-scarred town during a trip organised by the Syrian authorities.Twenty six Syrian hostages who escaped from their Islamic State captors received an emotional homecoming on Sunday in the central province of Homs, witnesses and officials said. They were among at least 70 people abducted and taken by fleeing Islamic State militants to a secret location in the desert east of the town of al-Qaryatayn on Oct. 21 when the Syrian army and pro-government militias regained control of the town.The others are still missing, according to local officials, who have not disclosed the identities of any of the hostages. Al-Qaryatayn lies nearly 300 kilometres (190 miles) west of Deir al-Zor city, the current focus of the Syrian governments offensive, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, against Islamic State.About 200 people turned out in al-Qaryatayn on Sunday to welcome home the returning hostages, according to Reuters reporters who visited the war-scarred town during a trip organised by the Syrian authorities. Parents wept as they embraced returning sons while other relatives and local residents threw sweets and sugar in the air in celebration. Thank God for your return, said an elderly man as he embraced a young man.Most in the crowd declined to be interviewed. Syrian authorities said jihadists had taken revenge after being forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al-Qaryatayn, by slaughtering scores of the citys inhabitants.A senior local official said the hostages escaped after they got past an Iraqi jihadist militant while he took a nap and seized his gun and shot him dead. But the joy surrounding the hostages return was still overshadowed by executions witnessed in the town in the past few weeks when militants rounded up local officials and members of the security forces, police and members of their families and executed them in broad daylight, according to officials.We forgot our joy when thinking of the nightmare that we went through, Found Ghosn, a local government official told Reuters TV, saying city officials had identified at least 70 out of 130 people slain during the revenge killings.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Twitter/ @Mark4WyreForest) Mark Garnier is a junior international trade minister. (Source: Twitter/ @Mark4WyreForest)British Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered an investigation into a report that one of her ministers asked a female secretary to buy sex toys for him, as she tries to tackle a culture of sexual harassment in politics. Mark Garnier, a junior international trade minister, asked secretary Caroline Edmondson to buy two sex toys and he also called her sugar tits, the Mail on Sunday reported. Garnier told the newspaper that the comment was part of an amusing conversation about a television show, and that asking her to buy the toys was good humoured high jinks.Edmondson, in comments to the paper, disputed Garniers recollection of the incidents, including his assertion that they were high jinks. Garnier was not immediately available for comment to Reuters through his constituency or parliamentary offices. The report comes after Mays spokeswoman said on Friday any unwanted sexual behaviour was completely unacceptable and any minister who acted inappropriately would face serious action. She was reacting to a report in another British newspaper that described a culture of sexual harassment among lawmakers and their staff working in parliament.Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday May had asked officials to investigate if Garnier, whose role is outside the cabinet immediately surrounding the May, had broken the government ministers code of behaviour. These stories, if they are true, are obviously totally unacceptable, Hunt told BBC television. The Cabinet Office will be conducting an investigation as to whether there has been a breach of the ministerial code in this particular case, but as you know the facts are disputed.May will also write to John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house of parliament, the House of Commons, to ask for his advice about changing the culture there, Hunt said. Reports of inappropriate behaviour in British politics, and in other industries, have followed dozens of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Cabinet minister Michael Gove apologised on Saturday after he likened being interviewed by a BBC radio presenter to entering Weinsteins bedroom. After the analogy was widely criticised, Gove apologised for what he said was a clumsy attempt at humour. The Sun newspaper said on Friday that women working in politics in Westminster had created a WhatsApp instant messaging group to discuss their experiences of harassment and warn others about potential perpetrators.The prime minister was very clear when we responded to the reports about Harvey Weinstein in the last few weeks that any unwanted sexual behaviour is completely unacceptable, and that is true in any walk of life including politics, Mays spokeswoman said on Friday.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

5a1556379855b76bf13ed5f5,Run or wait? Tokyo’s Koike faces dilemma ahead of October 22 poll,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/run-or-wait-tokyos-koike-faces-dilemma-ahead-of-oct-22-poll-4871066/,2017-10-02,"Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike (AP/File) Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike (AP/File)Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has made no secret of her desire to be Japans first female prime minister  she even named her pet terrier Sori, Japanese for premier. But Koike, 65, whose fledgling Party of Hope poses a growing threat to Prime Minister Shinzo Abes ruling bloc in an election this month, faces a tough choice: run now for a seat in parliament so she becomes eligible for the nations top job, or wait and bet her party positions itself to win the next national poll. Abe called the Oct. 22 poll in hopes his Liberal Democratic Party-led bloc could keep its majority in the lower house, where it now holds a two-thirds super majority, but Koikes party has upended forecasts.If Koike resigns as governor little more than a year after defying Abes LDP to run successfully for that post, she would risk a backlash from voters. Waiting might let her best shot at the premiership slip through her fingers. If she thinks of the nation, it is important that she boldly announce her candidacy, present her ideas about important matters  and debate policies head on, Abes ally, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Sugar, told reporters on Monday. Koike, a media-savvy former LDP member and defence minister, has said she would not resign as governor to run now, especially ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games, which Tokyo will host.But her carefully phrased remarks have failed to kill speculation that she will run, perhaps announcing on Thursday, when the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly ends its session. Candidates must register on Oct. 10, when the campaign officially starts. Only she can decide, said one Koike adviser, who declined to be identified because he is not allowed to speak for her. Koike is certain to be watching opinion polls as she weighs her decision. A TV Asahi survey published on Monday showed 72 percent were negative about her potential candidacy.Her close ally, Masaru Wakasa, on Sunday said it was not essential that Koike run this time around.NEXT, NEXT ELECTION?If there is a firm prospect of a change in government, party chief Koike might run for parliament, but if we can achieve a change in the next, next election, she doesnt have to run now, Wakasa said during a debate on public broadcaster NHK. Koike, however, has already once blindsided Wakasa, who led efforts to form the new party, by announcing  on the day Abe announced the snap poll, that she would lead the Party of Hope herself, not entrust it to allies.On Monday, she told Jiji news agency her party aimed to run more than the 233 candidates needed to take a majority in the 465-seat lower house. If you dont buy a lottery ticket, you cant win, she said. But she again denied she would seek a seat in parliament now. I was in national politics for 24 years and I have no intention to go back to a place where you can achieve nothing despite spending so much time, she said. A former TV announcer who speaks Arabic and English and peppers her speeches with foreign words, Koike wants to build a pro-reform, conservative party to compete with the LDP, in part by cannibalising the failed main opposition Democratic Party and luring smaller parties to her side.Her cool, polished demeanour belies a steeliness beneath. She can take a punch with a smile and sharpen her knives at the same time, said Jesper Koll, head of equity fund Wisdom Tree, who has followed Japanese politics for years. Like former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, one of her past mentors, Koike promises to break free of vested interests, a slogan that resonates with voters looking for an alternative to the LDP  although critics question just how different that alternative would be from Abes LDP.To differentiate her party from the LDP, Koike has adopted popular policies, such as an end to atomic power amid public safety worries after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis, and proposes to freeze a planned sales tax hike from 2019. But she also backs Abes push to expand the role of the military overseas and his goal of revising the post-war constitution  although recently she has avoided focusing on the divisive issue of amending its pacifist Article 9.She has also said in the past that Japan should consider having nuclear weapons, breaking a taboo in the only country to suffer an atomic attack, and, like Abe, has visited Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Japans past militarism. Koike entered politics in a small reformist party and migrated through several other groups before joining the LDP and in 2008 became the first woman to run for head of the conservative party. She came in a distant third.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Photo: Priyanka Parashar/MintNew Delhi: In a relief to the growing packaged food industry, the prime ministers office (PMO) has overruled directives of ministries for health, and women and child development, which were against providing ready-to-use food to children.In a 4 November meeting chaired by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister on nutrition, the PMO said that the decision to provide RUTF (ready to use therapeutic foods) may be left to the discretion of individual statesthus paving the way for such foods to be provided to children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM).A copy of the minutes of the meeting was reviewed by Mint. The meeting was attended by officials from the PMO, Niti Aayog, and secretaries of both women and child development (WCD) and ministry of health.RUTF, also referred to as energy dense nutritious food (EDNF), consists of a paste of peanuts, oil, sugar, vitamins, milk powder and mineral supplements.Commonly used in Africa, the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) supports community-based provision of RUTF.The PMO maintained that the practice of offering hot cooked meals to 3-6 year-old children; and Take Home Ration for six months to three year old children, as well as pregnant and lactating women, will continue as per the existing scheme of Integrated Child Development Services, run by the WCD ministry.A WCD directive issued on 28 August informed state governments that the use of RUTF food to tackle SAM was not an accepted policy of the Centre, referring to a February 2009 circular issued by the health ministry.The WCD letter also pointed to concerns that the use of RUTF may replace family foods that children should normally be eating.It is informed that enough evidence is not available for the use of RUTF vis--vis other interventions for the management of SAM, it said.The concept of therapeutic food or ready-to-eat food has been a subject of debate in India for long.In 2015, the government constituted the SAM alliance, consisting officials from the department of biotechnology, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and ministry of health, to examine the effectiveness of RUTF for management of SAM children.According to officials in the health ministry, who did not wish to be named, the findings of the inter-ministerial alliance suggested that RUTF was only temporarily helpful in nutrition.The group had suggested that management of children with SAM requires a comprehensive family-centric approach involving caregivers, instead of a food-centric approach.Experts found that an obsessive focus on the type of diet was diluting attention from the critical aspect of caring.The caretakers thought that their job was done by giving children RUTF, and hence children were not cared for properly. The study pointed to the great need for the aspect of caring which was found to be missing, added the official cited above.It also found that RUTF may not benefit the common household in developing appropriate food habits for children as against home augmented food.The Health Ministry had, in fact, stressed as early as in 2009 that the use of RUTF was not an accepted policy of the government. And in 2013, the centre had asked Jharkhand to stop distributing RUTF to malnourished kids.The RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) said it was concerned that introducing RUTF would benefit private players.The recently constituted working group on nutrition constituted by Niti Aayog is clearly showing the pressure coming from the global forces. There are representatives of different organisations that are promoted by multinational corporations. RUTF is not in the interest of health of the children, as earlier suggested by various studies. The policies should not be based on lobby groups and we cannot allow this to happen, SJMs national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said."

Express The election for the Shri Dudhgana Vedganaga Cooperative Sugar Mill in Kolhapur will see Congress tie up with Shiv Sena. ExpressPolitics makes strange bedfellows. In the sugar belt of Maharashtra, it has made arch enemies come together to gain power. The upcoming election for the Shri Dudhgana Vedganaga Cooperative Sugar Mill in Kolhapur has seen the BJP siding with the NCP to take on Congress-Shiv Sena combine. This election has generated much interest for many see as the BJPs effort to enter the cooperative sector.Located in the Kagal taluka of Kolhapur district, this cooperative mill, like others in the area, has been under the control of leaders who are from the NCP or Congress. Though the mill is located in Kagal taluka, its more than 54,000 members are spread mostly in the talukas of Radhanagari, Kagal, Bhudargad and Karveer. They will be participating in the election to elect a new 21-member board of director for the mill, which will run the show for the next five years.The outgoing board of director was headed by KP Patil, an ex-NCP MLA and majority of the directors were either from Congress or NCP. This time around, Patils panel is pitted against another panel formed by veteran Congress leader Dinkarrao Jadhav. Jadhav had held the chairmanship of the mill for more than a decade and his relations with Patil was cordial once. But, now, both have become arch rivals. The election of the cooperative sugar mill might have gone unnoticed had it not been for the strange alliances it has created. In the run-up to the election, Patil decided to enter into a formal alliance with the BJP and of the 21 candidates it has put up, five are from the BJP. On the other hand, the panel put up by Jadhav decided to enter into an alliance with the Shiv Sena, with Prakash Abitkar, the Sena MLA from Radhanagari, joining hands with Jadhav to bring down Patils panel.In this election, what has made the BJP leaders hopeful of favourable results is the induction of leaders like Rahul Desai, son of former NCP MLA Bajrang Desai. Millers like Samarjitsinh Ghatge, chairman of Kagal-based Shri Chattrapati Shau Maharaj Cooperative Sugar mill and Vinay Kore, director of Tatyasaheb Kore Warna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana, had earlier joined the BJP, which has boosted its prospects in the region. Abitkars decision to join hands with the Congress is mostly because of the fact that Patil was his opponent in the 2014 Assembly elections. Incidentally, Abitkar had switched over to Shiv Sena from Congress just prior to the polls.Kolhapur happens to be the home district of state Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil. Patil has been trying to increase the partys footprint and presence in the sugar belt as well as the cooperative sugar mills. Patil has been in the forefront of this alliance, but leaders close to him say this is a purely local arrangement and nothing much should be read into it. Given the fact that the BJP is looking to make strong inroads in the cooperative sector, this election is being viewed with interest by many. During the 2014 elections, Shiv Sena had bagged six of the 10 Assembly seats in the district while NCP and BJP had won two seats each. But since then, the BJP is on the rise in Kolhapur, with the zilla parishad elections witnessing the party sharing power with a local party called Tararani Aghadi.With both sides putting their best foot forward to win the elections, no one is leaving any stone unturned. Shareholder voters who are outside Kolhapur are being called back to be present to exercise their franchise.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Financial struggles pushes the family to leave their village and go to a neighbouring town to do back-breaking labour in sugarcane fields. Despite the challenging situation and days filled with hard toil, Vacchi quietly finds time to study, much to the irritation of her father, a simple farmer who has very little sympathy or understanding for her aspiration.Vacchi faces all these obstacles with a quite positivity that finds a way to solve all these problems as they occur.

The administration was informed and the students were immediately rushed to hospital, said Ravindra Kumar, principal of the school. Two kilometres away, Global Shanti Care Hospital and Trauma Centre started admitting some of the students  aged 6 to 14 years  around 10 am. About 30 children were admitted with symptoms of anxiety, nausea, chest congestion and respiratory distress. Their heart beat was over 100. Four of them had respiratory distress and were admitted to the ICU. Everyone recovered by evening and were discharged, said Madan Mohan Jha, Medical Superintendent at the hospital.With a student strength of 2,000, Saraswati Balika Vidya Mandir claims to have students from 48 villages in Shamli district. One such village, Lilon, is just a kilometre from the school.It has been understood that students who reached Saraswati Shishu Mandir Vidyalaya by taking the road from Lilon village complained of itchy eyes and difficulty in breathing, said a statement from the DGPs office.On this road, an unpaved path led to a sugar mill complex that houses a bio-gas plant. A pungent smell filled the air near the mill and some people leaving the mill premises had their faces covered with cloth.

She was given medicine, he said.Less than 200 metres from the mill compound, Prachi Sharma, a Class XI student, had returned home from a private hospital. Sitting on the bed, she breathed heavily, supporting herself with her arms. She felt dizzy but did not lose consciousness. She is still short of breath, said her father Devendra Sharma.By evening, an FIR had been registered against the owner and management of the sugar mill on the basis of a complaint by the school principal.Students who came to school on foot from Lilon village were the ones who fell sick. Investigation is under way. The DGP has ordered an inquiry under the commissioner of Saharanpur. Samples from the spot have been sent for forensic examination. All angles are being explored  whether there was emission from the mill, burning of waste. The accused have maintained it is a conspiracy but our investigation will ascertain the cause, said Ajay Pal, SP, Shamli.The factory is close to the school and was installed in 1933. It was closed for a long time and was in the process of being reopened. Something might have happened during the cleaning process, DM Indra Vikram Singh said.A senior health official said, It seems that waste was disposed by putting some chemical on it which generated some white matter and released gases like ammonia. The children could have inhaled the gas, which could have been toxic. Details will be revealed after investigation.

Jeyapragasam said that while formulating the GST, genuine stakeholders were not called for discussion. It had been formulated by ministers and officials without understanding the ground reality of the industry.In a bid to boost revenue, the government had neglected the interests of small traders and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). The Tamil Nadu government used to invite stakeholders for pre-budget meetings to elicit their views. The practice was in vogue since 1996. The Union government should have convened such a meeting so that the features of GST could have been discussed and fine-tuned.The Association had sought total tax exemption for coriander, chilli, dried ginger, mustard, fenugreek, turmeric, and five % for pickles, biscuits, ghee and butter (unregistered brand). Under the GST regime, palm jaggery was exempt from tax, whereas palmyrah sugar, the method of production of which was the same as that of palmyrah jaggery, was levied five %. Palmyrah sugar should also be exempt from tax.Sugar candy (kalkandu) which was mainly used in temples as prasadam and also for medicinal purpose in country drugs was exempted earlier, but it was levied five % now.The Association had asked 100 % exemption for many products, mostly unregistered brands/commodities used in houses from time immemorial. Some of them included batter for idly and dosa, a common household item in southern States, that attracted 18 % when GST was launched. Though it had been reduced to 12 %, it should be brought down further to five %."

Running wide across her angular face, it appeared often, especially when she spoke of her son, who was seven then.I met her in Ambalanthurai village in Batticaloa, a district in Sri Lankas Eastern Province. She ran a small shop, selling packets of sugar, chilli powder, and toiletries. The shop was essentially a portion of her brick-walled home. A square-shaped window was kept open, its vertical bars spaced wide enough for customers to easily put their hand in. It was her sale-cum-cash counter.Jayakumari was among the many women I spoke to for a story on enforced disappearances in Sri Lankas post-war north and east. Like thousands of other women, she was looking for her husband who went missing around the final stages of the battle.As she began telling her story, I realised that the search for her disappeared partner was only one of her many challenges. Both her arms got severely injured in wartime shelling, as the army and the LTTE clashed. She underwent a surgery that barely managed to stitch up what remained of her arms. Ever since, she has not been able to lift even light objects without feeling excruciating pain.Between running to government offices to follow up on her petition about her husband and weekly trips to the town market to restock supplies at her shop, Jayakumari was raising her little son all by herself. Her life, I thought to myself, is what the aftermath of a war looks like every day. She had no time to deal with the trauma of the past, she was busy surviving.Where did you go? she asked her son half-knowingly, as he came running and hugged her tight around her knees. Breathless, he grinned quizzically at her, maybe wondering who this stranger was. ll her labour and optimism was for him, she said.Jayakumari spoke to me at length of vanishing jobs in her village, of dwindling incomes and about people taking loans. It seemed that hardship had become a running theme around her.Have you heard this Kannandasan song where he says, unakkum keezhe ullavar kodi, ninaithu paarthu nimmadi naadu (think of the crores of people worse off than you and feel peaceful)? she asked, quoting from a famous Tamil film song from the 1960s penned by the poet.That line keeps me going. I realise I am better off compared to many others here, she said, flashing a big smile again. Whenever I feel bogged down, I go back to those words."

The group of over 50 families is among regular visitors from other states to the annual congregation here.The social stigma Dalits faced decades ago is no longer there. However, many are still marginalized on the economic front, and are facing a new crisis in the cow belt these days. After the ban on cow slaughter, there has been a problem of plenty of the bovine. The hinterland is infested with unproductive cattle abandoned by their owners. The cows have now become a new cause of crop damage. Majority of these men have small holdings, and cattle eating away the meagre crop, leaves them bleeding, they said.""The chana (gram) had hardly grown, and the cows finished it all. There is hardly anything left even for the family to consume,"" said Ram Dulari Devi of Kisripur village in Sitapur district. ""My sugar cane crop too was damaged, when it had barely grown a feet,"" said Raju Gautam of Arua village in the same district.The problem started after the ban on cow slaughter. Cows that are no longer productive cannot be sold for slaughter, since it would invite the ire of the gau rakshaks (cow conservationists). So the herdsmen have simply let them free. Even some milk producing cows and calves have been set free. The animals graze freely in the fields, with little chance of stopping them, said Hemnath Gautam.The big farmers can easily fence their fields, but the marginal cultivator cannot afford this. Many in the group hardly have a single acre of farm. The number of cows abandoned is anywhere between 20 to 100 in a village, said one of the visitors in the group.""The activists immediately spring into action if they find people setting up fences. They allege farmers are trying to kill the cattle with electrified fences. When the situation gets worse, the residents of one village load the cows in a truck and dump them near another village under the cover of darkness. When caught, it leads to clashes,"" added Hemnath Gautam.""A bull had gored a young man in our village, and such a risk is always there, but nothing has been done,"" said Shivbal Gautam, another member of the group.The government keeps saying that gaushalas (cow shelters) will be built, but nothing has happened so far, he said.

It'll send a very strong message.It's about setting a national agenda. The task calls for huge financial outlay, and long gestation period. We're talking 20-25 years for rivers to flourish again. Four to five governments are likely to come and go. All governments must be focused, for which an overwhelming 'yes' (in the form of missed calls) must come from India, so they know so many voted for this one cause.We want to create a large-scale workable module. India has 20,000 km of riverine land. Nearly 25% of this is government land. This will be forested. We want to prove to farmers that their income from tree-based agriculture will far exceed returns from cropbased agriculture. This will be done in a scientific way. All support will be provided. We are speaking to CII. Baba Ramdev has said he will provide minimum support price to farmers for their tree-based produce. Farmers don't want to shift from paddy and sugarcane, the thirstiest of crops, as these have a support price. We have to tell farmers how the shift from crop-based farming to tree-based farming can increase their income three times over. If farmers get a guarantee that their produce will be procured, they will switch over to the tree based farming. This model will work.When in survival mode, as we've been in the last 50 years, we did many things and benefited from it. Don't go about damning the dams now. That was a certain phase of development. Now we're thinking differently as we want sustainability. There are those for river linking and those against it. I seek a solution. We'll find one only if science and politics marry and I'm trying to officiate the marriage.The survival rate for what our volunteers are doing on private land is very high. When government plants on a large scale, it can get political. I say don't announce you'll plant so much in a day. If you say one year, you can plan better. MP, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are doing it, and geo-tagging all trees. So you know when a tree has to be replaced, using technology.In the last month, media has done a fabulous job. We appreciate the support of the Times of India, its leadership, the editorial and reporting teams for its relentless support through this month long campaign. TOI took ownership of the Rally for Rivers and also published many reports on the state of India's rivers that raised awareness and will play a role in the making of a river revitalisation policy. There's been some fantastic reporting in the vernacular media as well.I am trying to disconnect the emotion from the behaviour. Emotions do not translate into practice, or action. There is a time for emotions and politics, but now we have to think scientifically and strategically. Which is why, when someone says they'll plant a tree I say, no, your satisfaction is not a solution. You get me 10 missed calls instead."

In fact, the religious places could be termed as high-risk prone spots for spread of illness caused due to food contamination, flies, said the officials.The campaign aims to train volunteers in the religious centres around mosques, gurudwaras, churches and temples. It will conduct vendor training programmes, workshops on food safety management systems, utilization of leftover flowers, fruits and vegetables, product handling and safety to name a few.A senior official from the FSSAI said, ""There is a need to inform and alert people about sanitation and food safety when it comes to prasad that is served to the devotees at places of worship.

Tourists who had stepped out for a weekend retreat had to bear the brunt of the sun.Physicians, paediatricians and dermatologists suggested people take precautions to keep health issues at bay.Physician and critical care specialist Anant Kulkarni said that this is a time when incidents of viral fever and other infections rise.Kulkarni said, 30 to 35 degree celsius is the optimal breeding temperature for viruses as it is neither too hot nor too cold.The best remedy is to avoid overexposure and have freshly prepared home food instead of outside food, he said.Samata Saoji, consulting paediatrician of Saoji Hospital confirmed that this weather attracts infections. These are different from the infections that thrive during rainy season.Heat-related infections are common due to the October heat, Saoji said. She suggested that if children are suffering from viral fever and other such infections, the parents should avoid sending them to school to prevent the infection from spreading.In case of fever, doctors suggested taking paracetamol. If the fever does not subside even after that, a doctor should be consulted.Samata Saoji said that if the child suffers from dehydration or diarrhea, they should be given oral rehydration solution (ORS). One can prepare rehydration solution at home using sugar, salt and boiled water. The solution helps in keeping the body hydrated, she added.Doctors advise that if one has to go out in the sun, they must use a scarf, umbrella and goggles to prevent direct exposure to the sun. Changing temperatures tend to confuse people. They are unprepared for the intense sunlight. This leads to increase in fever and dehydration incidents, Kulkarni said.Dermatologist Reena Jain suggests that staying too long in sunlight can cause Melasma, a common skin condition in women. It causes dark patches on the face. She suggests using sunscreen while indoors and a 3-4 hourly sunscreen application while outdoors. Melasma makes up about 80% of all skin conditions among women.Sunrays can cause thickened or leathery skin, skin burns and even skin cancer, Jain said. She suggests consumption of food rich in antioxidants such as pomegranate and berries. She also advises eating food rich in beta carotene like carrots and other suitable supplements to avoid aging and wrinkling."

Farmers who have sown 0238 variety of cane are increasingly facing problems caused by Pokka Boeng disease and that too when the crushing season is due to begin by October-end. At this stage, use of pesticide is ruled out. The district sugarcane department has come up with the suggestion that they spray the infected plants with buttermilk as an organic means to protect their crops from the disease.The disease is most rampant in 0238 variety of sugarcane. Pokka Boeng disease is caused by a complex of fungal species within the genus Fusarium that causes malformed or distorted tops in cane crop.Giving details about the disease, a farmer said leaves of the crop shrink, dry up and main shoot turns black in colour. Use of pesticide at this stage is not advisable as the tops of cane crop is used as fodder.According to district agriculture officer OP Singh, Farmers should not use pesticide at the time when sugarcane crushing season is round the corner as it can affect the quality of sugar and will be harmful for livestock. We are suggesting to farmers to spray mattha (buttermilk) on their sugarcane crop. It has anti-fungal properties which protects the crop from Pokka Boeng.He said, Farmers should mix two or three litres of buttermilk in 100 litres of water and spray the mixture over the crop. It will control the growth of the fungus. The method was suggested after consultations with those farmers who practice organic farming.Ashok Kumar, director, research, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture & Technology, Meerut, endorsed the view and said that buttermilks acidic property helps tackle such disease and has been adopted by organic farmers.The suggestion to use buttermilk as a remedy is significant as Bijnor is the second biggest sugarcane-growing district in Uttar Pradesh after Lakhimpur Kheri. Cane has been cultivated in an area spanning 2.12 lakh hectares in Bijnor and over 21.5 lakh hectares across the state. A cash crop, cane can withstand storms and heavy rain. But of late, farmers are facing problems due to cane diseases.A particular variety, 0238, has been cultivated across 40% of the total area under cane cultivation in the state. This variety has become a hit among farmers as its yield is better than other varieties. But now, farmers find that due to its low immunity, it is prone to plant diseases like Pokka Boeng. This means, farmers have to put in more pesticides to grow 0238 variety."

Now, when data has been compiled by the agriculture department it shows that each of them had made his own lethal concoction and that profefonos and cypermethrin were not used in all cases.As reported by TOI in the last few days, Bt cotton plants, which were supposed to be pest resistant, attracted hordes of pests like pink bollworm, jassids, thrips and white flies forcing desperate farmers to try out different pesticides. They did it without taking protective measures and succumbed after inadvertently inhaling the chemical while spraying.Some of the brands used by the farmers are made by reputed companies, including listed entities like United Phosphorus, Insecticides India Limited and Syngenta  a multinational company.The Profex Super brand which makes the combination of profefonos-cypermethrin has been used in six out of 11 deaths. It is made by Andhra Pradesh-based Nagarjuna Fertilisers which is a major player in the business. The chemical is recommended for bollworm pests. The packets carry a yellow triangle mark which means it is ranked second in terms of risk.It was used as a mix with some other pesticide in five cases. In nine cases, Profex was not used at all. For example, Gajanan Fulmali, of Sawargaon village in Kalamb tehsil, had used Phoskill and Asatop. The former is a red triangle pesticide, which means most dangerous, and Asatop packets have a blue mark, which means the least risk. Phoskill is produced by United Phosphorus.The other brand names used by farmers include Monocil, Polo Streamrich Tomic, Metastis Stop, Monocrotofos,, Laser, Police and Mono. ""The brands are approved by the Central Insecticide Board,"" said an agriculture official here, adding, ""These are used for other pests like white fly and sucking pest.""So far the type of poison which has killed the patients has not been ascertained. ""The names of the brands have been recorded on the basis of statements by the survivors who in many cases could not produce the empty packets,"" say the official.""Farmers believe that spraying a mix of all pesticides will lead to better results. There was bollworm in the area but it was below the threshold level of economic loss. Eager to get better results as the crop was favourable, farmers increased the intensity of the spraying,"" said the official.The state government has booked the manufacturers of Polo and Police brand for culpable homicide for the recent deaths. In the case of Polo, made by Syngenta, the makers have been booked because the dealers were given the product without issuing the principal certificate. The certificate is mandatory for a dealer to get a license to sell a particular pesticide.Police, made by Gujarat's Gharda Chemicals, is recommended to be used on sugar cane yet it was pushed in large numbers in Yavatmal where there is minuscule cultivation of the crop. ""The distributors tried to push it as a pesticide recommended for cotton which amounts to misinforming the farmer,"" said the agriculture official."

Though I must say French Fries has a nice alliterative ring to it and sounds better than going up and saying, Give me large Belgian Fries please!The best place to get true Belgian Frites is from a friterie or frietkot. These fry stands can be anything from a small cart with deep-fryers to a shop in a bustling market square. Belgians eat their frites served in a paper cone and preferably with small plastic forks; and if you are a true Belgian, you will walk around while eating out of the cone with the fork! Belgian fries are short and stout, about a centimeter wide and are often hollow inside. Fries here are typically served with dollops of sauce which range from the more traditional favorites such as ketchup and mustard to more interesting concoctions like andalouse, samurai and joppieaus. The topping most Belgians prefer is spicy mayonnaise, which is also paired with most Belgian dishes. I had my paper cone of frites topped with spicy ketchup and spent an ideal 15 minutes soaking in the lovely view of the canal. And the calories!Besides fries, Belgians have been making waffles long before the Americans got their hands on to it and transformed it into a diner breakfast option. In Belgium, waffles is the perfect street food: you eat them on the run, the waffle fits very comfortably in your hand and unlike, the American iHop variety, you definitely do not slather them with toppings (very un-Belgian). And the best part is you can get your hands on a Belgian waffle anywhere: from stalls in the large stations to waffle trucks which you can smell coming a mile away!So what is the difference between the original Belgian waffle and its US Johnny-come-lately counterpart? Belgian waffle is essentially a denser, sweeter, chewier waffle that can brighten up ones day on the most dreary of days. And with the country having many unpredictable rainy days, these waffles are just the perfect remedy to plod through a gray day. The secret in making these waffles is pearl sugar. This is basically an integral part of European baking and is coarse, large chunks of sugar which does not melt at temperatures used in baking, giving the product an extra sweetness and crunch. So when this sugar is mixed into the dough, and cooked on the iron, the pearls melt and caramelize on the outside of the waffle forming big bites of crisp, browned sugar.I stand outside a waffle shop and watch the waffler (is that even a word?) prepare his wares expertly. The smell wafting from the shop is intoxicating. I ponder: would another round of a high-calorie food, after a large wretched cone of fries, send me into a diabetic coma? And then of course, there is another matter: Belgians pride themselves on their chocolate  and their beer. Between this awesome foursome and a world of regret later, lies a delicious state of lip-smacking, Ooh-inducing seduction.I debate, shrug and waffle no more. A hearty round of that sweet pastry follows, and as my clogging heart lubdubs me accusingly, I turn around and say to it, in my best Rhett Butler manner: Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn!"
