""I have been to Hyderabad many a time before. But this time it's going to be a little different as I will be performing at the Comic Con. I have a repertoire of superhero jokes and plan to rely on them to make Hyderabadis laugh,"" says Sahil, adding that it's mostly going to be old jokes in new avatar.In an age when anyone can take offence to anything, how does he crack a joke without getting into trouble? ""Actually no one cares about what I say. But I tend to play smart when putting across puns which are below the belt. anything can offend anyone, yes, but the trick is to push the limit just that much; you should rein in when required,"" he explains.Is that 'reining in' the reason why you don't hear too many political jokes from him? ""Well, I have political opinions, but I refrain from using any in my jokes. politics doesn't need jokes on it; it is a joke in itself,"" he quips.With close to 600 shows around the world under his belt, one characteristic that stands out for The Front Row star is his ability to mould himself according to his audience. Be it a corporate crowd or an audience of college-goers, Sahil is comfortable with both, but says that if given a chance he would any day choose the latter over the former. ""In corporate shows, your jokes need to be within a limit. By that I mean you can't go all out and say whatever comes to your mind. But in college shows, there is a certain sense of freedom for a stand-up comic and it's total madness. corporates are little conservative when it comes to topics such as sex and porn, but it's completely opposite in case of a college crowd,"" he informs.In the last four to five years, the stand-up comedy scene has expanded in India. with so many new comedians springing up in such a short time, it's getting competitive, and we dare say, crowded. So, how do one know which joke will work with the audience and which won't? ""I useTwitter as a laboratory to test my jokes. I post my jokes there and when some goes viral, I make a set based on them. I believe if I can crack up people with 140 words, I can easily make them go bonkers with a set,"" he says, signing off."

The e-mail id of the two companies is also the same. The company eventually paid 50% of money to bag the mining contract for the controversial sand mines of Saidpur Khurd and Mehdipur. ""The minister and his wife have also taken a loan of Rs 407 lakh from RGS Traders as per his election affidavit,"" he alleged.Khaira said he would move court to seek an independent inquiry into the case in case the chief minister does not accept his party's demand.""It is a matter of record that as per the Narang Commission (appointed by the government to probe the charges), Rana Gurjit Singh had called up Amit Dhaka, director mining in the run up to mining auctions. A CBI inquiry can unearth the details of the conversation and about the pressure exerted on the director,' alleged Khaira.Rana Gurjit Singh, on the other hand, has denied any involvement in the mining process and the state government has decided not to take any action against him.Asked about his demand seeking ex-communication of Akali leader Bibi Jagir Kaur, Khaira said his petition was a test for the Akal Takht jathedar and he has even sent a reminder to him. It may be an old case but it is still relevant, he said. ""When action was taken so promptly in the (Sucha Singh) Langah case, why not against this Akali leader,"" he said."
5a15bb379855b76bf13ef780,New virus on the prowl in Kolkata,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-virus-on-the-prowl-in-kolkata/articleshow/61013479.cms,2017-10-10,"KOLKATA: Even as Kolkata reels under a dengue outbreak, a new virus is on the prowl and has laid hundreds low with fever, body ache and respiratory distress. Human metapneumo virus, which is activated by a sudden temperature drop, is active in the city, say experts. Like other seasonal viruses, this one too spreads through cough and sneeze droplets.The sporadic showers since last week have cooled the city by a couple of degrees, a condition which is ideal for viruses to thrive, according to Arindam Biswas, senior consultant, general medicine, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS).Metapneumo, it seems, is the most prevalent this time. The typical symptoms are high fever, body ache, respiratory trouble and fatigue. It affects all age groups, but children and the elderly are more vulnerable. Those suffering from cardiac ailments or high blood sugar could have very severe symptoms due to their low immunity.Public places like buses, trains, auditoria and classrooms are ideal locations for the spread of the virus, said Debashish Saha, consultant, AMRI Hospital . ""It spreads through sneeze and cough droplets that often collect on bus handles, chairs, window sills and handkerchiefs. So, hand hygiene is very important. Hands should be washed regularly and tissues should be used instead of handkerchiefs,"" said Saha.With schools shut for vacation, the spread has been checked among children so far, said Shantanu Ray , paediatrician. ""But once the vacation ends, a spurt is imminent. Children are obviously less careful and so more susceptible to infections due to their low immunity. Metapneumo leads to respiratory problems in some children and there have been cases where hospitalization was required,"" said Ray.With symptoms similar to that of dengue, physicians have often been left confused. Like dengue, metapneumo, too, kicks off with high fever and body ache. In many cases, it has been leading to diarrhoea. ""Symptoms have been overlapping with dengue, which too has changed symptoms this season. Previously, dengue never caused diarrhoea, but now it is common. Dengue type II and type IV have been common this year and both are life-threatening. So, we are taking no chances and recommending a blood test even if we suspect it's a virus like rhino or metapneumo,"" said Biswas.Unlike dengue, metapneumo virus is always accompanied by a respiratory infection. Asthma and COPD patients, those suffering from chest infection and children are more vulnerable, according to Irfaan Akhtar, head of microbiology and infection control, Fortis Hospital . ""While fever and body ache are the most common dengue symptoms, in the case of metapneumo it is always accompanied by coughing and wheezing. For those with a history of chest ailments, the symptoms are likely to be more severe,"" said Akhtar.But like most other seasonal viruses, metapneumo. too, can be countered with just paracetamol and symptomatic treatment. Antibiotics are not recommended unless there is an accompanying bacterial infection. ""Bacterial infections are rare but could lead to severe complications. But seasonal viruses usually recede with time and rest,"" said Biswas.The feature of this year's spread has been the scare of dengue. With the outbreak of dengue continuing, a panic has set in. ""people are scared and many are rushing to get a blood test done. It's good to be careful, but treatment of viral diseases should be different from that of dengue,"" said Saha."

He will join the Aditya Birla Group as group head for corporate business development and strategy.Santrupt Misra, director, group HR & CEO, carbon black business, Aditya Birla Group, confirmed the development. Ahmed El Sheikh, senior VP & GM for PepsiCo Egypt & Jordan, will replace Shivakumar as CEO of Pepsi-Co India.Shivakumar joined Pepsi-Co India in December, 2013. Prior to that, he served as MD of Nokia India and its senior vice-president for India, Middle East and Africa. He was PepsiCo's first 'outsider' CEO since Rajeev Bakshi , who headed the company from 2001 to 2006.While a PepsiCo India spokesperson first denied knowledge of the development, the company issued a statement confirming the Shivakumar's move just before this edition went to print. Shivakumar's move comes a few months after Venkatesh Kini, his counterpart from Coca-Cola India , put in his papers. Kini's exit followed a string of high-profile exits at the company.Shivakumar, who is credited with leading PepsiCo's 'Power of one' strategy in India  integrating operations of the company's food and beverages' departments that ran as separate entities before  also witnessed a sustained period of senior management churn at the firm.After seeing years of fastpaced growth, both Coke and PepsiCo are fighting an uphill battle in India. Dependent on fizzy drinks as the mainstay of their revenue, the US-headquartered companies have found it tough to plot a turnaround in their strategies, while consumers keep shying away from sugary carbonated beverages.The Rs 14,000-crore soft drinks industry is currently undergoing a substantial consolidation, with many plants shutting down across the country and companies rushing to launch 'healthier' and lowcalorie beverages."

""It is high time the government starts training farmers on the most cost-effective way to extract neera from coconut trees. The government had in March announcement training on the extraction and creation of value-added products from neera including drinks, sweets, sugar and cakes,"" he said. ""But there has not been a single word about neera since.""""The nearest neera testing facility is in Kochi. Why should our farmers travel all the way to Kochi to understand the neera certification process and standards that have to be maintained when extracting and marketing it? Tamil Nadu should have its own testing and training facility,"" an association member said.This could also be an opportunity to promote Coimbatore and Pollachi, known for coconut farms. ""If they set up such a centre in Coimbatore, the district could in turn attract farmers from places like Theni, Dindigul, Tirupur and Krishnagiri, which will also boost the district's revenue,"" the petition said.Tamil Nadu currently has about 1.5 lakh farmers cultivating coconut trees on about 10.74 lakh acres. ""Coconut trees on almost one lakh acres have either died or have registered a drop in production owing to the drought. Focus on neera industry would help augment their income,"" Palanisamy added."

It was found that the board of directors had sanctioned huge loans to private and cooperative sugar mills in violation of rules, resulting in non-performing assets of Rs 1,070 crore. As per the Cooperative Societies Act, the probe was to be completed within two-and-a-half years. Since the probe was not completed in time, the state government amended the Act in March 2017 to provide for more time for the probe. The government said the Act would be implemented with retrospective effect.A director moved the HC saying that while the two-and-a-half year period ended on November 21, 2016, the government amended the law in March 2017. He said the law cannot be implemented with retrospective effect and that it should be set aside.A week before the law was amended, TOI had sought the CM's response on the probe being not completed.

A window opens out into a shelf stocked with a variety of cookies and cakes in decorative wraps, ready for the festive season. In the corner, a signboard reads, The first shop managed by people with special needs.Its late afternoon, and there is no one in the shop at the moment  on most other days, there is someone at the window during the day  but theres a hum of activity inside, as children shuffle their bags and prepare to leave for the day. They have just concluded a Navratri party, and are winding down after a few hours of merriment.The shop is attached to a vocational training centre for people with autism and intellectual disabilities between 14 and 30 years of age, including a commercial bakery certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The shop, which opened a few months ago, provides what Sangeetha Chakrapani, Founder of Together, which runs the centre and the shop, calls a sheltered, meaningful employment opportunity for the children.Children with autism  called a spectrum disorder, because it affects children in a variety of ways  face challenges in communication and social interactions. And intellectual disability is characterised by below-average intelligence and a lack of day-to-day living skills.Window of opportunityOne of the ways I could look for employment for these students, Ms. Chakrapani says, was to go out into the world, knock on many doors and say, Please give a chance to these students. It is possible today; there are many organisations far more receptive to working with people with disabilities than they used to be. But I decided, instead, to create another window of opportunity.The bakery has a chef, and a team of students works in different capacities depending on their skill-sets: some may bake, others pack, or label the products. The shop allows the students to interact with the community around them, and develop communication skills. Even in the shop, we have students training in different areas, Ms. Chakrapani says. You have students, for example, who dont interact with customers at all. They clean the shop, put up the display, while some explain the rate card, and maybe one or two handle the money.Simran Fanson, 19, enjoys managing the shop. She is usually at the counter for about 10 to 20 minutes before another student relieves her, but today, she has been sitting for half-an-hour and even sold some products to a group of women who attended the Navratri party. We have triple-choco modaks, laddoos, cookies and cupcakes on sale, she says, and breaks into a grin. I want you to buy some too! Her enthusiasm is infectious. I feel good doing this. Its no use sitting at home, she says. She has completed her Class XII in Home Science through correspondence, and wants to help her father in his generators business . She also makes lamps and sells them in her Andheri West neighbourhood, besides helping her mother with cooking. Her best day so far? Independence Day, when she earned Rs. 1,500. I gave everyone a treat from my first salary!Ms. Chakrapani sees Ms. Fanson playing a much larger role . She was never inclined towards academics, and always wanted to learn skills. Teaching her the tasks is not an issue at all. I see her taking on a very big role, once she settles emotionally and understands responsibilities.A cooperative endeavourIn many ways, Ms. Chakrapani lives the project. She has four children, quadruplets, and two were diagnosed with autism. The kids are now 13. She would ask herself the question parents of children with disabilities must confront what would their life be like after the parents passed on?  and that became the core of Together, which she founded four years ago.This is our programme in a nutshell, she says. Weve tried to conceptualise what the hurdles are a person with autism is likely to cross from dawn to dusk. Right from the time you wake up in the morning to your basic physical needs  getting dressed, being able to say youre not well, that you need some extra time in bed, you have your period, your back is hurting  it could be all the small things you and I take for granted. This is especially important, as many children with autism are either non-verbal or have limited verbal capabilities, therefore the need to teach them to communicate their basic needs.Ms. Chakrapani visited residential centres for people with disabilities and saw how they lived when they were in their 30s and 40s. I saw there is a lot we need to teach that has nothing to do with academics. There is a huge area to be covered. She calls herself a co-worker at Together, which has a team of seven  four special educators, a parent, two support staff and herself  who attend to 15 children. Im very clear that none of us is perfect here: not the teachers, not I, not my students. And this world is not perfect. So we live with our imperfections, and we run this like a cooperative.The programme is divided into four parts: the kitchen, personal hygiene, how to manage free time, and work. Together opened the vocational centre last year, with one microwave oven and an oven-toaster-grill. It began operations last November. We started slow. Not everyone could be involved in the bakery. So we decided to enter into paper plates, then paper bags, and then the shop.The vocational training is based on the premise that every human being needs to put in a minimum of five to six hours of work a day. The training depends on the area of work and the students skill set. A peer group is important because many people with intellectual disabilities sit at home doing nothing; that hurts me no end, she says, as her voice softens.Another challenge is to create lifetime care facilities, which is a dream she and her husband wish to fulfil. Even if theyre going to be in a supported environment, they need to have some skill set. So we have to push and push and push for greater independence on living skills, being able to adjust to people around them, understand basic communication, follow instructions, communicate requirements to people other than their parents.A beautiful journeyIts still early days for the shop, with just word-of-mouth bringing customers in. The shop is open five days a week, which she hopes will soon be seven days. Ms. Chakrapani is hoping companies give them bulk orders. She also hopes to buy a food truck that will go from area to area with the students, selling their products, for which she needs finance.She is careful to emphasise that Together does not rely on emotions. We are here to create a product that gives customer satisfaction  if it is going to be on sympathy it will never last  and provide an engaging atmosphere in which people with disability can learn, earn, enjoy themselves, just like other people. This is possible only through community support. Our duty is to give something of value. Now we are waiting for the world to meet us half-way. That wont come overnight. We have to keep at it.To most of us who have friends, regular jobs and families we interact with, its a perspective we can only imagine. Ms. Chakrapani, however, works with a much larger aim and when she speaks, the passion comes through. She always reminds parents  and herself  that they have to focus on the fact that its not their journey, but that of the children. Somewhere we have to let go of our ego, our demands, our pride and our desires and concentrate on their journey. And make it a beautiful journey for them; give them a world that is safe. A world that accepts them and where they can engage.Together Foundations bakery sells muffins, teacakes, cupcakes, sugar-free products made without artificial sweeteners, oats-and-raisin cookies, chocolate cookies, and oreo pops, all eggless and vegetarian.

They worshipped Bathukamma by singing songs in praise of Goddess Gauri before immersing the floral arrangements in the NSP canal late in the evening.We prepared the 33-foot Bathukamma by using locally-available flowers such as Gunugu, Thangedu and Teak flowers spanning over several hours to celebrate the flower festival, dedicated to Goddess Gauri, revered as mother nature, in a befitting manner, said Gopala Rao.Talking to The Hindu , he said they had prepared a 21-feet Bathukamma last year. This year, we take pride in preparing one of the tallest Bathukammas in the entire State, he remarked with a sense of accomplishment."

The mixture of profefonos and cypermethrin was used leading to the deaths, say farmers. Even as the blame game continues, farmers say had it not been for bollworm attack they may have not used the killer spray at all.The profefonos-cypermethrin mixture is available in different brands. User manual of one of the brands with TOI recommends the pesticide's use against bollworm. Farmers largely use genetically modified Bt cotton. However, since last three years at least, farmers have been complaining of even the Bt crop being affected by bollworm attacks.Farmers and activists say bollworm had now developed resistance against the Bt crop. Experts in government's Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) say there can also be other reasons for the pest attack.""In 2006, when BG II, the current version of Bt seeds, was introduced it was an effective protection against bollworms. In last three years even Bt crops are being infested with bollworm. This year it was worse due to which the intensity of sprays was increased,"" said Vijay Ingle, a farmer from Achalpur tehsil in Amravati, one of the affected districts. Ingle had bagged the state government award for achieving highest cotton yield.Nitin Khadse, a farmer from Jalka village in Yavatmal, the most affected district said, ""Even I used one of the brands of profefonos in my fields to get rid of bollworm. The infestation is seen since last 2-3 years only. We spray profefonos for bollworm. There are other pesticides for sucking pests and white fly. It has only added to sowing expenses."" Vijay Kankirad from Selodi in Yavatmal said he normally used profefonos on soyabean crop. Due to pink bollworm, it was also used on cotton this time, he said.Dealers maintain there was no major increase in profefonos sales this year while accepting that pink bollworm attack had increased. Farmers use a varied mix of pesticides. At times, it is their own formula, they said. According to dealers, careless use by farmers had led to accidents. A dealer requesting anonymity said farmers used a particular brand recommended for sugar cane hoping to get better results.This year climatic conditions increased the plant height to nearly six feet as against four normally. As the pumps were facing upwards during spraying, the contents also fell on workers' face leading to deaths, said a dealer.A senior officer in CICR said a large use of the unauthorized herbicide resistant Bt seed has also been seen lately. Since the variety has not been approved in India yet, there can be issues related to its quality. This may be one of the reasons for bollworm attack. Certain farmers extend their crop beyond December using irrigation. This gives a longer cycle to bollworm pest which can spread to other fields, said the source."

It was found that the board of directors had sanctioned huge loans to private and cooperative sugar mills in violation of rules, resulting in non-performing assets of Rs 1,070 crore. As per the Cooperative Societies Act, the probe was to be completed within two-and-ahalf years. Since the probe was not completed in time, the state government amended the Act in March 2017 to provide for more time for the probe. The government said the Act would be implemented with retrospective effect.A director moved the HC saying that while the two-anda-half year period ended on November 21, 2016, the government amended the law in March 2017. He said the law cannot be implemented with retrospective effect and that it should be set aside. A week before the law was amended, TOI had sought the CM's response on the probe being not completed. The CM had said a probe would be conducted against the inquiry officer. ""But no probe has been ordered against the inquiry officer,'' a senior bureaucrat told TOI. ""Two-and-ahalf years is sufficient to conduct a probe. He should have at least submitted an interim report,'' the bureaucrat said. When contacted, Pahinkar said, ""The government has granted an extension to conclude inquiry before June 30, 2018. The cross (examination) is in progress and once concluded, will be followed by oral arguments. Then report writing and orders is the job sequence before submission of report. I am hopeful to conclude the inquiry in time."""

However, Bishoi said that, he has nothing to do with the case.Police are doing forensic analysis of the Call Data Records (CDR) of all the seven accused. ""The records show that several officers were in contact with the accused,"" said a police officer. The police have already filed the chargesheet in the case in August this year. TOI was first to report in its August 25 edition that 21 government officials were in touch with the accused for favourable transfers. The fraudsters had also told the owner of a sugar factory in Solapur that they could obtain environment clearance certificate from the Union government through Ravindra Yadav, another accused who posed as member of the censor board.A charitable trust had also approached another accused, Kishore Mali, to get a sum of Rs 20 crore released from a bank. Two cheques for Rs 5 crore issued by the trust were recovered from Mali.

Fadnavis also said that government would be filing cases under Section 304 of the IPC which amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.Pesticide poisoning toll in the region climbed to 35 after Chandrapur administration confirmed the death of a 23-year-old farmer from Babapur village in Rajrua. He had passed away a few weeks back. However, the cause was confirmed on Tuesday.All the deceased farmers had allegedly used a concoction of chemicals to get rid of pests that were threatening to destroy cotton crops. Sources said they were also not using protective gear as recommended by manufacturers.Fadnavis said a team headed by additional chief secretary (Home) Sudheer Srivastava is already investigating the issue. However, considering the multiple issues involved, the SIT too has been constituted.Officials say that the announcement of forming the SIT was in response to a public interest litigation (PTI) filed in the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court. The division bench of Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Swapna Joshi has sent notices state agriculture secretary, agriculture commissioner and Yavatmal collector directing them to file their replies before October 30.Fadnavis also said that it has come to light that most of these farm hands were using a newly introduced Chinese-made spraying pump which has no mechanism to regulate the flow of pesticide. ""We will ban use of these Chinese-made sprays,"" said Fadnavis.The state government has lodged an FIR against agro-chemical firm Gharda Chemicals in the wake of the pesticide-related deaths. It is also mulling to lodge a case against agro-chemical firm Syngenta, state agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said on Tuesday.""We have lodged a case of cheating and culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Gharda Chemicals. Its pesticide  'Police'  was among those used. It is not meant for the cotton crop but for sugar cane and it is meant to be released in the soil, not for spraying,"" he said. He said that the pesticide should not have been sold to dealers in the cotton belt.""FIR is also likely to be registered against Syngenta, which manufactures pesticide 'Polo',"" he said. The companies could not be contacted at the time of going to press.The government has also issued a show cause notice to the agriculture development officer of Yavatmal Zilla Parishad. He is likely to be suspended, sources said. The notice was issued after a government committee led by Srivastava found that several unlicensed shops were operating in Yavatmal district, officials said.Suraj Parkhi (23) was engaged in pesticide spraying work at Babapur village when his condition started deteriorating and he was rushed to Rajura rural hospital. He breathed his last while undergoing treatment a few weeks back. The body was sent to Chandrapur GMC for post mortem, which confirmed Parkhi's death due to indirect consumption of organophosphate based pesticide.No fresh casualties were reported from other parts of the region even though four new patients of pesticide poisoning were admitted to the Yavatmal GMC on Tuesday taking the number of patients undergoing treatment there to 24. The number of casualties from the district remained at 19 (11 deaths in GMCH and 8 in other hospitals) as no death was reported till filing of the report.Of the 24 patients in the GMC, 6 are in the ICU and the remaining 18 are in other wards. ""Of the 6 in the ICU, three are on ventilator support. Though their condition is critical, they are stable,"" informed head of the department of medicine Dr Baba Elke. Three patients were discharged today.At GMCH Akola, one person affected by pesticide was brought in on Tuesday taking the number of patients undergoing treatment there to 4. One of the four is in critical condition and is kept in the intensive care unit (ICU).Chandrapur resident deputy collector, Vaibhav Nawadkar, confirmed Parkhi's death due to pesticide poisoning. However, the data compiled by his office about the number of people from the district affected by pesticide poisoning does not match with that of the record of the Chandrapur GMCH.Nawadkar informed that reports submitted by tehsildars of all 15 tehsils in the district suggest that only 24 people were affected by pesticide poisoning. They include 17 from Warora tehsil, five from Bhadrawati and two from Bramhapuri tehsil. On the other hand, civil surgeon Dr Umesh Newade claimed that 33 patients were admitted to the GMC since September. Out of these, 28 patients belong to different tehsils in Chandrapur district, while the remaining five are from adjacent Yavatmal and Gadchiroli districts, he said. Dr Newade also informed that only eight persons are undergoing treatment at present while others have been discharged.Two of the pesticide affected persons remained on ventilator support at the Nagpur GMCH.Meanwhile, Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission (a state task force for agrarian crisis) chairman Kishore Tiwari chaired a meeting at the local Bachat Bhavan on Tuesday to review the progress of Mahatma Jyotiba Fuley Jeevandayi Yojana of the state government. According to Tiwari, the norms for availing the benefits under the scheme have been relaxed and now all pesticide poisoning affected persons would be given the benefits and 13 hospitals availing the scheme are enlisted to give the service and reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the kin of the affected persons.'We have also proposed to procure 12 more 108 ambulances in addition to the 23 available in the district to ensure prompt health care to the needy from the rural areas,"" said Tiwari.""I have talked to the principal secretary of medical education Sanjay Deshmukh to ensure that adequate stock of medicines will be made available in the GMCs so that no patient is forced to buy medicines from outside agencies,"" said Tiwari.Yavatmal police have booked 8 Krishi Kendras in the district under Section 304A of the IPC (causing death due to negligence not amounting to murder) and Section 29 (1) of the Insecticides Act, 1968. The administration has already cancelled the licences of 5 kendras while it has issued warning to a kendra."

Several people complained that over 10 houses in the area were on the verge of collapse.For the last two days, there have been intermittent showers across these districts. As the intensity of the rain was less farmers started work in many places, including Papanasam and Budalur block. Farmers have started plucking of Samba nursery for transplantation. Some have begun the work, said A K R Ravichandar, a farmer from Budalur.Farmers complained that due to change in weather, pest attack is prevalent in the nurseries.Farmers in Thanjavur and Papanasam also started transplanting work. Though it has been raining continuously, Thanjavur has so far received less than normal rain. The normal rain till November 6 ought to have been 243.4 mm. This year the rainfall recorded was 210.4 mm, which was 14 per cent less than the normal.In Tiruvarur district, above normal rainfall have been recorded up to November 6.

Around 81 huts have been damaged so far. During our visit to flood-affected areas, we asked owners if they have pattas. If yes, they are eligible to receive D2 lakh under the green house scheme. Those residing in government houses are not eligible to avail of the scheme, the Collector said. The Collector accompanied minister O S Manian on an inspection of flood relief work in Thalainayar and other areas.Rains give impetus to sugarcane cultivationTiruchy: The onset of monsoon has given fresh impetus to sugarcane cultivation. Farmers had been shifting to paddy, but because current conditions are expected to give a successful year for sugarcane, those who stopped cultivating the crop have gone back to it. Now fields cover 1,331 hectares instead of the earlier 1,000 hectares. Officials state the figure could rise to 3,000 hectares by December. In addition, special seedlings are being prepared on 450 hectares. S Murugesan, a sugarcane farmer from Tiruchy, said, I was cultivating sugarcane on five acres before switching to paddy. But since this seems to be a good monsoon and there is adequate water from the Cauvery, some of us are growing sugarcane. I am now growing the crop on three acres with two acres of paddy. The state has been providing D75,000 in subsidies on shade nets to grow seedlings.25,000 workers in Vedaranyam jobless as salt pans stop productionNagapattinam: Salt makers in Vedaranyam have stopped production due to transportation issues. Because of the halt, 25,000 workers have been rendered jobless in Vedaranyam. Salt pans in here cover an area of 10,000 acres. Though salt makers start production after February every year and complete it in September, untimely showers in February meant production commenced in March this year. V Senthil, secretary, Small Scale and Marginal Salt Manufacturers Association, said, From March to the first week of October, small-scale salt manufacturers produced about 1.5 lakh tonne of salt over 4,000 acres in Vedaranyam. Large companies operating over 6,000 acres have produced some two lakh tonne. Big companies have the necessary logistics like trucks, godowns and permanent employees to survive but small and marginal producers do not have the same facilities."

During the daylong camp, pregnant women were tested for haemoglobin, urine albumin and blood sugar levels, malaria, VDRL, HIV, etc.,"" said Dr BK Rajora , chief medical officer, Gurgaon.""Now, we will ensure that these women get proper medical attention for the rest of their pregnancy and even after the delivery. We will keep a check on their health conditions and will ensure that their deliveries take place at government hospital only, and not at home or any health centre,"" Rajora added.The tests were conducted under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) to identify women with high-risk pregnancy and ensure comprehensive antenatal care free of cost during the pregnancy.Health department sources said maternal mortality was a big problem in Gurgaon, where 42 maternal deaths were reported in 2016 alone. The weak health of mothers, in turn, affected the babies and around 900 infants lost their lives within a month of their birth in 2016.Further, around 30% of the infants (below one year) visiting government hospitals are suffering from deficiencies of vitamins and minerals, like iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin-A and B etc, which suggest deficiencies of one or more micronutrients in their mothers too."

It has also spawned a few dietary cousins including one that compels you to drink only vegetable juice and all this effort will make your insides squeaky clean.Whats bad for you? Everything. We are told that bread (the staff of life), salt (of the earth and worth it), sugar (hi honey) and milk (of human kindness) are foisted upon us by a gigantic conspiracy of the pharmaceutical industry, the egg and dairy industry and the meat and poultry mafias in conjunction with government connivance so that it is a win-win for all  except the consumer who is designated to keel over and become a statistic.We are all going to die. Right. There is no running away from that solitary reaper. And food is a happy element in our lives. But we are being so easily robbed of that joy.We are not stupid. Just as we know that smoking is bad for us we also know that processed meats cannot be good. We also know through sheer logic that taking in marbled red meats and oil soaked fast foods will supersize us. Nothing surprising there. If we overdo fried foods and alcohol and eat cream in its many wondrous forms it will clog our arteries.The scaremongers have based their findings, though, on American portions. The rest of the world eats sparingly in comparison. You know how much you need so if you ignore that simple factor there will be a price to pay. The mountain of French fries, the dozen bacon rashers, salami, pastrami, etc in one serving are about the same as what we would consume as mere mortals in a week. Ergo, the 18% risk is whittled down to a little over 2%.By the same token it is impossible to scientifically evaluate how a single food damages the human body. No one has done any authoritative study with a dedicated group of volunteers eating only, shall we say, cheese and figured out how it affects them as compared to a group being given placebos. Therefore the premise itself is flawed.The 2% risk factor is further reduced by the difference between a daily rational intake and an infrequent devouring of any of these dining table adversaries. If i eat a few rashers on a holiday morning or fry an egg or two on toast to go with them, the skies will not fall. The odds would fall to half which is 1%.There is no gainsaying the fact that spurious foodstuffs and lack of a common yardstick for quality and safety contribute to the illnesses listed in these current denouncements. If you stop eating plump chickens which are hormonally enhanced that makes sense. If you scratch off dyed fruits and vegetable or animal products treated with antibiotics to be made meatier and go organic no one would accuse you of being a fraidy cat.The same measure can be applied to anything that is suspect. Add to this protective decision an up in hygiene so that your cast-iron stomach is not tested because you are avoiding contaminated roadside foods, stale edibles and post sell-by products and you reduce your risk to 0.5%. Add to that an awareness of spurious colourings, injected fruits and other imaginative food adulterations and the risk dwindles even more.Add to the fraction of the percentage the grimness and joylessness of life without your culinary delights and what is left to enjoy. For years fad diets wrecked happiness and tossed us on this sea of misery. Now, it is being fine tuned with very little scientific fact to make us wallow in calorific guilt. The stress of denial is tangible.In What the Health the visuals compare eggs to smoking five cigarettes and milk and dairy to pure poison. The trick lies not in scare stories and clever manipulations of the mind but in moderate and judicious consumption.You will live longer and be happier for it."

5a1734fb9855b76bf13efeb4,Look at who the Niti Aayog is consulting,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/staying-alive/look-at-who-the-niti-aayog-is-consulting/,2017-10-26,"International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) is globally known for being a front organisation for food companies, soft drink companies and agrochemical manufacturers. There have been several reports on how ILSI has funded studies to oppose or dilute public health measures involving regulation of the food industry to tackle obesity. ILSIs dubious role in influencing policy both at the level of national governments and at the global level is nothing new.A WHO report as far back as 2000 had identified ILSI as an example of industrys involvement and funding of seemingly unbiased scientific groups to manipulate political and scientific debate on health and tobacco control. In 2003, yet another report of an independent consultant of WHO on how the food industry had infiltrated the organisation pointed out: One industry-led organisation, International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), has positioned its experts and expertise across the whole spectrum of food and tobacco policies: at conferences, on FAO/WHO food policy committees and within WHO, and with monographs, journals and technical briefs.Despite such publicly available details on the nature of ILSI, which claims to be an independent scientific body, it is being involved in evolving a policy on nutrition in India. One would have thought the government would do a background check on those it involved to safeguard against vested interests hijacking public policy.At the first meeting of the Working Group on Nutrition constituted by the Niti Aayog, on October 16, participants were asked to introduce themselves and declare if they had any conflicts of interest (verbally, not in writing, which is a departure from the global norm). Interestingly, barring the founder of Healthkart, which sells nutritional supplements, the rest claimed they had no conflict of interest. Those making this claim included ILSI executive director Rekha Sinha and Dr B Sesikeran, former director of the National Institute of Nutrition, who is currently on ILSIs board of trustees and is a member of the Nestle Nutrition Advisory Council.History of ILSIILSI was founded in 1978 by Dr Alex Malaspina, a long-time Coca-Cola Scientific and Regulatory Affairs leader, according to the Coca-Cola website, which goes on to say that he started ILSI to spearhead an effort to unite the food industry. It is funded by multinational food and agrochemical companies, including Coca-Cola, General Mills, Hersheys, Kelloggs, Kraft Foods and Monsanto. ILSI, started with an endowment of $22 million with the support of Coca Cola senior leaders, today has over 15 regional branches that influence food safety and nutrition science in various regions of the world.ILSI-Indias board of trustees is dominated by food and beverage companies  seven of 13 members are from the industry or linked to it (Mondelez, Mars, Abbott, Ajinomoto, Hindustan Unilever and Nestle) and the treasurer is Sunil Adsule of Coca-Cola India.January 2003 The Guardian cited a report by Norbert Hirschhorn, an independent consultant to the WHO, detailing how ILSI had spread its influence across national and global food policy fora. Hirschorns report stated that there was reasonable suspicion that undue influence was exerted on specific WHO/FAO food policies dealing with dietary guidelines, pesticide use, additives, trans-fatty acids and sugar. The easy movement of experts  toxicologists in particular  between private firms, universities, tobacco and food industries and international agencies creates conditions for conflict of interest, stated the report.December 2016 The New York Times (NYT) reported on how ILSI had funded a study to review guidelines on sugar intake. This review questioned the WHOs 2015 guidelines recommending that adults and children cut down their sugar intake and larger public health measures that called for a reduction of sugar, especially in processed food. Critics pointed out that this review was part of the food industry efforts to shape global policy and guidelines on nutrition by funding or supporting academics who questioned the role of junk food and sugary drinks in causing obesity, Type 2 diabetes and consequent health problems.April 2017 ILSI had a special consultative status with the WHO, and in January 2006 despite complaints about ILSI members vested interest in public health matters, the WHO executive board had decided to maintain official relations. This had allowed it to attend WHO governing body meetings but excluded any collaboration by ILSI on normative activities, defined as setting microbiological or chemical standards for food and water. But ILSI is absent from the list of non-state actors (NGOs) in official relations with the WHO decided at the 140th session of the executive board in January 2017. WHOs policy on conflict of interest excludes those experts who have done consultancy/work or have directly, and in their personal capacity, received research grants from industry in relation to compounds on the JMPRs agenda or having other forms of economic relations that may undermine their neutrality.Of course, the food corporations that fund ILSIs science are known to have used other fronts as well. For instance, in August 2015 NYT laid bare how Coca Cola had funded scientists to push the idea of energy balance or the need to offset calorie intake with physical activity, to deflect negative attention over its sugary drinks. Coke had provided financial and logistical support to a non-profit called the Global Energy Balance Network, which promoted the argument that weight-conscious Americans are overly fixated on how much they eat and drink while not paying enough attention to exercise. Marion Nestle, the author of the book Soda Politics and a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, was quoted as saying: The Global Energy Balance Network is nothing but a front group for Coca-Cola. Coca-Colas agenda here is very clear: Get these researchers to confuse the science and deflect attention from dietary intake. GEBN was disbanded in December 2015 after detailed of Coca-Colas efforts to use the network to influence scientific research on sugary drinks surfaced.In September 2015, NYT reported that Cokes chief executive, Muhtar Kent, admitted that the company had spent almost $120 million since 2010 to pay for academic health research and for partnerships with major medical and community groups involved in curbing the obesity epidemic.Again, in June 2016, the Associated Press reported how a study funded by an association representing the makers of Butterfingers, Hershey and Skittles, essentially candy-makers, came up with the startling finding that children who ate candy tended to weigh less. One of the industrys most powerful tactics is the funding of nutrition research. It carries the weight of academic authority, becomes a part of scientific literature and generates headlines, stated the AP article.When industry funds nutritional researchAn article published in the journal PLOS Medicine in December 2013 stated that an analysis of beverage studies found that those funded by Coca-Cola, Pepsico, the American Beverage Association and the sugar industry were five times more likely to find no link between sugary drinks and weight gain than studies done by authors with no industry funding.Prof Nestle of NYU also wrote in 2016 that 156 of the 168 industry-funded studies that she reviewed showed favourable results for sponsors. She said that playing up nutritional perks had become a critical marketing tool in the competitive food industry.In spite of such abundant evidence of MNCs and their fronts like ILSI playing a dubious role in defeating or diluting regulation of the food, beverage and even tobacco industry, Niti Aayog has chosen to have ILSI in the working group on nutrition. Not only Niti Aayog but several ministries and top government bodies such as the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute for Nutrition seem to have no compunctions associating with ILSI."

The state government has set up a special investigation team to probe the deaths and lodged an FIR under the charges of `culpable homicide not amounting to murder' against agrochemical firm Gharda Chemicals.Another firm, Syngenta , also faces action.CM Devendra Fadnavis said a team headed by additional chief secretary (home) Sudhir Srivastava was inves tigating the deaths, but the SIT was constituted given ""the many sides to the issue"".Talking about the firms in question, state agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar said on Tuesday, ""Gharda's pesticide `Police' was among those used. It's not meant for cotton, but sugarcane, and it should be released under the soil, not sprayed."" ""We're going to lodge an FIR against Syngenta in connection with their pesticide `Polo',"" he added. The companies could not be contacted for comment at the time of going to press. Officials said a PIL filed before the Bombay high court could have prompted the SIT.The Srivastava committee, which has recommended the suspension of the Yavatmal agriculture development officer (ADO) and a ban on `Polo' and `Police', has raised the hackles of the agriculture department. Officials said the core reason for not spotting the problem, which was the failure of the district machinery, wasn't addressed, and banning the pesticides would be a problem since they were essential for sugarcane.The government has issued a showcause notice to the Yavatmal ADO after the Srivastava panel found that several unlicensed shops were operating in the district, officials said. Eight FIRs have also been filed against Krishi Kendra (agro input centre) proprietors in Yavatmal, and licences of five cancelled."

Telegraph picture A 35-year-old JAP-2 constable and two aides, including a college student, were arrested with drugs and illegal arms following an 8km chase after they snatched a woman's gold chain in Ranchi, the incident another blow to the force that was at the centre of a recent contrversy over liquor deaths. The arrest of Gorkha jawan Vinay Khatri, a police driver, near Ratu Chowk under Kotwali thana comes after spurious liquor sold from the JAP-1 campus in Doranda killed 13 people last month. Khatri's aides have been identified as Vishal Kumar (25), an unemployed youth from Doranda, and Anup Kumar (20), BA Part-I student of Gossner College. Besides the stolen chain, countrymade pistols, cartridges of Insas and AK-47 rifles and pouches of marijuana and brown sugar (adulterated heroin) were found on the trio. Kotwali thana OC S.N. Mandal said the hot chase by police, traffic cops and bystanders took place around 1pm. ""The chain was snatched while the woman was sitting inside her car near the Honda showroom. The accused were in a car too. As she raised an alarm, two passers-by chased the car on their bikes. They also dialled 100 and every thana was alerted,"" Mandal said. Traffic constables first attempted to intercept the car near the SSP's residence, but in vain as the accused sped towards Hotlips Chowk. ""From the Chowk, they reached Ratu Road roundabout, where alert traffic cops backed by police caught the trio,"" the OC said.

The duo on a bike had stolen the gold chain of advocate Raly Parinita Topno near Kantatoli Chowk under Lower Bazaar police station around 10.30am and were making a second snatching attempt when they were caught, said Doranda OC Abid Khan."
5a1739c39855b76bf13f011f,Reservation of Women should be above party politics,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/arise-awake-and-stop-not/reservation-of-women-should-be-above-party-politics/,2017-09-26,"Google Doodle honouring Indias first female scientist Asima Chatterjee, Sushma Swaraj the roaring lioness speaking on behest of India and on Indias foreign policy in UNGA, and Sonia Gandhi urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that the Womens Reservation Bill meets a logical conclusion.After decades of delay in the domain of women empowerment, 2017 has been a fast paced roller coaster ride, and the current government is keeping us on our toes in the hopes of seeing more rapid progress and development.If anybody delves into the history of India they would know that such slow progress was unwarranted and would find its roots deeply entrenched during the colonial period of British India. The British Empire didnt want the citizens of our nation rising to a respectable level. So our legal system barely budged as a matter of fact it retrograded, and our manner of living was purely medieval. Yet out of the prevalent evils of casteism, and female subjugation some women of our nation became leading pioneers and are globally acclaimed. Here, we name a few:1. Asima Chatterjee, a renowned Indian chemists 100th birthday was marked by Google with a Doodle on the 23rd of September. An organic chemist, Asima Chatterjee paved the way for Indian women in science and improved the odds of survival for patients with cancer, epilepsy, and malaria.2. A pioneering botanist and cytogeneticist, Janaki Ammal, born 1897, is credited with putting sweetness in Indias sugarcane varieties. There is even a flower named after her, a delicate bloom in pure white called Magnolia Kobus Janaki Ammal, only a few nurseries in Europe cultivate the variety.3. Born in 1865 in an extremely orthodox Brahmin family in Maharashtra, a 9 year old girl got married to a widower who was almost thrice her age. The girl later on became the first Indian woman to qualify as a doctor. Her name was Anandibai and her husbands name was Gopalrao Joshi. Gopalrao, was determined to educate his wife when she expressed her wish to study medicine at the age of 14. Unfortunately, before she couldnt practice medicine as she left her heavenly abode at the age of 22.4. Dr Rukhmabai has the honour of being the first practicing lady doctor of India. Her journey was not an easy one, she was married at the age of 11, child bride Rukhmabai Bhikaji contested her husbands claim to conjugal rights in an iconic court case that led to the passage of the Age of Consent Act in 1891. In 1888 despite the out-of-court settlement, this case became a landmark in colonial India for raising issues of age, consent and choice for women in marriage. Rukhmabai was ostracized by society, but she didnt let this affect her ambition of being a doctor. She finished her studies and obtained a position as Chief Medical Officer in Surat. She never married again and remained active in social reform till her death in 1955 at the age of 91.Though Dr. Rukhmabais case might have played a pivotal role in the Age of Consent Act, the age limit was only increased from 10 years to 12 years. India is still fighting the confusing interloped situation of child marriage and the Age of Consent, where logic dictates justice albeit practice otherwise. In the fight for proper judicial and legislative rights of women, Sonia Gandhi wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 20 September, 2017, urging him to take advantage of the majority BJP members in Lok Sabha to pass the Womens Reservation Bill. The womens Reservation Bill plans for 33% reservation of women in the Lok Sabha and all state legislative assemblies, yet Panchayati Raj and Civil Bodies already have this reservation for women. If passed, India can be acknowledged as a leading global figure in political and participation equality of women. It can help surpass the few number of women that we hold dear as leading figures or pioneers who work so hard to break the glass ceiling, and provide the nation with many more women defying the patriarchal assigned roles.Currently the global average for Women in Parliament is 22.4%, India stands at a meager 12%. On a global scale we rank 103rd from a list of 140 countries, and in Asia we rank 13th out of 18 countries. Its about time that we quit hiding behind the curtain that India is one of the youngest nations in the world. After 70 years of Independence, a rapidly growing nation, and the vision of our founding fathers its time to take action and not hide behind a veil of excuses.As shown by the stories of the pioneering scientist women of India reservation is not a necessity, but it is a good set up. The women scientist pioneers of India were fortunate to have husbands, or fathers support them at a time when women were prone to child marriage and pushed to bear children. The manner in which they broke the chains of society was with the help of the chain makers of society, the men in their lives. Its time for us all to stand up and give our women a helping hand, in the form of a mother, father, sister, and brother."

Sakshi loves to bake and she used to treat us with delicacies every now and then. There used to be cupcake, brownies and the like at our house and we would thulp it in no minute. One day she gave us these choco covered Oreos and we went gaga over it. Thats when we decided we have to make this our business, shares an excited Vikas.Belonging to a family of businessmen, the idea to present something out-of-the-box to Chennaites was ingrained in them. We had already imagined how we wanted it to roll out. Our initial idea was to start off in December 2015, but the floods hit. We waited for an appropriate time and started out two days ahead of Valentines Day, he says.OCD has packs of nine cookies neatly stacked in a sea-blue box. The cookies are heavily coated with milk chocolate, dark chocolate or white chocolate sauces. One cookie is good to give you the much needed sugar rush. In India, we have three main flavours of Oreos  the original, chocolate and strawberry. We have the gold ones now, but we stuck to the three flavours, he adds. The nine cookies are used in permutation and combination with the three sauces.The process might seem simple now, but it was not so earlier, as they were self-taught cooks. During the first few deliveries, we noticed that the coating used to melt off. We worked on it and realised the chocolate needs to melt at the right temperature; thats what does the trick, he avers.In countries abroad, Oreos come in a variety of different flavours, but they are not available in India. Vikas and Vishal also worked out their own flavours which were limited edition. One was peanut butter and the other was mint Oreos. We prepared the filling ourselves. This became a hit and we plan to launch it as a regular soon, he shares.Sakshi now works with an MNC and it is up to the boys to run the business. Vikas mans the kitchen and produces the delicacies. Their customer base is largely youngsters and the rush is clearly visible during festivals like Holi, Diwali and Raksha Bandhan, for which the sauces get a dash of colour. Apart from these we get heavy orders for birthdays...especially September. So many people are born in that month! laughs Vikas.Obviously there is no healthier way to consume Oreos but there is always room for additions. Our friends in other countries are willing to help us with different flavours. We might do a trial and then decide, he adds. But for now they are already preparing to meet the demands during the Christmas season in December. We are looking to launch something new this December and we are sure Chennai is going to love it, says Vikas without disclosing much. With constant prodding he lets us in on a tiny, yet obvious, detail. The base will definitely be Oreos.OCD cookies are priced at `150 plus delivery charges available on order and can be customised.

He was talking to reporters at Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district. He also urged the government to not stop with issuing mere statements by the CM, but curb the usury menace in the state.He attributed poor implementation of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2003, by the government as reason behind the family of four ending their lives by self-immolation at Tirunelveli collectorate last Monday. Emphasising the need to regulate the money lending trade, Ramakrishnan said that the government should also make it possible for the common man to get loans from banks and cooperative societies at ease.Ramakrishnan said that Tamil Nadu Vivasayegal Sangam of CPM will organise a march against usury from Tenkasi to Tirunelveli on November 1 (Wednesday). He also pressed for CBI probe into the granite scam in the state.Coming down heavily against the Central government for allegedly trying to disturb the public distribution system (PDS) by increasing the price of sugar in PDS shops with a sharp drop in subsidy for the sweet commodity, the CPM secretary also strongly criticised the state for going hand in glow with the Centre without opposing it.Stating that the TN government has miserably failed in curtailing dengue, the CPM secretary added that this is the reason for the government for hiding the actual number of dengue deaths.

Once formalized, the MSP norm will have to be followed by even private dairies, which account for 60% of the milk procurement in the state.At present, the procurement rates fixed by the government are only for state-run and cooperative dairies. Over the years, the state-owned and -run dairies have systematically reduced procurement, and now they buy 0.5% of the total milk, while cooperatives control 39.5% of the market.""There are private brands selling cow milk for Rs 90 per litre but the farmer gets Rs 17-18 per litre. We cannot tell the brands at what rate they should sell that is their business model. But we can regulate the rates the farmer gets,"" Mahadev Jankar , minister for dairy development, animal husbandry and fisheries development, told TOI. ""The Act will allow the state to fix an MSP. The MSP will be finalized keeping in mind the 70:30 profit-sharing ratio on the lines of the sugarcane industrywhere 70% is for the farmer and 30% for the milk processor and middlemen,"" he added. The bill is likely to be tabled in the state legislature in December.Officials working on the legislation said milk is covered under the central Essential Commodities Act, and it has a provision for the states to enact state level legislations to set an MSP. The state has been asking farmers to rear milk-producing animals to supplement their loss-making agriculture-based income. The farmers, in turn, have been demanding that the state fix MSP for milk like it does for nearly 18 crops.""The Act will provide for setting up a regulatory committee to review the supply-demand situation and fix an MSP,"" said a senior official.The move comes after the June 1 state-wide agitation by farmers. One of their main demands was increase in procurement rates for milk. A farmer gets Rs 27 for a litre of cow milk, with 3.5 measures of fat and 8.5 measures of solids not fat (SNF). For buffalo milk, the government has prescribed a price of Rs 36 per litre. ""Many co-operatives don't follow even these rates. Since the direct procurement by government is negligible, farmers are left at the mercy of these buyers and we are aiming to regulate that,"" said an official.He also said that any failure to follow the MSP will attract penalties. An estimated 121 lakh litres of milk is procured daily across the state. Mumbai's daily requirement is 80 lakh litresthis is just packaged milk, loose milk is not accounted for."

The operator has to make several declarations in the form, including the version of software used in the machine and whether theres provision for auxiliary fitting or computer interface in the set-up.The circular will be applicable for all units that will be calibrated after November 15. Vendors [of the software and other parts of the machine] will also have to make a declaration of accuracy, Gupta said, adding that the particulars in the declarations will be scrutinised during the machines annual audit.Under the current practice, after a weighbridge is installed, its calibration is checked by using authorised weights. The operator is then issued a certificate after this verification process. Again, during the annual audit, the weights are used to check the machines calibration. The old practice is similar to the audit process applied at petrol pumps earlier. But the petrol pump scam brought to notice the possibility of manipulation of the digital machine, Gupta said. Unless every component of digital weighbridges is thoroughly checked, it will be difficult to ascertain if it has been rigged.For the 8,300 weighbridges already in operation, sources said the LMD would issue a circular next week to bring them under a similar declaration and audit regime. To begin with, weighbridges at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets, sugarcane markets and cotton gins would be brought under the ambit of the circular. These are the places where the bulk of farmers produce in the state is weighed and sold. It is extremely important to rule out manipulation of weighbridges as it has direct bearing on rural economy, Gupta said.Many of these weighbridges have got licences decades ago, and the switch to digital systems has been made without any authority authenticating the components used in them. Considering that every day thousands of trucks carrying farm products are weighed at these places, a few kilograms of manipulation in each truck would mean a colossal gain to the traders and middlemen, at the peril of the farmers, Gupta said."

Acting on a tip-off, excise officials raided a sugarcane field near Banjaria village under the jurisdiction of Kathiya police station in Muzaffarpur on Saturday evening and seized over 96 cartons of Haryana-made alcohol. It was stored to be supplied to Muzaffarpur, Sitamarhi and East Champaran districts. Muzaffarpur excise superintendent Dinbandhu said the smugglers managed to escape. The seized alcohol was estimated to be worth over Rs 50 lakh. Sources said Baleshwar Rai, who was wanted by the police in connection with a number of cases related to violation of provisions of the prohibition law, had booked the consignment. The excise superintendent said Baleshwar was absconding. ""Raids were carried out to nab Baleshwar, a liquor don, but he fled,"" he said, adding that one Anil Rai, a resident of Muzaffarpur, was arrested in a separate raid. In Begusarai, a team attached to Nimachandpura police station spotted an abandoned truck on Ajhaur-Taraiya road early on Sunday. During its search, over 350 cartons of alcohol made in Punjab were found. The truck, bearing a registration number of Nagaland, was parked near Karubabasthan in Begusarai district. ""It seems the consignment was to be delivered in nearby villages for consumption. But the police seized the consignment before its delivery,"" said a senior police officer. Begusarai superintendent of police Aditya Kumar said the station house officer of Nimachandpura police station had been directed to ascertain the identity of the alcohol supplier. The truck has been seized and a case lodged with the police station concerned in this connection. In another crackdown, a Sitamarhi police team arrested a suspected bootlegger, Vijay Kumar, and seized over 50 cartons of alcohol from his house in Sitamarhi town on Sunday. The raiding team later recovered some more cartons during a raid at his relative Mukesh Kumar's house. The police have intensified operation to arrest Mukesh. Statistics available with the police headquarters said over 71,400 people have been arrested and 14.25 lakh litres of both Indian-made foreign liquor and country liquor from different parts of the state in the past year. According to additional director-general (headquarters) S.K. Singhal, 408 private buildings and 83 commercial buildings were locked up for violating the prohibition law. In addition, 2,422 two-wheelers and 1,006 four-wheelers were also seized, he added. Singhal pointed out that action was initiated against 50 policemen, including four sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors and 46 constable rank. Eighteen of these policemen have been dismissed from service. Departmental proceedings were initiated against 24 police personnel, who failed to enforce the law effectively in the areas falling under their jurisdiction."
5a5221069855b770e0374c4b,Day care opens for elderly,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171009/jsp/bihar/story_176874.jsp,2017-10-09,"Senior citizens who feel lonely and insecure now have some reason to rejoice, as the city now has a day care centre for the elderly. Around 150 senior citizens have registered with Purodhalaya, the day care centre started by non-government organisation Health Line on September 5. Senior citizens don't have to spend a paisa for a three-room furnished accommodation where they can spend time with other senior citizens every day from 9.30am to 5.30pm. The day care centre not only provides entertainment but also conducts basic medical tests - such as blood sugar and blood pressure - for free on the elderly. ""We want to cater to senior citizens who feel lonely and are left with no choice than to be confined to their homes,"" said Avadhesh Kumar, secretary of Health Line. ""We have games like carrom, chess and cards to keep them engaged. There is a television set and we also keep newspapers. ""Elderly people associated with the centre are also connected through a Whatsapp group where they share jokes,"" he added. ""The urge to meet like-minded people and the intent to do something constructive is strong among the elderly. A day care centre is definitely a solution to the problem."" He added that the centre has people from different walks of life, like a retired teacher, government employees and even businessmen. ""Though around 150 people have registered, only around 25-30 people are visiting it periodically. We want more awareness to be created so that more elderly people take advantage of the facility,"" Avadhesh said. He said the NGO was also planning to start routine check-up of senior citizens on a fortnightly basis. ""We have already written to the district administration in this regard."" N.K. Mishra, a retired zoology teacher at Patna Science College who visits the centre, said it has helped dispel his loneliness. ""After having worked tirelessly for 25-30 years, it is difficult for many people to get accustomed to retired life,"" Mishra said. ""One can be happy being surrounded by grandchildren, but one cannot confide in them because of the age and generation gap. But such day-care centres provide the perfect respite."" He, however, said that people running the day care centre need to also analyse the aspirations of the elderly, so that they can plan activities accordingly. ""I think the centre still lacks a stimulating factor for people like me. It could do well to check the hobbies of the elderly. It can organise some classes or discussions accordingly,"" Mishra said. R.K. Sinha, another senior citizen, hailed the initiative. ""People from different walks of life have joined the centre. One member is like a laughter guru. He has us in splits all the time with his wisecracks. It's fun visiting the centre,"" he said."

The licence to sell local liquor could be cancelled if majority women of a particular village passed a resolution against it, the Sena noted, wondering whether Mahajan was aware of such a movement.""You (Mahajan) may not be able to talk against liquor because of its heavy revenue generation (for the state) but (the minister) should avoid giving out such marketing tips,"" the Sena said.""It seems that Mahajan himself is charged up to increase the sale of liquor, which could be because of dropping revenue figures,"" it said.The Sena also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulating Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for the decision to prohibit consumption, stocking and sale of liquor in his state.The ruling alliance partner said it was thankful to the Maharashtra government for not having a ministry for cemetery.If Mahajan headed such a ministry, he might have issued an advisory to increase deaths to boost the sale of items required for last rites, the Sena quipped.Mahajan had said at the event in Nandurbar, ""As I was discussing the mill's issues with the management, I came to know that liquor sales are not picking up. I visited some of the major producers of liquor brands having names such as 'Bhingri', 'Bobby' and 'Julie', whereas this mill's brand name is 'Maharaja', how will it work."" A video of his speech was uploaded on YouTube.""I suggest you change the name to 'Maharani', and see how sales shoot up. This is happening everywhere. Even (chewing) tobacco brand names are like that, for example 'Kamal', 'Vimal', 'Suman' and so on,"" the minister said.He then said, ""I am not insisting on changing the name, but it is my suggestion. You may try it."""

5a5227e89855b770e0374e08,Drought remedy: trip to Japan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171008/jsp/nation/story_176796.jsp,2017-10-08,"Shivraj Singh Chouhan Bhopal, Oct. 7: As Madhya Pradesh reels under drought with farmer protests erupting everywhere, its lawmakers have united across party lines to jump to the rescue. They are planning a foreign trip for themselves - to study agriculture. At a meeting of the state chapter of the India Parliamentary Group on Wednesday, most MLAs suggested a joint tour of China and Japan. Perhaps mindful of his role as an Opposition leader, Congress member Jaivardhan Singh, son of party senior Digvijaya Singh, voted for Israel and Jordan instead. Some BJP members favoured the tourist hotspots of Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, the last of them a city state with limited scope for agriculture, an MLA who was present told The Telegraph. When state finance minister Jayant Mallaya suggested Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries, highlighting the lower cost of travel, a sullen silence greeted the proposal. Sensing the mood, Speaker Sitasaran Sharma ruled that a sub-committee would be formed to decide the destination, expenses and logistics. The tour has tentatively been scheduled for the year-end and is expected to be of two weeks, with a group of about 30 MLAs picked across parties in proportion to their strength. Anand Rai, a rights activist, wondered: ""What do the MLAs hope to learn from a study tour of Japan, China, Israel, Jordan or Singapore, whose farming practices, technology, crop patterns and laws are a world apart from those in Madhya Pradesh?"" In 2011, a team of some 30 MLAs from the state had toured America with stopovers in France, Greece, Spain and Switzerland - to study agriculture. Most of them had taken their spouses along, apparently paying about Rs 60,000 each towards their air tickets. Apart from that, each legislator is believed to have paid Rs 2 lakh for his or her own trip, covering a percentage of the total expenses. Most state Assemblies, including that of Madhya Pradesh, are affiliated to the India Parliamentary Group, an autonomous body that serves as a link between Parliament and its foreign counterparts. The MLAs' foreign trips as part of the group's programmes are generally funded through contributions from the state government, the India Parliamentary Group and the legislators themselves. Sometimes, the local hospitality is borne by the host country. The MLAs have lunches and dinners thrown in their honour by the Indian missions and NRI forums. Last year, 17 MLAs from Uttar Pradesh had visited Japan, Australia and New Zealand on an 18-day ""study tour"". Although the trip was partly funded by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the MLAs picked a destination - Japan - outside the Commonwealth. In 2013, a group of MLAs from Karnataka had toured Brazil, Argentina and Peru. A private tour operator had planned the itinerary for the 16-day-15-night trip, which took in tourist paradises such as Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Iguassu, Lima, Cusco and Buenos Aires, with a stopover at Dubai thrown in. The MLAs feasted their eyes on the Sugarloaf Mountain, Corcovado and Tijuca and the wondrous harbour they enclosed. They experienced the ""exuberant ecosystems of Rio's tropical urban jungle"" and halted at Manaus to absorb the rhythms of Samba, Tango and Paraguayan music. On their return, one member of the delegation said: ""We learnt of poverty and how people here must open up."""

Tobacco products are sold only because they are named after women. If you feel that liquor products should be sold on top priority, instead of Maharaja, they should be named as Maharani.However, after facing an angry backlash from womens rights activists and opposition parties for suggesting that liquor brands be named after females to boost sales, Mahajan tendered an unconditional apology on Monday for his remarks.Speaking to newspersons at his official residence in Mumbai, Mahajan said I attended Satpuda Sugar factory function at Shahada on Sunday where the person who spoke before me raised the issue of liquor sale not getting a boost.

The committee comprises industries minister Satish Mahana, urban development minister Suresh Khanna and minister of state for industry and sugar mills Suresh Rana. The committee has held many meetings with the builders to expedite delivery.On September 12, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities to deliver 50,000 flats in three months. However, builders are yet to expedite delivery and offer relief to homebuyers.The government wants builders to expedite delivery of flats to provide relief to homebuyers. If the builders do not deliver or solve buyers issues as per their promised schedule, we will initiate legal action against them. The committee made it clear that whoever fails to deliver is bound to face stringent action, said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Of 50,000 flats,12,500 flats are to be delivered in Noida, 27,500 in Greater Noida and 10,000 in areas under the Yamuna Expressway authority.Now, the committee has instructed the builders to deliver flats by December-end to evade action. The authorities are trying to help builders in delivering flats to benefit buyers.There are 31 projects for which occupancy certificates (OC) are about to be issued. It will help around 20,000 buyers in getting delivery, provided the builders complete all formalities related to OC application. We will meet them on November 15 to resolve minor issues and expedite delivery, said Debasish Panda, CEO of the Greater Noida authority.The builders will be able to deliver flats faster if the UP government further relaxes the process of issuance of OCs. For example, the authorities should start issuing OC to a ready building without asking for land dues at this stage. And once the OC is issued, the authority can recover land dues per flat at the time of registration. If the government supports the builders, delivery will happen quickly, said Getambar Anand, CMD, ATS Builders, and president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India."

In the past as well, the authority board took decisions to resolve such cases but it could not be executed. Now, we will look into this issue on a case-to-case basis, said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.In Noida, there are around 10 big housing projects for which interest waiver for the period has been sought. The realtors alleged that they failed to get possession of the land on time due to ongoing cases.Many builders failed to finish their housing projects as per the scheduled deadline because farmers had challenged the land acquisition by the respective authorities and filed pleas in the Allahabad high court and the Supreme Court.The case between the Noida authority and farmers pertaining to group housing land took several years to be resolved. In some cases, the cases dragged on for three-four years. During this period, builders were forced to suspend construction at the site due to high court and Supreme Court orders.The builders were alloted group housing land against payment to be made in instalments. If they defaulted on payment, they had to pay 11%-14% interest on land dues. The builders argued that since their realty projects got affected due to the land dispute between the government and the farmers, the interest must be waived off.In comparison to Noida, many more projects in Greater Noida were stuck due to litigation. Around 30 builders are claiming interest waiver on the basis that their work was disrupted.We have a committee that is looking into such cases and proposals submitted by builders for a waiver, said Debasish Panda, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.Builders said that if the interest waiver is given, it will help them resolve issues related to flat delivery.The government must look into the cases where construction was disrupted due to court orders in response to farmers applications. Because in these cases, builders were not at fault, said Amit Modi, vice-president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (western UP) and director of ABA Corp.Six projects of Amrapali Group in Greater Noida West and two in Noida were caught up in litigation and thereby, construction work was disrupted. The builder is demanding an interest waiver for the period when work was affected due to litigation.If the authorities give us interest waiver for the period when work was halted due to the dispute between the farmers and the authorities, our projects will be benefited. We are hopeful of delivering around 30,000 flats and providing relief to homebuyers if the interest waiver is provided. Not only Amrapali, but other builders will also be immensely benefited, said Shiv Priya, director, Amrapali Group."
5a522dc59855b770e03750a2,Travel Special: Celebrating fire,http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/uycQ6CGa7Mb88onwrqiiSK/Travel-Special-Celebrating-fire.html,2017-11-10,"In Regla de Och, an Afro-Cuban religion rooted in West African cosmology, religious dancers and drummers bring the orishasgodsto life through folkloric dance and ritual. In the Casa del Caribe, a religious dancer breathes fire while he dances and embodies Chang, the orisha of fire, thunder, and dance. Photographs: Britt BaselThe drummers were slick with sweat as they played, their thrumming music a prayer. The valley filled with the intoxicating waves of percussive sound pouring from their sacred drums.Born half a world away in western Africa, brought to the Caribbean through slavery, and surviving against all odds, the rhythm they played resonated with the essence of dense forests, open savannahs, burning sun, and a world alive with spirits and gods.The elaborate beats danced against my skin and my chest. My heart, I was convinced, had altered its ordinary cadence to keep time with the percussionists. I was among thousands of people who had gathered in Santiago, the second largest city of the island nation of Cuba, for the 37th Annual Festival of the Caribbean (3-9 July), better known as the Fiesta del Fuegothe Celebration of Fire. Delegations from the West Indies and Latin America flock here each year to celebrate the identity, art and community of the Caribbean nations, and the dance and music that drives it all. The weeks festivities include parades, performances, conferences, workshops, magical-religious ceremonies, and live music late into the night.I felt right at home. Dance feeds me. Sometimes, I joke that I could abandon everything except my family to dedicate myself to dance. And little in my life has made my eyes shine like being enveloped by a warm Caribbean night and moving to the clavethe rhythmic backbone of most Afro-Cuban music. There was nowhere in the world I would rather be than at the Fiesta del Fuego, standing with the drummers at the base of a colossal metal sculpture of the Cimarrn, a monument dedicated to the rebel slaves, or cimarrons, of the Caribbean. The percussionists music was a tribute to the invincible spirit and African roots of the Caribbean that the Cimarrn represents. Cast in iron and bronze, heavily adorned with African religious symbols, and towering almost 10m high, the sculptures base is a ngangaa cauldronthat overflows with the power of life and death. From this ancestral cauldron the cimarron is born, and, along with the music, rises defiantly towards the sky.Crowded into the back of a massive Russian-issue truck, the Steel Band of Cobre leads the crowd in a parade toward the harbour in Santiago, where people gather for the grand finale of the Festival of the Caribbean, the burning of the devil.Decoding the CimarronThe statue commemorates every fugitive slave as the cimarron who escaped his captors. He broke the shackles that enslaved his brothers and sisters, kidnapped from their homelands in western Africa and brought by force to the Caribbean. The cimarron was, and is, fiercely freeasserting his freedom and resistance through Cubas dance, music and art.The essence of the cimarron, with his ethnic origins in the Yoruba, Carabal and Bantu cultures of West Africa, resounds in modern Caribbean culture. He is alive and well in Afro-Cuban dances, from rumba in the backstreet barrios (neighbourhoods) to the vivacious movements of the comparsa street dancers of Caribbean carnivals. For centuries, he has moved couples across dance floors with popular dances from danzn to Cuban salsa. He declares his freedom in the thundering feet and shoulders of people who take to the streets of Santiago to dance a conga. And he was there in el toquethe playing of drumsdedicated to him during this years Fiesta del Fuego.Sculpted in iron and bronze by Cuban artist Alberto Lescay, the Monumento al CimarronMonument to the Escaped Slavesoverlooks the picturesque valley of Cobre, a small town in the mountains above Santiago. According to the artist, the sculpture is not only an homage to Afro-Cuban culture and religion, but also a celebration of the freedom of the human spirit.Cubas original capital, Santiago de Cuba, was founded in 1515 when the Spaniards colonized the island. The city is a strategic port, framed by the imposing green peaks of the Sierra Maestra mountain range and the Caribbean Sea.The streets spill downward from the foothills of the Sierra towards the bay, between brightly painted homes built wall-to-wall. Weathered facades harbour stories of the individuals who lived behind them during the citys 500 years of rebellion, revolution and music.Its no coincidence that the cimarron is celebrated here. The determined and unbreakable Santiagueros have defended themselves from pirates in colonial times, fought for freedom from Spain in the 19th century, helped ignite the Cuban Revolution of 1953-59, and safeguarded the Afro-Caribbean culture of Cuba.Bara-Rumba, the folkloric dance group from Baracoa, Cuba, performs guaguanc for the crowd in Santiagos colonial central plaza, Parque Cespedes. During gatherings in Santiago, couples from the audience take to the stage with the percussionists to dance guaguanc in a light-hearted and flirtatious competition of skill and sass.A city aliveAs the festival took over the city, the already humming streets blossomed like the blanca mariposa, Cubas national flower, with musicians, artists, performers, and intellectuals from every corner of Cuba and the Caribbean. The sound of excited discussions about identity, gender and environmental challenges poured on to the streets through the doorways and windows of colonial buildings as I made my way through the mid-July tropical heat and air so thick I could almost drink it. With dusk, a gentler warmth wrapped the city in its arms, as the menagerie of cultures gathered for the evenings festivities. Musicians from Martinique and Venezuela met in inspired bouts of improvisation. Brazilian samba dancers amicably challenged Dominicans to follow their moves on stage. Cubans danced the timba with Virgin Islanders in lamp-lit streets. Music and art poured from every revolutionary crack, overcrowded patio and makeshift stage in the city.On the back patio of the Casa del Caribe, the Cuban ministry of cultures House of the Caribbean, I joined a sea of dancers moving jubilantly to upbeat congas, cowbells and horns.Just as the conga-cowbell pandemonium ended, a friendly hand tapped me on the shoulder. Eider Lpez, a long-time friend and choreographer for the Cuban folkloric dance group Bara-Rumba from nearby Baracoa, had found me in the rowdy crowd. Come practise guaguanc with us tomorrow morningwere staying at the school!Lpez gave me a warm hug before taking the stage with his troupe. Their tour de force show of eastern Cubas traditional dances, from the melodic chivalry of kirib to the whooshing skirts and sass of guaguanc, was the perfect finale to my evening.Time to danceEarly morning, the streets were empty aside from the occasional motorcycle taxi. Lpez met me at the entrance and led me past a cacophony of musical groups whose competing rhythms resounded through the halls. It was impossible to tell whether they were practising for an upcoming performance or were still in the throes of last nights party. I decided that both might be true.I hustled to match his pace as he led me to the third floor, past altars to Afro-Caribbean deities. I almost tripped on the concrete steps when we passed an old Haitian woman whose piercing gaze and lined face seemed to tell the stories of generations.Lpez pushed open the door to the dormitory, revealing the still-sleepy faces of the Bara-Rumba troupe. As I made the rounds, greeting everyone with a small kiss on the cheek in accordance with Cuban custom, Lpez and his twin brother, Hctor, plugged in a small speaker and started the music for our dance class. The tiny speaker emitted a feeble whimper that was lost in the overwhelming clamour of the musical groups. We exchanged a helpless look.Lisandro, one of the groups percussionists, winked and got up. He tapped a few shoulders, shuffled around a few chairs, and pulled the conga drums from their bags. Felix grabbed the clave, the two sticks used to create the beat by the same name. Suddenly, we had a full band playing for my dance class.Santiagos eclectic cultural heritage has shaped it into a mecca of Cuban music and dance. The city is especially known for son, the music and dance style that led to modern salsa, Afro-Cuban guaguanc and the citys traditional conga parades. The Parque Cspedes plaza is the heart and soul of the city.Divine momentBehind the dance and celebration, and the constant flow of rum and aguardientefire water, a liqueur made from sugarcane passed around in shared plastic cups, the festival is a tribute to African heritage that, against all odds, survived slavery and suppression. Now, fused with Catholicism and meticulously passed from generation to generation, these roots are the heartbeat driving the Caribbean. And the Fiesta del Fuego.Spectators gathered by the thousands in Parque Cespedes, the plaza in Santiagos colonial centre, shielding themselves from the late-afternoon sun with an explosion of colourful umbrellas. The ceremony began to unfold and driving drum rhythms erupted from the plaza into the crowded city streets.The If priest was at the epicentre of the Bant Yoruba drummers and dancers, kneeling in his flowing white robes as he used white chalk to methodically create sacred symbols of arrows and lines on the burning grey asphalt. With tobacco smoke, and then with clouds of aguardiente, forcefully expelled from his mouth, he blessed them. The explosive sound of the drums grew stronger.A young girl sheepishly stepped forward carrying an ornately decorated cows horn, the mpaka, charged in a sacred ceremony with all the good of the festival. The horn shone in the sun with red, white and blue beads forming the stripes and star of the Cuban flag.Looking like a tiny childrens doll with wide, sparkling eyes next to the imposing presence and commanding stature of the priest, the girl extended her arms upward, offering him the horn. Tenderness transformed his face as she gingerly placed the mpaka in his hands. I inhaled deeplyfor a moment, I had forgotten to breathe, and in that instant, the exchange had eclipsed even the rhythmic beat of the drums.The whole scene came back into focus as the drumming again increased in tempo for the consecration of the festival.The If priest now shifted his gaze to a man and woman by his side, officials from the government. With confident grace he reached forward, presenting them with the mpaka, wedding Afro-Cuban heritage with Cubas present.The spectators roared. The Desfile de Fuego, the Parade of Fire, began. Dance troupes began to sweep through the plaza.Dancing riverI made my way through the celebration, finding a spot in Parque Cespedes where each delegation stopped, offering their final tribute. One woman, dressed in a vibrant, flowing blue gown, assumed the spirit of the water deity Yemay, becoming the ocean in all its moods, from soft rolling waves to the ferocity of winter storms, with masterful movements of her skirt, feet, hips and arms. Some dancers exhaled fire in golden globes that erupted from their mouths. In a show of defiant cimarron-like invincibility, others rubbed burning torches against their bodies or ran the blade of a sharp sword against their flesh without drawing blood.When the watching crowd quickened, moving into the street and becoming the parade, a fellow photographer grabbed my arm. In thick Cuban-Spanish, he warned: The conga is starting. Go somewhere safe and protect your camera. Dany Hernndez, a friend and Cuban photographer, came to my rescue. He guided me through the crowd to a monstrous truck, a relic from the Russian army, that was waiting at the lower edge of the plaza. Towering 5m above the crowd, the back was packed with musicians and steelpans, drums made from metal barrels. The musicians were poised to play and lead the masses of people in a conga towards the bay and the final event of the festival: La Quema del Diablo, the Burning of the Devil.Hernndez and the driver exchanged a few words before we scrambled up the slick sides of the monstrous truck to perch on top of the cab, just above the band and far above the multitudes below. The diesel ignition grumbled and we started moving. The jovial, tinny sound of the steelpans filled the air. The conga began. A flowing river of radiant smiles followed us, dancing towards the harbour. With my feet carefully wedged into a grate for balance, camera in one hand and keeping beat with the other, I thought this is how the cimarron would have danced in celebration of his freedom.When we reached the edge of the bay, our dancing river met a sea of colourful shirts and dresses stretching as far as my eye could see. The entire city of Santiago had gathered, waiting for the conga to arrive and waiting for the burning of the devil. It was time.An enormous figure of el diablo, the devil dressed in burlap and painted with maniacally crooked eyes, loomed above the people. Someone struck the match and languid flames lapped up his sides, growing steadily in their ferocity. The Diablo began to disappear like a ghost into the fire, with the smoke consuming himthe symbol of evil and injusticepurifying the path to the future, and next years Celebration of Fire.***Cuban dancesCasino: Sometimes referred to as Cuban salsa, casino is a partner dance derived from the Cuban son that was originally performed in Havanas casinos before the revolution (1953-59).

Photos: Alamy.You cant go far in Cyprus without being reminded of its Hellenistic heritage. The eastern Mediterranean island country is packed to the gills with ancient mosaics, temples and necropolises. Legend has it that it was the playground of some of the best-known ancient Greek deities themselves. Aphroditethe goddess of love and beautywas born in Cyprus, and the island is peppered with sites associated with her. This includes cave pools where she used to bathe and the deserted ruins of temples where she was once venerated through song, dance and sacred sexual rites.Every third business, it seems, pays homage to Aphrodite. You can sip Keo Aphrodite wine made from the islands signature xynisteri grapes or tee off at the golf course at Aphrodite Hills resort. Even the countrys most popular brand of loukoumi, the saccharine sweet most commonly known outside Cyprus as Turkish delight, is produced by a company called Aphrodite Delights.Despite the goddess stronghold on local naming conventions and the ubiquity of mythological sites, a sizeable subset of the islands masses of European tourists has little interest in the countrys historic and mythological riches. For them, Cyprus is all about beaches. And booze.***The resort community of Ayia Napa is famous for its nightclubs.In 100m, turn right on alpha gamma iota alpha sigma mu alpha upsilon rho pi sigma, the narrator of Google Maps barks at me, opting to spell out every single street name, letter by letter, rather than taking a stab at the language. Ive been on the island for a fortnight, doing site inspections at popular tourist hotels, most of which have been of the sprawling, multi-pool, all-inclusive variety. Though Ive scrounged up a handful of minutes here and there to wander amidst the crumbling pre-Christian Tombs of the Kings and marvel at the intricate mosaic work in some of the islands old churches and monasteries, Ive seen far more tourists sunbathing poolside than I have wonders of the ancient world.The final leg of my journey takes me to Ayia Napa, a famous resort community on the far-eastern side of the island. Ayia Napa gets its name from a 16th century monastery situated smack in the middle of the city centre, but these days its better known for nightclubs that stay open well past sunrise than it is for monastic life. Much of this beachfront towns popularity followed the Turkish invasion of 1974, which effectively divided the island into north and south and displaced a couple of hundred thousand Cypriots of both Greek and Turkish extraction. The Turkish military took with it what was previously the hub of sea-and-sun tourism on Cyprus, the resort community of Varosha, just north of Ayia Napa. Today, Varosha is in ruins and closed to the public. Most tourists only witness its powdery white beaches and shells of high-rise resorts from a distant viewpoint, a stop-off on the popular Red Bus Divided Line Tour that ferries a couple of dozen foreign tourists through the UN Buffer Zone and into the foreboding Turkish North every day.In Ayia Napa, most of my fellow foreigners seem oblivious to the fact that they are partying and tanning just a few miles south of an invaded ghost town. During the day, the turquoise waters of hot spots such as Nissi Beach are speckled with the bobbing heads of overseas sun-worshippers. Come sunset, the action moves to the strip, a neon-lit expanse of watering holes, American fast food restaurants, late night pharmacies, and olive oil dealers. Here, sozzled 20-somethings congregate on large outdoor terraces, puffing on flavoured sheesha and belting out unabashedly off-key karaoke renditions of Pretty Woman. Later, theyll move the party over to one of the citys world-famous nightspots, such as the multiroom Castle Club or the after-hours River Reggae. Theres no talk of occupied Cyprus, no mention of ancient Greek goddesses or history. People are here to party.Life is about having fun, a British waiter at my hotels restaurant tells me that evening with a wink, before imploring me to join him and his friends on a late-night traipse around Ayia Napas nightlife hot spots. I decline. As much as I am tempted by promises of free-flowing booze and sunrise foam-parties, Ive got a long drive to Paphos the next day, where Ill board a plane back to the grisaille of London. And I have one spot left to visit before I leave.***The sea caves of Ayia Napa are a major tourist attraction.Aphrodites Rock, as its called in English, sits just off a sandy beach on the old coastal highway, a convenient 15-minute drive east of Paphos Airport. I leave my car at a tourist complex across the road, complete with its own gift shop and pay showers. I dont want to leave the island without paying my respects to the goddess, and where better to do it than the very place where she emerged from the sea, many moons before a succession of Egyptian, Knights Templar, Ottoman and British rulers (among many others) left their mark on the island?I half expect the beach to be deserted and quietthere are no bars or parasols for rent here, after all. Instead, I find myself immersed in a symphony of Greek, English, German, Italian, and something that sounds like Polish. Elderly couples tie pieces of cloth to a wishing tree believed to help bring prayers to fruition, while toddlers splash barefoot in the pebbly surf. In the distance, I see the silhouette of a young man who has climbed on to Aphrodites birthplace rock, appearing to prepare himself for a plunge into the waters below. Despite the mega resorts, nightclubs, and borders thick with military, the goddess of love is alive and well.***Cypriot sweetsWhile Cyprus is best known for its delectable mezze, huge spreads featuring multiple small plates of Mediterranean specialities, the countrys myriad sweet dishes are worth trying too. Here are three sweet Cypriot specialities that you wont want to miss.LoukoumiThis is an ubiquitous, jelly-like (but gelatin-free) dessert made of starch, sugar and, usually, some sort of flavouring, such as rose water or bergamot lemon, cut into cubes and dusted with powdered sugar. Loukoumi is known as Turkish delight in most parts of the world, but its better to just stick to the traditional name while in Cyprus.SujukThough the term sujuk often refers to a type of spiced sausage, in Cyprus its more frequently used to describe a long cylindrical treat made of unfiltered grape juice, nuts, a little flour, and flavouring such as pomegranate or carob. Theres no added sugar, so its not overly sweet.KataifiA popular dessert item at hotel buffets across the island, this is a sweet, baklava-like pastry consisting of ground nuts, sugary syrup spiced with cinnamon, and kataifi, a birds nest-style pastry dough with a consistency similar to soan papdi."

A revered tradition of the Hindus, tulsi vivah will see the sacred plant being married in spirit to Lord Krishna, according to the customs and rituals of a Hindu marriage.The story is rooted in mythology. ""Tulsi's husband used to be cruel and difficult. He used to harass her. To save her from her plight, Lord Krishna killed her husband and assumed the role of her companion,"" says Indira Gawande, a resident of Swavalambi Nagar.Tulsi vivah can be celebrated any day after the end of Chaturmas until Kartik Purnima, says Shiva Hazare, a teacher and a resident of Rajendra Nagar. ""We conduct a mass tulsi puja between five homes so people don't have to go through the hassle of visiting each other, and can enjoy celebrations at one place,"" he says adding that people fast a day before tulsi vivah and end it the next day.For the married, sugarcane is tied to tulsi plant on both sides, a mandap is built and the plant is dressed in a sari and covered with a dupatta, the way a bride is dressed. A shloka is recited, children burst crackers and prasad is distributed among everybody. ""The ambience is the same as that of a marriage and we have been celebrating it since childhood,"" Hazare added.Vidya Rajandekar, who makes Maharashtrian panchang, says tulsi vivah signals the end of chaturmas. ""During the four months of chaturmas, god is assumed to be in slumber and he awakens on Ekadashi. Hence most marriages are planned after that. Nowadays due to lack of time, people marry throughout the year. Tulsi vivah is performed not just for marriage but to bring positive vibes in the house,"" she says.Amla is an important component of wedding rituals. So are the diyas, laddus and naivedyam prepared at home, some of whom call a guruji to prepare them, adds Rajandekar.Gujarati homes, however, celebrated tulsi vivah on Tuesday. ""For us, celebrations fall on agyaras, whereas Maharashtrians celebrate on baras,"" says Pramilaben Lad, a resident of Nandanvan adding that five pots are placed one into another and the god's idol is placed in it.Radhika Sapkal, a schoolteacher, has three little daughters who get excited every year for the event. ""My daughters make rangoli and we conduct puja to keep our tradition going,"" she says."

Two major private mills of Yamunanagar and Karnals Bhadshon have not started crushing yet with only one private sugar mill in Ambalas Naraingarh having followed the guidelines.After delay in crushing operations, the farmers under the banner of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) are holding protests. They blocked the Yamunanagar-Saharanpur highway for more than an hour on Tuesday.Officials of the state agriculture department said the government had issued directions to all cooperative and private sugar mills to advance the crushing operations following an increase in area under sugarcane cultivation.The mills continue the crushing by end of May as sugar output from sugarcane crushed after March gets higher.Karam Singh, cane adviser to Piccadily Sugar Mill, Badshon, said, We have decided to start crushing from November 15 and we have informed the government about this.He refused to acknowledge that sugarcane acreage has increased in the state and farmers are holding protests. There is no increase in sugarcane acreage in our area, he claimed.Whereas, the farmers alleging that the delay in crushing operations will cost them heavily and they will not be able to sow wheat crop and mills could not crush the entire produce on time.We held a protest outside Yamunanagars Saraswati Sugar Mill (which crushes about 1.70 crore quintals of sugarcane every year) but the mill officials said they cannot start the crushing before November 21 due to construction work, said Dharam Pal, a farmer from Yamunanagar district.The mills chief operating officer SC Sachdeva could not be contacted after repeated attempts. Even as the private mills citing construction work behind their inability to start crushing, sources said they are doing so due to low sugar output in the early crushing.The farmers having tie-up with these mills cannot sell their produce to other mills as they do not have tie-up with the cooperative mills. The mills continue the crushing by end of May as sugar output from sugarcane crushed after March gets higher.Additional cane commissioner to Haryana agriculture department JS Brar said, In the October 13 meeting of the Sugarcane Control Board it was decided to advance the crushing operations from third week of November to first week. All the mills, including the private ones, were told to follow the guidelines.Whether the government will take action against the mills, Brar said, We will write to these mills again to advance crushing.The sugarcane acreage in the state has jumped to 1.25 lakh hectares, registering an increase of 22%. Though the state has 11 government-run sugar mills, the crushing capacity of these mills was not as per the requirement and farmers have to depend on three private sugar mills which crush over 50% of the produce."

Under the EPR introduced in the Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules 2016, producers are responsible for collecting waste generated from their products. The corporation, in a meeting conducted last week, has entered into an agreement with beverage giant Pepsico to take back plastic waste generated from their products.The PWM Rules, 2016 has given local bodies power to implement EPR. However, it has not been effectively implemented anywhere so far. The corporation, which has successfully implemented green protocol in major events such as Attukal pongala, could not follow green protocol norms due to security reasons in the match. So it decided to launch the event as a zero-waste programme, by avoiding disposable plates and glasses to the maximum extent possible. The prisons department, which is planning to sell chapattis during the match, has agreed to supply food in paper cover, instead of the plastic. ""They, however, could not avoid the disposable containers used to supply curry. But they agreed to collect them after use, clean it and dispose it properly,"" said a corporation official.For vendors, who sought support to find environment friendly disposables, the Corporation will make available plates and boxes made of sugarcane bagasse, which is supplied by a vendor for Faizabad in UP. ""We have also requested other vendors to supply plates made of palm leafs. All these will be available for purchase near corporation stall at Kazhakoottam ,"" an official said.The civic body will deploy 100 sanitation workers and 35 supervisors to implement the zero-waste programme. The Kerala Cricket Association will bear the expense of the waste management programme.As techies are likely to turn up in large numbers at the stadium, the corporation has tied up with Prakruti, an organization that promotes green living among the group. Prakruti has launched a social media campaign '#mywaste myresponsibility', which aims at creating awareness among techies to segregate waste after match and dump them in the right bin. Divas Sadasivan, member secretary of Prakruti, said that they have planned various online and offline campaigns to make people aware of managing the waste.Considering the huge amount of paper waste that could be generated as part of the event, the corporation along with Prakruti has decided to launch 'T20 for Tree 20' where they will plant 20 saplings on the compound of the stadium and Technopark to compensate for the papers used. Twenty prominent personalities will plant the saplings. The Prakruti will take care of its maintenance."

Subash Chander with a plate of kalakand, an Indian confection, outside of his Bombay Sweets & Snacks in Irving, Texas. Lalit Thota , owner of the restaurant India 101 in Irving, Texas, shows jangiri, a thick, patterned fritter soaked in sugar syrup. NYT ImageTwo weeks after the close of the State Fair of Texas, with the smells of deep-fried Oreos and funnel cake still lingering in the air, 60,000 Indian-Americans from across the country are expected to descend on the same site this Saturday to observe Diwali, one of Indias most important holidays.Like the state fair, the annual event  known officially as the DFW Diwali Mela (for Dallas-Fort Worth)  is built around food and mounted on a scale worthy of Texas. Held in and around the Cotton Bowl, it is among the largest and grandest Diwali celebrations in the United States.Dallas is not the most obvious setting. Though the city and its surrounding area have one of the nations largest Indian populations (1,08,000 in the 2010 census), the Chicago regions is nearly twice that size, and the New York-New Jersey areas is more than five times as large. The Dallas festival is being held this Saturday, long after Diwali (October 19 this year), because the state fair was using the fairgrounds then.But for those who attend the Dallas mela, Saturday may as well be the official holiday. What brings them here is the sheer scope and Technicolor splash of the spectacle: Bollywood singers are flown in from India. A cast of 150 volunteers stages a production of the Ramlila. Three giant burning effigies of Ravana and his family crackle into the night, and hundreds of cooks fry up syrupy, spice-laced Indian sweets.This years festival will have a slightly different tone than in years past, coming so soon after Hurricane Harvey, which devastated much of Houston and other parts of southeastern Texas. Organisers are expecting a sizable contingent from Houstons large Indian community to travel more than 200 miles to Dallas, in part because Houstons Diwali celebration on October 7 was smaller this year in the wake of the floods.We have so many friends there, said Satish Gupta, who founded the Dallas mela. (Its supporting organisation, the DFW Indian Cultural Society, is aiding hurricane relief efforts.) Its not even a question. Whatever help we can provide. This means, too, that the coming event could be the largest in the history of the citys festival.One of its central components  and the backdrop to every other activity at the mela  is the dizzying array of foods, with special care taken to make sure that every regions Diwali-specific treats are represented. This multicultural spirit is what sets the Dallas mela apart from those in other cities.In a single festival, you can eat Gujarati snacks while listening to performances in Tamil, and watching South Indian dance, said Kalpana Fruitwala, an organiser.For the event, Subash Chander, the owner of the popular Bombay Sweets & Snacks in suburban Irving, creates a pack of Bengali mithai. It includes neon-pink chum chum (coconut-coated milk solids), and gulab jamun filled with a silky mixture of cream and ground almonds.On a recent afternoon, Chander was deeply concentrating on an enormous mixing bowl heated to exactly 450 degrees, making sure the milk and shredded coconut for the chum chum were being churned to the ideal softness. If the temperature rises even a few degrees, or the mixture is stirred for too long, he said, the treat loses its luxurious, slightly bouncy texture.You have to be very patient, Chander said. Only after 18 years have I figured out the secret to making chum chum this soft. The response at the festival makes all the care worthwhile. All night, we have this big line that wraps around many times, he said. It got so long that the organisers had to install stands for people to wait.Lalith Thota, who is busy preparing to open the restaurant India 101, also in Irving, will make jangiri (with a shape not unlike that State Fair of Texas staple, funnel cake) that is eaten widely in Andhra Pradesh.Nearby, at the restaurant Bawarchi Biryanis, Anil Sukkagopal said his Diwali booth will serve Mysore pak that has its origins in Karnataka. We want to create an environment like the street markets in Bombay, Sukkagopal said. Well be yelling and shouting about our food. People will be crowding around. Its a sensory experience.At his booth, Naga Kolli, the owner of the South Indian restaurant Saravanaa Bhavan, in nearby Plano, will supplement a menu of dosas and idlis with payasam popular in Tamil Nadu, where the dish is often consumed first thing in the morning on Diwali, right after prayers.Testing the recipe in the restaurants kitchen, a cook tossed in just-fried cashews and raisins into a bubbling stainless steel vat filled with milk and vermicelli noodles, to add richness and crunch.We make it because it is made especially for Diwali in certain places, Naga said, adding with a laugh, The only disadvantage of payasam is that because its more of a liquid, people have a hard time walking around the festival with it.Community-run melaThe Dallas celebration has come a long way since 1994, when it began as a house party with about 50 guests, bootleg fireworks and catered food at Guptas home in North Dallas.When the party started to outgrow his backyard, Gupta came up with the idea to turn it into a public, community-run mela, a type of traditional festival with food and music that occurs in every village throughout India during Diwali. We wanted to bring that flavour of home to Dallas, to give our children a closer connection to Indian culture, he said.For the inaugural mela in 2006, Gupta ambitiously decided to book Texas Stadium in Irving. Everyone was making fun of us, said R K Panditi, a festival organiser who oversees the food vendors. We knew we wouldnt fill it, but I thought maybe well get 15,000.More than 38,000 people showed up, creating a major traffic jam on the freeway, and an hourlong wait just to enter the stadium. The food ran out within the first hour, so Panditi had to ask two nearby Indian restaurants to stay open until 4 am to feed the crowds.Since 2011, the festival has taken place in the Cotton Bowl, which has a capacity of nearly 1,00,000, and the added allure of being a citywide landmark.The festival has played an enormous role in expanding the impact of the Indian community, whose population in the Dallas area alone more than doubled between 2000 and 2010. There is now a petition going around the Coppell Independent School District to make Diwali an official school holiday, and last year a seasonal Diwali postage stamp had its Texas debut at the mela here.On Saturday, vendors will arrive at the Cotton Bowl at 10 am and not leave until well after midnight, when stalls once loaded with chum chum and biryani have been completely emptied of their goods.Staying until the very end is well worth it, though, as the closing event of the mela is an impressive display of fireworks shaped like diyas (lamps), synchronised to a colourful laser show and Bollywood music  a favourite tradition of Guptas ever since that first house party.Without the fireworks, he said, a sparkle in his eye, there is no Diwali."

Having learnt the ground reality during an inspection to assess the precautionary measures taken for the monsoon season, they wasted no time and rolled up their sleeves to clean a drainage canal at Pillaithottam in Nellithope constituency.Puducherry Chief MinisterV Narayanasamy (R) andMinister Kamalakannan(L) cleaning a drain| ExpressMonsoon rains have been lashing the Union Territory incessantly for the past three days, forming pools of stagnant water in many places. On Thursday, Narayanasamy and ministers R Kamalakannan, A Namassivayam and M O H F Shahjahan went to Pavanar Nagar and Phoomiyapettai, where they inspected the government quarters area.The residents there complained that free rice, sugar and kerosene were not being supplied to them through the ration shop in the locality. The Chief Minister assured them that rice would soon be distributed and that the territorial government could not distribute kerosene since the Centre had refused to give the fuel considering its bad effect on the environment.However, the residents said they were facing difficulties during power failures and kerosene could come handy for use in lamps. For that, however, at least one litre of kerosene was required per month.Narayanasamy then assured them that necessary measures would be taken after consulting with the Civil Supplies Department.Apprising the visiting top brass of their grievances, the residents further said many of the houses in the locality were built around three decades ago and around 800 households depended on public toilets as they did not have a separate toilet in their houses.They went on to add that due to lack of maintenance, drainage systems were blocked and rainwater got mixed with sewage water and stagnated on the roads. This could become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that spread several diseases, including dengue.Due to inundation, venomous snakes and insects were also finding their way into houses, they added.

He said the late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa had vehemently opposed the Food Security Act (FSA), but the law was given approval by present Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam when Jayalalithaa was in hospital. The Centre should exempt Tamil Nadu from implementing the FSA, instead of hiking the sugar price in public distribution system (PDS).CPM state secretary G Ramakrishnan said BJP-led government at the Centre had started destabilising the PDS when it started implementing the FSA in Tamil Nadu last year and already kerosene supply had been drastically cut.PMK youth wing president Anbumani Ramadoss said when the FSA was implemented in 2016 the State government assured that the interests of cardholders would be protected. Now that assurance had been broken by hiking sugar price.CPI State secretary R Mutharasan said only a few weeks ago, it was announced that those who have an income above Rs 8,000 per month would not get PDS supplies. Now, the hike in sugar price has come as a warning that in the coming days, rice, which is given free of cost and other commodities, would also be stopped for a majority of the cardholders.TNCC president S Thirunavukkarasar said the reasons for hiking the sugar price in PDS were unfair as only the poor and middle class bought from ration shops and not the rich.Its only nominal, says ministerMadurai: Justifying the rise in prices of sugar being supplied through Public Distribution System (PDS), Cooperatives Minister Sellur Raju said the price revision was nominal and that the common man could afford it. Speaking to media persons, Sellur Raju said the Union government had stopped the subsidy given to sugar and the State government was procuring it from the open market. Further, the sugar in open market costs D40 per kilogram, while the State had decided to sell it at D25 and it will not affect the common man as the revised price is nominal and is affordable by the ration card holders, he said."

For other family cards the commodity would be supplied at Rs 25 per kg.Earlier the government used to sell sugar through PDS shops for all family cards at Rs 13.50 per kg.In the G.O, the State said the decision was taken after the Central governments withdrawal of levy sugar allotment and further reduction in the subsidised sugar allotment from 10,820 MT to 1,864 MT per month with the effect from June 1. Because of this, the subsidy burden on the State government due to sugar alone has gone up to Rs 1,300 crore per annum for the monthly supply of 33,636 MT of sugar per month under PDS. The entire quantity of sugar was procured by the State from cooperatives and from the open market, the GO said.Even after this revision the difference between the market price of Rs 45 per kg at which the government procures sugar and subsidised rate of Rs 25 per kg at which sugar will be supplied to all cards other than AAY cards, will be Rs 20 per kg. The State government will have to bear this subsidy. The amount of subsidy on account of sugar alone to the State government will be of Rs 836.29 crore per annum, the G.O. said."

Goswami said the minister has insulted women by suggesting that giving feminine names to brands would boost the sales of liquour.As per the provisions under sub-section 47 of the Constitution, the government is supposed to implement liquor ban in the state.

It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.More than a fifth of Indias agricultural output by value today comes from milk. In 2014-15  the latest year for which detailed estimates at individual crop level is available  the value of milk production, at Rs 495,840.52 crore, for the first time, exceeded even the Rs 486,845.87 crore for foodgrains that includes all cereals and pulses.The accompanying table shows that in many states  virtually the entire northern belt covering Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, plus Gujarat  milk accounts for over, or just under, a quarter of the value of their total output from farming and allied sectors. It puts paid to assumptions by policymakers and even academic scholars, who have for long viewed livestock farming as a subsidiary activity to regular crop agriculture.The subsidiary treatment to dairying may have some justification at an individual farmer level. Income from milk could well be lower than from their main crop for most farmers. However, even this might, in many cases, be obscured by the fact that milk marketing happens round-the-year, as opposed to the more visible money generated from the one-time sale of paddy, wheat, sugarcane or cotton. Bulk income from the so-called main crop may help marry ones daughter or build a new house, but the cash from milk sales is what is squirrelled away by the homemaker to meet the familys day-to-day expenses. It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.Also, while a sugarcane grower may not cultivate cotton, just as mustard or chana farmers are unlikely to plant paddy, virtually all of them produce some quantity of milk. If every farmer is, by implication, a dairy farmer  a rising share of the milk that the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul) procures is now being supplied those having 30 or more animals, fed on fodder grown in-house(see The Big Picture: A new churning )  it makes all the more sense to discard the traditional subsidiary view of dairying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File/Photo) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. (File/Photo)Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said his government would take help from Mauritius in sugarcane research to get sugar production in the state at par with international standards. He was speaking to mediapersons in Lucknow shortly after returning from a three-day trip to the country.Speaking about Mauritius having a 51 per cent Hindu population and how those who migrated from India to Mauritius decades ago had still preserved their culture, Adityanath cited examples like a sacred pond called Ganga Talao, a 108-ft-tall statue of goddess Durga, over 350 temples and the Ramayana Center for research in Mauritius. He further said that considering the countrys position in the Hind Mahasagar (Indian Ocean), Mauritius is significant not only from the point of view of trade, but security as well.The chief minister said his government was also working on a proposal to set-up a Pravasi Bhartiya Bhawan in Varanasi along with a museum to depict the history of Girmitiya labourers, who had migrated to Mauritius over a century ago. Apart from tracing the roots of these labourers along with the Mauritius government, UP government officials would also visit Kolkata, from where these labourers had left the country, said Adityanath.They have saved their culture in adverse situations. Be it Bhojpuri, Hindi, Tulsi, Ramayna, they preserved it all. They also got cultural heritage status for Bhojpuri Gawai from UNESCO, said the chief minister. He also said that while a section is also working on ensuring the inclusion of Bhojpuri in the curriculum of schools in Mauritius, there is also a Hindi secretariat in the country.Stating that Mauritius had the potential to become a world trade centre, Adityanath said that though people of Indian origin are settled there in large numbers and hold important posts, the countrys economy is still in the hands of people with originate from France. He said efforts are on not only to bring in technical experts and investment from there, but to also ensure Indian businessmen also invest in that country.The CM indicated that both the Centre and state government were working on reviving the Buddhist Circuit project and a plan to establishing a Buddhist Research Centre in UP as well.Budha par ab shodh Cheen kare bari ajeeb si baat hai. Budh ke bare mein jo de sakte hain, hum de sakte hain, (It is strange that China now does research on Budh. Whatever can be provided about Budh, it is us who can provide it). He further said that it would be strange if China today makes a claim over Buddha, adding that most related to him are in India, especially UP and Bihar.Adityanath said that the state government has also invited those associated with the Maitriya Budha project for discussion to understand the reasons for the project being a non-starter after over 15 years.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Behind the moment of being able to use the grocery shopping list, is the thought of 'how did all those products reach the store in the first place, and then, how were they able to be taken home'?The answer sits firmly packaged in one of the most important, yet working-in-the-background sort of industries  Packaging. And Manjusjree Technopack is a packaging household name today, with innovations in the plastic packaging space, which is the driving force of how food, beverage, and other home FMCG companies seamlessly position, sell and supply their products today.Way back in 1983, then Assam-based Manjushree Technopack set out producing flexible plastic packaging for the tea industry in Eastern India, supplying pouches, bags and other products. In 1994, it purchased a unit in Bengaluru.""A thought occurred to me: Why not, we expand out of Assam?"" reminisces Vimal Kedia, the Founder and Managing Director of Manjushree Technopack.""We had a plan to work in the plastic PET bottle space. We went around government departments, and met stakeholders to understand the market. We set up this facility totally new. We thought this is a good area for PET bottles, because all the Southern states are industrialised, with high literacy rate and per capita income, resulting in greater spending power. Bengaluru is where logistics works out very well, because of its proximity to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra. If you cover all of South India, 60% of consumption is covered,"" he tells DH.Manjushree's first facility in Bengaluru came up at Bommasandra, which also came to house a unique packaging heritage museum, exhibiting over 80 years of packaging.The PET at homePET or Polyethylene Terephthalate is one the greatest innovations in the packaging space, let alone plastic packaging. Over 20 years ago, PET bottles were not in vogue. When this innovation arrived in India, women were easily attracted to it because they could reuse the wide-mouthed PET jars, for keeping masalas, groceries, sugar, tea powder, salt, spices, and so on. Earlier, glass jars and tin cans were used. PET bottles are easy to handle, no breakage if dropped, and come in handy with the purchase of most items for the home and kitchen.""Initially, we would send PET consignments of tea packaging by train all the way to Eastern India, because the demand was huge, with limited players,"" Kedia says.Explaining the science behind PET packaging, with tea as an example, he says: ""In tea, only 100 gm, 250 gm, 500 gm, and 1 kg are popular sizes in India. The 250 gm tea packs constitute 60% of sales, either in pouch or PET containers, 25% are from 500 gm, while the balance is between 100 gm and 1 kg. The science here involves knowing popular sizes and what should be the volume by density. Tea will require a particular size of capacity to pack. In the same way, oil requires different sizing. A 250 gm tea pack requires a 750 ml jar, but to pack 250 ml oil or water, one requires a 250 ml bottle.""A second factory came up in 2003, which merged its earlier factory within itself, setting up unified operations. As business expanded, Manjushree acquired land in the Bidadi Industrial Area and opened a large factory to manufacture preforms for cola and bottling industries, owing to high tonnage  Every day, that facility produces about 250 tonnes, while Bommasandra makes only 50 tonnes. Production level has risen to an annual output of four billion units of PET preforms, bottles and containers, which corresponds to 15% share in the overall Indian PET market.""We moved up with all the industries, and our uniqueness was in service, quality and design. We invested in technologies and innovations, understanding customers' ideas. We imported bottle-blowing machines from Japan, preform machines from Canada, film machines from Germany, and multi-layer technologies from Italy, so as to never compromise on quality. The main crux here is reliability and integrity. If I get an order, which I don't deliver on time, my customer's factory will shut down. And if his product is out of the market for even one week, someone else will take over,"" Kedia says.Industry mantraPackaging has two formats: Flexible (wrappers), which is economical and cheap; and Rigid, which can be held in hand and is reclosable. General merchandise in India is packed in cheaper flexible packs, against expensive rigid packaging. Premium products like shampoos, cosmetics, and colas, are packed in rigid bottles, which are convenient to use, carry, refrigerate, and reuse.Today, Manjushree is one of the largest manufacturers of 'anything in rigid packaging', supplying to a mega host of customers and industries. The company caters to 12 sectors including food and beverage, edible oil, alcobev, dairy, personal care, and home care, among others.Last year, Manjushree acquired rival Varahi, emerging as a pan-India company  with seven operational plants in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam, with a total annual manufacturing capacity rising to 1,25,000 MT. Today, the company's clients, who number around 200, include Patanjali, Dabur, SC Johnson, Marico, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Reckitt-Benckiser, Mondelez, and many others. It also exports to 10 countries.""Totally, we have over 1,000 designs from 5-ml containers to 20-litre potable water bottles. We can manufacture any size for any industry. We are capable of making bottles for any product, be it acidic, processed food, or dry product, as we even have moisture and oxygen barriers. Besides PET, we work with Low-density polyethylene (LDP), High-density polyethylene (HDP), Polypropylene, LED bulbs made of Polycarbonate, and Polystyrene,"" Kedia says.Plastic perilIndia's plastic packaging industry, which is largely unorganised, is expected to reach $73 billion by 2020, at 18% CAGR, according to a report by FICCI and Tata Strategic Management Group, which also states that the size of the industry in India today is at $32 billion, constituting only 4% of the global packaging industry.The largest consumer of plastic products is the beverage space at 40% in India (global is 60%), led by colas, followed by liquor (10%), pharmaceuticals (8%), and then other health supplements, and miscellaneous products.With plastic comes the question of its inherent threat to the biosphere and its unfortunate ability to degenerate the environment, if not treated or disposed of properly.""The biggest challenge is plastic mismanagement. The government has come out with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, which specifies producers' responsibilities. Even citizens must be disciplined enough to dispose of plastic in a separate bin, lest we all continue to suffer,"" Kedia, who is also the President of PET Association for Clean Environment, says, adding that awareness and stringent punishment is needed.Manjushree is carrying out R&D on biodegradable plastics, which isn't in much use, owing to its high cost. ""It has to be produced from plants  sugarcane to molasses, from which Monoethylene glycol has to be sourced. Biodegradable plastic doesn't fulfill requirements of all industries,"" he says.A way out would be to reduce the weight of a plastic bottle or container, and also using recycled plastic. ""We look at new designs through our dedicated design studio, on how to reduce weight and plastic use. By this, the customer reduces his packaging costs, and it is our objective to reduce plastic usage every year,"" he adds.Till date, Manjushree Technopack has invested over Rs 500 crore. Last year, it logged a turnover of Rs 650 crore, and will close this year at Rs 850 crore, a growth of 30%. ""We eye Rs 1,000 crore in turnover by 2019,"" concludes Kedia."

(Express Photo: Sandip Daundkar) A dairy farmer in Lohegaon near Pune giving fodder to his buffaloes. (Express Photo: Sandip Daundkar)Bapu Yede, like many in Palasdeo village of Pune districts Indapur taluka, had wholeheartedly participated in the Shetkari Sampa or farmers strike early this June. He joined the movement, stopping supply of all produce to urban centres, mainly in the hope of realise a better price for his milk. The week-long stir culminated in the Maharashtra government hiking its procurement price for cow milk, containing 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent SNF (solids-not-fat), from Rs 24 to Rs 27 a litre.Till around end-July, Yede was actually getting the officially declared rate for the 30-35 litres of milk he supplies daily from his three Holstein Friesian crossbred animals to the Sonai Dairy at Indapur. Since August, though, the company owning it  Indapur Dairy and Milk Products Ltd  has rolled back its price to Rs 22.5 per litre. Most private dairies in Maharashtra are today paying Rs 21-23 a litre. The cooperatives are continuing to give Rs 27 to producer-members, but only Rs 22-23 for milk collected from farmers outside their core district areas.I hear they (dairies) may reduce prices further, maybe to the Rs 18/litre levels of 2016, fears Yede, who grows sugarcane on five acres and devotes the remaining two out of his seven-acre holding for cultivating fodder jowar (soghum), maize and napier or elephant grass. At Rs 22.5/litre, my monthly revenue from 30 litres per day comes to Rs 20,250. As against this, I spend Rs 13,500-14,000 on fodder and feed concentrates alone. Adding family labour and other unpaid expenses leaves me, as it is, with nothing. If prices dip to below Rs 20, I will have no alternative but to sell my animals, he adds.Dairies, especially in the private sector, attribute the falling milk prices to two factors.The first is a crash in international skimmed milk powder (SMP) prices. Since the start of this calendar year, SMP rates at GlobalDairyTrade, the fortnightly auction platform of New Zealands dairy giant Fonterra, have plunged from $2,660 to $1,797 per tonne. These rates are close to their all-time-low of $1,419 per tonne in August 2015 and way below the record $5,142 scaled back in April 2013. Dipping global prices has led to domestic SMP realisations, too, dropping from Rs 220-225 to Rs 155-160 per kg between January and now.The second factor has to do with the goods and services tax (GST). Prior to the new indirect taxation regimes introduction from July 1, butter, ghee and other milk fats attracted an overall duty incidence of 5-6 per cent. With GST, that has gone up to 12 per cent, even as there isnt any duty on liquid milk per se.Both these  crash in SMP realisations and 12 per cent GST on milk fat  have hit us particularly hard. Unlike cooperatives, which are mainly into liquid milk marketing, our revenues come predominantly from production and sale of commodities such as SMP, ghee and white butter, notes Dashrath Shrirang Mane, chairman of the Sonai Dairy. His dairy procures about 17 lakh litres per day (LLPD), of which only two lakh litres is sold as pouched liquid milk and the rest mostly converted into commodities.Rajiv Mitra, managing director of the Satara-based Govind Milk and Milk Products Pvt. Ltd, makes a similar point. We are now paying 5 per cent GST on SMP and 12 per cent on ghee/white butter. And since there is no GST on our raw material (milk), we cannot avail any credit on input tax either, he observes. His dairy procures 6 LLPD and, like Sonai, sells only 2.5 LLPD as pouch milk under its Govind brand.Private players have an estimated 60 per cent share of the total 150 LLPD or so milk handled by organised dairies in Maharashtra. Many of them  specifically those dealing in cow milk fat  had incidentally benefited, when the Yoga guru Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Ayurved Ltd launched its branded cow ghee. The latter, in early-2016, was reportedly sourcing white butter, containing 82 per cent fat, from dairies in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu at Rs 190-200 per kg, while retailing the end product (ghee has 99.5 per cent fat) at around Rs 450 per litre (one litre of ghee equals 910 grams). As Patanjalis procurement grew  it accounts for anywhere between 1,200 to 1,800 tonnes of the countrys branded cow ghee market of 3,500-4,000 tonnes a month  so did the price of white butter. With white butter currently fetching Rs 290-300 per kg  they had touched Rs 360 levels in January-February  Patanjali has had to raise its own ghee retail price to Rs 560-580 a litre.The 12 per cent GST has affected us much more than Patanjali, as it is paying the same rate on its raw material (white butter), which partially at least offsets the increase in duty incidence on the final product. We dont have even that luxury. Dairies cannot claim input credit on their own ghee production, whereas those making it by procuring white butter from us can do so, says a dairy industry source, who does not want to come on record.But even cooperatives are not happy. Given that their main product  liquid milk  attracts no GST, there is no scope to offset taxes on inputs. That includes the plastic pouch film, which falls under the 18 cent rate slab. We cannot afford to also not pay the official Rs 27/litre procurement price. The government issues notices and imposes fines only on us, complains Vinayak Patil, chairman of the Sangli-based Rajarambapu Patil Sahakari Dudh Sangh, which markets liquid milk under its Krushna Dudh brand. Unviable SMP prices and GST, he claims, has resulted in his cooperative dairy registering a loss of Rs 1 crore each in both August and September.Even bigger a loser is, of course, the dairy farmer. If milk prices go back to Rs 19 a litre, farmers will most certainly exit dairying this time. And the cost will ultimately be borne by the consumer, warns Mane. Maharashtras dairies have already formed a four-member committee under former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to take up the matter with the Centre. We are seeking a meeting with the finance minister Arun Jaitley. Our main demand is a reduction in the GST on milk fat to 5 per cent, adds Mane.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sehri (a pre-dawn meal) and iftar (an evening meal to break the fast) are the two meals every day during this holy month when Muslim families across India relish delicacies, some of which are especially made during Ramzan.The idea of the sehri meal is to eat food that is high in protein, is easily digestible and does not leave you thirsty for the rest of the day. Khajla (a kind of pancake) and pheni (a vermicelli dish) are integral to this meal in North India. Bakeries in Muslim localities make special breads during Ramzan, to be eaten with milk for sehri. Big bowls containing salan (non-veg curry) with pieces of chapatti mixed in it are part of the pre-dawn meal of Muslim families in Delhi and Lucknow.The iftar meal is the one to which believers look forward; preparing which women in the families spend their afternoons. Except dates which find a mention in Islamic history (it is believed that prophet Mohammad used to break his fast with dates) and are common in iftar meals across the world, rest of the delicacies eaten for sehri and iftar are influenced by a given region or states history, culture and cuisine (read the accompanying stories).Fruits and smoothies such as Baebri Boel (a popular drink in Kashmir) are consumed primarily for their nutritional value while snacks such asunnakaya (Kerala), haleem (Hyderabad) and bhajiya (Kolkata) reflect the Indian fondness for all things spicy.HYDERABAD: HALEEMHaleem is much in demand in Hyderabad in the month of Ramzan. (HT Photo.)The one festival that Hyderabadis across faiths wait for is Ramzan. This is the only time when they get an opportunity to relish their favourite local food item  Haleem.Haleem, made of meat, wheat, dry fruits and spices, is now incredibly popular because Hyderabad haleem, was given the Geographical Indication certification in August 2010.After fasting throughout the day, Muslim families look forward to having haleem for dinner.Hyderabadi haleem is made of meat  preferably that of goat or sheep and pounded wheat (not exactly atta) The two are then cooked together in pure ghee.The meat and wheat mixture along with spices are cooked in a bhatti (a cauldron made of iron and inserted in a kiln made of brick and mud) on a low flame, with cooks stirring the mixture continuously using wooden paddles or sticks for 10-12 hours.It is garnished with fried onion, coriander and slices of lemon. Occasionally, boiled eggs are also served with haleem.It is believed that haleem originated in Iran, but became popular in Hyderabad during the reign of the Asaf Jahis or Nizams in the 18th century. Since then, it has gained prominence in the Deccan.According to Ifteqar, a steward at a popular Irani restaurant at Mehdipatnam, haleem is not only tasty, but also highly nutritious. It has carbohydrates in the form of wheat, proteins in the form of meat besides spices, which are good sources of minerals and vitamins. At the same time, it is very soft on the stomach because of prolonged cooking, he said. For vegetarians, there is vegetarian Haleem. The ingredients and recipe remain the same minus meat.

(Mujeeb Faruqui/HT Photo)Nukti Khaare, a Ramzan dish that is common across Bhopal, is, in fact, a combination of three snacks: Nukti, a yellow sweet made of gram flour; anardaana, made of slit black gram; and khaarey, which is essentially, sev, crunchy noodles made from chickpea flour paste.While the yellow nukti, also known as nukti daana is found in northern India, the addition of anardaana is unique to Bhopal.The Nukti is typically eaten with Khaare or sev, which is salty.Nukti and khaare are sold separately. They are mixed together before eating. The result, a sweet and salty snack, is a staple iftar dish in many families. (By Punya Priya Mitra)"

Convicted for the dowry death of his wife, he has spent 18 years of his life in jail, 13 of which at Sampoornanand Shivir, an open-air prison in Uttarakhands Sitarganj.Set amid lush green fields, the jail was established in 1960 over an area of 5,965 acres.Sampoornanand, then chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh of which Uttarakhand was a part, promoted the concept.Balbir attributes the transformation in him to the unfettered life in the shivir, which is among the 28 unique open jails of India.General jails are cramped, there is no individual space and inmates there are mostly depressed. Here we are already part of the mainstream, he said.But all is not well at this unique jail. Its area has now shrunk to just 640 acres as a vast swath of its agricultural land was given away to the Sate Infrastructure and Industrial Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of inmates, referred to as shivir wasis, too dwindled from 500 in 2000 to 44 in 2017. We have urged the inspector general of jails to shift 50 prisoners from other jail to this camp so that the number of inmates is increased and we can have more hands for agricultural work, superintendent of the shivir TD Joshi said.The area of the jail has now shrunk to just 640 acres. (HT Photo)Giving some respite to those who are striving to protect the unique concept, the Uttarakhand high court, Nainital, recently ordered that not an inch of the land belonging to the shivir should be given to any agency for any work other than building of hospital or school.But inmates are not fully assured. Besides, there are many problems that still persist.There is no doctor on the campus. The 15- day home leave to inmates was withdrawn by the government five years ago.Inmates at the shivir live in huts on the fields and guard the crops at night. Sugarcane, wheat and rice are grown over around 200 acres of land by them.The inmates are categorised as pucca and kachcha shivir wasis. The pucca shivir wasis live in the fields as they are trustworthy. They can, however, move only within the fields of the jail and not beyond the open boundary. They are allowed to keep with them their families for a week in a month and are provided daily quota of rations. They have to cook their own food. The kachcha shivir wasis are considered less trustworthy and are kept in unlocked barracks."

Thereafter no escalation was permitted, as per the agreement. The power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed on May 4, 2005.The MLA alleged that Rana Gurjits company violated the agreement and approached the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) in 2010 seeking re-determination of tariff for supply of power to PSPCL.The PSERC rejected the petition in 2013 and thereafter the company approached the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, New Delhi, challenging the order.In 2014, the Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeal and forwarded the matter back to PSERC for reconsideration and to re-determine the tariff after duly considering the actual fuel cost of bio mass, said Khaira, while showing copies of official documents to support his claim.The MLA said that in 2015, the PSPCL filed an appeal against the judgment of Appellate Tribunal in the Supreme Court under the Electricity Act, which is now set for hearing on September 8.Interestingly, Rana, who as power minister is controlling PSPCL, is now misusing his official position and pressuring PSPCL to either withdraw the petition from the Supreme Court, or accept the judgment of the Appellate Tribunal of Electricity passed in favour of his company, charged Khaira.He said its a clear cut case of conflict of interest. It has now become amply clear why (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh has backtracked from bringing the conflict of interest law as he knows that his blue-eyed Rana would become the first victim of this law.BOXMINISTER RUBBISHES CHARGESMeanwhile, Rana Gurjit dismissed Khairas charges and said the AAP leader is a failed and frustrated man, who is too desperate to stay in limelight.In a statement, Rana said like any other citizen of the country, he too has every right to seek legal recourse and remedy.He said the case Khaira has been referring to is five-year old and due process of law is being followed.Khaira, instead of jumping the gun in his desperate bid to seek publicity, should have waited for the Supreme Court judgment in the matter, he observed.The minister said he was not surprised over Khairas charges since he is desperate to become the leader of the AAP legislature party in Punjab. I really wonder whether he does anything else other than trying to find faults in whatever I and my family do."

Dullo, another leader who does not have a pleasant equation with Amarinder, too had said the government that took over in March should fulfil promises made in the manifesto. Then, HT on November 6 reported that the CM will stay away and the meeting will be chaired by Mohindra, second in seniority after him.Brahm Mohindra and Amarinder Singh (HT File)Totally disillusionedNow, Bajwa told HT over the phone, Today, I am totally disillusioned with government. I will not be going to attend a meeting that is being chaired by a minister and not by the CM. I have to take up issues that relate to Punjab and only the CM can take a decision. For instance, he said, How can Brahm Mohindra take a decision on fixing prices of sugarcane?I was waiting to remind the CM about promises including action against SAD leaders Bikram Majithia, Sukhbir Badal, Tota Singh and Adaish Partap Kairon. And why is (finance minister) Manpreet Badal not issuing a department-wise white paper on the loot committed by the SAD-BJP regime in the last 10 years? he said, adding that he would wait for another meeting.Lacks courtesyDullo, a former state Congress chief like Bajwa, said over the phone, The invitation to the meeting lacks courtesy.

I am a dignified person, and will not got to a meeting for which basic courtesy is not extended.SS Dullo (HT File)He said he will not like to comment on working of the government in the media, but added, I would remind the CM about poll promises of ghar ghar naukri (jobs), unemployment allowance, and fulfilment of a pledge that the CM took at Bathinda by placing his hand on a holy book. The farm loan waiver is still on paper, and similar is the story of enhancement of pensions and Shagun scheme. I prepared a list, but now will not attend the meeting as the CM is not attending it.Regarding raising issues in the Rajya Sabha, he said, I am already doing that, since before there was a Congress government in Punjab.Sources said another Rajya Sabha MP, Ambika Soni, will not attend, while state unit chief and Gurdaspur MP Sunil Jakhar will be there, as would be other Lok Sabha MPs of the Congress.Akalis take digAs for the SAD, its line is that Brahm Mohindra lacks the seniority to chair the meeting. SADs Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra said in Patiala, It seems the CM is not concerned with Punjabs issues. Thats why he twice postponed this meeting, and now a new communication says that Brahm Mohindra will chair it. How can Mohindra take a decision which is in the domain of the CM? The meeting is against protocol and the dignity of MPs.First, the meeting was supposed to be held on November 6. Then we were informed that the meeting has been rescheduled for November 15 as the chief minister was busy. We again got a message that the meeting has been rescheduled for November 14. But again, it was changed to November 15, he said.Prem Singh Chandumajra (HT File)He went on to allege that Amarinder is attempting a secret pact with Haryana over the SYL (Sutlej-Yamuna Link) canal, and only he can tell the reality over it. As he is aware that the SAD will question it, he decided not to take the meeting.BJP MP and Union minister Vijay Sampla will not attend as he is occupied with prior engagement, party secretary Vineet Joshi told news agency PTI.AAP splitAAPs Lok Sabha MP from Sangrur and state unit chief Bhagwant Mann simply said, We are not going to attend the meeting.But the party has four LS MPs here, of whom two have all but parted ways with it and remain suspended. Those two  Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa  will attend.Dharamvira Gandhi (HT File)Gandhi said it was his idea to have such a meeting: I am going to attend as it is a noble initiative by the CM to collectively raise issues of the state in Parliament. It was my idea, which (previous CM) Parkash Singh Badal didnt implement, but Amarinder Singh has decided to hold a meeting before every session. I have to take up the matter of Chandigarh-Rajpura rail link to connect Malwa; besides pollution and other issues."

Situated beside a granary in Chawri Bazar, it has been serving fruit sandwiches since 1948.The sandwiches, with apple, chiku, pineapple, and grape stuffed between slices of white bread, are a delicacy you will probably not find anywhere else in the Capital.The basic ingredients of each fruit sandwich, besides the fruit, are white cream, home-made paneer and sugary kesar chutney. Some of the specialties are seasonal, but the rule doesnt apply to all seasonal produce. The mango sandwich, for instance, is available round the year. They also serve toasted sandwiches with a simple filling of tomatoes and cucumber.The area where the Jain Coffee House is located has a colourful history. It was a red-light district during the Mughal era. Serious-minded city explorers, however, visit the area to photograph crumbling old balconies and try delicious streetside, vegetarian-only snacks such as aloo tikkis, gol-gappas and bedmi puri.If you dont have a taste for fruit sandwiches, you might like the savoury namkeen sandwich layered with paneer, tomato slices, pomegranate seeds, and flavoured with coriander leaves and light spices.The dimly lit coffee house is owned by a family of grain merchants from north Delhis Kanhaiya Nagar. A few assistants spend the day placing sliced tomatoes on slices of white bread. Its founder, Lala Shambhu Dayal Jain, had migrated to the city from Shikarpur in western Uttar Pradesh.The coffee house also serves fruit shakes. But you should wash down the sandwiches with its excellent ginger-flavoured chai.Sadly, Jain Coffee House doesnt have patience for people who like to sit for hours over a single cup of coffee. A Hindi-language notice on the wall warns the customer not to waste our time by idling in the shop."

Photo: HTKolkata: Rosogolla, the syrup-soaked spongy ball that has served as a gastronomic identity marker for the Bengali community for almost 150 years, just got recognition for its uniqueness.The Union ministry of commerce and industry on Tuesday recognised Banglar Rosogolla, the iconic sweet, as deserving of protection under geographical indication (GI), ignoring competing claims about its origin from neighbouring Odisha.Earlier this year, two exotic varieties of rice produced in small quantitiesTulaipanji and Govindabhogalso received similar protection under GI as unique products of West Bengal, but this went largely unnoticed. But the success with the ubiquitous rosogolla, at least 20 million pieces of which are produced every day, was sweet news, said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. It triggered celebrations in Kolkata.The recognition does not necessarily end the debate on the origins of the coveted sweet. Whereas a confectioner from Kolkata, Nabin Chandra Das, is known to be the inventor of rosogolla, people of Odisha have claimed that a variant of the sweet was offered to the deity at Puris Jagannath temple from much earlier.The GI recognition was widely seen as a victory over Odishas claim, but what the intellectual property authorities have recognised is the uniqueness of Banglar Rosogolla for its melt-in-the-mouth smoothness, spongy texture and the lightness of the sugar syrup in which it is dipped.Smooth and delicate feel in the mouth are the basic characteristics of Banglar Rosogolla, the state had said in its petition seeking GI protection. Hardness of Banglar Rosogolla is experimentally proven to be much lower than samples collected from other states, and the sugar concentration of the syrup is maintained at 30-40%, making it lighter than variants from other states.Though the states application for GI protection of Banglar Rosogolla was based on various physical and chemical parameters of the sweet, which are claimed to be consistent, sweetmeat makers actually go by their instinct, said Sumit Sundar Ghosh, director, Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar Pvt. Ltd, a fabled confectioner established in 1907.I am not sure the uniqueness can be maintained if people stopped to rely on their intuition and started to measure the ingredients or if production were to be mechanised, he added. At the same time, his firm was one of the early birds to start its own dairy farm to maintain product consistency. The quality of milk is paramount, determined by the fodder and the process of collection, he said.Back in 1994, the sweet maker from north Kolkata started to invest in its dairy farm. It now sprawls 100 acres, and produces 2,000-2,500 litres of milk a day, said Nitai Chandra Ghosh, Sumit Sundar Ghoshs father and a fifth generation confectioner. The farm has its own refrigerated trucks to carry the milk to Kolkata from Durgapur, 180 km away.Our rosogollas are made entirely out of the milk that we produce, he said. We still buy small quantities of milk but only to produce other sweets, which, for instance, need milk with higher fat content.Curding of milk to derive cottage cheese, or chhanathe main ingredient of rosogollastarted in eastern India under the influence of the Europeans, said Mani Shankar Mukherji, an author and historian. In 1868, confectioner Das invented the rosogolla in its current form capping several years of experiment after being thrown out of his ancestral business of sugar refining, said a scion of the family, Dhiman Das, also a director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd.Nabin Chandra Das built his business on the strength of the rosogolla, whose popularity spread beyond the neighbourhood of his store in north Kolkata from the 1870s. K.C. Das helped spread the sweet outside Kolkata by creating a long-life variant sold in cans from 1930. Now there are 16 K.C.

We are very happy and proud that #Bengal has been granted GI ( Geographical Indication) status for Rosogolla  Mamata Banerjee (@MamataOfficial) November 14, 2017India has awarded a ""geographical indications"" tag to rosogolla, the king of Indian sweets, after a years-long battle between the neighbouring states of West Bengal and Odisha over the ownership rights.Luscious rosogolla, or sweet cheese balls dripping with sugar syrup, are a favorite dessert for those with an exceptionally sweet tooth.But West Bengal and Odisha have been arguing over the origins of rosogolla, which means a ball of sweet. They consulted historians and produced old documents to support their claims. On Tuesday, the Union Commerce and Industry Ministry ruled that the sweet originated from West Bengal, giving it the coveted ""geographical indications"" tag.The World Trade Organisation says ""geographical indications"" defines a good as originating in a particular territory of a member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is available.West Bengal's chief minister Mamata Banerjee welcomed the decision saying in a Twitter post it was ""sweet news for us all""."

From the high and mighty to the hoi polloi, a reporter also gets a chance to meet up, close and personal all sorts of crooks, charlatans, including, of course, self-styled babas.Now that Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is in the news, his nemesis at the altar of justice transports me back to an audience I had with the controversial and colourful self-styled godman inside his den (read dera) in Sirsa. Two things stand out in the memory chip: One, I narrowly escaped being baptised into his faith, and secondly, an interview with him on public address system!It was April 2009. A month into the new role as editor of this newspaper, the reporter in me nudged me to follow a potential story in Sirsa. The Lok Sabha elections were round the corner. The dera, with its huge following, was seen as an X-factor in poll sweepstakes in Punjab. Casting an ominous shadow on the border states electoral landscape was a raging bloody conflict between the dera devouts and Sikh radicals after Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singhs controversial imitation of the 10th Sikh Master, Guru Gobind Singh, in 2007.This law and order imperative had prompted the Election Commission to go in for a two-phase poll in Punjab. Despite facing three CBI cases for rape and murder and being ostracised by the Sikh clergy, the dera chief was the man of moment not just for election, but even for tenuous peace in Punjab.SURREAL SCENEUpon a midnight touchdown in the dera premises, I was hosted graciously by Aditya Insan, a young, smooth-talking eye surgeon who doubled as Babas Man Friday and spokesperson. Next morning, a view from the first-floor window revealed swarms of premis (as the dera devout call themselves) walking into the dusty, sprawling complex for Sundays naam charcha (spiritual discourse). My request for an on-the-record conversation with Pita ji  as Ram Rahim is reverentially addressed  was granted after a lot of back and forth messaging, with two riders: submit your questions beforehand and attend the religious congregation. Sensing that the interview will happen after the discourse, I quickly jotted down questions before being escorted through the crowds and ushered to the front row of a huge pandal (tent), neatly divided in the middle into enclosures for male and female faithfuls.The scene was surreal and surcharged. It reverberated with high-decibel devotional songs set on filmy tunes, eulogising Pita ji and his miracles. Many a follower danced deliriously, while others clapped in frenzied symphony. The music touched a crescendo at Babas dramatic entry on a golf cart. For the next 45 minutes, all eyes were on the eight-foot high canopied rostrum from where a gaudily-attired godman with the trademark peacock plume in his hand spoke in Hindustani to pindrop silence of what, a while ago, was a raucous assembly.OPEN ENCOUNTERThe moment the sermon was over, Baba made an announcement that left me dumbfounded. We have with us an editor sahib from Chandigarh. He has asked me a few questions and I will answer them, one by one, in the presence of the entire sangat (gathering), he said pulling out my handwritten list of questions from his pocket. For the next 20 minutes, he held forth on each question, some of them tough and pointed. It was the first  and since last  interview I ever got through a public address system in front of thousands of people.The surprise was not over yet. When the crowd began dispersing, I was gently escorted to a large room where a group of men and women waited for the initiation ceremony. Pita ji will be here soon. Will you like to be baptised? asked a middle-aged devout, who seemed to be the master of ceremony.Finding me nonplussed, he patronisingly reeled off a whole sheaf of boons in the life and after-life that accrue for an initiated disciple. I dodged and ducked his sugar-coated spiritual pitch with a worldly mumbo-jumbo before the Baba, gleam in his eyes, walked in to baptise and bless the new disciples. By then, Baba too had sensed my demurral. So, we briefly exchanged pleasantries before I made a hasty exit. Even for a hard-nosed hack, the encounter with the Baba of Bling was baptism by fire.@vinayak_ramesh"

This state portal is to be launched next month. Currently, several central schemes including scholarships offered by higher education department, employment guarantee scheme and other social benefit schemes operate through the centre linked portal, where payments are electronically transferred into the accounts of the beneficiaries. The list of the beneficiaries with Aadhar numbers has been seeded into the system by different departments.Farmers who register for the loan waiver will put in their individual Aadhar numbers to access and feed in other information about land records and income.The government will hire a private firm to run the software that will bring together bank information on loan accounts, and government data, including income tax and service tax, and land records. IT will cross-check information and arrive at a final data set, said a senior official from the information technology (IT) department.For instance, farmers who have a secondary income and file tax returns for the same, who are registered as value added tax payees or are as retired with a monthly income of Rs 15,000, are not eligible for the waiver. Those elected on the board of sugar co-operative mills, district co-operative banks and agricultural produce marketing committees are not eligible for the waiver. Those elected to these bodies are generally local politicians, who have both money and muscle power.Every farmer who applies for the loan will have to be vetted through the central data information to ensure that he or she does not fall in any of these categories.The IT department is working with the co-operation department and the Chief Ministers Office to come out with the loan disbursal system.Given that the co-operation department estimates nearly 89 lakh farmers as beneficiaries under the newly announced loan waiver scheme, collating the data is no easy task. The process should take at least another two months and the earliest the loan will only get disbursed in October."

The family fell on difficult times and his childhood was spent in poverty.His first attempt to set up an outlet at Jorasanko bombed but he struck gold with rosogolla at his shop on arterial Chitpur Road (now known as Rabindra Sarani).Nobin Chandra Das invented the sweet in 1868. He was trying to come up with a new sweet for a number of years before he came up with it. He never thought of trying for a patent on the sweet but taught confectioners how to prepare it, Nobin Chandra Das great-great-grandson Dhiman Das said.The key ingredients are chhana (cottage cheese) made from cow milk, the sugar syrup and a crucial determinant is how long the rosogolla is boiled, the director of one of the most famous makers of the iconic sweet, KC Das Pvt Ltd, said.Dass son Krishna Chandra (1869-1934) expanded the business his father set up and is credited with the invention of another popular sweet rosomalai.For years, the Das family was recognised as the first family of the states sweetmeat industry mainly due to its claim on the parentage on rosogolla. The residence of the Das family on 532 Rabindra Sarani is  no prize for guessing  known as Rosogolla Bhavan.Down the decades, Bengalis have taken immense pride in the spongy sweet. Virtually every dignitary visiting West Bengal  from Fidel Castro to Diego Maradona  was offered this signature sweet during state dinners.So Bengalis were quite surprised, if not hurt, in 2015 when the neighbouring state of Odisha suddenly claimed that the sweet was essentially an invention of that state. As the bitter battle between West Bengal and Odisha started over its origin, the Bengal government quoted 19-century history to argue that the rosogolla was invented by Das in 1868.Odishas minister of science and technology Pradip Kumar Panigrahi announced the setting up of committees to trace the origin of the sweetmeat and furnish evidence that it was first prepared around 600 years ago in the temple town of Puri.The Odisha government even launched a social-media campaign #RasagollaDibasa on July 30, 2015, to celebrate its origin. An exhibition and awareness event was also organised in Bhubaneswar by the states confectioners.Later in September that year, the Mamata Banerjee administration applied for GI authentication.Bengals food processing minister, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, told Hindustan Times last week that they were toying with the idea of getting ready for a legal battle even if the governments application was turned down.And on Tuesday, the rosogolla firmly established itself in the rich culinary tradition that the state is known for."

We do not see improvement, says Usman Naseem.8.00pm: Delhi is out of emergency but not out of danger. In the coming days by November 16 and 17, the conditions are expected to get better.

5a5326249855b770e037dc53,Juvenile diabetes: a rising concern,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/642587/juvenile-diabetes-rising-concern.html,2017-11-13,"By Suruchi Goyal Agarwal Nov 14 2017, 0:55 ISTMany people believe that diabetes is an ailment that hits only adults, especially the middle-aged. It can, therefore, be disconcerting for a parent to find out that their child is suffering from diabetes. The fact is that about 10 lakh children live with type 1 diabetes in India, according to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).Type 1 diabetes in children implies that insulin is no longer produced in their bodies and they need external insulin supplement to manage this ailment. Also known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, it may redefine the life of your child who will now need periodic monitoring of blood sugar levels and it's management.As we observe World Diabetes Day on November 14, it is pertinent for us to talk about the subject of Juvenile Diabetes, as this day in India is also Children's Day. Though it may need some adjustments in the lives of the affected children, type 1 diabetes can be managed well and prevented from advancing to a more dangerous level. Through consistent care, proper blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery, the daily management of type 1 diabetes in children can be done.Juvenile diabetes is largely believed to be a genetic issue. However, some environmental factors could aggravate the problem. Rapidly changing lifestyles with improper dietary habits with excess consumption of calories, simple sugars, saturated fats and less fibre, and markedly reduced physical activity may be among the contributing factors.All these modern lifestyle problems that have put adults under a diabetes threat might also be the result for our children to be in great danger, making them more vulnerable towards Type 2 diabetes too. It is, hence, crucial that awareness is required if at all we look forward to our future generations lead their lives in a diabetic-controlled environment.In a country like India where many do not have access to healthcare and most people are unaware of the fact that diabetes can affect children who may often go undiagnosed till they are too ill. Even the onset of the ailment is slow and parents may often confuse the symptoms for something else or overlook them. It is hence important to generate enough awareness among people about how to monitor the health of their children.There are some signs and symptoms that parents should monitor, especially those who know that there is a strong family history of diabetes.An increase in thirst or urination, issues with vision, a sudden weight loss or lethargy in the child are some of the symptoms that should be taken seriously. A doctor should immediately be consulted and required checks undertaken for the child as diabetes might be a cause for these problems.Setting an exampleWith a rise in childhood obesity, there also has been an increase in the number of children who develop type 2 diabetes.It is important that we promote a healthy diet with regular monitoring of sugar level topped with compulsory and consistent physical activity in order to prevent children from developing type 2 diabetes. Healthy eating and physical activity can prevent obesity and its disastrous consequences and if a family becomes health conscious, children are more likely to follow suit and hence we will see the change.Children are very much dependent on what they are being told, in what kind of an environment they are born and brought up, is exercise or health check-ups a regular affair in the family or things like these do play an important role  because this is what they will fall prey to and a healthy family will more predictably have healthy children only.Medical care of a child with diabetes does not stop there. Since most of the affected are school children, teachers and school nurses should be able to recognise diabetic emergencies and offer first-aid treatment whenever needed.Parents should always inform the teacher or concerned authorities about the diagnosisand make sure their child has a helping hand in school, during an emergency. This is very important when a diabetic childis hypoglycemic (having low blood sugars). Two spoons of sugar, glucose or a sugary drinkshould be given to the child while awaiting medical help.(The writer is Consultant - Paediatrics and Paediatric Endocrinology, Columbia Asia Hospital, Whitefield, Bengaluru)"

5a532ac79855b770e037de9c,Bride-hunting tales,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/642099/bride-hunting-tales.html,2017-11-10,"By K V Chandra Mouli Nov 11 2017, 2:08 ISTMy wife, while offering me my morning coffee that day, reminded me that it was our 35th wedding anniversary. Her statement took me back several decades, to reminisce my bride seeing experiences.In 1980, after my engineering graduation, I got a lecturer's job in an engineering college. Back then, once we had finished our studies, landed a job and settled down, marrying was mostly the next thing on the agenda.So once, a relative lured me to see a landlord's daughter. She had failed lower secondary, but was good looking and would inherit a lot of assets. He advised me not to worry about her educational qualification, as it affected no one then. I agreed to the meeting. At their house, the traditionally adorned girl served us snacks and coffee. Once the formalities were done with, we took leave of the family. Later, I was greatly disappointed to learn from my relative that the lower secondary failed girl, unaware of the status of a lecturer, had rejected me. She believed my job to be equal to that of a primary school teacher's post!To improve my value in the marriage market, I joined the sugar industry as an engineer. A colleague, who was an ambush matchmaker, recommended that I meet this daughter of yet another landlord. I yielded to his request. When we went there, the female protagonist never showed her face! A woman offered us snacks and coffee before we left.My colleague later told me that the girl was reluctant to meet me since mine was not a secured job with considerable income as I am worked in a private factory. But the girl's mother had felt obliged to serve us refreshments for having invited us.Having had such horrendous experiences, I decided to stop thinking of marriage until I landed a government job. I also decided that when the bride's side could expect a certain status of the bridegroom, there was nothing wrong in expecting something in return. After my selection as a Boiler Inspector, marriage offers began pouring in. An affluent landlord, who had noticed me at a random function, sent word to come see his daughter. This time around I went to see the girl, now my wife, with my elders.The elders, who were satisfied with the alliance advised me, ""Don't miss this opportunity. The girl will inherit a lot of assets. If they ask about your requirements, pretend as if you are not interested in such offers."" I shook my head sombrely and agreed to the alliance.On the day of our marriage, the bride was adorned in rich jewellery. My naivet led me to believe that they would all be mine after marriage. While submitting my first annual property returns to the government, I enquired my wife about the jewellery and properties she had inherited. I was shell-shocked when she showed only a few ornaments.When I enquired my in-laws, they said, ""Our daughter is pure gold from head to toe. Why do you worry about jewellery?"" While I was under the impression that I had been clever in marrying the girl, my in-laws had proved that were shrewder than me in disposing of their daughter! However, as the years went by, my love towards my wife forever last."

(Source: PTI)Even as the government cut down tax rates on 200 items at the 23rd GST Council Meeting on Friday, many have called the move an election ploy to influence voter sentiment ahead of the December 9 Gujarat elections. Critics have said it made little sense for a commodity like cement to be subjected to 28 per cent tax. Sources said the government might now focus on recasting the lower tax slabs of 12 per cent and 5 per cent.On Friday, the GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, shifted as many as 178 items of daily use from the top tax bracket of 28 per cent to 18 per cent in a move to shore up public spending and revive investor sentiment.A uniform 5 per cent tax was prescribed for all restaurants, both air-conditioned and non-AC, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. Currently, 12 per cent GST is levied in non-AC restaurants and 18 per cent in air-conditioned ones.These measures are expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 20,000 crore, government officials said. Items for which the GST rate has been cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent include chocolates, chewing gums, detergents, shampoos, hair creams, henna powder/paste, deodorants, fans, pumps, lamps, sanitaryware, marble, granite, glass, wires, cables, electrical boards/panels, furniture, fire extinguishers, rubber tubes and all musical instruments and their parts.

It also decided to reduce the tax rate for all restaurants, barring those in luxury hotels, to 5 per cent, without any input tax credit.These measures are expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 20,000 crore, government officials said. Additionally, the Council decided to reduce the compliance burden for businesses through easing procedures for filing of returns, along with an increase in the annual turnover threshold for the composition scheme to Rs 1.5 crore from the recently revised Rs 1 crore.The tax rate for manufacturers under the composition scheme was also reduced to 1 per cent from the earlier rate of 2 per cent, bringing it at par with the tax rate for traders. The composition scheme for restaurants will continue unchanged with a tax rate of 5 per cent.

These recommendations are in spirit of the continuous feedback we are getting from various stakeholders on GST, he said.In Guwahati, speaking to reporters, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said items were fitted into tax slabs based on equivalence principle as per their pre-GST incidence, but in the last three meetings, they had been looking at reducing the items in the 28 per cent tax bracket.In the last few meetings, as part of our efforts to rationalise the tax structure, the Council has been reviewing rates from time to time in the last three meetings, we have been systematically looking at the 28 per cent tax bracket and rationalising certain items out of that bracket into the lesser categories, mostly 18 per cent, and in some cases even less.We were reducing items from 28 per cent category because optically some of them should not have been there in the first place. Secondly, some items were being made by small businesses who used to get excise exemption out of total 228 items which were in the 28 per cent category, fitment committee had recommended rationalising these after the last meeting, Jaitley said.The proposed rate changes, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said, will be effective from November 15 prospectively.The GST Council also decided to reduce rates from 18 per cent to 12 per cent for 13 items including condensed milk, refined sugar, pasta, diabetic food; from 18 per cent to 5 per cent for six items such as fly ash, chikki, chutney powder; from 12 per cent to 5 per cent for idli/dosa batter, finished leather; and 5 per cent to nil from for items such as guar meal, frozen/dried fish.GST rates on aircraft engines have been cut from 28/18 per cent 5 per cent and on lac/shellac bangles from 3 per cent to nil.Jaitley said restaurants were not passing the benefits of input tax credit via reduction in prices to consumers and so, it was an additional burden for consumers and was resulting in unjust enrichment.Since they did not pass on the benefit of input tax credit to the consumer, they are not entitled to the benefit themselves, he said.GST rate on takeaways have also been reduced to 5 per cent without input tax credit, while rate on outdoor catering will continue to be 18 per cent with full input tax credit, an official release said.Restaurants in hotels with room tariff of Rs 7,500 and above per day will attract 18 per cent GST with full input tax credit.The Council also provided relief to businesses by easing requirements for return filing as well as lowering the penalty for late filing. Now, businesses will have to file simplified Initial GSTR-3B returns till March. Also, monthly matching of sales and purchase invoice has been kept in abeyance until March 2018.The Council decided to give a simplified GSTR-3B form to those businesses which have nil-tax liability or have no transactions to file in invoice. As many as 40 per cent of the businesses filing returns on GST Network portal have nil tax.The timeline for filing of initial returns GSTR-3B for all businesses has been extended to March from December. GSTR-3B of a month is to be filed by the 20th of the succeeding month.The Council lowered late return filing fees for businesses from Rs 200 at present. Businesses with nil-tax liability will now have to pay only Rs 20 as late fee for delayed filing of returns, while for the rest the fee is Rs 50.A committee under GSTN chairman Ajay Bhushan Pandey has been set up to look into making filing of GSTR-2 and GSTR-3 business friendly.GSTR-2 is the purchase invoice and GSTR-3 is to be generated by businesses by matching GSTR-1 and 2.The time period for filing GSTR-2 and GSTR-3 for the months of July 2017 to March 2018 would be worked out by a committee of officers, an official statement said.Until March, businesses with turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore will have to file only GSTR-1 or sales returns by the 40th day. This will be in addition to initial GSTR-3B returns. For the July-October period, businesses will have to file GSTR-1 by December 31.Goods and Services Tax was rolled out from July 1.

On Saturday, enraged protesters collected blood samples and then proceeded to write their demands in blood on the district collectorates walls.Madhya Pradesh had witnessed one of its worst farmer agitations at Mandsaur in June. Young farmers used social media platforms and WhatsApp to coordinate protests and issue updates, forcing the administration to temporarily cut off Internet connectivity in the area.The order issued by Narsinghpur additional district magistrate J Sameer Lakra under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure-1973 bans residents from posting or forwarding provocative/objectionable messages through social media platforms. It also prohibits protest rallies as well as publishing, printing or painting of provocative words on cutouts, banners, posters, hoardings and flags across the district. The order will remain in force until January 11 next year, and strict action will be taken against violators.Salil Dhagat, district agriculture officer of Narsinghpur, told HT over the phone that sugarcane farmers were demanding a significantly higher price for their produce. At present, farmers get Rs 270 per quintal of sugarcane from traders and sugar mill owners. They, however, want Rs 350 to Rs 400 for the same amount, he said. The price fixed by the government is Rs 255 per quintal.Sugarcane, sown between October and November, is a one-year duration crop. Narsinghpur accounts for over 50% of the crops total cultivation in Madhya Pradesh. Sugarcane is grown in over 20-22% (55,000 hectares) of the districts total land under cultivation of three lakh hectares."

He alleged that the Punjab government had not been providing machinery to farmers to manage stubble. He said the National Green Tribunal had asked the Centre and state government in 2015 to provide machinery to the farmers to manage stubble but till date government has not released any funds for such machinery. Thus, farmers are being forced to burn stubble and I was protesting against this attitude of the government.He added that Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had not increased even a penny in the State Assured Price (SAP) of the present sugarcane crop. Khaira demanded that government must review its decision and hike the SAP at par with Haryana, that is Rs 330 per quintal.Khaira said it was heart-rending that while retail prices of sugar were at an all-time high of Rs 4,100 per quintal, the Punjab government was denying the farmers even a meagre increase.Khaira alleged that a powerful private sugar lobby that that owns several sugar mills was behind this. He added that the nine state-owned sugar mills were running up huge losses, of nearly Rs 150 crore, owing to obsolete machinery and no backward and forward integration (co-generation plants and distilleries), leading to higher cost ofproduction.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Last years monsoon recovery raised hopes of a production rebound in the new season, beginning October 2017.Sugarcane growers in Maharashtra are set to get the second instalment payment within the next month. This comes after the Cane Control Board (CCB) sealed the payments as per the revenue sharing formula, and farmers will gain Rs 96.56 crores as per the calculations.The cane season of 2016-17 was the first when Maharashtra paid growers as per the revenue sharing formula of the C Rangarajan Committee. The panel had recommended sharing of revenue between growers and millers in the 70:30 ratio. Mills in the state had, however, paid more than the fair and remunerative price (FRP) last season as paucity of sugarcane had triggered a price war. The CCB has representatives of millers and growers and gives the final nod to the calculation according to the formula.Sambhaji Kadu Patil, the commissioner, sugar, said the total FRP payment due to the growers was Rs 8,307.40 crores. The payment amounted to Rs 8,614.76 crores as per the revenue sharing formula, he added. Mills in the state had already paid Rs 10,287.80 crores. Kadu Patil stated that of the 150 mills that had taken part in crushing last year, 112 had complied with the formula while the rest are yet to comply, he said. These mills have been given a month to pay the excess Rs 96.50 crores to the growers.After a resolution was reached regarding the first instalment between growers and millers, sugar mills in the state have commenced crushing in full force. More than 81 mills started operations with mills in western Maharashtra taking a lead. The commissionerate has initiated the online issuance of crushing licences from this season and till date, around 140 licences have been issued. Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, the Vice-President of the Maharashtra Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation, said barring six mills in Hingoli and Nanded, no mills have faced any issue regarding water availability. The quality of cane this year is good, in terms of weight and quality, he said.

People are compelled to live with fear and hate, and a hostile state, as normalised elements of everyday living. An old farmer in Uttar Pradesh lost his son transporting cattle to a lynch mob. The police did not register this as a lynch killing, the killers are untraced, and he has not even seen his sons post-mortem report. He said to us, his face lined with sorrow, Maine sabar kar liya. I have learned to endure.Attempting love, atonement, conscience and justice, the Karwan-e-Mohabbat travelled through India from east to west, traversing Assam, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The landscape changed  paddy fields, areca nut groves, sugarcane fields, millet farms, arid wastelands. But the stories we heard in state after state were frighteningly similar.We found widows, mothers, fathers and children, numbed with incomprehension at the ferocity of loathing and violence that had snatched from them their loved ones. How could parents of two boys in Nagaon, Assam come to terms with the lynching of their sons by a mob from their neighbouring village, accusing them of being cow thieves? Why would they gouge their eyes out and cut off their ears? Why would complete strangers stab Harish Pujari 14 times near Mangalore, pulling out his intestines, only because they mistook him for a Muslim when he was riding pillion behind his Muslim friend?Dalits are viciously attacked by upper caste neighbours to crush any assertion. Single women remain vulnerable to incredible medieval cruelty by family and neighbours, branded as witches. Christians in tribal regions are subjugated by violence targeting their priests, nuns and places of worship, and by laws criminalising religious conversions. But the foremost targets of hate violence by lynching and police killings are Muslims, and it is they who have most abandoned hope.Against Muslims, the hate weapon of choice is public lynching. We read of lynching of Blacks in America as public spectacles, watched by white families in picnics. In todays India, this same objective of lynching as public performance is accomplished with the video camera. Most lynch attacks are filmed by the attackers, with images of their victims  humiliated, cringing, begging for their lives. In a particularly horrifying incident in Jharkhand, in a busy market square in Ramgarh, a mob stops the car of a Muslim man. A huge pile of red meat  the size of the body of a full cow  appears on the street, the mob claiming that they seized this from the car. He is filmed as they beat him to death. Laughing faces of attackers appear in the video. They upload the videos even as they lynch the man and torch his car. His young son receives the video of his father being lynched on his mobile even as the lynching is underway.We found that lynch videos are widely and avidly shared among young Hindutva activists. As evidence of what they see as their valorous exploits. As proof that the state will protect them. As public exhibitions of the humiliation of their enemy communities. And for drafting new recruits to militant Hindu supremacist formations like the Hindu Yuva Vahini founded by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath.We found families that were bereaved by hate violence bereft of hope of either protection or justice from the state. The police in almost all the 50 families we met during our travels in eight states registered criminal charges against the victims, and treated the accused with kid gloves, not opposing their bail. A lynch mob, for instance, attacks a vehicle transporting cattle, killing some of the transporters. The police registers criminal cases of illegal cow smuggling, animal cruelty and rash driving against the victims. It obliterates completely the fact that the men were lynched. Or, in other cases, it mentions anonymous mobs who are never caught. The families of people attacked by lynch mobs sometimes do not even file a complaint with to the police, because far from getting justice, the police would register criminal charges against them.Even more worrying, we found that in Haryana for the past two years, and in Western Uttar Pradesh since Adityanath became chief minister, the police has allegedly taken on the work of the lynch mob. And unlike lynching, targeted police killings have barely registered in the national conscience.Dalits homes were gutted and women and men attacked by their Rajput neighbours in Shabirpur of Saharanpur district, only because they had the temerity to plan the installing of a five-foot statue of Ambedkar on their own community land. They could not accept that the statue on a raised platform would display Ambedkar pointing his finger at the public street on which they walked. In Dangawas in Rajasthan, six men were crushed under tractors because they dared to demand their land back after their claims had been validated by every court. In Anand district in Gujarat, the only crime of a Dalit youth was to seek a dry portion of the village commons that was not a swamp to skin a cow.But hearteningly, we found that the Dalits in all three states were angry, proud, organised and fiercely determined to fight back. In Shabbirpur, the Dalits have converted en masse to Buddhism, immersing their Hindu idols in the village ponds. Jai Bhim was their resounding slogan everywhere.This was in stark contrast to the Muslims, who are today crushed, isolated and despairing. And we found in all these local communities profound and pervasive failures of compassion. We encountered very little acknowledgment, regret or remorse among the upper-caste Hindu communities in any of the states we travelled. They remain convinced that somehow their Muslim and Dalit neighbours deserved their cruel deaths to lynch mobs or police bullets.There is a gathering darkness in our land, less and less penetrated by the light of compassion and solidarity. As India is fast mutating into a republic of hate, why do we just watch from the sidelines?In Nuh in Haryana, a young Muslim man said, A poisonous wind is blowing through our country. I feel a stranger in my own homeland.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

There are more than 60,000 vacant government posts in the region, he said.Shettar demanded that the state government should bring government doctors also under the ambit of the Karnataka Private Medical Establishment (Amendment) Bill 2017.

Her family says she had not eaten for five days. The state government is investigating whether the family was denied their monthly quota of cheaper food-grain because Shakina, who was paralysed, could not be present at the ration shop for her fingerprint authentication for Aadhaar.Shakina's husband Mohd Ishaq says they begged the ration shop owner for grains when she was paralysed.The Yogi Adityanath government says its initial inquiries suggest Shakina died of an illness, not starvation.The family alleges that it had been denied ration under the Public Distribution System for November, because Shakina - marked as the head of the family in the ration card - was too unwell to be even taken to the shop in a rickshaw, as she was every month.""My wife died because of hunger. She was very ill. We used to take her there in a rickshaw. This time she was very ill. We begged the Kotedar (ration shop owner), but he said he would not give anything without the biometrics,"" said Mohd Ishaq, Shakina's husband.The ration shop owner insisted that Shakina come for her biometric identification using a fingerprint machine at the ration shop, says the family.The family is entitled to 35 kg of subsidised wheat, rice and sugar each month under the central government-sponsored Antyodaya scheme for the poorest.Seema Tripathi, the official in charge of foodgrain supply in Bareilly, said there is no order to deny food if anyone can't be present to authenticate their biometric data.""We found out through the newspapers. She had an Antyodaya card. We are trying to find out the exact cause of the death. There is no provision of the government that people will be denied rations because of an Aadhaar card. We have alternative systems in place. If the person in whose name the Antyodaya card is cannot go, then there is a provision for other relatives to be given ration,"" Ms Tripathi said. Sources in the local administration also question the starvation allegation because they say Shakina had about Rs 4,000 in her bank account. However, they have no answer to the question of why the ration shop insisted on Aadhaar biometrics to provide their share of food.In September, an 11-year-old girl died crying for ""bhaat, bhaat (rice)"" at her village in Jharkhand, allegedly because her family had been denied ration for not linking it with an Aadhaar ID. The state government ordered that no one should be denied food benefits for want of Aadhaar-linking."

Cars frequently stopped by his roadside stall in north Delhis Rithala. Customers swiftly stepped out and gazed upon the many options. Most would buy the chikki, of course, but quite a few of them also got laddus made of puffed rice. We had never tasted this thing before, and it was delicious.Mustafa, who hails from Bareilly, said, My chikki business lasts only for a few months... until Lohri (the festival). The rest of the year, he sells fruits. The chikki seller sits on the road just outside Rithala station. The stretch has a few other similar stalls, each manned by a young man like our Mustafa.Just as we started to dream of Mustafas family making fresh chikki every morning, he told us, I get these from a factory nearby. We were feeling a tad disappointed at this discovery until we tried the chikki  it was as tasty and addictive, just as we had imagined."

This institutional framework comprises the NAA, a Standing Committee, Screening Committees in every state and the Directorate General of Safeguards in the Central Board of Excise & Customs (CBEC).Although consumer-friendly, some experts have pointed to the fact that this body could mean more government, not less, and that it could result in the harassment of businesses in some cases. Still, the anti-profiteering body is a temporary one, part of the transitory phase as India moves to a unified tax regime. The body will have a life of two years.Read more: GST rate on restaurants slashed to 5%: Will eating out get cheaper?Affected consumers who feel the benefit of commensurate reduction in prices is not being passed on when they purchase any goods or services may apply for relief to the Screening Committee in the particular state. However, in case the incident of profiteering relates to an item of mass impact with All-India ramification, the application may be directly made to the Standing Committee.After forming a prima facie view that there is an element of profiteering, the Standing Committee shall refer the matter for detailed investigation to the Director General of Safeguards, CBEC, which will report its findings to the NAA.If the NAA confirms there is a necessity to apply anti-profiteering measures, it will step in and ask businesses that have not passed on full benefits of a reduced tax burden to consumers to refund it with interest. If the undue benefit cannot be passed on to the recipient, it can be ordered to be deposited in the Consumer Welfare Fund. In rare cases, a profiteering business could lose its GST registration too.The NAA will be headed by a senior officer of the level of secretary to the central government with four technical members from the centre and states. A selection panel led by cabinet secretary P.K. Sinha has already started consultation with states to finalise the members of the panel.Read more: Exporters can manually file GST refund claims: CBECThe finance ministry said this is one more measure aimed at reassuring consumers that government is fully committed to take all possible steps to ensure the benefits of implementation of GST in terms of lower prices of the goods and services reach them.In the 23rd GST Council meeting held in Guwahati last week, the government decided to make major tax cuts, by shifting 177 items from the highest slab of 28% to the 18% slab including wrist watches, non-alcoholic beverages and shaving cream. It also decided to lower the tax rate on 54 other items that includes diabetic food, refined sugar and bamboo furniture.The top tax rate of 28% is now restricted to luxury and demerit goods like pan masala, aerated water and beverages, cigars and cigarettes, tobacco products, cement, paints, perfumes, air-conditioners, dish washing machines, washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, cars and two-wheelers, and aircraft and yachts.Aditya Singhania, Deputy General Manager, GST at Taxmann said the provisions of penalty for making excessive profiteering and even cancellation of registration of such taxpayers will certainly help in achieving the objective of establishing this body. The measure will certainly keep a check on inflation as it will help in monitoring the prices of the products for which rate cuts have been made, he added.In another move, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) allowed removal of prohibition on export of all types of pulses to ensure that farmers have greater choice in marketing their produce and in getting better remuneration for their produce.In 2016-17, Indian farmers produced 23 million tons of pulses and is the highest ever till date. The Government has procured 20 lakh tons of pulses by ensuring minimum support price or market rates, whichever is higher, directly from the farmers and this has been the highest ever procurement of pulses.Mayank Aggarwal also contributed to this story."

Photo: MintVisakhapatnam: A mechanical engineer from Andhra Pradesh raised the issue of farmer deaths caused due to automation choosing more harmful chemical ratios while spraying pesticides, at an interaction between state chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and progressive farmers at the Agtech summit held in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.In response, Naidu said his government would look into the matter and consider forming a policy.In the usage of low-volume and ultra-low volume sprays (of pesticides), the automisation ratio (which is the proportion of water mixed with chemicals), is not regulated and is automated. It changes the surface chemistry of the active particles (chemicals) automatically. If proper safety is not taken, it will have a lot of bad effects on humans and the entire surrounding ecosystem (due to a higher presence of chemicals), explained Rajkumar Bollem, an operations manager for a private company.Bollem, who belongs to the Prakasam district and works in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, claimed that 39 farmers in Maharashtra had recently died due to this problem. That was the official number, but unofficially, it was about 200. There also needs to be a policy regulating drones that spray pesticides, he told Mint on the sidelines of the event.Taking note, Naidu said there was a need for regulating automated sprays and also drone usage. He added that his government would also look into the other matters presented to him by farmers during the interaction.We will even give more preference to farmers than industries. More youth should become agri(cultural) entrepreneurs and not just entrepreneurs, he said, addressing farmers at the interaction. Naidu also said his government would provide all the resources required by the agriculture sector without any restraint.J.B. Appa Rao, a former employee of Andhra Pradesh Grameen Bank who took to farming post retirement, said one of the major challenges in the agriculture sector is getting back equal or more returns than the money invested in farming. Untimely rains only add to the problem, he added.This year I have opted for a new variety of sugar-free rice that was introduced last year. Earlier we used to go for traditional varieties of farming, Rao said.P. Rameshwar Rao, a sugarcane farmer, presented a pen-drive and file comprising photos of his farm to the state government, to showcase his farm practices. I wanted to show the government my success, he told the gathering."

It can make us notice details we may have overlooked, emotions we may not have tapped into, and, at its very best, give us a completely new perspective. While writers are the rulers of the worlds they create, photographers must make do with the world they inhabit. They must observe it patiently, waiting for that fleeting momentthat split second when everything comes together in visual coherence.Some use the medium to document the ordinary in the extraordinary, like Showkat Nanda, 34, with his haunting images of the widows of Kashmir (featured on page 1). Others use it to comment on the erasure of natural habitats, like Asmita Parelkar, a documentary-wildlife photographer whose series on animal trafficking helped create awareness of the urgency of the problem.We list young photographers with different areas of focusdocumentary, street, wildlife, fashion and interior-architecturedelving into their practice and seeking to offer insights into their visual thinking.To curate this list, we reached out to galleries and senior photographers. While we couldnt include many deserving names, we hope this gives you a glimpse. They come from different regionsKolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabadbut their photographs transcend the boundaries of time, space and geography. Each photographer has a compelling story to tellof that decisive moment which prompted them to pick up the cameraShowkat Nandas self-portrait.Showkat NandaBest known for: documentary photographyShowkat Nandas childhood memories of Kashmir are singed with the strife of the 1990s. A reticent child, he dreamt of becoming a surgeon. As violence tore through the state, however, Nandas dream crumbled. I began to believe that I would never live to grow into a young man. Survival became the topmost priority, he says. He lost his 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old cousin to the conflict. But while many children his age would go on to pick up stones, Nanda picked up the camera.Throwing stones at the Indian forces was a natural, human response to the situation one witnessed every day, he says. But I wanted to tell stories of my people. The desire to show the world the reality of a conflict that has devastated thousands of lives turned me towards photography. He borrowed his first camera, a Cosina C1 SLR, from his friends brother in 1997; he was 14 years old.I wanted to tell stories of my people [in Kashmir]. The desire to show the world the reality of a conflict that has devastated thousands of lives turned me towards photography.-In 2009, Nanda would shoot an image which would leave an indelible mark on him. I shot the image of a 12-year-old boy throwing stones at an armoured vehicle of the Indian forces, moments after his schoolmate died in my arms, Nanda says. It was a defining moment since he, a photojournalist, was compelled to play his role of a silent observer, while his instinct told him to pick up stones. He didnt rebel.Haleema, whose husband was arrested in 1998, on her way to a sit-in.Nandas photographs offer the insiders view of Kashmir. Perhaps one of his most bone-chilling works is The Endless Wait. It features Kashmiri women and children, often in isolation, waiting, silently, for the return of their husbands, brothers, sons and fathers (who disappeared mysteriously during the conflict). A womans face was the most prominent symbol of suffering in Kashmir, explains Nanda. In the early 1990s, during the crackdown, many men left their homes in fear of being arrested, spending days in forests. The only people left behind were elderly men, women and children. Nanda goes beyond the archetypal front-page images of women protesting and delves into their personal tragedies through quiet, yet haunting frames of longing and loneliness.Today, the 34-year-old has won recognition for his work: He has been a recipient of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Fund grant (2016), won the National Press Photo Award (2011), and a Fulbright fellow (2012). He has done his postgraduation in photojournalism from the University of Missouri, US, and in mass communication, from the University of Kashmir. Nanda is currently busy teaching visual storytelling to young photographers in Kashmir.Deepshikas self-portrait.Deepshikha JainBest known for: architecture photographyFor architecture photographer Deepshikha Jain, the process of looking at a building for hours and observing its intricate detailing is akin to reading a novel. One has to know and learn every part of it. Jain belongs to a group of young photographers who believe it is important to document the architectural facades that define an urban landscape. Architectural photography in India, as a niche or a specialization, didnt exist (until) almost eight years ago, she says.Jains two series, BOMbai and Urban Postcards, capture the different facets of the city, from modern skyscrapers to buildings caged in scaffolding. It is an attempt, perhaps, to immortalize the city through black and white stills.-Her interest in the visual arts led her to pursue a masters in architectural photography from the Spos International Photography School, Paris (2009-10). While many of her batchmates chose the field of fashion photography, Jain chose to shoot archaic arches and modern symmetrical squares. She was invariably drawn to mansions falling into disrepair, as well as modernist masterpieces. I love architecture that is rooted, that has a story, that is raw and minimalist, and is all about the form which complements the function, she says.From the series Urban Postcards.Her first assignment was photographing some buildings designed by award-winning architect Anupama Kundoo in Auroville, in 2010. Jain has since worked for architects such as Annkur Khosla, Riyaz Tayyibji, and the architecture firm Morphogenesis, and shot for various publications, including Architectural Digest, Harpers Bazaar and Vogue.I think Bombay has influenced my sense of storytelling. I find urban stories very compelling, says the Mumbai-based 31-year-old.Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier, Paris, France (built from 1928-31).Her two series, Bombai and Urban Postcards, capture the different facets of the city, from modern skyscrapers to buildings caged in scaffolding. It is an attempt, perhaps, to immortalize the city through black and white stills.Bombay as we knew it has been disappearing. Matunga and Dadar were different from Bandra; Andheri was different from Borivali. But as the old structures are being erased and newer ones are built, my attempt is to document that change.Asmitas self-portrait.Asmita ParelkarBest known for: wildlife photographyMumbai-based Asmita Parelkars favourite image is from 1989. Its a photograph by Michael Nichols of primatologist Jane Goodall, with strands of her hair, backlit by the sun, seeming to fall delicately into the palm of a chimpanzee. It was the tenderness shared between two species that resonated with me, she says. At a broader level though, that tenderness is absent between humans and animals.Parelkar, 34, refers to another photograph, by Biplab Hazra, who won the Sanctuary Wildlife Photographer of the Year award earlier this month. The image, shot in West Bengal, shows a baby elephant on fire as it flees a mob with its mother. We dont respect animals or their habitat at all. Wild habitats are burnt down in the name of urbanization. That angst informs Parelkars photographic direction. Stories related to wildlife conservation and endangered species form the backbone of her work.From the series Illegal Wildlife Trade.Her series Illegal Wildlife Trade puts the spotlight on the brutality behind the slaughter and trafficking of animals. Parelkar was allowed access by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (which regulates the import and export of flora and fauna in the US) for it. They have a lab in Long Island, which works as a repository for the animals that are confiscated at harbours and airports. I made two-three trips and managed to photograph the animals, she says.As humans, weve pushed animals out of their natural habitat. While zoos exist under the pretext of protecting these animals, they ironically serve to entertain us.-While studying photojournalism at the International Center of Photography, New York (2010-11), Parelkar worked on a series that featured animals in captivity, particularly those living in zoos. As humans, weve pushed animals out of their natural habitat. While zoos exist under the pretext of protecting these animals, they ironically serve to entertain us, she says. Parelkar shot the series in five zoos across New York and its boroughs. In comparison to the zoos in India, she observes, these man-made habitats in New York were pristine. The dioramas replicated the natural habitat of the animals really well. But if you think about it, the paintings on the walls were fake. They have been done for our eyes. These animals were still in a confined space.From the series Giraffe Behind The Door.This project Giraffe Behind The Door, still ongoing, was published in The New York Times in 2011.Parelkar, who also designs photobooks, is part of the BIND collective, a platform that curates visual book exhibitions. This year, she has helped the collective put together Travelling Library, a pop-up photobook exhibition at the GoaPhoto festival (23-26 November).Saumya Khandelwals portrait by Reuben Singh.Saumya KhandelwalBest known for: documentary photographySaumya Khandelwal uses her camera as a truth-telling instrument, taking us on a cross-country ride to the peripheries, and making us look at social anomalies we would rather hide under the carpet. Her ongoing series, Child Brides Of Shravasti, shot over a period of three years, is a peephole view into the lives of young girls from a small town in Uttar Pradesh who are prematurely pushed into adulthood. There is an incomparable beauty in her imagesthey are piercingly intimate and poignant. My approach to making photos is always to reveal something more about the people I am photographing than just the information of whats happening, says Khandelwal. Instead of objectifying them, I would like to make it subjective, where the viewer can put a context to the lives of these people.Khandelwals ongoing series, Child Brides of Shravasti, is a peephole view into the lives of young girls from a small town in Uttar Pradesh who are prematurely pushed into adulthood.-From Alex Webb to Raghubir Singh, Khandelwals visual language has been influenced by their phenomenal oeuvres. Having been mentored by senior photographer Amit Mehra since 2012, she has gone on to assist Delhi Photo Festivals co-founder Prashant Panjiar, and VII photo agency photographers Jessica Dimmock and Stephanie Sinclair. The 27-year-old is also the recipient of the Getty Images Instagram Grant (2017), National Foundation of India Award (2017) and the Neel Dongre Photography Grant (2014 and 2015).Images from the series Child Brides Of Shravasti.Currently an in-house photographer at Thomson Reuters in New Delhi, Khandelwal also works on personal projects. They are reflective of her meditative documentary skills, where she immerses herself into the milieu, slowly unravelling its layers, one photograph at a time. Her first serious project was WaterThe Dying Lifeline (2013), which documented the devastating conditions of Indias existing water bodies. The series proved to be a turning point, convincing her to consider photography as a profession.Images from the series Child Brides Of Shravasti.When she was working in an Indian publication, she was the only woman photographer in the team. I hadnt looked at my profession through the lens of gender before, she says. I would get stories that involved women with the expectation that the subjects will be more comfortable in my presence, she says. So it was an opportunity to work on good stories. To make a mark in the field as a woman is challenging. But Khandelwal used it to her advantage. With an approach that is steeped in ethnography and visual journalism, Khandelwal is a photographer to reckon with.Ronny Sens portrait by Shreya Dev Dube.Ronny SenBest known for: documentary/street photographyRonny Sen is self-effacing as he tries to recall the first image that left an impact on him. It was a black and white image by Pablo Bartholomew in 1975, of Poohperhaps one of Bartholomews most unforgettable subjectslying on a bed, looking directly at the camera. There was something very special about the photograph, says Sen. Its a memory of an infatuation that grew into something incomprehensibly more. When I look at this photograph, it almost makes me touch that time. Thats the power of this medium.Sen received the prestigious Getty Images Instagram Grant last year for his powerful documentary work on Jharkhands Jharia coal town that has had, for decades, an intense, uncontrolled fire burning underground. He also has a string of accolades to his name, including being the recipient of artist residencies in Japan (2012) and Poland (2015). The 30-year-old, who began his journey in photography in Salt Lake, Kolkata, in 2006, began shooting in monochrome. His visual language has been heavily influenced by the works of the Japanese photographers Daid Moriyama and Eikoh Hosoe, as well as Bengali film-maker Ritwik Ghatak.Untitled from the series Dont Breathe.A large part of Sens pictorial record is marked by compositions of barely recognizable figures shot in low light, often accompanied by grains and blurs. There is a jarring, almost unsettling theme that pulsates through his work: shattered windows, deliberately blackened faces, an anonymous arm here, an unrecognizable torso there. Sens photographs are hypnotic, be it his first, dark, quasi-surreal photobook Khmer Din (2013), which depicts the grim underbelly of Siem Reap, Cambodia, or the palpably raucous atmosphere depicted in Dont Breathe (a series that began in 2008 and was first exhibited in 2011), which conveys the experience of travelling in unreserved train compartments.Growing up in the late 1990s was pretty chaotic. We were surviving one day at a time. It was the fear of death that got me closer to photography.-To an untrained eye, however, his frames may seem imprecise and flawed. Many of his works carry macabre overtonesreminiscent of a difficult past. Sen grew up on the streets of Kolkata, where many of his friends were addicted to brown sugar. Growing up in the late 1990s was pretty chaotic, he says. We were surviving one day at a time. Staying alive was a big deal. It was the fear of death that got me closer to photography, says Sen. To give some meaning to my life, art became extremely important.Untitled from the series Khmer Din.His series New World Chronicles Of An Old World Colour (2015), which he created while at an art residency at the Gdask City Gallery in Poland, was a departure from his black and white photography. Polish film-maker Krzysztof Kielowskis Three Colours trilogy served as inspiration, with Sen depicting the melancholic Polish winter, while looking for traces of red, where solidarity had once emerged and how capitalism had finally taken over today. He is currently working on his first feature film, titled Cat Sticks (slated for release in early 2018)the screenplay has been co-written with Soumyak Kanti DeBiswas. He is also working on a project commissioned by Royal Enfield (in association with the India Foundation for the Arts) to travel and photograph his journeys for a possible book.Swarat Ghoshs self-portrait.Swarat GhoshBest known for: street photographyAcross the canvas of sky, an outstretched arm, an umbrella thrown in the air and a plane taking flight. In another time, in one of Hyderabads oldest wrestling precincts in Yakutpura, a young boy catapults against a wall with the help of a rope, his head coveringalmost merging withthat of another boy standing next to him. There is a certain charm, a nuanced idiosyncrasy in Swarat Ghoshs images.His images, never static, are often characterized by levity. Ghoshs angles are peculiar; there are figures that seem to appear by chance; and others that seem to merge. Each element in the composition, though, falls into an unexpected coherence.Ghoshs angles are peculiar; there are figures that seem to appear by chance; and others that seem to merge. Each element in the composition, though, falls into an unexpected coherence.-It was in 2012 that Ghoshs wife gifted him his first camera, a Nikon D3000, for Durga Puja. I had never shot a single image before that, so I dont know what made her give me a camera, Ghosh says, laughing, over the phone. The gift kindled his interest in photography. Based in Hyderabad, Ghosh had a demanding 12-hour job as a graphic designer, but in his spare time, he enrolled in photography clubs, and explored different parts of the city with his group.Photographed near Mumbai airport, from the series Beyond Street.As an aspiring street photographer, the 37-year-old spent nights poring over booksfrom Robert Franks exquisite visual book, The Americans, which captured the lives of people in the 1950s, to Raghu Rais revolutionary documentation of Kolkata locals, Calcutta. In addition, the collective works of veteran photographers Kaushal Parikh and Prashant Godbole influenced him too.He has been a finalist in the reputed LensCulture Street Photography competition (2017), won the Neel Dongre Awards for Excellence in Photography (2016-17) and has been featured in one of the most sought after international photography publications, BURN magazine, as well as the National Geographic Traveller magazine. His works have been exhibited in Paris, London, Glasgow and Istanbul, as well as Mumbai and Hyderabad, among other cities.Young wrestlers at Yakutpura, Old Hyderabad, from the series Beyond Street.While his ongoing series, Beyond Street, emerged on the edit table when he realized that certain patterns and repetitions emerged while placing the images together, another series that he has been working on features his family. I think it is our personal stories that are the real stories which need to be preserved in memory and in physical form, he says.Nisha Purushothamans self-portrait.Nisha PurushothamanBest known for: wildlife photographyWildlife photography is defined by two demanding prerequisitessolitude as an occupational trait and invisibility as a skill to master. A large part of Nisha Purushothamans life involves living away from the city, meandering through sprawling, open grasslands, and turning wildlife photography into her own branch of animal anthropology. From a group of cheetahs that appear to have broken away from a serious discussion, to capturing a rhinoceros crowned by birds as the sun setsPurushothamans images capture the interiority of the animal empire, making the unseen seen.We have to ensure that our work is used effectively to comment on issues as diverse as mountaintop removal mining and deforestation, or the very real impact of oil spills on marine life.-Purushothaman was born in Paravur, a small coastal village in Kollam, Kerala. Paddy fields and the Polachira wetlands were a 10-minute walk away from home. Becoming a person who loved nature, therefore, was not difficult, she says. It was only years later though, in 2008, when Purushothaman shifted to Dubai to work as a project manager at an advertising firm, that her interest in wildlife photography surfaced. It all started with a weekend photography trip during which she spotted over 150 species. I fell in love with birds. Slowly, instead of weekends, I started to shoot every day, at least an hour before I headed to work. And the more time I spent shooting, the more I became motivated to become a nature photographer.Cheetahs in Maasai Mara, Kenya.Since then, Purushothaman has travelled to some of the most forbidding terrain across India, Kenya, Tanzania, Alaska and Russia. She has photographed over 200 birds, as well as tigers, leopards and lions. As a practice, Purushothaman visits sanctuaries near her home in Dubai at least two-four times a week. I start from home around 4.30am and shoot till 10am. Nothing comes easy. As a wildlife photographer, you need to be fit in order to carry equipment, which can be as heavy as 10kg. Sometimes you even have to trek long distances, she says.An elephant in Amboseli National Park, Kenya.In 2004, Purushothaman, along with her friend Hermis Haridas, established Paws Trails Explorers, a global platform for wildlife conservation, travel and photography. Using photographs to protect animals is immensely important to her. We have to ensure that our work is used effectively to comment on issues as diverse as mountaintop removal mining and deforestation, or the very real impact of oil spills on marine life. In 2016-17, Purushothaman became a finalist for the Hamdan International Photography Award. A TEDx speaker, she has hosted over 30 photography workshops around the world.Hashim Badanis self-portrait.Hashim BadaniBest known for: fashion photographyA model struts across a blur of crayon-ish greens and neon.

He ventured into commercial fashion photography in early 2016 to explore his ability to shoot differently. His fashion shoots developed an idiosyncratic identity, involving a blend of orchestrated and real people/life situations.An Irani caf fashion shoot for Vogue India.Badanis process of conjuring up images is akin to film-making. I try to build a narrative in my head. There is a loose script and the models are characters in that story. I assign a mood, a personality and situation to them, and it makes the process a lot more fun, he says. In fact, as an ode to Wong Kar-wai, Badani collaborated with Mumbai-based fashion brand Obataimu to weave in the theme of Chungking Express into a shoot for the brands Wabi Sabi line.Having shot for Vogue India, Rolling Stone India, Lonely Planet Magazine India and National Geographic Traveller India, Badanis work is not confined to fashion photography. He is currently collaborating with writer Zeenat Nagree on a story on Myanmars Rohingyas. Were trying to document the challenges they face in their daily life, their culture, and what the future holds for them, keeping in mind the current government stand, he says.Anshika Varmas portrait by Adil Hasan.Anshika VarmaBest known for: interiors/documentary photographyPhotographing interiors is a tough task. Attention to detail is of prime importance, of course, but its the ability to convey the intimacy of a luxurious restaurant, the quaintness of a caf, or the charm of a newly opened retail store, that marks out a good photographer. It involves the craft of making a three-dimensional space look visually appealing in the format of an uncompromisingly flat, often rectangular frame.Anshika Varmas initiation into photography happened when she was a student of social communications media at Sophia Polytechnic in Mumbai. I felt that images could transport people to different worlds. It was perhaps the multiplicity of different realities that got me hooked to photography, she says. Her first camera, a borrowed one, was a Nikon F65 SLR film camera. I had asked my mother to lend me her camera and some film so that I could walk around Bombay with it. I still have the camera up in my studio although I dont use it any more.Detail from a space designed by Adil Ahmad, Mumbai.From images of interior spaces that are suffused with dense, contrasting colours, to framing objects that come together in a seamless symmetry, Varma has the ability to balance the incongruous. Symmetry becomes primary for me while working with interiors. Whether the aesthetic of design is minimal or ostentatious, its important for the eye to not get lost in clutter, she says.Symmetry becomes primary for me while working with interiors. Whether the aesthetic of design is minimal or ostentatious, its important for the eye to not get lost in clutter.-In fact, Varma has explored myriad facets of photographyfrom documentary (dealing with themes of identity, memory and objects) to curating exhibitionsshe was co-curator of A Million Mutinies Later: India At 70, which was shown at Ffotogallery in Cardiff, Wales, in July. It looked into the everyday revolutions that are slowly and steadily transforming the social, cultural and political fabric of the nation, she writes on her website. Varmas work has appeared in Cond Nast Traveller, Motherland and People magazines, among other publications. She has also worked for independent brands like restaurants DIVA, Qla and Mainland China, and fashion brands like Shantanu & Nikhil.Prarthna Singh.Prarthna SinghBest known for: fashion photographyCouched in minimalism, Prarthna Singhs fashion photography veers away from the theatricalthere arent any extravagant backdrops or carnival-esque props.

They appear to be everyday, ordinary women rather than models, shot in natural light. In Singhs pictures, the clothing is the hero.Singhs photography journey began at the age of 19 when she bought her first cameraa second-hand Nikon FM2. She would spend hours in the darkroom drenched in the dull red glow, watching pictures come to life. She found it therapeutic.Couched in minimalism, Prarthna Singhs fashion photography veers away from the theatricalthere arent any extravagant backdrops or carnival-esque props.-She studied photography at Rhode Island School of Design, US, and says that gave her exposure to myriad experiences, prodding her to become a thinker within and beyond a particular artistic medium.Her visual languageone that is unadulterated by the superfluoustakes cues from the world of August Sanders Citizens Of The Twentieth Century, a monumental collection of 431 frames featuring individuals from different strata of German society between 1892 and 1952. My early introduction to portraiture was through Sanders work, says Singh. What I admire most about his powerful, yet subtly composed, imagery is the honesty in both thought and approach, she says. Even today, when I am looking for inspiration, I revisit it, and it affirms my belief that a compelling portrait is an invitation to envision.An image from Neighbourhood Watch, a personal body of work.In the past two years, Singh has consciously steered away from fashion photography to focus on personal projects that are driven by reportage and deal with socially relevant themes. The Wrestlers, for instance, features female wrestlers who have struggled hard to upend the feminine stereotype and transcend social norms in India. The series offers an insight not only into Singhs versatility as an artist, but is a reflection on her awareness as an observer on gender in a patriarchal set-up. The Wrestlers was part of Photographing The Female, which was exhibited at the FOCUS Photography Festival in Mumbai in March. For me the wrestlers are symbolic, wrote Singh in her introduction to the series. Each of their stories speaks of overcoming innumerable hardships, fighting family pressure and most importantly, living gender differently.An image for fashion label Bodice.In 2017, Singh was one of the 29 finalists at the FCBarcelona Photo Awards, and was handpicked by Focs Scotland (an international platform that invites conversations on identity and culture) to exhibit her work at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.

She died a few years ago.However, recent seizures have led ANC sleuths to suspect that the same drug is being circulated once more.Little is known about Kamlis personal life. Her foray into the narcotics trade came at a time when the D Company facilitated the inflow of synthetic opioids from Pakistan and south-east Asia into the city in the 1980s. The deadly drug  mostly brown sugar  was called smack or skag and peddled in the streets. Its customers? Celebrities and children from across socio-economic strata.At that point of time, Kamli, a migrant who had settled in Tardeo slums, held sway over the drug trade in south Mumbai through a trusted network of peddlers. It was said that the market for her drug was the dark alleys of Ballard Estate. After the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, the police initiated an all-out crackdown on the drug syndicate. After a few run-ins with the law, Kamli shut shop temporarily as the supply chain had dried up.Taking advantage of the lack of drugs available on the market, Kamli resumed operations once more in the late 1990s as the prices of contraband soared. By this time, she had found a way to bypass the law  through a newfound chemical spray that altered the molecular composition of the drug while retaining its effectiveness.She began peddling Kamli, which became an instant hit among the poor and lower middle-class as it cost a fraction of what pure heroin did, said sources. Its composition also meant that users and peddlers could get away in case of arrest under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.Old ANC records suggest that Kamlis men were caught peddling the drug several times. However, the police had to let them ago after forensic tests to detect brown sugar came back negative.Now, ANC sources suspect that a new cartel has resumed the production of Kamli using the old modus operandi.Cartels procure high-grade heroin at a street price of Rs2.5 crore a kg. Later, harmless additives such as baking soda or monosodium glutamate is added to increase the quantity and bring down the retail cost. For every kg of pure heroin, 4kg of additives are added. Each kg is sold to small distributers at Rs1 crore a kg.Retailers convert the adulterated drug into Kamli by spraying it with a certain chemical. Sources said they suspect that the operation is carried out at rented flats on the outskirts of Navi Mumbai.While a pouch containing 1g Kamli is sold at Rs250 to Rs300 on the street, pure drugs of the same volume cost around Rs5,000.Noted anti-drug campaigner Dr Yusuf Merchant said it was difficult to alter the molecular composition of the drug by adding another chemical to it. I am unaware of this particular drug. It is possible that another method could have been used to alter it, he said."

Be it education, irrigation, public works or any other department. Each of them has come to a standstill. Vikas in Uttarakhand has virtually gone on a holiday, the senior Congress leader told reporters here.Slamming the BJP government over the claims that vikas karya (development works) was suffering due to paucity of funds, Rawat said that his government had left enough money in the state exchequer, to meet needs for at least four months. He all alleged that no fresh revenue collection had been made by the present dispensation during that period.They have failed to manage the states finances well which is why the development is getting hampered, Rawat said.Expressing shock at the reduction in central grants to Uttarakhand, he said, We had fought with the Centre to get the funding pattern for the hill state restored to 90:10. Our efforts paid off with the Union Finance Ministry restoring the funding pattern. But still, quite shocking, central grants to the state have declined substantially. Why is this happening? People of the state have a right to know and the chief Minister must explain.Rawat, whod lost on both the seats he contested during the assembly elections earlier this year, also alleged that the Trivendra Singh Rawat dispensation failed to present Uttarakhands stand strongly at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council and demanded to know who was bearing the expenses of providing Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) cover to some BJP leaders in the state.Taking a jibe at the BJP leaders jumle (idiomatic expressions not meant to be taken seriously), Rawat, who has been holding fruit-parties including that of jamun (blackberry) for mediapersons, said, Unke jumlon se diabetes hogi, humare jamun (party) se wo duur bhagegi (their sugary promises will give you diabetes, our blackberry parties will help you stay healthy).The BJP was quick to react comparing the Congress leaders allegations to bubbles blown by children, which disappear after a while. The (BJPs) government and party are working well in tandem for states development which has left the Congress leaders baffled. Just like children blow bubbles for their entertainment, public knows about their (Congress) allegations and treats them as nothing more than jokes, BJPs state media in charge Devendra Bhasin said.SC verdict on rebels vindicates our standOn the Supreme Court recently disposing off the pleas of the nine former Congress MLAs challenging their disqualification by the then Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly, former chief minister Harish Rawat said the top courts verdict had once again proved that those who rebelled against his government on March 18, 2016, were party defectors. Welcoming the courts order, which termed the pleas of the disqualified members as academic in nature as a new Assembly had already come into being in Uttarakhand, he said, Hopefully, it will help put an end to the politics of defection in the state."

Reason: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis visited Shivaji Park to pay homage to Sena founder, the late Bal Thackeray, and later in a closed-door meeting with Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Friday.The last time the two leaders were together at a public function was at the launch of NCP leader Praful Patels pictorial biography in May 2017.Thackeray is unlikely to campaign for the Sena candidates in the Gujarat Assembly polls or send top leaders of the party for this. Significantly, Thackeray also refused to comment on the police firing on agitating sugarcane farmers in Ahmednagar, in which two farmers were injured.On the fifth death anniversary of the Sena founder, Fadnavis visited his memorial at Shivaji Park and later launched a website for a new Bal Thackeray memorial, which is planned at the mayors bungalow. He followed this up with a 30-minute meeting with Thackeray.There were speculations that the two leaders discussed the Senas objection to former chief minister Narayan Ranes entry to the state cabinet as the BJPs ally. While there was no official word on what transpired at the meeting, Thackeray seemed to have softened his stance a bit.He said no decision has been taken as yet on his visit to Gujarat for campaigning.Read moreFollowing the meeting with Fadnavis, Thackeray was asked by a group of reporters whether he would address a rally in Gujarat, he said, It is not decided yet, but if I do, you will say that being in the NDA, we are campaigning against the government.He also refused to take any stand on the recent firing incident on farmers in Shegaon, Ahmednagar district. Interestingly, the party has taken a pro-farmer stance in the past few months and has demanded a loan waiver from the BJP-led government and even staged walk-outs in the state Assembly on the issue. Another indicator of the renewed stance is that the Sena has decided it wont field a candidate against the BJP for a Mumbai civic body by-poll in Kandivli. The gesture from Thackeray came at a time when both parties are trying to wrest control over the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Will this truce last long? Nobody in the ruling alliance can guarantee this.The Sena is going to contest around 60 seats in Gujarat where the polls are slated on December 9 and December 14. Last week, it had planned to take key leaders and even its ministers in the state government to campaign in the neighbouring state.A senior Sena leader, who is involved in poll planning, said they are currently evaluating candidates in the state and would soon put out a list of the candidates. According to the leader, the party does not have a strong base in Gujarat. We are still evaluating the list of people we can field. The Sena as a party does not have a strong base there. So electorally and politically we dont stand to gain much from the election, the senior leader told HT.Fadnavis said the process of handing over the land for a memorial was in the last stages. Once the process is completed, the plot will be handed over to the Shiv Sena Pramukh Balasaheb Thackeray Memorial Trust. The government is making all efforts to clear it as a priority,he said.The Sena also handed over cheque of Rs2 crore for the CMs Farmer Relief Fund to Fadnavis. All Sena MPs, MLAs and corporators donated a months salary for farmers and Uddhav donated Rs10 lakh towards the fund."

The GST rate cut was to implemented from 15 November.In her letter to all the major FMCG companies, Sarna pointed out the need to immediately revise the MRP on all the products for which the tax reductions have been announced by the GST Council, according a statement by the finance ministry.She has also requested all to give wide publicity to the revised MRP of products. The government expects that the industry should immediately respond to the earlier appeal made by the finance minister on this issue, it said.GST rates on a number of items have also been reduced from 18% to 12% and from 12% to 5%. The benefit of reduction in the GST rate has to be passed on by the suppliers to the consumers by way of commensurate reduction in prices. The reduction in GST rates is also expected to encourage domestic demand and investment, the ministry said.Items on which tax rate has been cut from 28% to 18% include chewing gum, chocolates, coffee, custard powder, marble and granite, dental hygiene products, polishes and creams, sanitary ware, leather clothing, artificial fur, wigs, cookers, stoves, after-shave, deodorant, detergent and washing power, razors and blades, cutlery, storage water heater, batteries, goggles, wrist watches and mattress.Tax rate on condensed mil, refined sugar, pasta curry paste, diabetic food, medical grade oxygen, printing ink, hand bags, hats, spectacles frame and bamboo/cane furniture has been cut from 18% to 12%.The top tax rate of 28% is now restricted to 50 items, including white goods, cement, paints, luxury and demerit goods like pan masala, aerated water and beverages, cigars and cigarettes, tobacco products.Last week, finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia had said that FMCG firms and big corporates will have to ensure that retailers pass on the benefit of GST rate cut to consumers and sell their products only after lowering the MRP.When asked what would happen if any retailer does not pass on the benefit despite the corporate reducing the rate, Adhia said the responsibility would rest with the FMCG firm.I again want to appeal to FMCG companies that if they want to be safe from anti-profiteering action then they have to ensure that their whole retail chain is informed and immediately pass on the effect of reduction of tax rate from 28% to 18% to consumers, Adhia, who is also the revenue secretary, had said."

Why should the committee hold the meeting in Delhi rather than Lucknow, where all officials have their offices? said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat buyers welfare association.To attend these meetings, the staff of the three ministers have to travel from Lucknow to Delhi.Since their office is located in Lucknow they can call the two (authority) CEOs for a meeting in Lucknow and thuse save the money spent on rent and food in Delhi.

The neighbouring Haryana has fixed the SAP at Rs 330 per quintal for this season.Sukhwinder Singh, a cane grower from Bhattian village in Machhiwara of Ludhiana district, said he has reduced the area under sugarcane cultivation to an acre from 12 acres.Before that, I used to grow sugarcane on 35 acres, but I now have decided to cultivate other crops due to high input cost and low returns, he said.The state expects 675 lakh quintal sugarcane production this season.Cane commissioner Jaswant Singh told HT that due to financial constraints, the government has decided not to hike cane price. The farmers are yet to be paid 46 crore for the last years produce. The farmers should not seek hike but improve productivity and grow vegetables, along with sugarcane, he said.Punjab cant match Haryana in increasing the cane price as the neighbouring state better placed financially, he added.Rana Inder Partap Singh who runs a sugar mill in Gurdaspur said they were already paying Rs 45 more to the farmers than the price fixed by the Centre.Rajinder Singh Raju Chadha, owner of the Dasuya sugar mill, predicted increase in sugar production this season, leading to fall in sugar prices.He said the wholesale price of sugar is Rs 3,550 per quintal, where as it is costing Rs 4,100 per quintal. This includes 5% GST (Rs 200), Rs 50 transportation charges and Rs 100 as dealer margin.We are already incurring huge loses, as a quintal of sugar is selling at ex-factory price of Rs 3,550 per quintal and it would further fall to Rs 3,400 quintal in a few days, said Rana Inderbir.Chadha said, prices of molasses, a byproduct of sugarcane, which used to cover up the losses, have fallen from Rs 4,000 per tonne to Rs 1,000 per tonne, he said.Ban import of sugar from PakistanEvery week, traders from Delhi are Kolkata are importing 25,000 quintals of sugar from Pakistan. The government should ban the import of sugar to save the states industry, said Rana Inderbir.Farmers to gherao MLAs housesA faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, led by Balbir Singh Rajewal, has decided to gherao houses of Punjab MLAs as a mark of protest against the state governments failure to fulfil the pre-poll promise of a complete farm loan waiver.The farmers would also demand increase in SAP of sugarcane on a par with Haryana."

A month after Diwali and three weeks ahead of the winter session, there was no news about the expansion. In fact, developments on last Friday were seen contrary to what was being expected. On Sena founder the late Bal Thackerays fifth death anniversary on Friday, Fadnavis made it a point to visit Thackerays memorial at Shivaji Park. He attended a small function organized by a government-appointed committee to develop Thackerays memorial at mayors Bungalow and later had a half-an-hour long meeting with Uddhav Thackeray.After the meeting, Thackeray seemed a bit softened towards the BJP. He chose not to criticise the government over firing at sugarcane farmers in Ahmednagar on November 15, which was in sharp contrast to what the Sena has been doing -- leaving no opportunity to target the BJP governments in the state or at the Centre. Thackeray also indicated he was unlikely to campaign against the BJP in Gujarat, where the Sena is fielding candidates.In political circles, these developments led to speculations whether the Sena was happy with Fadnavis for preventing or at least delaying Ranes inclusion in the state cabinet. Thackeray has been strongly opposed to his bete noire Rane entering the state cabinet.A section in the BJP was also pointing out that the party top brass has been busy with Assembly elections in Gujarat and as such the decision on cabinet expansion in Maharashtra could be taken after the elections in the neighbouring state. Some Sena leaders, too, wanted the expansion to be postponed till the Gujarat election results were declared. Their logic was the BJPs attitude towards allies may change if it suffers a setback in Gujarat.The developments on Monday, however, indicate there could be an expansion of the cabinet in the coming days. Does that mean Fadnavis has managed to convince Thackeray to let Rane  technically a BJP ally -- be part of the state cabinet?In any case, several equations in Maharashtra politics are set to change if the BJP goes ahead with Ranes inclusion. Will Sena, especially Thackeray, forgive Rane or will it plan an exit from the National Democratic Alliance? The rumours about the same have been around ever since NCP chief Sharad Pawar disclosed that Thackeray met him and seemed upset with the BJP. On the other hand, if Fadnavis manages to broker peace between Thackeray and Rane, the NCP would be forced to return to the Congress-led UPA camp. Already, Pawar has started praising Gandhi familys role in Indias politics.Countering the selfie-attackRecently, public works minister Chandrakant Patil had to face an attack of selfies, after NCP MP Supriya Sule started a selfie with potholes campaign to highlight the issue.

Irked with it, Patil has now asked public works department officers to click pictures of the road repair work and post it on Twitter. He makes it a point to retweet these pics."

The 20-page itemised bill from the hospital added up to Rs 18 lakh.The case came into light when Union health minister JP Nadda responded to a family friends tweet expressing outrage about the billing. We will take all the necessary actions, the minister said on Twitter. The Union health ministry has asked the Haryana government to initiate an urgent probe into the allegations and submit an action taken report within two weeks.Please provide me details on hfwminister@gov.in .We will take all the necessary action. https://t.co/dq273L66cK  Jagat Prakash Nadda (@JPNadda) November 20, 2017The girl, Adya Singh, was referred to Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, after she was diagnosed with dengue and her condition deteriorated August 31. She was put on ventilator the next day.She was on ventilator and dialysis for 15 days. The doctors had initially said that she should come off life-support in 24 hours. When that did not happen, they said they wanted to wait and see. After three or four days, we were told that there might be some brain damage. But no CT/MRI was done and the treatment continued, said Adyas father Jayant Singh, an IT professional from Gurgaon.Seven-year-old baby Adya was brought in to Fortis Memorial Research Institute (Gurgaon), from another private hospital on the morning of 31st August, 2017. She was admitted with Severe Dengue which progressed to Dengue Shock Syndrome and was managed on IV fluids and supportive treatment as there was a progressive fall in platelet count and hemoconcentration (decrease in blood plasma volume). As her condition deteriorated, she had to be put on ventilatory support within 48 hours. The family was kept informed of the critical condition of the child and the poor prognosis in these situations, a hospital statement said.All standard medical protocols were followed in treating the patient and clinical guidelines were adhered to, the hospital said.When she passed away, we thought at least the doctors tried everything, Jayant said. It was only after the doctors proposed a full-body plasma transplant (a procedure to remove, treat and return blood plasma), despite the brain damage, that the family began to question in the hospital practices.My first question was, why perform the procedure? Will it help her? With 80% brain damage, what would her life be like? The doctors said they can save the other organs, said Singh. When the family refused and requested a discharge, they were told they would have to leave against medical advice.We were asked to arrange for a private ambulance as the hospital authorities told us they not liable to provide one if patients leave against medical advice, Singh said.The family said they decided to have Adya discharged from the hospital, and she died at the hospital premise before she could be transferred to another hospital in a private ambulance. Singh added that the family had to request another hospital to take her in just to declare her dead.We had a medical insurance and I paid around Rs 10 lakh above it too, without even questioning them. But, after we signed the papers stating that we were leaving against medical advice, we were asked to go back and pay for the hospital gown Adya was wearing because she couldnt fit into her clothes, said Singh.When they finally looked at the bill they realised that in the period of 15 days some 660 syringes and 2,700 gloves were used. We are not from the medical background and even then some of the things appeared outrageous, he said.The billing details shared on Twitter show that they were charged Rs 200 for strips to check blood sugar levels. Similar strips are sold on the Fortis website for Rs 13 per piece, the family claimed.Patient was treated in the Paediatric ICU (PICU) for 15 days and was critical right from the time of admission requiring Intensive monitoring. Treatment during these 15 days included mechanical ventilation, high frequency ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, intravenous antibiotics, inotropes, sedation and analgesia. Care of ventilated patients in ICU requires a high number of consumables as per globally accepted infection control protocols. All consumables are transparently reflected in records and charged as per actual, the hospital said.The family said they will file a case in consumer court."
5a5356729855b770e037f0f8,Fighting tomorrow’s public health battle,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/wvHTlLzHX1Mmp2ptjJcdGO/Fighting-tomorrows-public-health-battle.html,2017-11-21,"Ensuring that citizens lead a more physically active life would directly address a number of risk factors for NCDs. Illustration: Jayachandran/MintThe India: Health Of The Nations States report, released last week, makes two things abundantly clear. The first is that the lack of such a granular, state-wise assessment of Indias public health scenario and trends in a common framework until now has been an inexplicable failure on the part of previous governments. The Narendra Modi government has done well to rectify the lack. The second is that the nature of the countrys health challenges has changed sharply over the past couple of decades and is going to continue changing.The latter should not come as a surprise. Global precedent shows that a countrys health profile changes as its economy and level of urbanization grow. The threat posed by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseasescollectively termed infectious and associated diseases in the reportdeclines, and the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) grows. India is no different, even if the rapidity and extent of the change are startling.In 1990, the total disease burden of infectious and associated diseases in the country, measured using the metric of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was 61%. The burden of NCDs at the time was 30%. Cut to 2016 and those numbers have just about flipped: infectious and associated diseases account for 33% of the disease burden while NCDs account for 55%. This trend is going to continue to play out as Indias socio-economic contours change. In roughly the same period that the report coversthe past quarter centurytwo thirds of the deaths globally have been because of NCDs. The World Health Organization predicts that over the next decade, NCD deaths will increase by 17% globally. And in high-income countries, generally speaking, they account for 80% or more of deaths. All of this leads to two conclusions.The first is the need for decentralized health policymaking. There is wide divergence between the health profiles of various regions and states in India. While infectious and associated diseases now account for less than half of the disease burden in all the states, the transition happened as early as 1986 and as late as 2010 depending on the state in question. Likewise, the NCDs burden covers a substantial rangefrom 48% of the state disease burden to 75%. Drill deeper and it gets even more complicated. The burden due to specific diseases within the NCDs and the infectious and other diseases groups differs substantially. This is true not just between groupings of economically similar statessay, industrialized states like Maharashtra and Gujarat, and Empowered Action Group states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradeshbut between similar states as well. This divergence, naturally, extends to the risk factors that cause various diseases. In the face of this reality, Centre-dominated health policymakingsave in its broadest contours such as increasing insurance coverage, setting standards for public sector health institutions and deciding drug policymust inevitably diminish the effectiveness of state response.The second takeaway is the nature of state response will have to enter relatively new territory. According to the report, The leading individual cause of death in India in 2016 was ischaemic heart disease... The other NCDs in the top 10 individual causes of death included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Risk factors such as dietary risks, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and tobacco use rank correspondingly high.In a journal article Beyond Carrots And Sticks: Europeans Support Health Nudges, Lucia A. Reisch, Cass R. Sunstein and Wencke Gwozdz note that tools such as nutritional standards, fiscal measures and hard regulation such as banning advertisements for certain products have been less effective globally than hoped for in addressing such risk factors. Instead, they note: Increasing research evidence suggests that a key to changing nutritional and activity patterns is the purposeful design of living and consumption environmentsthe so-called choice architecture. In other words, nudges, brought into prominence in recent years by the work of Nobel Prize winning economists like Daniel Kahneman and Richard H. Thaler. An increasingly large number of countries are incorporating this in policymaking; the UKs Behavioural Insights Team is perhaps one of the most well-known attempts.Building an effective choice architecture can require direct government action. Urban planning is perhaps the best example of this. Ensuring that citizens lead a more physically active life would directly address a number of risk factors for NCDs. That means ensuring ease of access from everything to pedestrian access to public transport and communal green spaces. Effective architecture will require bringing private enterprises on board in other instancesfrom displaying health information and advice in stores to appropriate food labelling, high salt warnings and product placement in stores.This sort of broad and diffuse response will not be easy to implement. And certainly, addressing the weak fundamentals of Indias health system is critical. But NCDs are called lifestyle diseases for a reason. Evidence from developed economies shows that addressing them requires inducing basic changes in the manner citizens live their lives, effective health systems notwithstanding. Achieving this without straying into state paternalism and heavy-handed regulationan ever present risk in Indiais going to be tricky but essential for fighting tomorrows health battle.Can nudges effectively address Indias growing NCD burden?

Photo: ReutersNew York/London: Nestle SA is among companies exploring a purchase of Hain Celestial Group Inc., a US maker of organic and vegetarian food, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Swiss giant seeks to expand into healthier fare.The Vevey, Switzerland-based company has held preliminary talks about purchasing all or parts of Hain Celestial, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details arent public. Other companies, including US food makers and buyout firms, are also interested in Hain Celestial, the people said. No final decisions have been made and Hain Celestial may decide against a sale, the people said.Shares of Hain Celestial rose as much as 11% after they were temporarily halted in New York. The shares closed up 2.6% to $40.89, valuing the company at more than $4.2 billion.Representatives for Hain Celestial, which owns brands including Health Valley cereal, Terra chips and Alba Botanica skin care, didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. Nestle declined to comment.Like many food companies, Hain Celestial and Nestle has been whipsawed by rapidly changing consumer tastes.Hain Celestials annual profit has shrunk from a peak of $180 million in 2015. It had adjusted net income of $102.5 million on revenue of $2.9 billion for the year ended 30 June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Whole FoodsThe company, which supplies natural and organic food to Whole Foods Market Inc. and other grocers, reported financial results in June for the first time in more than a year after completing an internal accounting probe. The company said in 20 August that it was delaying the release of its financial results and examining its accounting practices. The company said later it didnt need to restate any of its results.Activist investor Engaged Capital, founded by Glenn Welling, disclosed a 9.9% stake in Hain Celestial in June, and began pressing for changes, including a possible sale. Engaged Capital believes the company could fetch $46 to $73 a share in a sale based on recent acquisitions in the food industry, a person familiar with the matter said in June.Hain Celestial said in September that it was working with advisers to explore strategic alternatives. The company, based in Lake Success, New York, also agreed to add six new board members nominated by Engaged Capital.Cost CuttingNestles sales fell to $91 billion in 2016 from a peak of more than $100 billion in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The company, which is cutting jobs at its skin-health unit and shifting headquarters in the US and France, may spend close to 1 billion Swiss francs ($1 billion) on a business reorganization this year, chief financial officer Francois-Xavier Roger said on a call with reporters in October.Nestle chief executive officer Mark Schneider, who took the helm at the owner of Nespresso coffee and Perrier bottled water this year, is also under pressure from an activist investor. Since Dan Loeb disclosed a stake in the company in June, Schneider has stepped up efforts to bulk up in niche markets like organic food and hipster coffee as Nestle foresees the slowest sales growth in at least two decades this year.The acquisitions are part of a trend by big food and beverage companies to buy up smaller players to capture their rapid growth in premium segments. Nestle faces pressure as its leading position in the market for global packaged coffee has been challenged by JAB Holding Co. JAB has spent more than $30 billion expanding its empire with brewers such as Keurig Green Mountain and Peets.In recent months, Nestle has snapped up vegetarian burrito maker Sweet Earth Inc. and drip-coffee specialist Blue Bottle Coffee Inc. and invested in Freshly, a US meal preparation company. Nestle is also seeking a buyer for its US confectionery business as consumers cut back on sugary snacks. Bloomberg"

The fuel will be supplied by a demonstration project set up by Bio-bean Ltd, a London-based company that joined with Royal Dutch Shell Plc on the initiative. It will produce 6,000 litres a year of the fuel.Its got a high oil content, 20% oil by weight in the waste coffee grounds, so its a really great thing to make biodiesel out of, said Arthur Kay, founder of Bio-bean, in a phone interview.As public pressure mounts against using food for fuel, companies are increasingly focusing on biofuels made from waste such as used cooking oil and inedible plants. Some crops such as corn and sugarcane are made into ethanol to be burned in engines, with sizable markets in some parts of the US and South America.Bio-bean has partnered with thousands of coffee shops across the UK such as Costa Coffee Ltd and Caffe Nero to collect used grounds. The UK produces 500,000 tons annually, according to Kay. Caffe Neros parent company is Italian Coffee Holdings Ltd, based in London.It will then be converted into a biofuel at the companys factory in Cambridgeshire and blended with ordinary diesel with the finished product at 20%. It will then be shipped to a central tank where London buses refuel.The company also makes a solid biomass pellet and briquette to be used in home heating and in stoves, producing 50,000 tons per year. Its also a good feedstock for our other products for instance because its packed full of energy, they have a higher calorific content than wood, Kay said.Bio-bean was founded in 2013 and has received funding from the UK government, Shell and private investors. It is planning to expand throughout the UK and eventually to continental Europe and the US.Were basically looking for places where they drink a huge amount of coffee, Kay said.

For a serious film on global warming, its non-preachy and entirely watchable. The chemistry between Shorey and Mishra is darkly entertaining. Panda never tries to shove global warming in your face. He shows how the changes happen gradually, like a failing crop. But the effects of it, like the loan a farmer takes, linger on.NDTV Movies calls the film a pill so bitter that no palliative can lessen the sharp aftertaste that it leaves. And that is precisely what it is meant to do: force the audience to think long and hard about the dangers that lie ahead of mankind if climate change isnt taken seriously and addressed on a war footing at all levels. Delivered without any sugar-coating, Kadvi Hawa blows the lid off our collective indifference to the worsening impact of wobbly weather systems on lives and livelihoods in ecologically vulnerable regions.In Ajji, starring Smita Tambe and Abhishek Banerjee, director Devashish Makhija effectively creates a phantasmagoria, but relies too heavily on stylised cinematography and grungy locations rather than well-sketched characters to convey the idea of hell on earth, says Scroll. Outrage over the rape of children is easily provoked, but it takes hard work to make a movie about the justice that is due to them. Ajji takes the easy way out.Julie 2, starring Raai Laxmi and directed by Deepak Shivdasani, deploys an unusual level of melodrama to create an aura of progressive ruination around its protagonist, says ZEE News. It finally slumps to a groaning halt. But not before executing an end-game that attempts to take the saga of the casting couch to a suspenseful level. An old-fashioned high-pitched melodramatic take on an actresss journey from zero to wow, the film has plenty of unexpected twists and turns in the plot, not all of them convincing.For Hollywood fans, American 3D computer-animated musical fantasy adventure Coco, directed by Unkrich and featuring the voices of Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garca Bernal, Benjamin Bratt and Rene Victor, comes to India this week. Vulture calls it a charming if belaboured adventure right out of the Pixar playbook. Coco is as indebted to Ratatouille as it is to Studio Ghiblis Spirited Away, but the combination of sensibilities and the colourful, semi-spooky milieu of the afterlife realm where most of the film is set is not at all unwelcome.Mystery drama Murder on the Orient Express, directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Branagh along with Penlope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench and Johnny Depp, is a ride worth skipping, says The Atlantic. The retelling of the classic Agatha Christie tale is visually sumptuous yet otherwise inert, a series of what are essentially cameos by performers far too gifted to waste their time like this. Its not a bad movie per se, merely one that feels self-indulgent and thoroughly unnecessary.There is also biographical war drama Thank You for Your Service, directed by Jason Hall and starring Miles Teller, Haley Bennett, Beulah Koale, Amy Schumer and Scott Haze. Striving for the elusive goal of political neutrality, Hall has made a less jingoistic film than American Sniper, says The New York Times. Instead, Thank You for Your Service is a macho weepie, whose messagethat wars are permanent for those who fight in themhas broad appeal.Marathi drama Happy Birthday, starring Shashank Shende and Arun Nalawade and directed by Narayan Gondal, has all the necessary elements of a big-ticket launchpad, says The Times of India. The film, which clocks two-and-a-half hours, is replete with many songs, fight sequences, comedy tracks and romance. What ruins it, though, is the unnecessary comic track that is seen as a must have. The comedy is lame and cringe-worthy and the film might have seemed less longer had they been trimmed.Several releases this week havent elicited any reviews yet. These include Tamil comedy drama Guru Uchaththula Irukkaru, Tamil action adventure Indrajith, Telugu drama Ippatlo Ramudila Seethala Evaruntarandi Babu, Kannada action thriller Athiratha, Kannada drama Mombathi, Malayalam comedy drama Paipin Chuvattile Pranayam and Malayalam drama History Of Joy."

Graphic: Subrata Jana/MintThe governments decision to raise import duty on edible oils is expected to benefit farmers if domestic prices move up and as a result farmers get a higher price for oilseeds. Indeed, a Reuters report says Indian soyoil and crude palm oil futures rose by 4% on Monday as the increase was much higher than expected.The import duty on crude palm oil was doubled to 30%. While this may be good news for farmers and domestic edible oil refiners, it does raise the question of a cost push for packaged food companies and what impact that may have on their margins.Companies such as Britannia Industries Ltd and Nestle India Ltd, and even the foods division of ITC Ltd, count edible oil as a key input, alongside others such as wheat flour, sugar and milk products. Britannias FY16 annual reports shows oils and fats accounting for around 15% of raw material consumed, while Nestles 2016 annual report shows it at 9%.While oil prices may increase, companies usually take an overall view on raw material costs before making changes to pricing. Wholesale price data collected by the government shows that wheat flour prices have declined slightly from a year ago, but the price of sugar and milk has been increasing and if edible oil prices increase post-duty hike, it points to a cost push. Companies are likely to increase prices to the extent the market can absorb it.An improving consumer demand scenario may give them confidence on increasing prices without affecting sales. The September quarter indicated a revival in consumer demand in urban and to a lesser extent in rural areas. Consumer companies profitability too improved in the September quarter, partly due to accruing benefits from the goods and services tax roll-out.Since investors will focus more on whether the sales growth story can pick up pace, an increase in costs may not be a worry at this point. That could explain why shares of Britannia and Nestle shares did not react to news of the sharp hike in import duty."

Photo: PTINew Delhi: Thousands of farmers protested in Indias capital, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts, underscoring the challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces before elections in his home turf Gujarat next month and nationally in 2019.Representatives from 184 farmer organizations squatted on a road leading to the parliament building in the heart of New Delhi, demanding a nationwide waiver of crop loans on the lines announced by some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, higher prices for their produce and lowering seeds and fertilizer costs.The protest is the latest challenge for Modi who promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and ensure a 50% profit over the cost of production. The number of farmers committing suicides climbed about 42% to 8,007 in 2015 from a year earlier, according to a farm ministry statement in parliament in February.I am struggling to take care of my family and considering the current situation, I dont think I can get out of this mess without any help from the government, said Jayesh Bhai Hurabhai, a farmer from Gujarat. We have come here with a lot of hope as farmers from all parts of the country have joined hands this time to protest.Some farmers travelled for more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from different parts of the country to reach New Delhi to participate in the two-day protest that ended on Tuesday. As many as 300 widows of farmers who have committed suicides in the past years due to high farm loans also took part in the protest, with some holding placards that read Farmers are Robbed.Dwindling incomesAbout 800 million people of Indias 1.3 billion depend directly or indirectly on farming, with agriculture accounting for about 16% of the economy. The country is the worlds top grower of cotton and the second-biggest producer of wheat, rice and sugar.The farming community is agitated over falling food prices and high debt levels. Bumper harvests, boosted by a normal monsoon last year after back-to-back droughts and good rain this year, have hurt prices of crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Depressed prices, combined with poor arrangements for government-assured purchases, have triggered these protests.I have heard that the country is becoming prosperous. But what am I getting out of it?, said Pintu Patil, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. Rising input costs and household expenses are making it difficult to manage a seven-member family with an annual income of just about Rs2 lakh, he said.Indian farmers are likely to fetch about Rs36,000 crore less this crop season due to lower market prices of top seven commodities, including paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and some pulses, than what they would have received by selling at government-set minimum purchase prices, according to All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Minimum support prices for cotton, paddy and sugar cane have risen between 7% and 16% in the year ending in March 2018 from the start of 2014-15 when Modi came to power, according to government data.The government procurement agencies, which are mandated to purchase some agricultural commodities at fixed rates to support prices and supply to the government for its welfare programs, buy only a small portion of a commoditys total output, leaving million of farmers across the country to sell at the market-determined levels.

Pop a spoonful of this blob of white froth in your mouth and it disappears. The lingering sweetness is as fleeting as an early morning dream.Made of buffalo milk, Daulat ki Chaat is a street exclusive and doesnt belong to the establishment. You are not likely to see it in mithai shops or in table-and-chair eateries. Sold on wooden carts or on three-legged mobile stands called tarona, its sellers are mostly migrants from UP and Bihar.In Chandni Chowk, Old Delhis signature street, we once met Hukum Singh, a Daulat ki Chaat vendor from Moradabad, UP. The young Mr Singh lives with his brother in Jamuna Bazaar, north Delhi.Every morning he wakes up at half-past-two and whisks cream with milk. Nothing is added, not even sugar. The froth builds up three hours later. At daybreak, Mr Singh leaves his house and boards the Metro for Chandni Chowk. From 9am to 9pm, with a tarona under his arm and a brass pan on his head, he makes several rounds between the bazaars two ends  Red Fort and Fatehpuri Mosque.The pan holds 5kg dessert, the snow-white surface of which is coloured with golden-yellow saffron, green pistachio nuts and decorated with (edible) silver foil. Sold for Rs 10 a plate, the froth, just before being served to the customer, is dusted with bhoora (unrefined sugar) and roasted khoya (condensed milk). Tell the vendor in advance if you dont want sugar.Eaten with a wooden spoon, it feels like butter in the first bite. That impression instantly dissolves. A moment later your senses are filled with delicate flavours of pistachio, saffron and khoya. If you dont take another spoon quickly, the taste vanishes.Much romance is attached to the making of this fluff. One legend is that the milk is whisked under a full moon sky and the morning dew sets the resulting froth. Since this cloud of cream melts at high temperature, Daulat ki Chaat vendors are sighted in winter  from Diwali to Holi. Hawked in the congested alleys  amid dust, fumes and flies  the dessert, covered with muslin, proves that beauty can be found in the unlikeliest of places."

Mr Basak, however, claims that the sweet dish was first invented in Fulia by Haradhan Mondal who later moved to Kolkata and came in touch with Das.""The original rasogolla, invented in Nadia was known as soft rasogolla. It was first invented by Mondal at his small sweet shop in Fulia. He is the actual inventor of the dish. However, Nobin Chandra Das was responsible for making the spongy Rasogolla,"" he added."

The gas, which is responsible for trapping heat and raising global temperatures, is stored in biomass as carbon.CERE identified 10 fast-growing native species that are efficient at capturing CO2 (see box). The uniqueness of our project is that we focus only on urban areas because it is high time we start greening our concrete jungles, said Dr Rashneh N Pardiwala, founder and director, CERE, and an ecologist from University of Edinburgh. We plant native species because we want to regenerate local flora and fauna as well.Among the 56 native species that have been planted are Peepal (sacred fig), Arjun, Bakul, Palash, Teak and Rudraksh. CERE calculates the amount of carbon captured at each plantation site and takes into consideration species type, age of tree and projected growth rates to assess carbon sequestration in the trees. Plants use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into sugar, cellulose and other carbon-containing carbohydrates that they use for food and growth.Plantation site near Malabar Hill. (Kunal Patil/HT)Pardiwala said that the carbon sequestration potential of each tree is measured using a model that calculates the above-ground and below-ground bio-mass of the tree. We measure the height and diameter of the tree and then multiply its volume by its species specific density. This helps us calculate the mass and the dry weight of the tree in carbon units. This can then be converted into carbon dioxide (using its molecular weight), telling us just how much CO2 a tree of a specific species and age can sequester, said Pardiwala, adding that while international papers take an average value, we know the exact amount being sequestered to the second decimal point considering growth rate, wood density and other specific details.HT had reported earlier this month that India is the third-highest CO2 emitter in the world after China and USA, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based energy policy advisor. The study found that CO2 levels from fuel combustion increased in India from 181 million tonnes (MT) in 1971 to 2,066 MT in 2015, a 1,041% increase.Some of the areas where maximum plantations were carried out include  5,858 trees across villages near Bhiwandi, 3,747 trees at Ambawadi in Malabar Hill, 1,000 trees each at the Mulund forest headquarters and both at the Borivli and Thane ends of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.We plant large well rooted trees that are three to four years old and at least five feet tall. We do this to ensure high survival rate in the hostile environment in a city like Mumbai where pollution levels are high and there is poor soil quality and limited watering facilities, said Pardiwala. Once these trees are planted, we geotag them to know that exact latitude and longitude of saplings planted. It is updated on a real-time database on our website so that there is complete transparency.She added that even though CERE is aware about species that capture maximum CO2, they focus on having mixed plantations. We are looking create natural eco-systems and biodiversity islands. The plantation is chosen keeping in mind nurturing the biodiversity of birds, butterflies and reptiles at every location, she said."
5a53850b9855b770e038032c,A mix of local flavours and tradition: How an Indian Christmas is celebrated,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-indian-christmas/story-K0tV83DZD1FRzvcMM8XPbP.html,2017-12-25,"Come December, and there is a mood of celebration in the air. Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

They have been admitted to Patna Medical College Hospital.The remaining injured have been taken to Gorakhpur in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh for treatment.Police said three of those killed had been identified as Arjun Kumar Kushwaha, Kripa Yadav and Mohammad Shahsuddin, said police.Gopalganj superintendent of police Mrityunjay Kumar Chowdhary said mill owner Mahmood Ali and his two sons had been detained for safety reasons after angry people went on the rampage on the factory campus. He said the mob also attacked Alis house and set on fire four vehicles parked there.Work was in full swing when the boiler exploded. At least 100 workers were on duty at the time of the incident and the toll could mount as many workers were still trapped inside the mill. Personnel of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been pressed into service to rescue the trapped mill workers.Locals said they heard a loud blast at around 11.35pm. Overheating of the boiler could be the reason for the explosion, they said.Arun Kumar Kushwaha, brother of one of the victims, said a pipe of the mill boiler had exploded a few days ago also but it was later repaired.Perhaps, lack of proper maintenance and inspection was the reason behind the incident. There had been demands in the past to change worn out parts of the machine and deploy experts, but to no avail, while minor mishaps kept taking place, he added.Chief minister Nitish Kumar has ordered an inquiry into the incident and announced compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the family of victims.

5a5388a59855b770e0380664,Sugar: can ending stock limits alone support prices?,http://www.livemint.com/Money/5XDnKQH5L8Bk4zuYHBLbUP/Sugar-can-ending-stock-limits-alone-support-prices.html,2017-12-22,"The current sugar season, which runs from October to September, is expected to be better. Photo: BloombergWill the governments decision to withdraw stock limits for sugar be enough to support prices? Stock limits on sugar were anyway due to end on 31 December unless the government extended the date.That it decided not to wait for a mere 10 days indicates the government was keen to support prices, especially after news reports said sugar mills may delay payments to cane farmers due to falling prices. Wholesale prices of M30 grade sugar have fallen by 6% over a month ago.The withdrawal of stock limits gives dealers the freedom to buy and stock sugar, matching supply to demand and hold out for better prices.The hope is that this move will lend more stability to the market and therefore to sugar prices.These limits were needed when sugar output was lower in the previous season, due to unfavourable weather, and are useful to keep prices in check.But the current sugar season, which runs from October to September, is expected to be better.The Indian Sugar Mills Association estimates output to be 25.1 million tonnes compared to 20.3 million tonnes a year ago. While the increase is significant, it is due to a relatively low base. As of 15 December, sugar output is up by 29.8%.ISMA also attributed the dip in prices to rumours of the next season (2018-19) being a bumper one, which it said was untrue as only 10-15% of cane area has been actually planted.Still, the broad expectation is that next years crop will be a good one. ISMA also reported that bids for ethanol supplied by sugar mills have been healthy this season, which result in higher income from sale of ethanol. More cane crushed should yield higher income from by-products too.In the near term, stock limits may support prices to an extent but the focus will shift back to how the final output numbers will look and then the sowing pattern for the next season.Any further supportive policy measure could help mills too. In a note after the limits were lifted, Care Ratings said it expects prices in 2017-18 to be stable on the back of higher consumption, offsetting the increase in output.International prices are another factor and here, sugar prices have been declining in December. The US Foreign Agricultural Service has estimated global sugar output to increase by 4.6% in 2017-18, while consumption is expected to increase by 1.5%.While this is seen as negative for the price outlook, stocks remain in the historical range as output in previous years was relatively lower. Financial positions can influence movements, depending on the view funds take.The lifting of stock limits is a boost to sentiment but it will be back to watching international markets and domestic output trends.That may also explain why sugar stocks went up on Tuesday as news of the stock limits being removed reached markets, but Wednesday saw some of them decline."

The district received 883.96 mm rainfall against the normal of 1199.8 mm which is 26.32 per cent less.As per reports, the Agriculture department has planned to grow different crops including cereal, pulses, oilseeds, vegetable, condiments and sugarcane over 1,22,720 hectares (ha) of land with a production target of 8,42,011 tonne in the district during the rabi season of 2017-2018. The production was 8,67,067 tonne in 1,22,720 ha during the last rabi season.Paddy will be cultivated in 51,300 ha with production target of 3, 22,677 tonne. Similarly, oilseeds including groundnut, sesame, mustard and sunflower will be cultivated over 13,620 ha with production target of about 19,650 tonne.Condiments including chili, garlic and coriander will be cultivated over 4,800 ha with a production target of 36,142 tonne. Besides, gram, mung, biri, field pea and other pulses will be cultivated over 22,340 ha with production target of about 12,557 tonne.This apart, cultivation of potato, sweet potato, onion and other vegetables has been planned over 29,490 ha with a target to produce 4,05,695 tonne this season. Last year, vegetables were cultivated over 28,890 ha with production of 3,96,995 tonne.On the other hand, area of sugarcane cultivation will be cut down this season compared to the last year. Sugarcane will be cultivated over 750 ha with production target of 42,750 tonne this season, Last year, the production was 76,950 tonne from 1350 ha.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das admitted that deficit rainfall during monsoon this year has impacted residual moisture status of soil in the district and said moisture stress will affect production of crops in the rabi season. We are pessimistic about achieving the production target of various crops including paddy, he added."

Be it due to the influence of local climate or availability of spices, herbs and vegetables, the variations in the style of cooking and tastes are inevitable. Coming to Odisha, the platter changes with each district.Interestingly, each of the 30 districts in this coastal State boasts of its unique and much-sought-after recipe, for sure! For instance, if Cuttack takes pride in its Aludum dahi bara, Baripada promises to offer the best mudhi (puffed rice) in the world. Similarly, the crisp ball made of puffed rice and jaggery, popularly known as muan, is quintessential to Ganjams list of delicacies.Not just that, muan holds a special significance in the Odia month of Pausa. In the Odia households, muan is a must-have for the season. Its auspicious to prepare muan between Dhanu Sankranti and Makar Sankranti.Unlike previous days, the season for muan has been extended. However, it is available in lots during December and January, said Udayanath Sahu, who had been preparing and selling muan for some decades now. Though much is unknown about its origin, historians believe this dessert was prepared in Ganajm district for ritualistic offering to the deity on Dhanu Sankranti.The age-old sweet has gone through a bit of change in the modern times. Local vendors said they now use sugar instead of jaggery for making muan. Moreover, ghee has replaced oil in its preparation. Some sweet shops add a little twist to the traditional sweet for the sake of innovation.They try making it more delicious and attractive by adding coconut chunks, cherries and cashew nuts.Besides local consumption, muan is exported to various places across the country. During peak season, at least one tonne muan is prepared across the district in a day. Sweet sellers in the district said price of muan had increased along with its variety. While the price of an ordinary muan with groundnut is between `180 and `200, the muan prepared with desi ghee, cherry and cashewnut costs up to `380, said Budha, a sweet trader here.The price of sugar as well as of ghee has increased. Besides, cost of cashewnuts, another major ingredient of this special seasonal sweet, has also gone up. However, we are still trying to produce better quality muan by compromising with our profit margins, said Samarendra Dash, another seller."

Suicides and accidents are the other leading causes of deaths. In fact, the State stands fourth in the country in the number of suicides. On the brighter side, life expectancy has improved from 58.4 years for females in 1990 to 71.9 years in 2016. Among males, it has increased from 57.7 to 67.3.The data is revealed in the report titled - India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative (ISLDBI)- released by the Central Government on Tuesday. As per the report, which was painstakingly compiled by the ISLDBI - a collaboration between the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, and experts and stakeholders from close to 100 institutions across India, the DALY rate for Ischaemic heart disease is the highest in Punjab and Tamil Nadu, followed by Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. DALY stands for Disability-Adjusted Life years, that is, years of healthy life lost to premature death and suffering. DALYs are the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability.If in 1990, a tenth of the deaths was caused by a group of risks including unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and overweight, which mainly contribute to ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, the contribution of this group increased massively to a quarter of the total disease burden in India in 2016. The combination of these risks is the highest in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra in 2016. Ischaemic heart disease, also known as Coronary Artery Disease, affects the supply of blood to the heart."

Lomachenko landed 55 punches overall while Rigondeaux landed just 15.Rigondeaux, who was booed loudly after the fight, looked the much smaller of the two fighters as the 37-year-old moved up two weight classes to challenge for the title.Rigondeaux (17-1) said after the fight that he hurt his hand in the second round and that was the reason he couldn't go on.""I lost, but it was because of my hand,"" he said. ""In the second round I injured the top of my hand and I could no longer continue.""It marked the first time double Olympic gold medal winners battled for a world title as professionals.Lomachenko, who won gold in the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, has rocketed to the top of his weight class since turning pro in 2013, winning nine world championship fights in his first 11 contests.Lomachenko lost his second pro fight to veteran Orlando Salido but then won a world title in his next bout by beating Gary Russell. He became a two division champion by moving up in weight in just his seventh fight to beat Roman Martinez.""He is a technical fighter. Very quick and very explosive,"" Rigondeaux said of Lomachenko."

The conference also asked the MPs to take up pending issues concerning various departments with the Union ministries.In the meeting attended by Rajya Sabha deputy chairman P J Kurien, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan asked the MPs to take up issues plaguing the railway sector. He wanted the MPs intervention in forcing the Centre to allocate budgetary provision for Thalassery-Mysore rail line, allotment of six new trains as part of the Rapid Transit System.The demand for new trains in the Thiruvananthapuram-Chengannur route, 100 percent funding for the Angamaly-Sabari rail project have also been taken up with the MPs. The government pointed out that new rail lines were required from Balaramapuram to Vizhinjam to link the Vizhinjam International Transhipment Terminal and a line to link the Cochin International Airport. The Centre should grant both these projects as a joint venture.The MPs were also asked to take up the Guruvayur-Thirunavaya line project and ensure sufficient budget allocation for it.The conference also discussed the impact of foreign trawlers in the Keralas coastal sea and its adverse effect on Kerala fishermen. The MPs said the state also should mount pressure on the Centre in this regard. A national level policy in catching small fish is required. The government pointed out foreign trawlers were causing huge loss to the tax revenue of the state. Kerala would ask the Centre to increase the state governments limit of territorial waters from 12 nautical miles to 36.It has been decided to demand reinstating kerosene permit for fishing boats.The government also wants the Centre to reinstate the food grain quota as per Food Security Act. The meeting also wanted the Centre to reinstate the sugar quota to provide sugar to priority category. It also wanted the Centre to reinstate the slashed kerosene quota of the state and asked MPs to press for Central assistance for projects under the Legal Metrology Department."

This has been revealed in the first-of-its-kind India state level disease burden study. The state is said to be at higher risk of heart diseases, stroke and diabetes and the combination of these risks was highest, according to the report.Noting that the above risks increased massively to a quarter of the total disease burden in the country in 2016, it said the risk factors have increased in every state since 1990. Despite Kerala at a higher risk for NCD, the study notes that the state was much healthier than any other state. The study was conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The report said life expectancy at birth improved in the country but there were major inequalities between states. Kerala again topped with respect to life expectancy where men enjoyed 73.8 years and females 78.7 years of life expectancy.Kerala also tops in respect of having the lowest burden due to child and maternal malnutrition. Even this was 2.7 times higher per person than in China, the report said. Though the disease burden due to child/maternal malnutrition has dropped in India substantially since 1990, the report points out that it was still the single largest risk factor, responsible for 15 per cent of the total disease burden. It has also been pointed out that the country should give the highest priority for addressing malnutrition.When compared to other states, Kerala also boasts of having the lowest infant mortality rate. The Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY)  a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death  was lowest in Kerala and Goa.However, the rates of unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and high body mass index in 2016 were high in Kerala, the report said.With respect to Tuberculosis, Kerala has the lowest burden but has twice the per capita burden as Sri Lanka and China. However, the report said India has an exceptionally high burden of tuberculosis contributing the largest number of new cases annually than any other country in the world."

The day after Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were pulled last year, Alli, the Kaanikkaran (tribal leader) of Kuttampuzha, handed out a big note at the ration shop and received his groceries as usual. Its never been different, not before, not after, not now.Kuttampuzha has 1,000 people scattered over Kunjippara, Variyam, Thalavachapra and Thera tribal colonies. There are two grocers, one tea shop and the ration shop. Its not a place of big savings. The men earn their living from labour and the women depend on MNREGS work and bamboo weaving.Barter is the bedrock of this economy. The people make bamboo mats and rubber sheets from materials gathered from the forest and deposit them at the two groceries where theres an account book. The grocer adjusts the vilagers earnings against the essential they buy.So mention of demonetisation sucks up no bad memories here; the changes made to the ration system by LDF govt do. Earlier, each family would receive 35 kg of rice from the ration shop but thats been cut down to 27 kg. To fill the gap, the govt threw in 7 kg of wheat, a grain thats not staple here. The 1 kg of sugar that used to be given has been scrapped. In sum, the tribals have to buy rice at a higher price from the grocers."

And sometimes, its just time to go. Photo: iStockphotoNew York: Its that special season when we reflect on those titans of business who held centre stage this year. But lets not forget those folks who made an impact just by retreating (or being pushed off) to the wings.So here is Gadflys 2017 toast to the departed.Travis Kalanick, UberTravis Kalanick, former CEO of Uber. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintUber Technologies Inc. had weathered many scandals in its relatively short life. But by midyear, mounting legal and moral crises and a leadership drain proved too much, and Kalanick was forced to step down as chief executive officer (CEO).The big question is whether, on balance, he helped Uber more than he hurt it. In part because of decisions he made as CEO, and enabled by many others, the company faces angry regulators, an annoyed judge in a court battle with Googles corporate cousin, a workplace culture cleanup, and a fractured board and investor base. If SoftBank does buy a large slug of Uber stock, it will clarify that the company is worth less than investors believed a couple of years ago.Yet Uber likely wouldnt have become such a force if Kalanick hadnt been a brilliant jerk, to use the words of one director. Kalanicks legacy now depends on whether his successor can calm Ubers storms and prove the company is financially viable. At stake is not only the billions of dollars invested but the fate of an entire category of post-recession tech startups that were more disruptive than anything seen before -- both in good ways and sometimes destructive ways.Jeff Immelt, GEJeff Immelt, former CEO of GE. Photo: BloombergJeff Immelt held the top post at GE for 16 long years before finally stepping down in August. According to his Harvard Business Review profile (written by himself, naturally), Immelts legacy is one of innovation, digital investment and the transformation of a General Electric Co. portfolio that was simply too broad and too opaque. GEs stock price tells a somewhat different story, one of poor capital allocation, a business mix thats still too broad and too opaque and a culture where bad news travelled slowly.Since Immelts departure, GE has been forced to admit its cash flow isnt sufficient to support a dividend he raised just last year and radically walk back earnings guidance he affirmed literally on his way out the door. Meanwhile, GE hung a for-sale sign on its stake in Baker Hughes, a GE Co., a legacy of Immelts mistimed oil and gas acquisitions.Immelt did generally have the right idea on investing in software to make industrial machinery run more effectively, but his push to become the be-all-end-all digital provider for industrial companies was too grandiose. GE says his departure was planned years ahead, but there was hardly ever a company more in need of fresh eyes. Maybe it still is.Hugh Hendry, Eclectica Asset ManagementHugh Hendry. Photo: BloombergHugh Hendrys September decision to shutter his London-based Eclectica Fund after 15 years highlights the existential threat central banks pose to macro hedge funds. These have struggled for several years as quantitative easing distorts asset prices.Investors are voting with their pocket books, with even the most storied managers suffering outflows. Paul Tudor Jones, for example, oversaw about $7 billion of assets by the end of the third quarter, half what he managed in mid-2015.Hendry lost 3.8% in August, mostly betting on rising German bund yields. The most distorted asset class in the world is the two-year German bond, he told Bloomberg Television on 15 Sept., the day after announcing his retirement as a hedge fund guy.Not much has changed since. That German two-year yield ended August at -0.73%; its currently -0.67%, versus a five-year average of about -0.3%. With central banks still setting the price of money, the ranks of the global macro gang keep thinning.Mickey Drexler, J. CrewMickey Drexler. Photo: BloombergMickey Drexler has been hailed as retails Merchant Prince. His vision fuelled Gap Inc.s 90s-era heyday. Later, he led a renaissance of J. Crew Group Inc., presiding over the period when its bright hues, mismatched prints and sequins-as-daywear aesthetic commanded huge sales and influence.But he stepped down this summer. Shoppers have been fleeing the chain after several years of ill-fitting garments, baffling price points and a so-so e-commerce plan.Drexlers fall shows just how much retail has changed. Trends move faster, e-commerce is booming and malls are floundering.Drexler and Jenna Lyonsthe creative director responsible for J. Crews comeback-era look who also left this yearare glaring examples of hubris. The pair seemed to believe Lyons could simply decide what was coolfancy pajamas as an outfit, anyone?and shoppers would follow. The rise of social media, however, means fashion springs increasingly from below rather than descending from on high. Lyons and Drexler missed that shift.Having scored the top job at J. Crew after being forced out at Gap, Drexler may yet rise again. But a resurgence seems unlikely: Apparel finally seems to have outgrown him.Joe Jimenez, NovartisFormer Novartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez. Photo: BloombergNovartis AG CEO Joe Jimenez accomplished plenty in eight years. He presided over $49 billion in deals; the companys pharma division has mostly weathered generic competition for its former bestseller Gleevec; and a deal with University of Pennsylvania academics led to a pioneering cancer therapy.But he also leaves a long to-do list for Vasant Narasimhan, who succeeds him in February.The decision to spin off, sell, or keep struggling eye-care business Alcon has been postponed. Ditto deciding what to do with Novartiss $14 billion stake in Roche Holding AG and its $10 billion stake in a joint venture with GlaxoSmithKline PLC.Theres also the need to deliver a long-promised return to sales growth. Meanwhile, price competition is rising for generic unit Sandoz, and Gilenya, Novartiss current best-seller, comes off patent in 2019.Novartis simply needs more sales drivermeaning more deals. But it faces the same obstacles as its peers, especially high valuations, as companies chasing growth who should know better keep throwing good money after bad drugs and everyone crowds into the same drug classes. Meanwhile, no company seems willing to commit to fixing a fundamentally broken drug-pricing model.John Bryant, KelloggJohn Bryant, former CEO of Kellogg. Photo: BloombergJohn Bryant left his CEO post at Kellogg Co. this fall on a soggy note: The cereal giants stock is having by far its worst year since the last recession.Americas leading packaged-food companies face an identity crisis. The very products responsible for turning them into household names no longer fill grocery carts. Away from sugary cereals, its the aisles where fresh, less-processed and convenient foods are found that have become prime real estate, and upstart brands have seized it.Long-time CEOs of General Mills Inc. and Mondelez International Inc. also stepped down this year. But Bryants departure speaks the loudest, perhaps because hes only 52 years old.His successor, Steve Cahillane, who was hired from Natures Bounty, has already turned to pricey bolt-on deals to revamp Kelloggs portfolio. Still, the company has a history of dropping the ball on brands it acquires that could have been booming, such as Kashi organic granola. Pricing pressure, intensified by Amazon.com Inc.s Whole Foods purchase, hasnt helped. It feels a bit like Bryant and the board finally threw their hands up. Unless Cahillane has the right growth recipe, Kellogg could wind up on someone elses shopping list.And with that, it only remains to say (or paraphrase) that sometimes, nothing becomes a persons job quite like the manner of their leaving it. And sometimes, its just time to go. Bloomberg Gadfly"

It was part of a broader rally in emerging markets as investors flocked to developing nations in hopes of higher returns.It wasnt a good year, however, to have bet on stocks in Qatar and Pakistan. The Persian Gulf country was thrown into chaos mid-year when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties. In Pakistan, the index was coming from a high base, but also suffered from foreigners pulling money out of the market. (Note: We excluded the Venezuelan stock exchanges 3,865% gain this year because its almost entirely due to the effect of a rapidly devaluing currency.)BondsThe three-decade bull run for fixed income rolled on in 2017, defying yet again predictions that faster inflation and tighter monetary policy would bring it to an end.

Copper and aluminium bulls also had a great year. Those gains were largely tied to better economic prospects across the globe, which would mean higher usage of industrial metals.On the down side, sugar and natural gas had a bad year. The sweetener has been falling on concerns of a global surplus, while natural gas recently hit a 10-month low following two warm winters that left stockpiles at high levels.CurrenciesThe biggest gainer in the currency space is a bit on the obscure side: the Mozambique new metical.

She was diagnosed at age 56 with advanced stomach cancer, a disease as persistent as it is painful. It took her life in a grueling 24 months.Fifteen years later, Fogel still describes his aunt's immense suffering as one of the most traumatic experiences of his life.It's a horror he would never want to put his own family through - if he could help it.Advancements in genomic research meant he could.By simply spitting into a tube, he gave geneticists the DNA they needed to detect that he had inherited a rare gene that put him at high risk of developing what's known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. There was no guarantee he would develop it - though chances were more than 70 percent - and certainly no time frame. But if he did, it was almost certainly a death sentence.The only way to outfox his genetic makeup was to remove his stomach.So in October, the 41-year-old father of two boys, 6 and 3, underwent a total gastrectomy at the National Institutes of Health. The doctors cut out his stomach and reattached his esophagus to his intestines as his new digestive system.""For me, it was a no-brainer getting my stomach removed,"" said Fogel, who lives in Silver Spring. ""Being with my aunt and watching her go through the process of dying with stomach cancer, that was enough.""Complete stomach removal is the type of extreme preventive procedure that has become a real option, thanks to advancements in gene science in the past two decades. Increasingly, a person's unique genetic pattern can foreshadow illness, providing a warning that can be heeded long before a disease becomes fatal.Turning to genetic markers to predict breast cancer may be a better-known application. Women with what's called the BRCA gene mutation can elect to have their breasts removed before cancer can hit.Stomach cancer is less prevalent in the United States; there are about 25,000 new cases annually, compared with 300,000 cases of breast cancer. But breast cancer has an 89 percent survival rate, while the survival rate for stomach cancer is 30 percent, according to National Cancer Institute data.It may be surprising to learn a person can live without a stomach. But the body is able to bypass the stomach's main function of storing and breaking down food to gradually pass to the intestines. Absent a stomach, food consumed in small quantities can move directly from the esophagus to the small intestine.It has been possible to detect the gene for stomach cancer since the late 1990s, when a New Zealand scientist began researching why so many people in one indigenous community were dying of the cancer. After 18 months of sifting through the Maori people's DNA, Parry Guilford, a professor at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, discovered a link between those carrying a gene mutation called E-cadherin and those who got the disease.Because stomach cancer is uncommon in the United States - although it is the fourth-leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide - stomach cancer prevention has not been a leading research priority. But Guilford, in an interview, said every week or so he's hearing from an American family who has tested positive for the gene mutation and wants to know more.It was late last year when a distant relative informed Fogel's family of the genetic test. Fogel, his sister and his cousin - his aunt's son - got tested. Fogel was the only one of the three to test positive. But three cousins in Kansas City all had the marker, too, and another had already been diagnosed with late-stage stomach cancer.Although the news was a blow, Fogel, who owns a coffee and record shop in Silver Spring, said he looked at his choices pragmatically: He had an opportunity to save his own life, a chance his aunt never had in her day.He enrolled in an NIH clinical trial run by oncologist Jeremy Davis that will track him and his family over time. One day, Fogel's two sons will be tested for the hereditary gene. If they test positive, Davis hopes that by then he and his team will have discovered other preventive treatments than stomach removal.After Fogel's Oct. 11 surgery, NIH pathologists checked his stomach for signs of precancerous cells and found none. More than 90 percent of the time after these surgeries, they do find early-stage cancer, Davis said. That Fogel was clean doesn't mean he would not have developed cancer, but it was a surprise to the patient and the doctor.Still, Fogel said he has no regrets.""It just means I'm beyond the one in a million my mom always said I was,"" he joked.Fogel had waited almost a year after finding out he carried the gene to go through with the surgery. He made a bucket list of things he would never be able to do again, like entering a pizza-eating competition. Before the date of his procedure, he downed a pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.He'll never be able to gorge like that again. Even when he's cleared to expand his diet beyond bland foods such as hard-boiled eggs and peanut butter crackers, he will have to eat in extreme moderation.It's made a little easier because he now never feels hunger. He has to set an Apple watch to remind him to eat or drink a little something every hour. On a recent day, he finished the last few bites of his son's cereal and felt the morsels back up in his esophagus. He drank some water to try to flush them down, but instead he felt the liquid pool on top.""I used to be your typical iron belly,"" he said. ""I would and could eat anything.""So are the holidays, with their overindulgence, difficult? Bypassing the Thanksgiving feast wasn't as difficult as Halloween, when he couldn't dig in to his sons' candy haul, he said. For a person without a stomach, sugar is high on the banned list because it can move so quickly to the intestine that it creates uncomfortable effects.During a return visit to NIH a month after his surgery, Fogel was all smiles and high spirits, willingly showing off the four incisions on his abdomen and a photo of his excised stomach.Davis walked into the room sipping coffee from a Bump 'n Grind mug - Fogel's shop - and the oncologist and patient greeted one another like longtime friends. Davis boasted about the gnocchi and Nutella cheesecake he'd had for dinner the night before. He patted his stomach and said, ""I carry a little extra."" ""You know what you can do?"" Fogel said with a smirk. ""Get your stomach removed."""
