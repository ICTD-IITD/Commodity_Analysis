The panel had directed the Greater Noida authority to file FIR against errant builders, who are not delivering flats as per the promises they had made to the buyers.But the committee failed to address any of the issues we (homebuyers), have been facing for the last seven years, said Pushpendra Kumar, a buyer.Homebuyers had pinned their hopes on the new government in Uttar Pradesh to solve their issues in 2017. After almost eight months of assuming power, chief minister Yogi Adityanath led state government has been unable to provide relief to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida.Yogi Adityanath, however, said the government has addressed the issues of homebuyers.The committee is seriously looking into the issues of homebuyers and it has been able to solve much of the problems. The committee has ensured delivery of 40,000 flats and another 40,000 flats will be delivered next year, said Suresh Rana, minister and committee member.On September 12, the chief minister directed the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to deliver around 50,000 flats by end of December 2017.We did not get any relief even after flat delivery promises were made by the state government on several occasions. The chief minister on December 25 said that Noida and Greater Noida authorities have ensured delivery of 40,000 flats by December end and another 40,000 flats delivery in 2018. But two authorities are unable to give a break up of these flats, which were claimed to be delivered to buyers, said SK Nagrath, president of Jaypee Aman flat buyers association.Homebuyers said living up to the promises of the government to maintain transparency in public functioning, the authorities should have provided details of delivered 40,000 flats on their respective website.The two authorities and the UP government have given an imaginary figure and their claim is an eyewash to fool us. Why cannot they share exact details of the number of flats delivered to buyers, who were earlier in trouble? We are going to resume our protests from January 2018, said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida extension flat owners welfare association (NEFOWA).Office-bearers of NEFOWA said none of the aggrieved homebuyers associated with their group got any relief from the problems.Officials of the Noida and the Greater Noida misled the CM on flat delivery issue. In reality, the two authorities and the builders are yet to solve the problems, said Shashank Shekhar, a flat buyer.Out of 40,000 flats, the Noida builders were supposed to deliver 12,500 flats, and Greater Noida builders were supposed to deliver 27,500 flats.As per the details given by the Noida authority, the builders have delivered 6,900 flats while remaining 5,600 are yet to be delivered. In Greater Noida, the builders delivered 12,000 flats out of 27,500 flats and remaining were supposed to be delivered by December end. But these ready flats are not owned by aggrieved buyers. The question is the builders should have delivered pending flats or shared a schedule of delivery, said Satish Kumar, a buyer.Homebuyers said the state government and officials in two authorities are ignoring the questions of buyers pertaining to pending flats.We have tried to ensure the builders deliver flats as per the orders of the Chief Minister. Now we have scheduled another meeting on January 15, 2018 with builders to ask them to deliver pending flats at the earliest, said Debasish Panda, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The Noida authority officials said they are helping the builders to deliver flats.We have tried to help the builders so that they easily deliver the flats and the homebuyers get relief by getting possession of their flats. We have expedited the process of issuance of occupancy certificate and also simplified the process for the same, said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.There are around 300 stuck housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida. Around 2 lakh homebuyers are unable to get flats as per the schedule promised by the builders, said officials. The Noida authority needs to recover around 11,000 crore land dues from the 94 builders, who got land on instalments after paying 10% of the total land cost. And the Greater Noida authority needs to recover around 7,200 crore from 203 builders.The confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), a realtors body, said the pending flats can be delivered if the UP government agrees to their demands.The real issue with the builders is of the funds due to the dip in sales of flats. If the UP government will agree to our demands, 80% of the pending flats can be delivered. Our important demand is that the government should allow the builder to pay land dues flat wise, said Amit Modi, vice-president of CREDAI (western UP).On August 9, the Allahabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted a plea from private bank IDBI to begin insolvency proceedings against Jaypee Infratech for defaulting on 526.11 crore loan the real estate developer for its Wishtown project in Noida. More than 30,000 buyers of Jaypee Infratech in Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas are worried that the insolvency proceedings would leave them in a lurch and without recourse to get either a house or compensation from the company.In August, NCLT has also admitted an insolvency plea from the Bank of Baroda against Amrapalis three firms  Ultra Homes Private Limited, Silicon City and Amrapali."

As if that was not a strong enough signal of intent, he topped it with a sweet lisp: ""It would be wrong to call the BJP a communal party. Remember, TMC was a BJP ally at the TMC's inception in 1997.""If Roy indeed joins the BJP, it will serve the party rather nicely. The Trinamool castaways fortress is the Kanchrapara railway scrap yard in the northern suburbs of Kolkata. Its a densely populated part of Kolkata on the east bank of the Hooghly, with a mixed migrant populace. Mukul Roys entry would enable the BJP to establish a bridgehead in a nicely festering location ideal for social engineering.Was it notun gur, Mukul?But Babu Moshai Mukul Roy didnt say whether the rosogullas were made of sugar syrup or jaggery. Surely with winter approaching, hed have known that jaggery is the flavor of the season? Winter is when Kolkatans switch to cane sugar from the rather run-of-the-mill mill-manufactured sucrose syrup for their rosogullas. Priced between Rs 7 and Rs 10, jaggery rosogullas are given as presents and prepared in large numbers for marriage ceremonies, many of which are solemnised in winter. The special rosogullas, which are available only in winter when jaggery is aplenty, give a boost to the confectionary industry concentrated in rural Bengal.Oxygen days ahead?Analogous to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai, the east Kolkata wetlands are the citys natural lungs, filtering out much of its pollution even though the city has grown more than three times since Independence. However, with a steady rise in pollution levels coupled with the state government plans to build a flyover right through the wetlands, its just a matter of before the eastern Kolkata wetlands begin to dry up the like the lost lakes of Hyderabad and Bengaluru. But wait there is a business opportunity for you: package and sell oxygen cylinders like in Beijing. Kolkata might need them very soon.No good movies, yetiThis holiday season has been bereft of timepass movies. The much-hyped film on the mythical Yeti fell flat on its face during the Durga Puja hols and not many new releases are lined up. Kolkatans have had no good movie to go see with the family this season. Single-screens and multiplexes are wearing a gloomy look with very thin attendances. Bollywood and Hollywood arent helping either.Hilsa getting smallerThis is the all-time Kolkata crib. How come hilsa sold before Durga Puja are bigger and those sold after are smaller, how dare they? Its cold consolation to Kolkatans that prices of hilsa have come down since Puja. Though the state government does issue strict orders to fishermen not to catch smaller hilsa and let them grow, fishermen disobey the diktat due to demand for hilsa in the festive season."
5aeabd779855b7179ad6e354,Mahajan apologises for ‘feminine liquor brand names’ remark,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/mahajan-apologises-for-feminine-liquor-brand-names-remark/article19996627.ece,2017-11-07,"Two days after suggesting that feminine brand names could boost liquor sales, State Minister for Water Resources and Irrigation and senior BJP leader Girish Mahajan apologised for doing so on Monday.Mr. Mahajan made the remark at a function organised at the Satpuda Cooperative Sugar Factory in Nandurbar district on Saturday, which drew widespread criticism and a call for his resignation from the Opposition. I have immediately regretted whatever I said. I apologise to all women, he said at a hurriedly convened press conference. I regret my remarks. I express my apologies. It wasnt my intention to hurt womens sentiments. [my remarks] are a mistake which happened unintentionally. It was not my intention to hurt anyone. It was said in the flow of things, in a lighter vein.At the event in Nandurbar, he had said liquor brands name after women were doing well across the world, such as the popular liquor brand Bobby in Poland. That is why I asked [manufacturers] what is the name of your brand. You said Maharaja. Make it Maharani and see the difference and jump in sales. Even the tobacco industry is making the same mistake with brand names like Kamal and Vimal, Mr. Mahajan had said while talking to liquor manufacturers. A video of his speech was uploaded on YouTube.Allies, Oppn. cry foulThe BJPs saffron ally, the Shiv Sena, said on Monday that it was shocking a Minister had made such comments, when women in the State have been protesting the sale of liquor. It is ironical that the Maharashtra government organises events to sensitise people about the ill-effects of liquor consumption, changes law for the same, and a Minister of the same government gives advice for increasing its sales, the Sena said in an editorial in its party mouthpiece, Saamana .You (Mr. Mahajan) may not be able to talk against liquor because of its heavy revenue generation but you should avoid giving such marketing tips. It seems that Mr. Mahajan himself is charged up to increase the sale of liquor, which could be because of dropping revenue figures, it said, adding it was thankful the government doesnt have a ministry for cemetaries. If Mr. Mahajan headed such a ministry, he might have issued an advisory to increase deaths to boost the sale of items required for last rites.The Aam Aadmi Party said it was glad the minister was forced to apologise, but the mentality is deeply ingrained in the government. I am glad we forced Mr. Mahajan to apologise. But his values, or rather the lack of them, is still despicable, senior AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon said.NCP State spokesperson Nawab Malik said, I think the Minister is a habitual drinker, and we appeal to all women in the State to come out and fight against this mindset.Activist files complaintA police complaint has been filed against Mr. Mahajan in Chandrapur by Paromita Goswami, an activist and president of Shramik Elgaar, an unorganised sector labour union. The complaint was filed on Sunday at Mul police station.Ms. Goswami said the Minister has insulted women. As per the provisions under sub-section 47 of the Constitution, the government is supposed to implement a liquor ban in the State. I was taken aback by the statement by none other than a Minister in this regard, and hence have lodged a police complaint. She said there would be protests if the police failed to register the FIR.In 2015, the State government had declared Chandrapur district in Vidarbha a dry district, and imposed a ban on the sale, purchase, production and consumption of liquor. Chandrapur was the third district, after neighbouring Wardha and Gadchiroli, where prohibition was imposed.Ms. Goswami said she would file a complaint against Mr. Mahajan with the Governor for his removal. She also demanded a statement in this regard from Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.PI Jayvant Chavan, Mul police station, confirmed receipt of the complaint. Paromita Goswamis complaint has been forwarded to higher officers for legal opinion. The complainant has alleged that the Minister has violated sub-section 47 of the Constitution during his speech. However, there are no specific clauses under which the complaint could be registered, he said.  With PTI inputs"

Asia Mariam, District Collector.Rabi seasonA total of 20,824 farmers in the district, who had raised crops other than paddy and had insured their crops, had suffered crop loss in the last Rabi season due to the failure of monsoon and the insurance companies have been approached for the disbursement of compensation to them at the earliest, the Collector said while speaking at the farmers grievances day meeting held at the collectorate recently.Ms. Mariam said that the farmers during the current season had raised millets on 55,944 hectares, oil seeds on 23,821 hectares, pulses on 9,166 hectares, sugar cane on 5,466 hectares, cotton 1,778 hectares and paddy on 123 hectares. The farmers had raised horticulture crops on 17,999 hectares.Premium paidDuring the last Kharif season, a total of 15,213 farmers covering a crop area of 29,014 acres, had insured their crops under the PMFBY till the deadline of August 15 last. They had a premium to the tune of Rs. 88.81 lakh.A total of 428 horticulture farmers too had insured their crops by paying a premium of Rs. 15.53 lakh.The insurance companies had sanctioned compensation of Rs. 93.78 lakh to 692 farmers. While Rs. 41.49 lakh was provided as compensation to 326 farmers under the preventive sowing category, compensation of Rs. 52.29 lakhs was sanctioned to 366 farmers who suffered crop loss.The district administration has taken steps for the provision of compensation to about 20,824 farmers who had raised crops other than paddy and had suffered crop loss, the Collector said.Collective farmingMs. Mariam said so far 280 collective farming groups comprising medium and small farmers have been formed in the district. While the agriculture department has created 160 collective farming groups, the horticulture department has set up 120 groups.The work of preparing an action plan for the provision of financial assistance to these groups has already commenced, the Collector added."
5aeabe8a9855b7179ad6e3f0,No danger of breach at Madurantakam tank: officials,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/no-danger-of-breach-at-madurantakam-tank-officials/article20007204.ece,2017-11-09,"The Madurantakam tank, the third largest in terms of water holding capacity in Kancheepuram district, reportedly reached full tank capacity late on Tuesday. Officials, however, assured the people that there was no danger of breach, as rain had reduced.According to official sources, the 2,400-acre spread tank received good inflow in the last fortnight when its main feeder, River Kilyar started recording good precipitation in its catchment areas of Vandavasi, Punnai, Kizhkodungalur and Ulundhai in Tiruvannamalai district. The inflow  which was recorded at 1,000 to 1,500 cusecs  came down to around 250 cusecs from Tuesday morning.Meanwhile, the Madurantakam tank also received inflow from other tanks in Uthiramerur taluk, as several of them reached their full capacity and started overflowing. Thus, on November 7 at around 9 p.m., the Madurantakam tank reached its full capacity and the water started overflowing through the excess water provision through the Kilyar to reach the Palar near Edaiyathur-Irumbulicheri islet.While this is the first time in this monsoon that the tank had reached its full capacity, it had reached its brim twice during the 2015 monsoon when this region particularly, Vandavasi and its surrounding areas in Tiruvannamalai and the Uthiramerur, received copious rain. That year, a flood warning was issued to the hamlets located between Madurantakam and Edaiyathur-Irumbulicheri islet. Earlier, the tank overflowed during the 2011 monsoon season.As far as Wednesdays position was concerned, official sources said there was no need to release water into the Kilyar as the inflow into the tank had almost stopped as there was no rain in the catchment areas.Meanwhile, the farmers in Madurantakam taluk were upset with the government for not taking up any work to desilt the tank despite repeated requests from them in the past.Claiming that the tank was desilted fully in the late 1960s, the secretary of Madurantakam Cooperative Sugar Mill Farmers Association, R. Muralimohan, pointed out that the former Madurantakam MLA, S.D. Ukkam Chand, had brought this issue to the notice of the Public Works Department officials during the 2015 floods.Heavily siltedIn his representation, the former MLA had pointed out that the tank filled up after a few spells of rain. He had also suggested that officials should take up desilting of the entire tank bed.In the report submitted to the Collector, the team had observed that they were not able to ascertain the exact storage since the depth of water measured at different places was not uniform because of heavy silt formation. Though the tank had filled up to its brim in the first spell of the northeast monsoon itself, it will not help ryots carry out cultivation of crops twice in an agriculture year in about 2800 acres of agriculture lands, said C. Ellango of Madurantakam.In the past, we used to plant two short-term crops as the seeds would be sowed in July-August and harvested well before the onset of the northeast monsoon. The next cultivation would commence with tilling and nursery raising during the northeast monsoon and transplantation immediately after the monsoon. Thus, the second crop would be ready for harvesting in January-February, he said.Feeder canal breachesA huge breach on the bund of the feeder canal to Pon Vilaintha Kalathur (P.V. Kalathur) lake from the Neenjal Maduvu (regulator) near Chengalpattu resulted in a large quantity of water depleting into the sea through the Palar river.The breach on the canal bund at a distance of about 500 m from the Neenjal Maduvu was noticed three days ago by the local people, who immediately informed the Public Works Department officials."

MoorthyG_MoorthyA group of farmers from Keelaiyur near Melur petitioned Madurai Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao on Monday demanding release of water from Vaigai dam to their areas as well.Pointing out that the water was presently released only to double-crop areas till Kallanthiri, the farmers said single-crop areas in and around Melur were the worst-affected in the drought, and they could not cultivate paddy for the past two years at least.M. Murugesan, one of the farmers, said though Public Works Department had cited limited availability as the reason for not releasing water to their areas, the explanation was not acceptable to them since the available water must have been shared with both double-crop and single-crop areas. Water is now released for samba cultivation, for which water is generally released for both the areas, he said.The farmers also staged a brief protest at Collectorate to highlight their demand.N. Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, also submitted a separate petition to the Collector pressing for the same demand.He said the PWD officials must consider releasing a minimum amount of water so that it would help in recharging groundwater table in the region."

He had made the suggestion to entrepreneurs in the sugar belt in north Maharashtra and had immediately come under criticism from various quarters.I have expressed regret for whatever I said.

Senas mouthpiece Saamna said on Monday that the Minister made the remark even though he was aware of the movement against alcohol and tobacco by women across the State.Unfortunate, says SenaThe remarks are unfortunate, especially to think the government, on the one hand, is launching campaign to curb consumption of such products and, on the other, it is suggesting using womens names to sell them, the newspaper said in its editorial on Monday.The Aam Aadmi Party said it was glad the Minister was forced to apologise. But his values, or rather the lack of them, are still despicable, senior AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon said on Monday.Meanwhile, a social activist has filed a police complaint against the Minister."

The prevailing climatic condition predicts that the water level in the reservoirs will soon move to comfortable level, farmers and water managers here expect.The water level in the Papanasam dam, the second largest reservoir in the district with the maximum storage level of 5,500 million cubic feet, that stood at 70.70 feet (maximum level 143 feet) 10 days ago has risen to 93.10 feet now after the monsoon became active.Similarly, storage level in the Manimuthar dam, the largest reservoir in the district with 5,511 mcft capacity, has increased substantially from 52.25 feet to 73.80 feet (118 feet) over the past 10 days to strengthen the farmers hopes of going in for pisanam paddy cultivation in a big way.Buoyed by the current monsoon trend, the Department of Agriculture has set a target of bringing 45,000 hectares of land being fed by both systemised and rain-fed tanks under paddy during this pisanam season. Though farmers had planted paddy only on 2,310 hectare till October-end (it was only 414 hectare during this period last year), the cultivation area is expected to go beyond 25,000 hectares before November-end as all the dams are getting decent inflow of water after incessant rain in the catchment areas.While all systemized tanks have water sufficient for 30 days of irrigation, the rain-fed tanks have started receiving water after the recent rain.Having witnessed conducive situation for farming operations, we firmly believe that area under paddy during this pisanam season would go beyond 35,000 hectares, an official attached to the Department of Agriculture said.The department has set a target of cultivating millets on 13,100 hectare, gram varieties on 35,500 hectares, sugarcane on 3,000 hectares, cotton on 4,000 hectares and oil seeds on 4,310 hectares.In all, weve planned to bring 1,32,310 hectares under all crops during this rainy season, he added.Meanwhile, the continuing rainfall in the Western Ghats kept the waterfalls at Courtallam swelling for the third day on Tuesday. While bathing was banned at Main Falls, tourists were allowed to take bath at safer points in Five Falls and Old Falls.The rainfall in the district (in mm): Papanasam dam  42, Ramanadhi dam  38, Ambasamudram  31.20, Servalar dam  28, Nanguneri  24, Manimuthar dam  22.20, Palayamkottai  18.40, Cheranmahadevi  15, Shencottai  10, Gundar dam  8, Nambiyar dam and Tirunelveli  7, Gadana and Kodumudiyar dams  5, Karuppanadhi dam  4 and Radhapuram  2.The water level in dams (maximum level in brackets): Papanasam  93.10 (143 feet), Servalar  107.41 (156), Manimuthar  73.89 (118), Gadana  72.50 (85), Ramanadhi  64.50 (84), Karuppanadhi  64.31 (72), Gundar  36.10 (36.10), Vadakku Pachchaiyar  21 (49), Nambiyar  22.70 (23.60), Kodumudiyar  52.50 (52.50) and Adavinainar  99 (132)."

Threats of disruption to the session, demonstrations in front of the Suvarna Soudha, the venue of the session, and in the city and other things were discussed.The Police Commissioner has jurisdiction over the whole of Belagavi taluk as well as the Suvarna Soudha and airport, vital points with regard to law and order and VIP movement are both outside the city, but within the taluk.Police officers discussed plans to manage protests announced by some interest groups during the session. The private doctors association has called for a Belagavi Chalo agitation against the State governments attempts to monitor pricing in private hospitals for services offered.Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Hasiru Sene and State Sugarcane Growers Association have also plans to lay a siege to the Suvarna Soudha in support of their various demands, including remunerative prices for farm produce and payment of arrears by sugar factories. Farmers who have supplied sugarcane to sugar factories in Kittur taluk have gone to the extent of saying that they would commit mass suicide if their arrears are not paid immediately.BillsLaw Minister T.B. Jayachandra has announced a list of Bills that would be presented before the two Houses, but ruled out the possibility of introducing the anti-superstition Bill.Political parties have announced their plans for protest rallies that could kick-off their campaigns for the 2018 Assembly polls.The BJP will raise issues such as Tipu Jayanti and the general failure of the Congress government in the State.DecentralisationMeanwhile, some organisations feel that a winter session away from the State capital is only the first step towards decentralisation.We are happy about the session being held in Belagavi, but feel that is an incomplete step, says Ashok Chandargi, convenor of the federation of Kannada organisations. Building the Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi is the first of the many steps at meaningful decentralisation. But then, holding the winter session is not everything. The State government should set up offices of various relevant departments and post senior officers here, so that North Karnataka starts seeing development, he said.Chiranjeevi Singh, an officer of the cadre of Additional Chief Secretary, who was posted as Development Commissioner in Belagavi two decades ago, said that this practice [appointing Development Commissioner] should be continued.There are those who think that the session is nothing but a tool in the States language politics. Then Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who laid the foundation stone for the Suvarna Soudha, announced that it was being built to establish Karnatakas rights over Belagavi.This shows that it was not built with any intention of developing North Karnataka or any part thereof, says Maloji Ashtikar, Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti leader. The MES has been campaigning for the merger of Belagavi and surrounding areas with Maharashtra."

Priyadarshinis heart.For the past year, the M.Sc. Zoology graduate of Nehru Memorial College, Puthanampatti, has studied over 1,000 nests of the avian king of construction and discovered what she feels is a rare treasure in her native village of Reddiyarpatti, around 90km from Tiruchi: a triple-chambered nest that measures 136 centimetres in length.I have consulted experts in the subject, and they all agree that this may be one of the longest Baya Weaver nests found in recent years, Ms. Priyadarshini told The Hindu . Earlier research from 1987 records the longest weaver birds nest as 44cm, and then slightly later, at 67cm. Usually weaver birds build only one nest, but this seems to suggest that the bird returned to the old one and just continued to build another one below it, she added. The length variation is caused by the two starting points of the nest. Weaver bird nests are commonly seen in cultivable lands and on trees growing near water bodies. The Baya Weaver prefers to build nests with the fibres of coconut and Palmyra trees.Ms. Priyadarshini surveyed the nests on vegetation over 480 wells situated in a radius of 13km around Reddiyarpatti from August 2016 to January 2017 and found the unusual nest hanging from a Nuna (Morinda tinctoria) tree above a well in a field six months ago. She has photographed the state of the nest when it was in use and then abandoned when the trees were cut down. She had to obtain the Forest Departments permission to be allowed to keep the nest for study purposes.This particular nest is built using sugarcane leaves, because they were growing in abundance near the well, said Ms.Priyadarshini. It takes a male Baya Weaver 18 days to construct a nest, which it completes only after its female mate is paired. If the female doesnt seem to like the nest, the male will stop working on it, and start a new one somewhere else, said Ms. Priyadarshini, who used a friends video camera to record the nest-building behaviour of the birds.Once an aspiring student of medicine, Ms. Priyadarshini decided to opt for Zoology in college when health problems affected her board exam results. She graduated with distinction in Zoology.The 23-year-old first-generation learner began her research in her second year of M.Sc and decided to continue it even after graduation in May, turning down an offer for a medical coders job in Salem. At present, she is working as a primary school teacher in Reddiyarpatti.With internet access available only in the nearby Erakudi village, the enterprising Ms. Priyadarshini used a cousins smart phone to find the geographical location of possible nesting sites in the area and kept a record of all her observations on the laptop computer that she has used since her school days.She recently presented her research findings at an international biodiversity conference organised by A.V.C. College in Mayiladuthurai and at the 4th Tamil Birders Meet in Yelagiri.But she feels it is too soon for her to formally publish her work. Of the 7000 coconut trees that were surveyed, nests were seen only on 19 trees. We must be able to tell people why these birds and other native fauna of the fields are slowly vanishing, and this needs more in-depth research, she said.Ms. Priyadarshini knows that opting for doctoral studies in the subject will be tough without the approval of her father, Sathasivam, who works in a grocery store in Thuraiyur, and her mother Bhanumathi, a daily wage-earner. Both parents worry over their eldest daughters near-obsessive love for the weaver bird, and her safety as she ventures out alone for field studies. They have supported me so far. Im sure they will continue to do so, said Ms. Priyadarshini, with a hopeful glance at her parents.Usually weaver birds build only one nest, but this seems to suggest that the bird returned to the old one and continued to build another one below itS.

And there is none to mourn the deaths, as all infants are abandoned, or declared rejected by their parents.Official figures noted by the Integrated Child Development Services and the district officials say at least ten babies below the age of 6 years died of health complications, while being treated at the Niloufer Mother and Child Hospital in Hyderabad. They, however, denied the deaths were due to official negligence and/or timely perception of babys immunity.According to the district paediatrician at the Mother and Child hospital, Dr. D. Yadaiah, the immunity of babies at the centre was far less compared to those taken care by mothers. Since the babies here are fed formula milk, risks arising out of weak immunity was always high, he said.Another paediatrician, attending the Sishu Gruha, Dr. Prabhakar added that the babies also suffered from lactose intolerance (inability to break down lactose-milk sugar, causing pain, bloating, diarrhoea and other symptoms ) one of the suspected reasons for poor nutrition leading to deaths.The centre takes care of children in two categories, 0-6 months and 6 months and above receiving a monthly grant of Rs. 2,000 for each baby.It has a present strength of more than 40 children, from two divisions  Nalgonda and Devarakonda.Alerted by videos circulated by electronic media, District Collector Gaurav Uppal who visited the centre on Wednesday evening met with officials and chalked out an immediate plan to be implemented on an urgent basis.Terming the incidence of deaths at Sishu Gruha as unfortunate he said there was no dearth of funds to attend to childrens health.Quality, and lactose-free milk will be supplied. And two committees, a technical and a monitoring one will be set up headed by district officials to assess and arrest risks, he said.A doctor himself, Mr. Uppal checked the health of the 19 babies and shifted three of them for immediate medical care.A probe was initiated to ascertain the cause of deaths, and official negligence if found will be dealt strictly, he said."

He has assured of action if such instances are found. The report will have to be submitted before the next meeting of the Sugarcane Rate Coordination Committee, which met on Wednesday.Farmer organisations are alleging that prices that sugarcane farmers get from sugar mills depends on the price of sugar. In reality, the by-products include molasses, biogas and even ethanol. Mills sell these products as well, but dont pay sugarcane farmers, Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raghunathdada Patil said.It has also been alleged that mills falsely claim the by-products are used as fuel. Where does the money go? Sugar factories get handsome amounts through sales, which should be shared with farmers, Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetty said.According to an estimate, this leads to a loss of Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 per tonne for farmers. The balance sheets are fudged at the mill level, and even government officers are sometimes part of this. The government must conduct an inquiry into this. If found true, action should be taken against those factories, Mr. Patil said. We will be meeting again before the sugarcane season ends. If the government fails to take action against factories by then, we will approach the court."

But owing to the efforts of political leaders, the factory will be inaugurated on Friday by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. About 37 years ago, a cooperative sugar factory named Bhimashankar Sugar Factory was planned in Indi taluk in which over 16,000 sugarcane farmers had invested, but owing to political interference, the factory could never become a reality. The farmers who had invested in the factory, which was supposed to come up in 181 acre land, had lost all hopes, but today their hopes have rejuvenated, he said.The man behind turning this almost impossible task into a reality is Congress MLA of Indi taluk, Yeshwantraigouda Patil. Mr. Patil had promised in the last assembly election that he would retire from politics if he does not get the factory established.Thanking Mr. Siddaramaiah for granting all approval and financial aid of Rs. 39 crore, he claimed that no single cooperative factory of the State has ever received so much financial aid from the government.After the governments help, we also borrowed loan from various banks, and with the total amount of Rs. 156 crore, the factory work was started. Today, in less than five years, the factory is completely built and ready for inauguration, Mr. Patil said.He said that with the crushing capacity of 3,000 to 5,500 tonnes, the factory will also generate 14 MW of power which will be sold to KPTCL at an estimated Rs. 5.61 per unit. This money will help us in clearing the bills of farmers who supply sugarcane to us, he said.He said that the factory will help farmers of Indi taluk who cultivate around 6 lakh tonnes of sugarcane.The factory will also save transportation cost as earlier, the farmers had to take their commodity to factories in Maharashtra.

In jaggery production, poru (dried sugarcane) is used for heating the cauldron. It is kept in the open area to dry, a process now hindered by constant rain, said Somasekharan, a sugarcane farmer at Kovilkadavu. The quality of sugarcane juice, which is used to make jaggery, is also affected by the rain.Marayur and Kanthallur areas are in the rainshadow region and only the northeast monsoon makes an impact there. In the traditional units, only dried sugarcane is used to heat the cauldron and the production is stopped when it rains heavily.GI tagJaggery is produced throughout the year as sugarcane is harvested as and when the crop is ready at various fields. Harvesting is stopped when it rains a lot. Marayur jaggery is known for its quality and the State government is trying to fetch for the product the Geographical Indication (GI) tag. The average price for a 60-kg pack Rs. 3,000 and farmers say price fluctuation is a concern for them. The cost of production and wages have increased considerably. Production will be profitable only if the pack fetches more than Rs. 3,500, said Mr. Somasekharan.The arrival of low quality produce from Tamil Nadu in the jaggery market has also brought down the demand for Marayur jaggery. Blocking the arrival of jaggery from Tamil Nadu is a long-pending demand of the farmers. Even if production falls, the price does not increase because of the presence of the poor quality fare in the market, they say."

They have not faced any loss. The sugarcane produce has not fallen and the government has not taken any effort to reopen the mill though several memorandums have been submitted to them, he said.He added that there were nearly 7,000 farmers who were dependent on EID Parry Sugar Mill. From Wednesday night, even the cooperative sugar mill has been closed. The farmers have to travel to Tamil Nadu to sell their crop and they are facing trouble, he said.Cane divertedT.P. Ravi, general secretary of the committee, alleged that the mill had been showing loss and diverting the cane without permission from the Cane Commissioner. The sugarcane production this year alone is 6 lakh tonnes. Nearly six months beginning from November is called the main season where sugarcane produce is sent to the mill to be crushed. If they do not open the mills this month, farmers will have to face huge loss again. This will be the third year since the mill stopped crushing sugarcane. Nearly 65% of the raw material supplied to the Puducherry Cooperative Sugar Mill and EIP Parry Sugar Mill was from the farmers from Tamil Nadu. The rest 35% is from Puducherry farmers. The farmers have incurred a huge loss in the last three years, he said.Mr. Ramamourti said they had informed the EID Parry Sugar Mill to review the situation and provide a positive response to farmers within 15 days. However, the farmers said that if they did not, they have to provide them no-objection certificate to transport sugarcane to other sugar mills in the neighbouring states.Madivanan, manager, cane, EID Parry Sugar Mill, said the cane output had fallen by 50%. To run the mill, at least 4 lakh tonnes of cane is required but we are getting only half of that. We cannot open the mill with less quantity. We are facing extra burden since we are providing the additional cost of transporting sugarcane to the neighbouring State. We have sought help from the government to open a sugar complex with co-generation and distillery. This would help in sustaining the mill, he added."

This will continue for as long as the members survive. On Sunday, the first instalment of ration was given to the adopted seniors.Apart from this, their health, clothing and other basic necessities will also be taken care of by the Bow United Organisation , an association that was formed by the residents of 134 flats that make up the iconic Bow Barracks, built during World War II as a garrison for soldiers.Each instalment of ration will comprise a sack of 5kg of rice, 2kg of dal, a packet of cooking oil, 2kg of atta, a packet of soya chunks, a large packet of biscuits, a family pack of ready-to-eat noodles, salt and sooji. Ration cards have been printed and distributed among these families with the details and will have to be retained for a monthly repeat.""While basics like rice, dal, atta and oil have to be repeated every month, we will bring in more variety with the rest of the items.

The two-fold increase is not only because of higher number of operating mills  80 mills started operating this year against 67 last year  but also because of a quantum jump in cane crushing from 29.25 lakh tonne in October-November last year to 68.05 lakh tonne this year.The sugar production also got a boost because of better sugar yielding cane varieties grown by farmers. Not surprisingly, sugar recovery rate also rose from 9.42% to 9.60%.""Sugar production looks impressive because of head start to cane-crushing. It needs to be maintained for next five to six months,"" said a senior official in the department.The high quantum of cane crushing and subsequent sugar production comes nearly 20 days after the state government increased the state advisory price (SAP) for sugarcane by Rs 10.UP had surpassed Maharashtra to become the highest sugar producing state in the country last year.Officials said that given the present production rate, the state would certainly repeat its performance this year.UP always had highest cane cultivation area in India but average and poor grade cane variety were limiting factors for sugar production.However, millers fear that the high production in first month may result in sugar glut, eventually leading to fall in prices.UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), which represents private sugar mills in the state, is apprehensive of a fall in sugar prices affecting their compensation paying capacity."

This will affect cash flows, which may prove detrimental to the interests of sugar producers and very soon may impact their paying capacity to the sugarcane farmers,"" it noted.The government has extended the stock holding limit on traders by two months till December 31.As per the latest data, mills have produced a total of 13.73 lt sugar till November 15 of this season as against 7.67 lt in the year-ago period.Of this, mills in Uttar Pradesh - leading sugar producing state - have produced 5.67 lt as against 1.93 lt in the same period last year.Maharashtra - the country's second largest sugar producer, has manufactured 3.26 lt so far this season as against 1.92 lt a year ago.""The main contributors to the higher production of sugar are the sugar mills in UP and Maharashtra,"" ISMA said.

Tamil Nadu was one of the premier States in banana cultivation and farmers and banana cultivators were dependent on the NRCB for advice. Hence, shifting or downgrading the NRCB was nothing but injustice to them.Mr. Suriyan added that there was also a move to downgrade two other Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes, the Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) in Chennai and the Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) in Coimbatore. The move was yet another example of the Centres discriminative approach towards farmers of the State.Puliyur Nagarajan, president, State farmers wing of Tamil Maanila Congress, said the Centres move would not only result in substantial reduction in funds, but also deprive the focus of research on specified areas of interest. The State government should take up the issue with the Centre and demand its withdrawal. Otherwise, farmers would be forced to launch a series of agitations.Replying to questions, Collector K. Rajamani said there had been no move to shift NRCB from Tiruchi. He had received inputs that it was aimed at administrative restructuring. However, the concern of the farmers would be brought to the notice of the State government and the Central departments.P. Ayyakannu, Desiya Thenninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Sangam, said two months had passed since the opening of Mettur dam. But water had not reached the tail-end areas of most of irrigation channels including Vadakarai vaickal in the district. Though the issue was brought to the notice of officials, there was no action.R. Subramanian, deputy secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, said farmers in the tail-end areas of Kattalai High Level Canal, who had raised paddy crop, were suffering for want of water. The supply was not sufficient to irrigate the paddy fields. Similar was the situation in paddy fields depending on Kattalai Canal from Mayanur to Thayanur.Hence, the State government should allocate funds for desilting of all canals in Tiruchi and Karur districts to prevent a similar situation next year, he added."

5aeae43a9855b7179ad6f82d,Back to where he belongs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/back-to-where-he-belongs/article21157371.ece,2017-11-30,"Last year, when the Madras High Court declared, Let the writer be resurrected to what he is best at. Write, Tamil author Perumal Murugan returned from the self-declared death as a writer. Hounded by protests over his book Madhorubhagan , or One Part Woman , his dramatic coming to life last year was marked by the release of Songs of a Coward, his book of poetry written during exile.This time its a collection of ten short stories, titled The Goat Thief , (Juggernaut) which have been translated by N. Kalyan Raman in English.Infused with several layers, the tales portray human relationships and emotions, beseeching readers to contemplate and question. These aspects came to fore during a recent discussion in New Delhi on the book between the author and Carnatic music vocalist, T. M. Krishna with journalist Akhila Krishnamurthy chipping in as a translator. The event was also a precursor to Lit For Life, The Hindus annual literary festival to be held in Chennai from January 14 to 16.This discussion was preceded by a reading of the story, The Night The Owl Stopped Crying, which is about Raju, a night watchman at a farm who encounters a ghost and comes under her spell, in Tamil by Murugan and then by Krishna in English. The two read from the same pair of spectacles, perhaps indicating their shared world view. Krishna observed all ten stories talked about people on the margins including those who work at night and sleep during the day. Stating that this comes naturally to him, Murugan replied, Coming from that section, I have experienced what people on the fringes go through and am able to empathise with them. For example, till 25, I used to tend goats. Likewise, being farmers, for us night is as important as day. The differentiation hardly mattered as I had seen my mother being alert to the needs of people and animals at night too.Unlike others, Murugan in the stories creates a vivid visual imagery of the rural settings through sound and smell. Be it shit or goat, both olfactory and aural senses play a vital role, remarked Krishna. Admitting that he realised it only when Krishna pointed it, the writer again traced this to village life. Sound and smell are intrinsic part of village. How the animal cries indicates whether it is in pain or thirsty or danger. Similarly, one has to find way in pitch dark by keeping nostrils open to odour emanating from reptiles like cobra.Social conditioningSocial conditioning comes into focus in a touching story about a scavenger who undertakes sceptic tank cleaning for four college boys as they discuss social evils and how to overcome them. Despite juxtaposing the characters in a liberal setting, Murugan, according to Krishna, refrains from being judgemental. Revealing that till 2002 his views would seep into the narrative, Murugan said: As an author, I understand, share and sympathise with my characters and their feelings but I never force my opinion through them. By simply presenting the tale, I enable the readers to ponder and form their views. The students are idealistic and liberal yet caught in a quandary whether they should offer water to the scavenger. This is simple and honest picturisation, and is bound to make the reader react according to their thinking.The title short, The Goat Thief, revolving around a person who becomes a thief due circumstances and is chased by a violent mob, too unravels on similar lines. Like Anton Chekhovs famous story, A Malefactor , Murugans sketch of the protagonist, the thief, makes many sympathise with him. Nothing is black and white. What was considered pillage and loot by sufferers was eulogised as bravery and courage by perpetrators. Writers need to put forth questions about ever-changing values systems and beliefs, leaving others to debate.Making an interesting observation, Krishna said some tales draw spotlight on inanimate and ordinary household objects like salt shaker, toilet bowls, tumblers, chairs, etc. In Musical Chairs , the chair highlights the husband-wife ego clash while in Mirror of Innocence a small sugar container is dear to a child. Referring to the latter, Murugan, disclosed that it was based on a real-life incident. One night my daughter was howling non-stop. My mother gave her medicinal herbs, wife tried to feed her and I cajoled her but to no avail. Finally her grandmother handed over a small sugar container which she held tightly to her heart and dozed off. This shows the subjective value people assign to objects, even the lifeless ones."

Ramasamy, former Secretary of the Science and Technology.The committee recommended merger of 103 agricultural research centres to 60 across the nation. It had suggested one research centre for one crop instead of having multiple centres. Besides SBI, two other institutions to be closed or merged are National Research Centre for Banana in Tiruchirappalli and Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture in Chennai.Researchers felt that it was a strong lobby of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh to gain control over the south-based institute. If both, the SBI and IISR, are merged the former should be headquarters, they say.We are not opposing the merger of the institute which has glorious record in sugarcane research in the world, but it should be made as headquarters instead of bringing it under the control of IISR to retain its name and fame of its seed brands beginning with ``Co'', said retired director of SBI P. Rakkiyappan.MemorandumThe Agricultural Research Service Scientists Forum (ARSSF) in its memorandum to ICAR has opposed the merger proposal.The ARSSF members feared that a decision in this regard may be taken at a meeting of the governing body of ICAR held on Wednesday. However, this was not part of the agenda.On its part, the ARSSF has initiated the process to safeguard the interest of Tamil Nadu and its members plan to meet the Chief Minister and also the BJP leaders in Chennai soon. Meanwhile, MDMK leader Vaiko in a statement issued last Saturday condemned the move and said it was part of the hidden agenda of BJP government and urged the State Government to desist the merger plan."

Chandrababu Naidu, said the farmers were worried that they would have to incur extra transportation charges. The Delta Sugars was not forthcoming with regard to stock yard, which upset the farmers.A high-voltage drama was witnessed in the Assembly on Wednesday when Mr. Vamsi reportedly threatened to resign following alleged rude behaviour of CMO officials. The Delta Sugars is located in the Gannavaram constituency, which Mr. Vamsi represents in the Assembly.When contacted, Director of Sugar and Cane Commissioner L.

Similarly, there are reports that the prices of rice, wheat and kerosene would also be increased. The reports cannot be ignored because the State governments actions leave a lot to be desired, he said.Bad repercussionsAlleging that the State government was ignoring the needs of the people of Tamil Nadu, he said, Any attempt to dismantle this system [PDS] will lead to very bad repercussions.

He complained that some sub-ordinate were misguiding their superiors, due to which encroachments were continuing in the supply channels.He said that the High Court in its order had already made it clear that the district authorities should remove all encroachments in the water bodies, even if the lower courts had given stay. But in many places, the encroachments have not been removed. He called upon the District Collector to accord priority and remove the encroachments from all the supply channels on a water footing to ensure flow water into the lakes and tanks. Mr. Sundaram also raised the issue of adulteration in the manufacture of sago. Due to the adulteration, the farmers were not getting reasonable price for the tapioca. The sago units procure tapioca based on starch content.Despite, good starch content, the tapioca is fetching a poor price of Rs. 300 per point at present, due to which the farmers were suffering heavy loss.The sago units were exploiting the innocent farmers and demanded stringent action against the sago units involved in adulteration in sago manufacture.M.G.

It was the second time the pachyderms have conducted a night raid in the Urakkuzhy area, destroying a shop there, sources said.Another herd of wild elephants have strayed into the pilgrims main base camp at Nilackal on Monday night. According to Forest department sources, the elephants, including calves, were found straying into the base camp from the forests near Kaduvathode stream.However, the Forest squad deployed at Nilackal managed to divert the pachyderms back into the forests, later.Wild elephants straying in herds to the incinerator yard at Nilackal was a regular feature during the previous pilgrim season too. They stray into the base camp for feeding on the ash as well as flowers and leafy decorative pieces left by the pilgrims.The elephants and other animals consuming plastic along with the sugary leftovers like empty tetra packets of fruit juices and soft drinks was a high health risk for the wild fauna, sources said.Changes in ecosystemThe changes taking place in the forest ecosystem, mainly owing to the climate change, have been leading to frequent straying of wild animals into human habitation in the forest areas of Sabarimala, Ranni, and Konni in recent times.Recently, Pampa, Nilackal and Attathode reportedly showed growing incidence of wild animals straying into the human habitation and workerss camps from the drought-hit forest interiors in search of water. Wild animals straying into the bordering villages, sending panic waves among the villagers, has become common along the forest fringes of Konni and Ranni during the summer months.The spontaneous reaction of the panicky people to protect themselves from these wild beasts often results in many wildlife casualties too.Instances of leopards, king cobras, and wild elephants, straying into the villages along the forest fringes have become more frequent in recent years.Experts attached to Forest department attribute this to the shortage of food and water inside the forests.Environmentalists say the indiscriminate granite quarrying from the close vicinity of virgin forests over the past several years too has contributed to the alarming depletion of the groundwater table even in the forests."

Ramasami, former secretary of Department of Science and Technology, is approved by the Centre.The institutes which are addressing different mandates should not be merged even though they are working in the same commodity and resources as they are specialised in nature and created for addressing special issues and problems of farming community, said the Agricultural Research Service Scientists Forum in its letter to Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Radha Mohan Singh.Funds cutScientists working for these institutes alleged that the merger would not only result in substantial cut in funds, but deprive the institutes of focus, original research and modern equipment.The objective of the government, they alleged, is to merge, corporatise and in some cases it may result in closure.In CIBA we are concentrating on low saline brackish water while ICMFRI in Kochi is focusing on capture fisheries. There is enormous scope and huge potential for brackish water aquaculture, as Tamil Nadu alone has 56,000 hectares of area and per annum generates Rs. 1,200 crore. Brackish water aquaculture empowers all sections of society while CIMFRI can benefit only trained fishermen, said a senior scientist of the CIBA, which has achieved many breakthrough in captive breeding of seabass, milk fish, white shrimp, karimeen , a delicacy in Kerala, and scat, an ornamental fish.Scientists explained that aquaculture technologies had contributed Rs. 35,000 crore of foreign exchange in the last couple of years. Instead of focussing more on aquaculture development which is the only scope for expanding fish production in the country, merging an aquaculture institute with capture fisheries will diminish scope of fisheries development in the country, they said.In fact, the ICMFRI, launched in 1947, originally functioned from Mandapam in Tamil Nadu, but moved to Kochi because of political reasons.Of the major States, T.N. has only three institutes. As many as 14 ICAR institutes are functioning from Uttar Pradesh, seven from Karnataka, five from Kerala and seven from Andhra Pradesh."

But Chinas muscular ascent combined with the capriciousness of a Trump-led U.S. is causing Tokyo to slough off its diplomatic slumber and rethink its role in Asia. From proposing new security dialogues, to taking the lead in developing multilateral trade agreements, it is beginning to pick up some of the slack left by the U.S.s America First-influenced withdrawal from leadership in Asia.Japan is in a potentially explosive neighbourhood, and it no longer believes that a wholescale reliance on the U.S. for a defence umbrella is sufficient to secure its best interests. Foreign Minister Tar Kon said in October: We are in an era when Japan has to exert itself diplomatically by drawing a big strategic picture.Military normalisation is one prong of Japans new foreign policy, but even if a controversial revision of Japans pacifist Constitution, as proposed by newly re-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe goes through, the archipelagos armed forces will remain under strong, self-imposed constraints. The constitutional revision would merely recognise the legality of Japans long extant Self-Defense Forces (SDF). Offensive weapons and preemptive strikes would remain outlawed.Countering ChinaHis nationalist leanings notwithstanding, even Mr. Abe realises that remilitarising alone will not provide Japan with an effective solution to its diplomatic dilemmas. What Tokyo needs to prevent the region from succumbing to a Pax Sinica is to use its strengths, its capital, its technological know-how and its democratic credentials to win friends and influence countries across the region and beyond. It needs to beat infrastructure sugar daddy China at its own game.A large part of Chinas rise has to do with its indispensability to global trade. But Japan is a trading heavyweight too, and is attempting to stake leadership on the regional platform with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). With the U.S.s departure from trade negotiations, Japan has become the principal driving force keeping the deal alive. At Novembers Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam, Japan got the 11 countries still involved to agree on the core elements of a deal. It wants to lead rule-making on trade in the Asia Pacific, rather than let China set the agenda with alternatives to TPP such as the Beijing-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).At the same time, Japan is stepping up aid and investment in Southeast Asia. A train line near Manila, a seaport in Cambodia, and assistance in the reconstruction of Marawi City in the Philippines are some examples. As the top source of development aid to Vietnam, it has helped construct a new airport terminal in Hanoi as well as the first subway line in Ho Chi Minh City.Mr. Abe recently committed 1 trillion yen ($8.7 billion) to the Philippines over the next five years, with a continued focus on infrastructure development. Japanese investment in major Southeast Asian countries is estimated to have averaged $20 billion per year, from 2011 to 2016, more than double the average annual flows between 2006 and 2010.Japanese sales pitches to countries in the region always have one eye on China, emphasising advantages in areas where Beijing is vulnerable such as safety, reliability and solutions that deliver benefits to local populations.Looking to IndiaChinas $900 billion, Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure building campaign across Eurasia is a gauntlet that Japan has picked up by turning to the only country in the region with the heft to match China, India.Japan and India have announced an Asia-Africa Growth Corridor, aimed at creating sea corridors linking the countries of the Indo-Pacific to Africa. In addition, Japan is cooperating with India in third country infrastructure projects such as Irans Chabahar Port, Sri Lankas Trincomalee port, and the possible joint development of the Dawei port along the Thai-Myanmar border.Japan has bagged the $17 billion contract to build Indias first high speed railway line, linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Tokyo is also investing in development projects in the Northeast and the Andaman and Nicobar islands. And Japans Diet gave the go ahead to a Japan-India civil nuclear energy deal earlier this year. The possibility of purchasing Japanese submarines and search-and-rescue planes to help the Indian Navy is being discussed.Creating a QuadA free and open Indo-Pacific, a phrasing that places India as a major actor in the Pacific, is an idea being proselytised by Japan in conjunction with the U.S. This is a response to concerns over the expansion of the Chinese navy and Beijings territorial claims in the South China Sea, waters through which a huge majority of Japanese energy supplies transit.It is against this background that Tokyos championing of the Quadrilateral dialogue with the U.S., India and Australia aimed at creating a community of democratically oriented interests in the region must be understood.Tokyo wants to use the bilateral ties it is developing to create a multilateral architecture in the region. Like Germany in post-World War II Europe, Japan is aware that unilateral moves by it invariably conjure up images of militarism and expansionism. However, without making genuine amendments for its past aggressions, an idea that Mr. Abe does not seem interested in, Japans attempts to shape the future of the region will remain constrained.Pallavi Aiyar has reported from China, Europe, Indonesia and Japan.

Veera Raghava Rao on Monday against National Cooperative Sugar Mills here for imposing unfair restrictions in taking their produce for sale or using them in their own jaggery-making units, despite them not pledging the produce to the mill.If we have pledged our produce to the mill, they have every right to question us. But we never used to pledge it to the mill. Then why should they bother about where we take our produce, K. Alagupandi, a farmer, said.According to the farmers, they are asked to obtain a no-objection certificate from the mill for taking their produce for sale outside or using them in jaggery units. Moreover, the jaggery units are asked to obtain proper permission from authorities to operate them during crushing season. We have been running these units, which are basically a cottage industry, for the past many decades. Nowhere in the past were we asked to obtain approvals, said M. Vijayasankar, another farmer.P. Prakash, yet another farmer, alleged that they were indirectly pressurised to give their produce to the mill since sugar cane supply had dwindled over the years. They are afraid whether they will get adequate tonnes of sugar cane for the crushing season this year, he said.The farmers alleged that they were not sending their produce to the mill since the money paid per tonne was insufficient and not paid on time. On the other hand, if we sell the jaggery to commission agents in Madurai, we get a decent returns. The agents are ready to give use an advance, which the mill never does, Mr. Prakash said.The farmers, who later met the Collector, said they were assured that unnecessary restrictions would not be imposed on those who did not pledge their produce to the mill."

The camp is to be held on the banks of the Bhavani River behind the Vanabadrakali Amman Temple in Thekkampatti near Mettupalayam from the first week of December for 48 days.Sources here said that tenders had been floated for awarding the work for setting up logistics for the camp.Preparation works included setting up of sheds/kitchen for cooking food for the elephants, the mahouts and cavadis (elephant handlers) and shelter for the veterinarians.There would be watch towers and solar-powered barbed wire fencing to prevent wild elephants from straying into the camp site.During the camp, the elephants would be given a bath on the banks of river Bhavani, taken on a morning walk and provided with sumptuous meals.The diet would be based on a chart prepared by a panel of veterinarians taking into account the gender, age, height and weight of each elephant.The diet would include 11 types of greens, five varieties of grams, rice, ragi, sugar cane and seven types of medicines including mineral mixtures and vitamin supplements.The pachyderms would get green fodder including sugar cane, sorghum and caryota leaves.Forest veterinarians would oversee the well-being of the elephants.Guests from PuducherryBesides elephants from temples and mutts across the State, jumbos from the Saneeswarar temple in Thirunallar and the Manakula Vinayakar temple in Puducherry would also attend the camp.However, aged and ailing elephants and the ones that were averse to boarding trucks would be exempted.The elephants would undergo health screening and treatment for various ailments and infections, if any.The camp began late last year due to the ill health of the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa; however, this year, preparations are apace to begin the camp in the first week of December, an official said. The elephant rejuvenation camp was the brainchild of Jayalalithaa and she launched the scheme during 2003.Earlier, the camp was held in Mudumalai. However, considering the long uphill journey that the elephants had to take, it was later shifted to Thekkampatti at the foothills of the Nilgiris.Last year, 33 elephants participated in the rejuvenation camp. The department incurred an expense of Rs. 1.16 crore.The department expects the same number of elephants this year.The exact date of inauguration of the camp would be announced shortly after getting the nod from Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, department sources here said."

The farmers said that the elephants had been seen in the vicinity of of Agasthya Foundation zone during the last three days, despite the efforts of the forest personnel to drive them back deep inside the forests.The villagers said that the herd camped in Mallappakonda hillock region in Gudupalle mandal, criss-crossing the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Farmers, who grow the crops of tomato, beans and ragi, are a worried lot.The forest personnel have tracked the movement of the herd, which would reconnoiter the fields at nights. Trackers were also arranged in an effort to prevent them from invading human habitations at the forest fringe villages.Divisional Forest Officer T. Chakrapani said that the forest officials from Kuppam rushed to the spot, and drove back the elephants.Meanwhile, heavy rains in Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in Chittoor district, and in the thick forests of V.Kota, Ramakuppam in Kuppam constituency and its adjoining Maharaja Kadai forests in Tamil Nadu in September and October have resulted in sufficient water sources and fodder to the wild elephants criss-crossing the tri-State junction.The forest officials said that during the six months, the problem has been reduced to a minmum, thanks to congenial climate to the wildlife. All the check-dams and ponds in the reserve forests abutting the tri-State junction are brimming with water. The question of fodder crisis will also unlikely to arise in the near future.In spite of the satisfactory scenario in the deep forests, the elephants are known for raiding crops, lured by the paddy and sugarcane fields. Three years ago, the officials counted the figure of wild elephants in tri-State junction at 34. In 2015, three elephants, including a calf, died due to electrocution and confinement. Generally, the movement of wild elephants criss-crossing Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Gudupalle and Shantipuram towards neighbouring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu becomes a phenomenon between November and January, with reports of extensive crop damages."

It wants to play it safe so that it does not have to confront the real players and demand a restraint on their products, not through voluntary action, but through government policies that put a premium on nutrition, not consumption, said Sunita Narain, director general of CSE.The study has listed seven major health problems in India, including obesity, mental health, cancer, heart disease, respiratory and hormonal disorder.The number of overweight and obese people in India doubled between 2005 and 2015, while 26% of all deaths happen due to cardiovascular diseases. There were an estimated 22.2 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and around 35 million chronic asthma patients in 2016, noted the study.While the WHO stated that an investment of US $1-3 per person per year could dramatically reduce illness and death from Non Communicable diseases, the CSE noted that the investment for India would be much higher.High costWe believe the cost is going to be much higher considering that risk factors in India are more than the four identified by the global body. These risk factors have multiple targets and can cause diseases that are not generally linked to them. For example, exposure to pesticides is known to cause cancer, but new data is emerging to link it to diabetes as well, said Ms. Narain.Targeting environmental risk factors is essential if we want to meet the Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, which mandates a one-third reduction in premature deaths due to lifestyle diseases by 2030, said Vibha Varshney, lead writer of the report."

Shanmugam.Addressing a protest organised by Tamil Nadu Cane Growers Association here on Monday, Mr. Shanmugam said the State government had repeatedly failed to get State Advisory Price (SAP) for cane from 11 private sugar mills to the farmers.It has piled up to Rs. 1,600 crore in the last four years. Even after several rounds of talks, including the ones chaired by Industries Minister Sampath, the mills have denied the SAP, he said. Will the banks not levy compound interest on loans of farmers? In that case, why should the farmers be denied their rightful price running to several crores?, Mr. Shanmugam asked.N. Palaniswami, president of Tamil Nadu Cane Growers Association, said, Frustrated with its inefficiency in getting what is due for the farmers, the State government is now trying to implement profit sharing formula recommended by the Rengarajan Committee, thereby doing away with the SAP. This was the reason for the government not having announced the SAP for the current crushing season that will begin at national cooperative sugar mills in December.Stating that several State governments in north India were preparing to implement profit sharing formula, Mr. Palaniswami said the farmers would vehemently oppose any such move by the Tamil Nadu government.Mr. Shanmugam said Section 5A of the Sugar Control Act mandated that sugar mills should share their profit with the farmers. But in all these years, sugar mills have only shown loss and never shared their profits with the farmers, he said.Revenue sharing formula could work for farmers in other States where recovery rate was high. But in Tamil Nadu, the recovery rate was only around 8.5% to 9%, and rarely 9.5%. At this rate, the farmers are not going to get any benefit, he said.Farmers from many places took part in the protest."

The mill, which has been closed for the last several months, had an accumulated loss to the tune of around Rs. 200 crore.Drowned in debtApart from the accumulated loss, the mill has financial liabilities to the tune of around Rs. 118 crore, including loans taken from banks and financial institutions.The mill owes around Rs. 17 crore to the Pondicherry Distilleries Limited, Rs. 15 crore to Pondicherry State Co-operative Bank, Rs. 18 crore to Pondicherry Industrial Promotion Development and Investment Corporation Limited and Rs. 8crore to Pondicherry Power Corporation Limited.Besides, the mill has to repay Rs. 21 crore to farmers for supply of sugarcane and Rs. 31crore as salary to its workforce totalling around 400.Running on grantThe mill, according to the official, was running with a budgetary grant from the government.

The government would bear the financial liability for the VRS scheme, the official added.We have almost come to a decision that in the present form, the government will not be able to provide budgetary support every year.

The beverage came from different regions of the island nation as part of cultural diplomacy and business initiative.Guests were treated to an assortment of sake, which was kept in long wine glasses so that the discerning could get a feel of each drink . The rice wine, with alcohol kept extremely low, is ideal for connoisseurs who have acquired taste for the drink.Enlightening guests about the need for promoting sake, Miho Komatsu, a Japanese sake expert, claimed, Sake symbolises the peace loving culture of Japan. If consumed in optimal quantity, it generates energy, hydrates skin and keeps cardiovascular diseases at bay.In taste, Junmai Ginjo sake was a pleasant drink which had flavours of fresh pear and jasmine. It has short grain rice named Yamadanishiki. Each sake is special as it has varied proportion of rice and alcohol. Since the rice content is more than alcohol the taste has sweetness to it.Explaining the methodology , Miho Komatsu, representative of Akashi Tai, said: Brewing superior sake by hand requires all five senses to be perfect with the natural process of fermentation and flavour development. Even the hushed process of natural fermentation at work can be heard in the cool quiet rooms of our brewery.The event demonstrated that sake can be paired with not only the Japanese cuisine but also goes well with South Indian snacks like idlis and spicy samosas. According to Rie Yoshitake, sake specialist, sakes versatility can be seen from the fact that it helps in enhancing flavours of food.During my Delhi trip, I discovered that it goes well spicy with Indian dishes. We are introducing it to develop relationship between the two nations.Sake is prepared by rice grown in different regions of Japan. But rice is transported everywhere. In North Japan, sake is drier as people in the region eat less spicy food. In South, it becomes sweeter as the locals eat spicy food, informs Rie Yoshitake.On how sake varies from wine in terms of preparation, she said: Wine is made from grapes which is in the land of producer but rice is transported to all parts of Japan. We dont have regionalism but sake makers infuse their own personality in the drink. While wine is in the hands of weather, sakes quality is in the hands of its maker. It is important to understand that sake makers have their own peculiar characteristics and skills. Bad rice can be compensated by skill of the sake maker.She said that one couldnt trace its exact origin but but its was prepared even 2,000 years ago. Japanese are basically rice eaters. One fine day rice was accidentally left on the ground with water. So when that rice was eaten it became sweeter because of the enzyme.Rice used in sake does not contain the kind of enzymes that barley does. So a different ingredient is needed to help convert the starch into sugar. This ingredient is koji (yeast). When koji is combined with rice then enzymes are produced which break up the starch in the rice and turn it into sugar.Summing up, she said: Sake is consumed on special occasions. Most importantly, it is meant to connect people no matter which region, country or continent they come from  heart-to-heart.While wine is in the hands of weather, sakes quality is in the hands of its makerRie Yoshitake"

Being subservient to political leaders and lack of will power on the part of the government to redeem the situation also contributed to its imbroglio, he added.The Chief Minister and the Minister should look at viable options to rehabilitate the mill. The government should mobilise Rs. 10 crore to settle the dues to farmers and make payments to about 300 workers who may opt for voluntary retirement.Mr. Ramadass wanted the government to discuss with the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited, New Delhi, the condition of the mill and request it to prepare a plan for its expansion."

Bringing up her three children is a daunting task with a meagre Rs. 500 a month that she earns by washing utensils in the neighbourhood houses, she says. She adds that she is yet to get any monetary benefit under the widow pension scheme, but hopes that unlike the previous Akali Dal-BJP government, the new State government will come to her aid.My husband suffered a paralytic attack and died in 2015.

A few others were not even aware of the welfare schemes, MGSVY cluster in-charge for seven villages in Nihalsinghwala sub-division Jaswinder Singh Brar told The Hindu .MGSVY is being implemented in the States rural areas to identify deserving people who have been deprived of the benefits of the schemes in the past.Dr. Brar points out that such schemes would be successful if interference on political lines is avoided and finances provided on time.Perturbed over not getting his name included in the list of subsidised foodgrain scheme, or the Atta-Dal scheme, sexagenarian Magar Singh blames political vendetta and discrimination. I had applied at least half a dozen times in the last 7-8 years but my name never appeared in the list and I never got the blue card. Names of people who owed allegiance to the Shiromani Akali Dal were included in the list while others like me were left out, alleges Mr. Singh, who belongs to the SC category and has now updated his details with the authorities under the MGSVY.1.41 crore beneficiariesYoung Gora Singh, in his mid 20s, has also placed his details on record under the MGSVY, hoping to get a job. My father toils in his little 2.5 acres farm and struggles to make ends meet. If I get a job, I can help him and the family, he says.Punjab has 1.41 crore beneficiaries of the Atta-Dal scheme, which promises wheat and pulses besides tea and sugar at subsidised rates. Families having income up to Rs. 60,000 per annum and farmers having land up to 2.5 acres are eligible. Besides families of farmers, who committed suicide, landless labourers are also entitled to the benefit.While the new government has renamed the earlier known Shagun Scheme to Ashirwad and enhanced the amount from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 21,000 for marriage of girls belonging to SC, backward classes and Christian communities besides daughters of widows, divorcees and widows of any caste, many people are still waiting for the requisite amount.My sister Babli Rani got married in 2011 and we applied for the benefit under Shagun. Its been nearly seven years now but we havent received the money, says Manjeet Singh, who belongs to the backward class.Raonta village Sarpanch Sarbjit Kaur, however, says in most cases deserving people are getting the benefits of the schemes, but she would still look into the complaints raised by the villagers.We cant generalise that people are not getting the benefits. Cases vary from individual to individual and if someone has a grievance Ill verify it, she adds.Politics on the issue is also at its peak. The Congress government, which has been in power for around 10 months now, has started a drive to figure out the undeserving beneficiaries allegedly included by the previous SAD-BJP government.The SCs, Backward Classes, and Minorities Welfare Minister Sadhu Singh Dharmsot said that action would be taken against the officials found guilty of issuing blue cards to ineligible candidates and faulty distribution of old-aged pensions.The SAD has, on the other hand, accused the Congress government of denying social welfare benefits to the marginalised section of society."

It was 2.25 a.m. Your sons body is lying in the sugarcane field at Belimai place, said the caller and abruptly cut the line, recalled Mr. Sah, as he performed the last rites for his son at the backyard of his home in the Banhora village on Friday. He had immediately rushed to his sons room to check. Mukesh Kumar was not in his bed.Gasping for breathMoments later, Ravikant Sah, along with his brother Ashok, raced on their motorcycle to the spot, reaching in just five minutes.From a distance, we saw a mutilated body in the field, surrounded by six to seven people. A girl, gasping for breath, was lying nearby. We could not muster the courage to reach the place and returned to wait for the morning to break, Mr. Sah told The Hindu, wiping tears.On Tuesday morning, soon after sunrise, Mr. Sah, along with other family members, reached the spot in the neighbouring village of Balua Malahi Tola once again. But there was nothing. The bodies were gone, he said. We searched the whole day but we did not get any clue. We then informed the Nautan Police Station and lodged a complaint at 9 p.m.Police Inspector Kundan Kumar Singh swung into action and, working on some initial leads, he recovered the bodies of both the teenagers from two different places.The boys mutilated body was recovered from a punj (a makeshift tomb-like structure to hoard ripened paddy) at a sareh (an empty place), while the girls body with grievous injuries was dumped in a gorge on the banks of Chandravat river and covered with salt and mud, said the police official.The post-mortem report is yet to arrive, five days after the incident.Honour killing?Before dawn on Wednesday, I sent the three accused persons  the girls brother and two uncles  to jail, said Mr. Singh. Otherwise, it could have flared up into communal violence. The 4,000-strong minority community population in the Balua Malahi Tola village of Noor Jehan Khatun has 1,800 voters.Was this a case of honour killing? During the investigation, it came to light that the boy and girl, both from different communities, had fallen in love while studying in nearby local schools. The boys father said in his complaint that the two had known each other for four or five months, said Mr. Singh.Mr. Sah, a trader in fertilizer and seeds in the village, has named four persons as accused in the case: Allauddin Ansari (24), the girls elder brother; her two uncles Gulsanovar (55) and Ansari Miyan (58); and elder sister Shabnam Khatun (26). All three male accused were arrested and sent to jail. Shabnam Khatun is absconding, said the inspector.Allauddin Ansari is a toughie who flaunts his proximity to local political leaders. He does odd jobs, but has no criminal record, he added.About half-a-kilometre from the police station is Noor Jehan Khatuns mud-and-thatch-roof house. There was no one inside, but for her sexagenarian aunt Sabbujanah Khatun, feeding a cow and five goats in the foreyard. Noor Jehan died after consuming poison, she said, without looking up."

With his directive, kharif season was advanced by two weeks this year so that the cutting of the crops would be over in September-October and new crops could be sown from November. He suggested that the agriculture department give wide publicity to educate farmers to opt for maize, groundnut, sugarcane, soyabean, pearl millet and other cereals instead of paddy which needed huge water to get a good yield.Mr. Ramarao said that farmers were keen to grow maize in 25,000 acres during rabi with the availability of water.Mr. Ravindra said that 3.5 tmcft in Madduvalasa and 2.4 tmcft of water in Thotapalli was available for irrigation purpose during rabi. He said the additional water would be released while maintaining the level in reservoirs.Mr. Dhananjaya Reddy told The Hindu the farmers would get economic benefits with the effective usage of water resources in the district.Migration problem would come down significantly when farmers are able to generate additional income up to Rs. 30,000 per acre during rabi.

Mechanisation and the hardship involved in raising oxens are hastening the decline of the tyre cart manufacturing units.Though industries are scarce in the predominantly agrarian Thanjavur district, there were some small units that used to prosper in the shade of the agricultural affluence.Tyre cart fabrication was among them due to the huge dependence of the farmers, especially the sugarcane growers and paddy farmers, for transporting their agricultural produce from the fields.Some four decades back, the delta region abounded with adequate water and consequently farming flourished.The farmers also looked beyond traditional paddy to tap the benefits of sugarcane and other crops. To suit their varied application and utility, they then sought to replace the traditional wooden bullock carts with tyre carts. Seeing its benefits, the delta farmers used to purchase the tyre carts from Vellanur, Poovalur and Lalgudi in neighbouring Tiruchi district, observes a sugarcane grower K. A. S. Elangovan of Kurungulam.When farmers started to buy more tyre carts from those areas and there arose a need for workshops to carry out maintenance works, many ventured to establish tyre cart fabrication units in Thanjavur district itself. Soon, there sprouted at least 300 big and small tyre cart fabrication units in the delta region and they all bloomed well.Slowly, agricultural returns ebbed and with that the tyre cart fabricating units slid into hardship. Declining fortunes led many units to disappear and now hardly a third of them are surviving. Previously there used to be at least two tyre carts in every farmers household and we did a roaring business. Gone are the days when we would fabricate up to 10 carts a month. Now we are lucky if we repair and refit two or three carts, rues a tyre cart fabricator S. Savarimuthu of Thirukkanoorpatti.Initially, I hired technicians from Vellanur but later on the locals learnt the fabrication techniques and the business went on smoothly until the farmers started to feel the pinch of farming. Now, we fabricators are having a tough time as our other area of activity, grill making, has also floundered, says Mr. Savarimuthu who has been in the trade for more than three decades."
5aeb1a309855b7179ad713b4,When Tamil Nadu autonomy took a hit,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/dec/30/when-tamil-nadu-autonomy-took-a-hit-1740199.html,2017-12-30,"T MURUGANANTHAM ByExpress News ServiceCHENNAI: It will be sufficient if the Centre retains only such powers as are necessary for preserving the unity and integrity of the country leaving adequate powers to the States, said C N Annadurai, the architect of Dravidian politics, on April 8, 1967.That was the year DMK captured power in the State. More than half a century has passed since then, and two major Dravidian parties have been continuously ruling Tamil Nadu, barring the Emergency.Yet, the State government cannot offer admissions in its own medical colleges in the manner it wants to, but only based on the rules set by the Central government. In fair price shops, it has to limit supplies to comply with the conditions laid down by the Centre. The electricity it supplies will be on terms set by the Centre under the UDAY scheme. Even urban civic projects under the Smart Cities plan would have to be cleared by the Centre.Sanitation, which is the most mundane job of local civic bodies, too has a Central component under the Swachh Bharat scheme. Incidentally, most of the schemes had Hindi names whose meaning is not easy to comprehend for the Tamil speaking populace.The year that is about to end would perhaps be remembered as one where Tamil Nadu compromised its position as the epicentre of the battle for State autonomy. It started in the fag end of 2016 after the late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa fell seriously ill and was hospitalised. Jayalalithaa was a firebrand leader who never allowed the Centre to encroach upon the rights of the State government and raised her voice always, and on some occasions, she even wrote to Chief Ministers of other states to stand united on such issues.When she was being treated at Apollo Hospitals, the aberration started with the State government accepting to implement the National Food Security Act (NFSA), which went against the universal public distribution system that was successfully implemented for decades and acted as a pioneer to other states in this regard.Though the State government headed by Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam gave administrative reasons for accepting the NFSA and UDAY schemes, they drew bitter criticism from the opposition. Jayalalithaa had opposed the NFSA since it was proposed during the Congress-led UPA regime and she protested against UDAY tooth and nail.Jayas oppositionJayalalithaa wrote letters to successive Prime Ministers cautioning them not snatch away the powers of the State government under any pretext. When the NFSA was accepted by Tamil Nadu government in November last year, the government categorically said its implementation would not affect the quantity of goods supplied through ration shops. But later urad dal supply was stopped to family card holders while the price of sugar given to card holders was increased.A few academics think the problem started with DMK. DMK played a key role in fighting for State autonomy. In 1970s, the State government headed by former Chief Minister M Karunanidhi appointed the Rajamannar committee on Centre-State relations and became a pioneer for many other states in this regard.The recommendations of the committee had created a turmoil in the Centre and they were seen as a milestone in seeking autonomy for the States. After playing such a progressive federal policy, DMK compromised after they got were accommodated in Union government as coalition partners, C Lakshmanan of Madras Institute of Development Studies said.The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical admissions also created a row over the Central government infringing upon States rights. Education was originally in the State list but was later moved to Concurrent List by the Centre and the demand for restoring it to State list is growing.Because of this one reason, students of Tamil Nadu have been suffering a lot for the past few years. And 2017 became an unforgettable year with the suicide of 17-year-old Dalit girl, S Anitha, who had scored 1,176 out of 1,200 marks in her Class XII State Board examinations but could not join MBBS due to poor score in NEET. Anithas death shook the State.The Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence (Access to Justice and Reparation) Bill, 2011, National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) and Dam Safety Bill were among the many issues on which Jayalalithaa never hesitated to raise her voice against the Centre.Raids at SecretariatA few months after the demise of Jayalalithaa, an unprecedented incident took place at the seat of power  the Secretariat in December 2016. IT sleuths searched the office of the then Chief Secretary P Rama Mohana Rao for hours, just as a simultaneous search was going on at his residence. The search took place when the then chief minister O Panneerselvam was sitting in his office a few yards away. But there was no opposition from him.During her tenure, Jayalalithaa opposed many provisions of the GST Bill and forced the Central government accept many provisions to safeguard the interests of the State. After her demise, opposition from the government side petered down to requests.The biggest threat to State autonomy perhaps came when Governor Banwarilal Purohit started meeting the State government officials and reviewing the progress made in the welfare schemes. To the shock of everyone, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his ministers just said: Take it easy. After all, the Governor is functioning well within his powers.Some ministers tried to justify the act of the Governor saying he did not pass any orders to officials or take decision while the Opposition raised their voice in a big way, saying Purohit was interfering in the State administration. But for Purohit, meeting officials was not new. When he was the Governor of Assam, he did the same and even blamed the local government for not performing well. As for Purohit, inspections in Tamil Nadu were an exercise in continuity.Unfazed by the protests, Purohit stood his ground and declared that he would continue to meet officials and visit all districts by and by. While the leaders of BJP stoutly supported the Governors meeting with officials, the Opposition accused that BJP, with negligible presence in Tamil Nadu, was trying to rule the State through the Governor.When the Governor went to Cuddalore district, DMK and VCK cadre showed black flags. But the Governor continued to justify his visits, quoting profusely from the Constitution and arguing that he had all powers to meet officials. While a war of words between the BJP leaders and the Opposition was on, the ruling party took it easy. However, the BJP leaders had no convincing answer to the question posed by the Opposition: Will your Prime Minister allow President Ram Nath Kovind to do a Purohit in all states? Also, they could not answer a similar question as to whether Governors in BJP-ruled states would be allowed to conduct similar meetings with State government officials.Not so neetNo other issue perhaps brought out popular resentment against the Centre like NEET. With Centre pushing for a common entrance exam based on CBSE syllabus, students of Tamil Nadus government schools suffered a huge blow. The death of Anitha, a young medial aspirant who committed suicide, sparked massive protests against the Central government"

Late on Friday, boiling sugarcane juice stored in a tank fell on workers, scalding around a dozen of them. Five workers have succumbed to injuries so far, while at least four are said to be critical. They are admitted to hospitals in Parli and Latur district.The sugar factory was set up by late BJP leader Gopinath Munde in 2006, who was the factorys chairman till his death in a road accident in June 2014. His daughter, State Minister of Rural Development, Women and Child Welfare Pankaja Munde, is said to be closely associated to it. Mr. Munde, who is Ms. Mundes cousin, was briefly stopped by the police from entering the factory. The cousins are bitter political rivals.Accusing the factory management of attempting to prevent his entry, Mr. Munde said, This unfortunate incident should not be a moment for playing politics. Despite the fact that I, too, am a stakeholder in this factory, I was prevented from entering the premises by the management, who used the police to bar my entry. The senior NCP leader was allowed to enter the factory, but without those accompanying him.Mr. Munde later met the deceaseds kin, and spoke the investigating officer on the probe status. While a probe will reveal whether the tank, in which the juice was boiling, was old, there can be no doubt that this tragedy is a result of a gross human error, he said."

This year was no different. In the four days running up to Christmas, Malayalis bought over Rs 160 crore worth of booze from over 330 retail outlets of the state-run corporation. With five more days left in the month and the new year approaching, BEVCO officials are confident that December sales will definitely cross Rs 1,000 crores.Every year, sales have been going up. This year, we have been able to record a growth of 10-12% over the past year, said H Venkatesh, managing director of BEVCO.Figures from BEVCO show that while sales worth Rs 26.78 crore from retail outlets was recorded on December 22 last year, this year it has jumped to Rs 32.99 crore in the same day. On December 23 this year, Rs 42.91 crore was accumulated compared to Rs 31.32 crore in 2016. The highest booze sale was recorded on Christmas eve with Rs 49.2 crore collected compared to Rs 41.53 crore last year. On Christmas, sales came down to Rs 38.13 crore. However, it was still marginally higher than the Rs 34.46 crore collected the previous year.These figures are only from the retail outlets of BEVCO and sales from wholesale outlets and bars were not accounted.On Christmas, BEVCOs Valanjavattom outlet in Pathanamthitta district accounted for the most alcohol sales  Rs 52.03 lakh. The Nedumbassery outlet near the Cochin airport and the Changanacherry shop were in the second and third spot, garnering Rs 51.16 lakh and Rs 51.01 lakh respectively on the day.The state-run corporation clocks an average liquor sale of Rs 12,000 crore every year with major chunk of the revenue generated during Onam and Christmas-New Year days. While tipplers prefer beer during the summers, brandy and rum are sold the most in other months.

5aeb22da9855b7179ad71987,"From Plate to Plough: Agri-futures, like China",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-agri-futures-like-china-4968066/,2017-12-05,"(Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh) (Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh)In November, prices of most major kharif crops crashed below their respective minimum support prices (MSPs), triggering farm distress. One of the many reasons behind this situation is that planting decisions of our farmers are based on last years prices, rather than the prices expected at the time of harvest. Signals indicating future prices are largely absent as agri-futures have been decimated by excessive controls and regulation. It is time to think afresh and resurrect agri-futures in India.In 2003, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments decisions to allow futures markets in India  after a long gap  was hailed as a big and bold step towards better price discovery for farmers. This, in turn, was supposed to help farmers take informed planting decisions. In the initial years  2003-2007  agri-futures did show promising growth. But around 2007-2008, they were hit by the global food price crisis. Agri-futures picked up momentum again and peaked in 2011-2012. However, since then, there has been heavy government intervention in agri-futures with higher margin requirements as well as absolute suspensions, resulting in their near collapse.Chinese agri-futures have had a contrasting trajectory. The agri-futures market was introduced in the early 1990s in China. It struggled for a decade, but thereafter Chinese agri-futures had such a robust growth that by 2016, it was at the top of global chart, crossing the 1,000 million mark, dwarfing Indias 20 million contracts in the process.What lessons can India learn from China in order to promote its agri-futures and help its farmers in better price discovery? Very briefly, China experimented with several things, including inviting experts from the Chicago Board of Trade in the US, rationalising commodities and exchanges by closing down trade in many items and focusing on a few farm products, especially the less sensitive ones. However, to understand Indias story better, we need to look at the perceptions and actions of three key stakeholders: Policy-makers, regulators (FMC/SEBI), and commodity exchanges. A pre-requisite for the development of a agri-futures market is to have a stable policy environment.The government, including the regulator, should provide a favourable environment for the futures trade to flourish. Commodity exchanges have to invest in designing appropriate contracts for business development. Abrupt interventions, with frequent changes in stocking restrictions on private trade, have reduced the prospects of agri-futures in India. We collated information about various interventions related to margins and suspensions since 2003 and found that suspensions of agri-futures, as well as high margins, have been targeted more towards commodities that are perceived as sensitive in the common mans food basket (See graph). For example, tur, urad, rice have been suspended for more than a decade now. High margins for sensitive commodities, for example, 100 per cent for potato (August 2014), 95 per cent for chana (June 2016) and 70 per cent for sugar (September 2016) reflect the governments intention of blocking their futures trade.So, if one has to develop agri-futures in India, the first lesson is to stay away from sensitive commodities (for example, common rice, wheat, most pulses, and even sugar), at least for some time, till futures gain momentum and some depth. It would be prudent to focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex (oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maize), cotton, basmati rice and spices. Once markets are developed and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort, the country can diversify to other commodities in the agri-futures portfolio. This is what China also seems to have done. The largest volumes in agri-futures have come from oilseeds. This points to the significance of the regulators role: Giving a clear direction in terms of the choice of commodities, and then staying the course by adopting a stable policy with minimal interventions.Second, for the government to be assured that speculators are not rigging markets, the regulator should allow only delivery-based contracts, at least till markets deepen. This is another lesson from the Chinese experience: All agri-commodities traded at the Dalian Commodity Exchange are physical-delivery based.Third, like its Chinese counterpart, the government of India should encourage state trading enterprises (STEs) to trade on the agri-futures platform. This will boost the governments confidence in agri-futures as it will have ample information from its STEs. In China, STEs, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) for example, have a major presence in the agri-futures markets. COFCO is directly administered by Chinas State Council and is the largest food processor, manufacturer and largest exporter and importer in the country. It trades in agri-commodities like soybean oil and meal, palm oil, cotton and sugar in the futures market. Indias STEs like the MMTC, STC, PEC or even the FCI can participate on the agri-futures platform in a similar manner, helping it to deepen.Lastly, it has to be recognised that developing agri-futures is as much the responsibility of the regulator as that of commodity exchanges, and both need to work in harmony for the benefit of various stakeholders, especially farmers who need useful information about future prices for their products while they are planting those crops. Can the Narendra Modi government take bold decisions to revive the legacy of the Vajpayee government and scale new heights in agri-futures, say 200 million contracts by 2022? Remember, China crossed the billion mark in 2015.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb24c89855b7179ad71a8a,Sweet somethings,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/west-bengal-gi-registration-kolkata-rasagolla-odisha-4940866/,2017-11-17,"Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar) Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar)In the last decade of the 19th century, the food aficionado Bipradas Mukhopadhyay compiled what was then regarded as the definitive list of Bengali sweetmeat recipes. Mishtanna Pak (cooking of sweets), Mukhopadhyays two-volume magnum opus, goes into copious details while giving instructions on preparing sweetmeats, many of which are obscure today. It lists more than 25 varieties of the sandesh. But Mukhopadhyay  whose more famous work, Pak Pranali, has been described by the sociologist Krishnendu Ray as the first truly popular modern Bengali cookbook  is way less effusive about the rosogolla. It finds a mention only in the discussion on sugar syrups.Rosogolla is prepared by mixing one ser (equivalent to 933 grammes) chhana (cottage cheese) with one ser sugar syrup. Small amounts of cardamom and rose water are added. One ser rosogolla requires four times of its quantity of syrup so that the chhana balls can float easily. The sugar syrup should be prepared very carefully so as to prevent it from becoming concentrated. The chhana should be fresh and absolutely free from moisture. It should be kneaded properly to squeeze the water out of it, notes the Mishtanna Pak. The West Bengal government cited this discussion in the 19th century cookbook as evidence for rosogallas origin in the state when it applied to the Registrar of Intellectual Properties for the Geographical Index (GI) tag for the sweetmeat.By most accounts, the Bengali passion for sweetmeats made from chhana is less than three centuries old. Food writer Chitrita Banerjee believes that confectioners in the state may have been trained by Portuguese colonists in the use of cottage cheese. But even into the mid-19th century there is no mention of the sandesh or rosogolla, Banerji writes in her classic, Life and Food in Bengal. She believes that these sweets were probably devised by professional sweat-makers during the latter half of the 19th century. However, its also well-known that in about a century, the two sweets had become emblematic of gastronomy, so much so that a ban on chhana sweets in 1965 by West Bengals then chief minister, Prafulla Chandra Sen  to deal with a milk shortage  evoked strong protests from Calcuttas confectioners. According to contemporary accounts, the artisans employed by the confectioners did not know how to make sweets other than sandesh and rosogolla.In their recent gastronomic kerfuffle with foodies from neighbouring Odisha, Bengali rosogolla buffs often extol the skills of these sweetmeat artisans. Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. The chhana balls should be soft but firm enough so that they are not broken while coming in contact with each other, cautions the Mishtanna Pak. Judicious addition of different agents in measured quantity is a major responsibility of the experienced artisans, notes the West Bengal governments GI application. It likens the role of the artisan to the conductor of an orchestra, who knows how to direct it to a flawless conclusion.Bengals upper-caste sweet aficionados have, however, had an ambivalent attitude to the sweet meat artisan, the moira. According to Banerji, tradition pictures the moira as a huge immobile mountain of flesh sitting in front of his stove or in front of a huge platter which he manipulates with the ease of long practice. He is utterly oblivious to all else in the world and so satiated with his products that he never touches them himself. Other accounts are at odds with such benign imagery. Historian Utsa Ray writes that confectioners, who generally belonged to the lower castes, were an object of disgust for the middle-class. She quotes a petition to the Bengal government in the mid-19th century which describes moiras as men more concerned with their own interests than the health and lives of their buyers. Moiras were also accused of being dirty and unhygienic, by R.C. Day, a physician writing in the 1920s.It was one such moira who is credited in numerous accounts as the creator of the rosogolla  as the Bengalis know it. According to the Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, The story goes that Nobin Moira belonged to a family of gur traders that had fallen on bad times. After at least one false start, he opened a shop in the Bagbazaar district of North Kolkata. Two kinds of sweets were popular at that time, sandesh and sweets made of lentils. An account written much later notes that patrons were bored and demanded something different. So Nobin came up with the rosogolla.But like most items, pinpointing rosogollas origins is a difficult  and as the Odisha-West Bengal contest over the sweetmeat shows  and fraught endeavour. Even in Bengal, there are several accounts about the rosogollas origin. Food historian Pranab Ray believes that the sweet was introduced a few years before Nobin Moiras creation by a confectioner who traded his wares in front of the Calcutta High Court. An early 20th century account, Nadia Kahini, quoted by Utsa Ray claims a rather fortuitous origin for the syrupy sponge balls: Rosogolla is not more than 50/60 years old. Haradhan Moira used to make sweets for the landlord. His little daughter was crying. In order to pacify her, Haradhan dropped some cottage cheese in the sugar syrup that was boiling on the stove. The result was a fine product. The zamindars named it rosogolla.In her work on American cheese-making, anthropologist Heather Paxson argues that cheese artisans have a tradition of inventing. The different, and contesting, accounts of rosogollas origins testify to such ingenuity  of Bengals moiras and Odishas sweet makers. But a GI tag runs counter to inventiveness. It binds artisanal production to strict standards of authenticity  and origin. A 2006 paper by trade economist Ben Shephard argued that the strict GI standards were making it difficult for French wine-makers to cater to tastes of New World Consumers. It will be a pity if such a fate befell Nobin Moiras successors.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The Global Burden of Disease study was initiated 26 years ago to chart the changing patterns of disease-related death and disability from 1990 onwards.Health status of populations across the world changes over time in response to socio-economic, demographic, nutritional, scientific, technological, environmental and cultural shifts. Such health transitions have been especially profound in the past half-century due to sweeping industrialisation, rapid urbanisation and relentless globalisation in most parts of the world. It is necessary to understand, and even predict, the patterns and dynamics of health transition so that multi-sectoral actions can be taken to protect and promote the health of populations.The Global Burden of Disease study was initiated 26 years ago to chart the changing patterns of disease-related death and disability from 1990 onwards. Since then, estimates are periodically provided for years of life lost to premature mortality as well as for years of disease-related disability that is weighted for severity. A combined measure of these two metrics is expressed as the loss of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to any disease or risk factor. In recent years, national and sub-national estimates are emerging to provide greater focus to action within countries.The first-of-its-kind Indian effort to map state-level disease burdens was undertaken by over 1,000 experts led by Lalit Dandona of the Public Health Foundation of India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the team that leads the global study. The results, reported last week, highlight significant trends common to all states as well as important differences between them.Life expectancy at birth improved in India from 59.7 years in 1990 to 70.3 years in 2016 for females, and from 58.3 years to 66.9 years for males. However, life expectancy of women in Uttar Pradesh is 12 years lower than that of women in Kerala, while the life expectancy of men in Assam is 10 years lower than that of men in Kerala. The per person disease burden, from all causes, dropped by 36 per cent in the same period. However, there was an almost two-fold difference between the states in 2016, with Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh having the highest rates, and Kerala and Goa the lowest rates.The under-five mortality rate has reduced substantially in all states in these 25 years. But there was a four-fold difference in this rate between the highest, in Assam and Uttar Pradesh, as compared with the lowest in Kerala in 2016. Despite a decline from 1990 levels, child and maternal malnutrition remains the single largest risk factor, contributing to 15 per cent of the disease burden in 2016. With its under-five mortality six times higher than Sri Lanka and burden of child and maternal malnutrition 12 times higher than in China, India has wide gaps to bridge.Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases contributed to 61 per cent of Indias disease burden in 1990. This dropped to 33 per cent in 2016. But the share of non-communicable diseases in the disease burden increased from 30 per cent in 1990 to 55 per cent in 2016, and that of injuries increased from 9 per cent to 12 per cent. While all states show this trend, Kerala, Goa, and Tamil Nadu have the largest dominance of non-communicable diseases and injuries over infectious and associated diseases, whereas this ratio is much lower in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Five of the 10 individual leading causes of the disease burden in India in 2016 are a carry-over of past threats: Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, iron-deficiency anaemia, neonatal pre-term birth, and tuberculosis. Though the disease burden due to poor water and sanitation decreased in these 25 years, the per capita burden due to these factors is 40 times that in China.In 2016, three of the five leading individual causes of disease burden in India were non-communicable, with ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being the top two causes and stroke the fifth leading cause.A group of risks including unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and overweight, which mainly contribute to ischaemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes, caused about 25 per cent of the total disease burden in India in 2016, up from about 10 per cent in 1990. Ambient air pollution and household air pollution both rank high as risk factors in 2016, the former rising and the latter declining in the past 25 years.There were large variations between states in the degree to which these risks are rising. States in early stages of the health transition were coping with both the persisting challenge of infectious, nutritional and pregnancy-related health threats and the rising magnitude of non-communicable diseases. States in the advanced stage of the transition were grappling largely with non-communicable disorders.These data, of time trends and inter- state variations, highlight the need to develop specific strategies to address the major contributors to disease burden within each state. Disaggregated data, as provided in the recent report, will help to tailor customised state-level responses while summated time trends will help the National Health Policy to set and track the progress towards country-level targets. Since the present report provides modelled estimates derived from multiple and often limited data sets, it is imperative to strengthen vital registration mechanisms and disease and risk factor surveillance systems in every state.The broad national agenda should be elimination of malnutrition, reduction of child and maternal mortality, control of infectious diseases and containment of risk factors contributing to non-communicable diseases. This report provides each state the GPS to chart their individual journeys towards those goals, from different starting points.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The angry farmers went out of the office premises and sat on the road in protest, disturbing traffic flow for around two hours.Addressing them at the agitation site, Maruti Manpade, State vice-president of KPRS, condemned the Union government for importing pulses from abroad and causing price crash in the domestic market.The Union government is keen on safeguarding the interests of big corporate houses, including the Ambani and Adani groups. It allowed big corporate groups to import 67 lakh tonnes of pulses in 2015-16, 57 lakh tonnes in 2016-17 and 18 lakh tonnes in 2017-18. As it did not impose 30 % duty on these imports as demanded by farmers organisations, the imported pulses were sold in the domestic market at low prices causing a price crash, he said.The farmers leaders lashed out at the governments for unscientific MSP and quantity restriction in procurement. Considering the cost of cultivation, farmers want MSP of Rs. 7,500 a quintal of red gram. However, the Union government has fixed only Rs. 5,450 a quintal and the State government would add Rs. 550 to make it Rs. 6,000 a quintal.Though the expected yield in the State is around 9 lakh tonnes this year, the Union government has decided to procure only 1,65,750 tonnes at MSP. This cap would push farmers to sell their crop at a much lower price in the open market, a farmer leader said.The agitation was withdrawn after a representative from the office of the Deputy Commissioner met the agitating farmers and received a memorandum addressed to the Chief Minister of Karnataka.Their demands included fixing MSP of Rs. 7,500 a quintal of red gram, removing quantity cap in procurement, opening procurement centres in each gram panchayat, imposing 30 % import duty on pulses and implementation of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee recommendations.Manjunath Gowda, Maula Mulla, Muneer Haski, Sharanabasappa Mamshetty, Shantappa Patil, Ashok Myageri, Panduranga Manivakar and other farmers leaders were present."

But State farmers, especially those from the Cauvery basin, are losing Rs. 270 a tonne due to such stringent norms as their average sugar recovery percentage is only around 8, association president Kuruburu Shanthakumar told The Hindu after the meeting.For the north Karnataka farmers, whose sugar recovery percentage is higher than that of their Cauvery basin counterparts, relaxing of norms would result in earnings of an additional Rs. 270 a tonne, he noted.Ministers sugar millin dockExpressing concern that some sugar mills were yet to pay dues of around Rs. 180 crore since 2013-14 towards sugarcane supplied by farmers, Mr. Shanthakumar alleged that Bhagya Lakshmi sugar mills in Belagavi district, in which the family of district in charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi had a stake, was yet to pay arrears of several crores."

High sweetness without salty taste, high content of iron, less sodium content, less insoluble impurities, organic method of production and dark brown colour are the unique characters of this traditional sharkara.A meeting of the apex body constituted for the GI registration of Marayur jaggery chaired by Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar at Kerala Agricultural University on Thursday decided to submit the GI application at the earliest. An awareness meeting of sugarcane farmers and jaggery producers will be held on January 4, 2018 at Marayur as a prelude to this.The quality of Marayoor jaggery is attributed to low temperature prevailing in the area, soil characteristics, quality of water used for irrigation and jaggery production, the traditional methods of production and sugarcane varieties used in cultivation.Another specialty of this jaggery is that it is not made in factories using modern equipment, but in the jaggery production sheds located in the farm itself, in a traditional manner. The jaggery produced from the geographical area has a higher market demand than that produced from other regions, since it is very sweet in taste and is of good quality.Marayur sharkara without colouring agents will be dark brown in colour.

Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Maharashtra as the top sugar producing state in the country.Sugar millers from Maharashtra, already bogged down by falling demand and price, now have to reckon with sugar from Uttar Pradesh. Thanks to the logistical advantage, sugar from the northern state is fast posing a challenge even in the traditional markets which were monopolised by Maharashtras sugar sectorSince the adoption of the wonder variety Co 0238, Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Maharashtra as the top sugar producing state in the country. Two consecutive droughts had also hurt Maharashtras sugar production, which has further cemented Uttar Pradeshs claim.This year, while Maharashtra is projected to produce 73 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar, UP is all set to touch the 100 lt production figure.This variety, developed by Dr Bakshi Ram, director of the Indian Council of Agriculture Researchs Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Comibatore, has helped both millers and farmers in Uttar Pradesh. The higher sucrose content in this variety has helped millers recover more sugar per tonne of cane crushed and for farmers, this variety has resulted in higher yield per acre.Millers from Maharashtra say that UP millers, thanks to increased sugar production, have now started making inroads into markets which were traditionally cornered by them like Delhi, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. To add to Maharashtra millers woes, UP millers enjoy logistical advantage  they are geographically nearer to these markets and thus charge less on transport costs. UPs domestic consumption is around 37-38 lt and as compared to its previous production records of 50-60 lt, this year it is all set to produce 100 lt of sugar. The excess sugar obviously challenges the markets which were traditionally captured by us, said a miller from Kolhapur.On Friday, cooperative and private millers from Maharashtra held a meeting to discuss the various issues plaguing the sector. BB Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA)  the apex body of private millers in Maharashtra  said they have decided to meet the chief minister early in January to discuss the issues. In view of the falling prices, payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers is becoming a major issue for us. Unless there are some policy level tweaks, the mills will soon not be in a position to pay the growers, he said.To arrest the falling prices, millers in Maharashtra want the creation of a buffer stock of 50 lt along with 100 per cent ban on imports. The millers also want the 20 per cent export duty on sugar to be waived off along with the Re 1.2 per unit cost levied on captive consumption of electricity generated by millers themselves.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Several years ago, Tee E. Siong, Malaysias leading nutrition expert, decided to act, organising a far-reaching study of local diets and lifestyle habits.The research, conducted by scientists from the Nutrition Society of Malaysia, which Mr. Tee heads, has produced several articles for peer-reviewed academic journals. But scientists werent the only ones vetting the material. One of the reviewers was Nestl, the worlds largest food company, which financed the research.Among the published articles was one that concluded that children who drank malted breakfast beverages  a category dominated in Malaysia by Milo, a sugary powder drink made by Nestl  were more likely to be physically active and spend less time in front of a computer or television.The research exemplified a practice that began in the West and has moved, along with rising obesity rates, to developing countries: deep financial partnerships between the worlds largest food companies and nutrition scientists, policymakers and academic societies.As they seek to expand their markets, big food companies are spending significant funds in developing countries, from India to Cameroon, in support of local nutrition scientists.Increase in salesThe industry funds research projects, pays scholars consulting fees, and sponsors most major nutrition conferences at a time when sales of processed foods are soaring. In Malaysia sales have increased 105% over the past five years, according to Euromonitor, a market research company.In addition to Nestl, Mr. Tees work has been funded by Kelloggs, PepsiCo and Tate & Lyle. He said scientists need cooperation and financial support from companies, who can supply much-needed resources. He said he has used his position in the government to push for important steps to regulate companies, including a 2003 rule that required food companies to put nutritional information  the levels of fat, sugars and protein  on their packaging. We were one of the first countries in Asia to do it, he said.Nestl said it is important for the company to collaborate in efforts to improve nutrition around the globe.Nestl reads papers before publication as part of a written agreement between the company and Mr. Tees Nutrition Society.Two of Malaysias top health officials recently sat down at the Health Ministrys offices to discuss obesity and Mr. Tees role in the countrys response to it. I really admire him, said Zalma Abdul Razak, the head of nutrition at the ministry. Nobody can replace him as the president of the Nutrition Society of Malaysia.The ethos of corporate partnership runs through a number of health initiatives in Malaysia. A Health Ministry committee teamed up with the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers, which includes representatives of major food companies, to develop a labelling system for the public. The labels tells consumers which packaged foods are a healthier choice than others in the same category.Corporate funding of nutrition science in Malaysia has weakened the case against sugar and processed foods, said Rohana Abdul Jalil, a Harvard-trained diet expert based in the rural state of Kelantan, where obesity is as high as in the biggest cities. Theres never been an explicit, aggressive campaign against sugar, Ms. Jalil said.NY TIMES"

This is 26% higher than the supply of 111 crore litres in 2015-2016. Ethanol supplies finalised last year were 66.5 crore litres.The Indian Sugar Mills Association said following two rounds of negotiations between sugar mills and ethanol manufacturers on the one side, and oil marketing companies (OMCs) on the other, against the first tender invited in November, 140 crore litres of ethanol supplies had been finalised.With this, the country would see blending of up to 4.5% ethanol blending with petrol in 2017-2018. Some more quantities could be supplied by sugar factories/ethanol manufacturers when the next round of tender is opened, possibly in February 2018, sources said. The government had earlier made it mandatory for oil marketing firms to ensure that ethanol would make up 10% of the petrol they sold at the retail level.However, that mandate is yet to see light of day, according to sources, due to inadequate supply of ethanol. OMCs would need 313 crore litres to meet the 10% blending target.Ethanol supplies also go to sectors such as alcohol and chemicals. If ethanol supplies increase, it would help reduce the oil import bill for the country.Remove leviesStates such as U.P. can meet the targeted 10% ethanol blending because of high sugar production. For other States to meet the mandate, governments should remove all levies on denatured ethanol, the association said.OMCs have offered an ex-distillery rate of Rs. 40.85 for a litre of ethanol. Sugar mills and ethanol manufacturers will get almost Rs. 5,700 crore this year from ethanol sales."

RamakrishnaA 56-foot-tall Christmas tree with 56 branches decked up with cupcakes would compete for the Guinness Book of World Records this year.Over 7,500 cupcakes of different flavours have been used to make the tree which has been registered in the Guinness tallest pastry tree category. The cakes are of three different sizes to suit the layered design. They weigh 850 kg in total, even as the structure weighs two tonnes.A hundred undergraduate and postgraduate students and a pastry chef of Culinary Academy of India (CAI), a private college affiliated to Osmania University, worked for two days to give shape to the tree.The tree, displayed inside the CAIs five-storied building located near Begumpet metro station, proved a delight for 1,000 students enrolled in the citys government schools here on Sunday. The academy also sold cupcake combo-packets to those interested in sugary treats.Flavour-richThe cupcakes were available in 20 flavours, including lemon, mango, pineapple, strawberry, mocha and mint. Among the flavours, chocolate, red velvet and pistachio were the most popular, said the student chefs. We followed the specifications listed by the Guinness Book of Records when it came to the structure. Even if we do not set the record, the exercise in itself is rewarding as it motivated our students, who are passing out this academic year, to aspire for more, said Naluvala Srikanth, head of pastry and bakery department in the academy.Apart from the cakes, the tree had pastry reindeer figurines stuck to the branches to give it a festive feel. It was also decorated in cotton candy to make the branches look snowy. The base structure made of glass was designed and put up almost a week before we made the cupcakes. Both the alumni and teachers of the academy helped students in this exercise, said Sudhakar N. Rao, director and principle of the academy.The students of the academy said the exercise gave them a confidence boost. Its a lot of work. But it is rewarding and joyful, which suits the spirit of the season, said Abhinav, a student of the academy. While the final year students worked on the cake-mix, about 250 first and second year undergraduate students managed the massive crowd that turned up to see the colourful tree.The same culinary school had in 2016 displayed 504 cakes at a single venue to set a record. In 2015, it had tried to set a record for the longest cold meat platter in the world."

Dr Poonam Satpute was diabetic, could have suffered hypoglycemia that led to her death, says forensic expert.A day after the body of gynaecologist Dr Poonam Satpute was found in her Andheri West flat, Amboli police registered a case of accidental death on Wednesday. Autopsy conducted on the 50-year-old doctor revealed that she died at least three days before the body was found.The death of the doctor, who suffered from diabetes over a period of time, shocked the medical community as the news broke on social media platforms. A forensic expert said Satpute is suspected to have suffered from hypoglycemia  low blood sugar levels  due to diabetes that led to her death. It seems she missed her meals or was in stress. She seems to have suffered a natural death, a forensic expert said.Satpute was known to be one of the first few gynaecologists in the city to use robotic surgeries. In over 24 years of her career, Satpute worked in Singapore heading a robotic surgery department in a private hospital. Later, she worked in Chennais Apollo Hospital before moving to Mumbai a few years ago. Satpute consulted with several private hospitals, including Cloud Nine, and earlier in Brahma Kumaris Global Hospital and Research Center.She was my batch mate from 1986 to 1991 in KEM hospital. It is a shock to us that she passed away, said Dr Niranjan Agrawal, the chairman of Network of AMC hospitals (NOAH). Gynaecologist Dr Sangeeta Pikale said Satpute was known to be energetic and vibrant. Pikale said: She was very bubbly. It is difficult to imagine she may even suffer from depression.The police do not suspect homicide. Autopsy findings stated there was no external injuries on the body. It was found in a semi-decomposed condition. We have preserved viscera sample for chemical analysis to check if there was any drug overdose, a forensic doctor said.According to the police, on Tuesday, Satputes neighbours complained of a foul smell from the doctors second-storey flat in Four Bungalows, Andheri, and alerted them. The body was found late on Tuesday evening. Satputes younger sister and parents also stay in Andheri but the family members claim that no one was in contact with her on a regular basis. We are trying to cope with this. Our family is in shock, Satputes sister Neelam said. According to relatives, Satpute lived alone in a rented flat. Her husband, who underwent a bypass surgery two months ago, lives in Chennai.She moved to a rented accommodation after our building went under redevelopment few years ago. Perhaps because it was Christmas and an extended weekend, the hospital thought she was on leave and did not get curious about her absence, an old neighbour of Satpute said. The doctors last rites were held in Amboli on Wednesday afternoon. The post-mortem had been conducted at Dr R N Cooper Hospital.On Wednesday, doctors discussed how stress levels have increased amongst medical professionals. Despite being doctors, our life span is reducing because of stress, gynaecologist Pikale said. Satputes last communication on Whatsapp, her colleagues said, was on December 23 around 11 pm. An officer from Amboli police station said an accidental death report had been registered at the police station in connection with the case.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

ArchiveWITH CHIEF Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Minister of State for Co-operation Gulabrao Patil deciding to skip the annual general body meeting in Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute, former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar took to the stage to advised the sugar sector to brace up for hard times.The recent directives of the state government of charging millers for harvesting and transport as per the distance have invited a flak from the sugar sector. The millers have also sought an appointment with the chief minister early next week to discuss the harvest and transport (HnT) charges, among other issues.Till last year, sugar mills charged a uniform rate of Rs 650 per tonne of the cane crushed as the HnT cost. As per the new directives, the HnT cost will depend on the actual distance of the field from the mills. Thus, farmers whose fields are closer to the mill will be charged lesser than those whose cane had to travel further distance.Unlike in Uttar Pradesh, millers in Maharashtra make arrangements for harvesting and transportation of cane from the fields of growers in lieu of a fixed charge, which is deducted from the final payment of the farmer.At the event, Pawar said this mechanism was not suitable for cooperative mills. I have raised the problems faced by the sector with both the central and state government. However, I do not know if they will be ready to help. In such a scenario, it is best for the sector to take steps to tide over the crisis. This will hit the availability of cane and needs to reconsidered, he added.Former minster and senior Congress leader Harashvardhan Patil said the decision was taken without taking into account the present legal framework. District collectors, Patil said, have been asked to determine the transportation costs, but barring Aurangabad, no one has submitted the data. We will be meeting the chief minister in the first week of January and are hopeful that the old system will be reinstated, he added.On the absence of the CM and the MoS, Pawar said the chief minister had gone to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Gujarat government and had expressed his inability to attend the meeting. Perhaps this would be the first year that the biggest event of the sugar industry happened in the absence of top government participation.The major part of Pawars speech was devoted to the greater crisis looming over the sector in view of a bumper crop next year (2018-19). Initial estimates have put the next years cane average in Maharashtra alone at over 9 lakh hectares and over 90 lakh tonnes of sugar is expected to be produced in the state. The former agriculture minister said, in view of the increased cane availability, mills might have to start their crushing operations earlier. Although, he added, it might result in lower sugar recovery. Growers are expected to get compensation in case mills fail to crush their cane in time.He said, The extra cane will seriously pose a problem for the millers but, in absence of government help, mills have to make arrangements themselves to ensure 100 per cent crushing. Mills might explore signing per-season MoUs to transport cane from surplus to deficit areas.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Growers are expected to get compensation in case mills fail to crush their cane in time.He said, The extra cane will seriously pose a problem for the millers but, in absence of government help, mills have to make arrangements themselves to ensure 100 per cent crushing. Mills might explore signing per-season MoUs to transport cane from surplus to deficit areas.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Dr Abhay Hake and Jasveer Singh.Along with the manufacturing sector, Internet of Things (IoT) and connected devices now hope to address some of the burning issues related to agriculture as well. Sense It Out Intelligent Solutions Private Limited, a Pune-based start-up, has come up with a solution which aims to optimise water usage using sensors and on-field connected devices. Called Sensor-based Intelligent Crop Centric Automation (SICCA), this solution uses sensors to measure soil moisture to optimise water usage on fields. Jasveer Singh, co-founder of the company which has developed the technology, said on-field sensors will help them reduce the quantity of water needed for irrigation. In order to get the best yield per acre, correct water usage plays a very important role. However, at present most of the farmers have back-of-the-envelope calculations to control their water usage during the life cycle of the crop, he said.Singh cited the example of sugarcane whose cultivation, especially in areas like Maharashtra, has often been criticised because of the enormous amounts of water it requires. Most sugarcane farmers, Singh said, practised what is called dubuk irrigation to water their crops. Farmers throw a random stone at the remotest part of their field. Only if the stone makes the typical sound of hitting the water, indicating ample water levels, the water supply is switched off. A lot of water gets wasted in the process, he said.Singh said SICCA solves this problem by regular monitoring of the soil moisture content through sensors which are installed in the field. At the start of the cropping cycle, all that the farmer has to do is to select the name of the crop from the drop down menu of the app. The app will accordingly calculate the amount of water and intervals when the crop would require watering. Based on this input, the drip irrigation system will only allow the required amount of water to flow into the field, he said. As and when the sensors indicate moisture stress, the pump will be instructed to run the watering cycle again.This smart irrigation system, Singh said, improves the yield per acreage by 1.2-2 times and reduces water wastage by almost 60-70 per cent. The data so obtained can be used for drought management and economise the water usage in periods of severe stress, he said. This system requires almost no human interference and the installed app will send out message only in case of emergencies.The product, which is two years old, had won a grant from the Centre and was also one of the top 20 start-ups under the Innovate for Digital India challenge. Along with Singh, Dr Abhay Hake co-founded the start-up and their working prototype is ready for field trials.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Vishal Srivastav Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary at a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal SrivastavLeader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of provoking and instigating opposition parties and asked him to be mridubhashi (soft-spoken). Chaudhary targeted Adityanath over his statement in the Assembly on Tuesday, when he had indirectly mentioned Congress president Rahul Gandhi speaking about aloo ki factory. Adityanath had said that there is a leader, who does not even know that potatoes are grown on fields, not in factories.While Adityanath had also said that many in the Opposition do not even know the difference between aloo and lauki or mango and sugarcane, Chauduary said, Aap to vipaksha ko khud uksate hain bharkate hain mridubhashi ho jaiye (You provoke and instigate the Oppositionbe a sweet-talker).Chaudhary said that he had raised the issue (of potato farmers) even during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. Lag sakhta hai aloo ka karkhana, said Chaudhary, while pointing out that potato farmers are facing acute crises due to extremely low rates of their crop in the market. He said that the anger of farmers is increasing. Replying to Chaudhary, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government had taken steps to help potato farmers soon after it had come to power. He added that apart from allowing and promoting export of the crop, farmers were also given exemption from mandi fee and the government had even purchased the crop. He said that the state government has decided to include potato in the midday meal menu of state schools.Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu, meanwhile, raised objection to the comment made on the statement of Rahul Gandhi but Treasury benches as well as the Speaker pointed out that no specific name was taken at the Assembly. As the Opposition went on to raise the issue of potato farmers, Adityanath said that his government has worked to give protection to all farmers without any bias. He said that while his government has announced support price for potato farmers for the first time, a three-member committee was also formed to solve their issues, apart from giving them other benefits. The chief minister said that for the first time, potato farmers were given permission to export their produce and orders have been issued to include potato in midday meals as well.Adityanath said that his government kisano ke hiton ko puri tarha se sanrakshan karegi (The government will protect the interest of the farmers in every possible way).At this point, Samajwadi Party MLAs staged a walkout, calling the government kisan virodhi (anti-farmers).Later in the day, Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded discussion on the deaths of children across the state especially in Gorakhpur and staged a walk out over the issue. He said outside the Assembly that he demanded a discussion on the issue of childrens death in Gorakhpur and other districts, but was denied it. The Congress leader said that he would again raise the issue on Thursday.Chaudhary as well senior BSP leader Sukhdev Rajbhar also raised the issue of incorrect information being given by officers in reply to questions asked in the Assembly and requested action in the matter. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna promised to order an inquiry into the matter and take appropriate action against the guilty officers.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 was placed in the Assembly on Wednesday. In the written statement of objects and reasons for presenting the bill, Law Minister Brajesh Pathak maintained that, On the recommendation of the central law commission and Ramunujam Committee constituted by the central government, it has been decided to repeal those Acts, which were notified by the central government during Presidents rule in the state and during the British Rule before Independence and have become obsolete and useless. The Acts, which have been repealed include The Police (Agra) Act 1857, The Mirzapur Stone Mahal Act, 1886 and The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation (Vote on account) Acts of 1980, 1993, 1996, 1996, 1997 and 2002 along with The Uttar Pradesh Appropriation Acts of the respective years.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

In all, 517 farmers suffered loss to the tune of Rs. 17.65 lakh.Based on a survey, proposal for relief to affected farmers had been forwarded to the government. Crop loss compensation for last summer was being disbursed. While 18 paddy farmers had received Rs. 51,000 as compensation, Rs. 48.64 crore would be paid to 20,205 farmers. Maize farmers would get Rs. 24.49 crore and Rs. 7.52 crore would be paid to greengram farmers.During 2017  2018, as many as 15,201 farmers had insured paddy before the deadline as they had raised the crop on 27,368 acres.For the rain-fed crops like maize, sorghum, blackgram, greengram and groundnut, farmers should pay the insurance premium before February 15 while the deadline for cotton is February 28. The sugarcane growers should insure the crop before October 31, 2018. When the farmers wanted the officials to survey the loss of coconut trees due to drought-like situation, District Revenue Officer P. Muthuramalingam said a proposal has been sent to the government for withered coconut on 413 hectares in western Tirunelveli.They deplored compensation of Rs. 3 being given for a damaged or withered banana tree and urged the Collector to send experts to advice farmers suitably for treating the pest attack in red banana in Vadakarai area.Officials from the Department of Animal Husbandry informed the farmers that a proposal had been sent to the government for launching one more mobile veterinary clinic in Tenkasi in addition to the existing one.The farmers raised the issue of severe damage being caused by wild boars to standing crops. Like the government of Kerala and Telengana, the State government should remove wild boar from the list of scheduled animals so that they can kill them as and when they enter the ranches, P. Perumbadaiyar, vice-president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam said. No reply was given to this appeal.The farmers deplored registration of a case against a farmer, who raised a question during the grievance meet held at Tenkasi recently and argued with an official. Though the farmer and the official buried their difference of opinion in the meeting, registration of a case two days later is an attempt to threaten farmers participating in the meet, said farmer Zakhir Hussein from Vadakarai. Mr. Sandeep assured that he would look into the issue."

While Papanasam dam has 5,166 mcft against its maximum capacity of 5,500 mcft, the Manimuthar dam, has 4,682 mcft against the maximum level of 5,511 mcft. The relatively smaller Servalar dam has 1,011 mcft against the maximum capacity of 1,225 mcft. The Gadana, Ramanadhi, Karuppanadhi, Gundar, Adavinainar, Vadakku Pachchaiyar, Kodumudiyar and Nambiyar dams have more than 90% of water.So, the Department of Agriculture has planned to take up paddy cultivation on over 45,000 hectares. It has also set a target of bringing 13,100 hectares under millets, 35,500 hectares under grams, 4,000 hectares under cotton, 3,000 hectares under sugarcane and 4,310 hectares under oilseeds. While oilseed crops have been so far cultivated on 452 hectares against this target, cultivation of all other minor crops are expected to reach the target before end of December.Officials say that streamlined distribution and adequate stock of chemical fertilizers such as urea, di-ammonium-phosphate, potash, super phosphate and complex fertilizers had kept the prices under control. Moreover, raids to check quality and quantity of chemical fertilizers have resulted in the sale of these nutrients at the right price.Quality of seeds and chemical fertilizers are being checked randomly. When 2,715 seeds were taken for analysis, 34 samples were found to be of inferior quality so that the lot has been seized even as legal course will follow, the officers say.Though the district has recorded 33% of surplus rainfall this year  1,086.05 mm received against the average of 814.80 mm  41 rain-fed tanks are still bone dry, much to the disappointment of farmers.At the same time, 54 rain-fed tanks have water sufficient for irrigating crops for 90 days while water stored in 740 more tanks is sufficient for 60 days of irrigation. Another 462 tanks have water sufficient for 30 days of irrigation.So, this pisanam paddy season will be a profitable exercise, say the farmers."

In clear violation of the directives by airport authorities, specifying how much they can charge for water  Rs 10 for 500 ml and Rs 20 for 1 litre of water, Rs 20 for 150 ml of tea, and Rs 30 for 150 ml coffee, the outlets continue to sell these items at higher prices.In July 2017, Pune airport director Ajay Kumar had convened a meeting of all the concessionaire operators, and directed them to sell these basic items at economical prices, as directed by AAI headquarters. Minutes of the meeting, held on July 2, shows that representatives of six concessionaires  Lite Bite Foods, New Poona Bakery, Sai Balaji Food and Beverage, Sugardough run by Supra Foods, and outlets run by P K Hospitality and R B A Hospitality  had attended the meeting.As per records, Sugardough, the restaurant located in front of the terminal building run by Supra Foods, used to sell tea at Rs 30, coffee at Rs 40, a 1 litre water bottle at Rs 30 and 500 ml bottle at Rs 20. New Poona Bakery stall, inside the terminal building, sold tea and coffee at Rs 50 each, and 500 ml bottle at Rs 20. Snack Bar, run by P K Hospitality, sold tea at Rs 50 and coffee at Rs 70. A restaurant run by the same firm charged Rs 104 for tea and coffee, and Rs 50 for 500 ml water bottle.The participants of the meeting were informed about the decision of the AAI headquarters, regarding provision of tea/coffee and water bottle at economical prices, and requested agencies to make available the above referred items at economical prices at their counters, read the minutes of the meeting. As per the records, representatives of Sugardough, Sai Balaji Foods and Beverages and New Poona Bakery agreed to make mineral water available at the requested price (Rs 10 for 500 ml, Rs 20 for 1 litre), and sell tea at Rs 20 and coffee at Rs 30.Representatives of Lite Bite Foods, P K Hospitality and RBA Hospitality had sought a few days time to discuss the issue and convey their decision. Despite these assurances, nothing much seems to have changed on the ground. On Friday, Pune Newsline found that Sugardough continues to sell tea at Rs 30, coffee at Rs 40 and a 1 litre water bottle at Rs 30. The 500 ml bottle was not available.New Poona Bakery sells both tea and coffee at Rs 50 each. When the issue was raised with Assistant General Manager (Commercial) K Srinivas, he said he would sent a notice to the outlets violating the directives. We had sent them the guidelines and also held a meeting. I have directed my subordinates to issue notice to Sugardough and New Poona Bakery for not following the directives of AAI, said Srinivas.Sandesh Deshmukh, a flier, said that despite complaints to authorities about the outlets overcharging for basic items inside the airport, they had taken no action. I had complained about this to an AAI officer. He told me that its an accepted fact that food items and beverages are sold at high prices at cinema halls and airports. Since the outlets pay a huge amount of rent to AAI, they are allowed to charge extra, said Deshmukh.A staffer at one of these outlets revealed that the shop gave a sizeable discount on its food items to personnel of AAI, CISF and other government agencies. The rates for public and government officials are different. For example, officials can get tea for Rs 10 while others will be charged Rs 30, said the staffer.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Both the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories and the Indian Sugar Mills Association have made presentation to the government asking for an ease of the stock limit on traders to boost prices. The central government had imposed stock limit on both mills and traders just before Diwali to prevent sky rocketing of sugar prices in retail markets.By the end of October, mills were supposed to have only 8 per cent of the sugar produced with them. The move had led to large scale sale of sugar by the millers and a subsequent drop in the retail prices. Similarly, stock limit was put on traders to prevent hoarding of sugar.Since the start of the sugar season in the 2017-18 fiscal, prices of the sweetener have fallen by Rs 400 per quintal. Ex-mill gate prices are now between Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,400 a quintal with reports coming in for sales at lower prices as well. Some mills in Marathwada have reportedly sold sugar below the Rs 3,200 mark also. The free fall of sugar prices had set alarm bells ringing among millers who claim it would be difficult for them to pay the designated fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs 2,550 per tonne to growers. Sugar prices, they had said, should be in the range of Rs 3,500 to Rs 3,600 per quintal to enable them to pay the grower.Officials of both the Federation and the ISMA had met officials of the civil supplies department to seek immediate removal of the stock limit on traders. This, the officials said, would boost sugar prices by Rs 100 per quintal at least. Rohit Pawar, the newly-elected Vice-President of the ISMA said he was hopeful of a positive feedback from the ministry. The stock limit was anyway set to lapse by end of December but there are indications that it might be removed earlier, he said.Meanwhile, sugar millers also want a reduction of export duty on sugar to zero as well as a total import ban on the sweetener. These, the millers said, were necessary in view of the decision of Pakistan to provide export subsidy to 15 laky tones of sugar, which they say, will eat up Indias traditional market of Bangladesh. Philippines, millers said, has put a ban on sugar import and they want a similar ban to be introduced in India as well.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Officials from the regional EPF office in Solapur had called a meeting of the representatives of sugar factories and contractors Friday to discuss labour laws being made applicable to sugarcane labourers and transporters.The representatives of sugar factories were informed that sugarcane labourers and transporters were eligible for EPF. These labourers are involved in the essential activity of the factory. The factories make payments to supervisors and transporters who then pay the labourers. Though the factories deduct these payments from sugarcane growers payments, the factories and sugarcane growers fall in the category of owners, said an official.The official said the representatives of the factories were also given a copy of the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the Orient Paper Mills case of 2005. The court had held in that case that the workers loading and unloading bamboo for the mill were workers of the mill. The nature of work of sugarcane workers is similar, added the official.However, the sugar factories said there was no question of extending EPF to labourers. The sugarcane labourers and transporters are not employees of the factories. It is the responsibility of the sugarcane growers to transport the sugarcane from the field to the factory. We merely help them in that work by engaging the Mukadams and transporters and deduct the charges from their payments. So, they cant be called factories employees and the question of providing EPF does not arise, said a representative who attended the meeting.Another representative said the issue was raised in 2003 also and they had then written to the Delhi EPF office. Sugar factories wont be able to bear the burden and it may lead to shutting down of factories, he said.

Archive Pune district has around 15,000 registered cooperative housing societies. ArchiveWhen it comes to conducting of election, the cooperative housing societies in Pune seem to have a huge backlog. In fact, the backlog and slow pace of elections at these societies have recently prompted the State Cooperative Election Authority (SCEA) to issue 1,450 letters to the housing societies, urging them to hold elections at the earliest.One of the major reforms in the cooperative sector was the provision of direct elections and formation of the state cooperative election authority. Headed by Commissioner Madhukar Chaudhari, this body is entrusted with conducting free and fair elections for more than 1.95 lakh cooperative institutions in the state. Cooperative housing societies form the bulk of the societies and are the largest cooperative bodies in urban centres like Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik etc. Since its formation three years ago, the authority has conducted elections in more than 95,000 cooperative institutions which includes banks, sugar mills, spinning mills etc. As per the Act, the cooperative bodies are supposed to intimate the election authority about their due election. The election authority, in turn, appoints an observer and conducts elections through secret ballot. The failure to conduct timely election can lead to the dismissal of the board.However, the cooperative housing in Pune seems to be lagging behind when it comes to notifying the authority about the expiry of their executive body. Given the workload on the district deputy registrars, action against defaulting societies has also not been taken. Cooperative housing societies are expected to elect an executive body among their members who, in turn, take over the running and maintenance of the society. The executive body also looks after the budget as well as issues arising in the society. Pune district has around 15,000 registered cooperative housing societies.Speaking about the notices, Chaudhari said they were issued to housing societies as many of them have failed to intimate the authority about the term of expiry of their executive bodies. The letter, while asking them to conduct election immediately, has also listed out the manner in which the elections can be held, he said. Prior to the issuance of the letters, the Authority had, through advertisements, urged housing societies to contact assistant registrars or ward officers to inform them of the expiry of their term and conduct election. We have also asked the Federation of Cooperative Housing Societies to help us in raising awareness about the matter, he said.Suhas Patwardhan, president of the Pune District Cooperative Housing Societies Federation, agreed there was a problem and said they had taken up the matter in all earnest. We have written about it in our monthly magazine and also talk about the same everywhere we go for holding seminars and camps, he said. Patwardhan said the federation sought that the housing societies be allowed to hold election in their annual general meeting, which normally sees good attendance.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The Shetkari Bachao Kruti Samiti has warned of an agitation if the plan is not withdrawn from Maval area.Alleging that the decision to set-up ring road was primarily taken to benefit politicians and builders, the Samiti said that the PMRDA ring road plan would hit several villages, including Salumbre, Dhamne, Parandwadi, Sangwade and Nere. Even a sugar factory will also be affected. In these villages, irrigated and fertile land is spread in vast area, and the plan has been framed to benefit politicians and builders, the Samiti said. 70 per cent of farmers in these villages are marginal farmers and they will be affected badly if the PMRDA goes ahead with its plan, the Samiti added.The Samiti said this was not the first time that farmers in Maval were being put under pressure. Earlier too, whether it was for Pavana Dam or for constructing Pune-Mumbai Expressway, several farmers lost their land and source of livelihood, the Samiti said.Farmers in Maval have also stalled the Rs 400-crore water pipeline project of PCMC, since 2011. They have alleged that the PCMC was taking away their share of water from Pavana Dam and that they would not get adequate water.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Leaders of the two Opposition parties met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Friday and urged the government to take some policy decisions to provide stability to the sugar sector.They demanded an increase in the import duty and scrapping of export duty. They also said the government should make payment of fair and remunerative price mandatory as an ad hoc system was not practical, especially at a time when sugarcane crop was surplus and prices had steeply declined. Fadnavis has assured the Congress and the NCP of taking up the matter with the Centre, and initiate whatever measures necessary. If Pakistan sugar comes to India, it will badly affect the domestic market. Kolkata was the biggest sugar market. But over the years Uttar Pradesh has also made inroads in Kolkata, said senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar.The top leaders concern over the sugar sector, however, has not gone down well with the elected members of the two parties representing Vidarbha. The perseverance displayed by top leaders to make the sugar sector a common cause is good. But they never display the same unity or commitment when it comes to fighting for the rights of Vidarbha issues, said a senior Congress leader who did not wish to be named. Another Congress leader said, The Winter Session (of the state legislature) in Vidarbha is held once a year. And it lasts for just two weeks. Yet, if we look at the Oppositions overall concern, very few Vidarbha issues are highlighted and taken to a logical end. As a result, the BJP walks away with advantage in successive elections in Vidarbha.Meanwhile, the alarm raised by sugar mill owners cutting across party lines over Pakistan sugar has been dismissed by a section in the BJP and the Shiv Sena. A Sena minister said, It is not as if Pakistan sugar is coming to India for the first time. Moreover, sugarcane crop brings assured profit. And successive governments at the Centre have always given Sharad Pawar an audience every time he meets the Prime Minister to discuss problems related to the sugar sector. However, NCP leader Dilip Walse-Patil argued, When we raise issues related to sugar industry, it is for the larger welfare of the state and its farmers. It is the only cash crop that helps earn highest revenue to the government.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Express Mills in the Nanded region by far have the best record in payment with the 27 mills there paying 88 per cent of their dues. ExpressA month since the start of the 2017-18 crushing season, sugar mills in the state have paid around 44 per cent of the total fair and remunerative price (FRP) due to the farmers. Of the Rs 1,578.47 crore payable to growers, mills till November 30 have paid Rs 693.04 crore, leaving Rs 963.02 crore as unpaid arrears.At the start of the crushing season, farmers organisations had upped their demand for payment above the designated FRP of Rs 2,550 per tonne of cane. Mills in the Kolhapur region have agreed to pay Rs 200 above the FRP while those in the Solapur region have agreed to pay Rs 400 above the fixed price. Farmers bodies had demanded higher pay given the then bullish sentiments in the sugar market with the sweetener trading over Rs 3,500 per tonne during the start of the season.Mills in the Nanded region by far have the best record in payment with the 27 mills in operation there paying 88 per cent of their dues. Kolhapur, Pune, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad region have recorded 45, 36, 23 and 62 per cent payment, respectively. The four private mills operational in the Nagpur region have paid only 6 per cent of their dues to the growers.Meanwhile, millers have expressed serious concerns about the drop in sugar prices, which they say will affect their ability to pay the growers. Sanjay Khatal, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, talked about how sugar prices have dropped significantly since the start of the crushing season. Also, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank recently reduced the valuation of sugar from Rs 3,390 to Rs 3,270, which will make it difficult for mills to pay the growers upfront. External factors especially the decision of the Pakistan government to promote export subsidy to 15 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar has further worried the sector.Calling for an immediate removal of the stock limit on traders, Khatal said the government should step in to stop the further erosion of sugar prices. Already, Philippines and Iran have banned the import of sugar and until steps like export incentives are given to the Indian millers, it will be difficult for us to pay the FRP, he said.Khatal also called for the creation of buffer stock to help stabilise the prices. With talks of a bumper crop in the offing, millers are apprehensive about a further drop in sugar prices.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The target to crush this season was fixed between 70,000MT and 80,000 MT against the plant capacity of 1.62 lakh tonnes, said factory Managing Director M. Narayana Rao.According to him, there has been a significant drop in crushing from 99,379MT in 2013-14, 92,737MT (2014-15), 91, 082MT (2015-16), to 63,136MT in 2016-17. He attributed this to depleting crop area at each crushing season. Mr. Narayana Rao told The Hindu that the yield per acre that was 40 to 50 tonnes in the past had now come down to 15 MT due to retaining the ratoon crop for three years or more. As the crop is labour intensive not many farmers are raising the plantation. The farmers are facing difficulty in finding labourers as they are finding job under MNREGS, he said. Farmers complain that the support price offered is inadequate. The price fixed for this season was Rs. 2,600 per metric tonne."
5aeb43dc9855b7179ad72af5,"Farm loan waiver: 6 months on, roadblocks persist",http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/farm-loan-waiver-6-months-on-roadblocks-persist-4966584/,2017-12-04,"Six months after the announcement of the loan waiver, the implementation of the scheme appears far from satisfactory. Six months after the announcement of the loan waiver, the implementation of the scheme appears far from satisfactory.Veena Manikrao Kadam, like 1,400 other account holders from Arvi village in Parbhani taluka and district had filed the online form for loan wavier way back in July. Six months have passed since Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced the Rs 34,000-crore Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Saman Yojana, but Kadams loan is yet to be waived. Just five people from our village has got the waiver till date. All of us have filled the form online but there seems to be no sign of the waiver for the others, she said.Kadam, who has close to 10 acres of land, has an outstanding loan of Rs 1.45 lakh, which she had availed from the State Bank of India. Compounding her worries, the crop loan disbursal for the present Kharif and now Rabi season this year has been bad. It seems the farm distress does not exist for the policy makers. Its just some thing they talk about and not follow up with action, she told The Indian Express.Six months after the announcement of the loan waiver, the implementation of the scheme appears far from satisfactory. As the clamour of protests gets louder, the state government admits to technical glitches, which seem to have put brakes on the scheme that was envisaged to benefit over 80 lakh farmers in the state. The number of beneficiaries was, however, brought down to 67 lakh after scrutiny, with officials claiming to have detected around 22 lakh ghost accounts.Faced with an unprecedented farmers strike in the first week of June, the state government had announced the farm loan waiver. The first government resolution was issued late in June, which had capped the waiver amount to Rs 1.5 lakh of the outstanding loans. Loans which are outstanding from April 1, 2009, till March 31, 2016, were to be waived and non-defaulters were to get an incentive of Rs 25,000. The process was to be linked with the Aadhaar number of the farmers to prevent any leakage. Government servants, elected representatives, directors of sugar mills and other cooperative institutions and those who have paid service tax were deemed ineligible for the scheme. This was to be second loan waiver witnessed in the state in the last 10 years.Back in 2008-09, Maharashtra had seen a loan waiver where loans to the tune of around Rs 7,000 crore were waived. The erstwhile Congress-NCP government had come in for severe criticism as allegations of misappropriation of the funds were raised. To avoid such a scenario, the current government had said it would use Aadhaar to authenticate the data filled by the farmers, and they were asked to file details online instead of dealing directly with the bank.Banks were to file information online and the loan waiver was to be implemented after matching and authenticating the farmers data. Technically, farmers were not to receive the amount in their savings accounts, but banks would receive drawal from the state government in tandem with the outstanding amount. Once the amount was received, banks would write off the loans.Right from the word go, the scheme had faced problems both technically and policy wise. At the policy level, the state government frequently changed the eligibility criteria for the scheme, which had proved challenging for the implementing agency. The scheme originally was to be extended to accounts that were outstanding between 2012 and 2016, but later included accounts that had become outstanding from 2009 onwards. The operation guidelines for the scheme itself took a long time to be finalised and were published only in late August. The scheme had seen 1.05 crore registration and as many as 56,59,187 applications were received.The over reliance on technology, which was supposed to make the scheme error-free, however, turned out to be its Achilles heel. At the ground level, complaints about the facilitation centres charging farmers for filing the online forms to the crashing of Aadhaar website had plagued the process. Farmers were given the deadline of September 22 as the deadline for filing the online forms, post which scrutiny of the database and the real work for disbursal were to happen. The first green list of 4.5 lakh farmers was released early October with the state government marking the occasion with a solemn function. Fadnavis had presided over the function and said the whole process would be completed by mid-November. The second list of 15 lakh beneficiaries was issued in the second week of November. Ajit Newale, secretary of the coordination committee for the farmers movement, said there was still confusion about the real numbers. The government has refused to share the lists with us, he said.As the deadline seems difficult to meet, officers point to the inherent flaw in the software. The genesis of the problem lies in the mismatch between the software used by the government to authenticate the data filled by farmers online. Errors in the database, has delayed generation of the green list. The lists being generated, say officers, have errors like same Aadhaar or bank account number for multiple farmers. Also, in some cases, the same names are appearing in the lists of both eligible and ineligible farmers. In case of such errors, the banks are asked to re-verify the data manually, and the field-level officers are coordinating the matter. Till date, it is estimated around Rs 4,000 crore has been disbursed under the scheme.Minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh denied the reports of any major technical fault but said the process was delayed due to some snags. Disbursal of the amounts is going on and we are confident it will be completed soon. Due diligence has to be followed and whatever snags have come are being addressed, he said. The process, the minister said, involved uploading data and then running the software. It is a technical process and is bound to take some necessary time, he said. That the system has developed serious faults was also admitted by Minister of State Sadashiv Khot who however said work was on war-footing to rectify the same. As soon as the technical glitches are resolved, the scheme will start full-fledged. We are also answerable to the people, the minister added.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana MP Raju Shetti had levelled charges of corruption against the government in the way the software contract was awarded to a Nagpur-based company. IT Secretary Vijay Kumar Gautam was moved out of the department even as both the IT and the cooperative departments struggled to correct the database. After adverse criticism from various quarters, officers of the cooperative department have been asked not to share information with the media at large.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb44879855b7179ad72b4c,Hardlook: To save a child,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/hardlook-to-save-a-child-trafficking-delhi-childline-volunteers-rpf-4977149/,2017-12-11,"One of the children rescued from New Delhi Railway station at a shelter home in Nabi Karim. (Express photo: Abhinav Saha) One of the children rescued from New Delhi Railway station at a shelter home in Nabi Karim. (Express photo: Abhinav Saha)Two days after leaving Patna junction, the Poorva Express came to a stop at New Delhi Railway Stations platform 15. A 14-year-old boy got down, followed by two men who had paid Rs 2,000 to his parents back home. The child was to work at a bangle-making factory in Mangolpuri. The men made sure the boy  who had worked in factories back home  washed his face and put on new clothes.The boy blended in with the crowd, and the two kept a safe distance to ensure the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and volunteers from the NGO Prayas  at the station after receiving a tip-off  werent alarmed.The traffickers were almost in the clear  until the boy stepped into the sunlight. Almost immediately, his skin glistened with bangle dust. The volunteers had found who they were looking for. When a child works for long hours over a few years at a bangle factory, his skin occasionally sparkles in the light, said Abdul Rahman Khan, a volunteer from Prayas, who appeared to have seen enough of such cases to not find it the least bit intriguing.The child was rescued and produced before the Child Welfare Committee, while the RPF took the two men into custody.It was a fruitful day for the Childline volunteers who, along with the RPF and Delhi Police, have been rescuing children ever since the NGO was established at four railway stations two years ago. Since then, the NGOs 48 volunteers have acted as the first line of defence to ensure children trafficked from far off states to work at factories and homes in Delhi are rescued the moment they step foot in the city.At the four stations  New Delhi, Old Delhi, Anand Vihar and Hazrat Nizamuddin  volunteers said more than 90 trafficked children aged between six and 17 are rescued every month.The minors are bought for as low as Rs 2,000 from their parents and made to work in factories producing toys, bangles, jeans, embroidery items and bags. The Indian Express accompanied volunteers to the four stations to understand the challenges each rescue operation poses.New Delhi Railway Station: Platform number 16Three Childline volunteers have been trying to piece together how a 12-year-old boy fled from his employers in Lucknow and reached Delhi. The boy was sold to a tailor by his relatives, with middlemen facilitating the transaction. The boy told them: They do not check tickets from a child. I thought my employer would hurt me, so I ran away. I thought my parents were dead. But when I heard they were alive and in Delhi, I came here.Every month, volunteers here rescue more than 65 children  about 45 of them trafficked from Northern and Eastern states, they said. Six major trains originating from Bihar and Jharkhand have the maximum number of trafficked children. RPF and NGO workers focus on these when they arrive in the evening, Junaid Khan, the team coordinator overseeing operations, said.To not arouse suspicion, the children are dressed in new clothes and handed school bags  a cruel irony given how many of them end up at bag-making factories in Nabi Karim, Bara Hindurao, Sadar Bazar and Karol Bagh.NGO workers from Prayas and Salam Balak Trust said that most of the 250 children rescued in the last two months from New Delhi and Old Delhi railway stations were from impoverished districts of Bihar and Jharkhand.Children trafficked from Patna are usually sent to bangle factories in Sultanpuri and Mangolpuri. We noticed this trend while rescuing children over the last two years. Children who managed to run away gave us locations of the factories. We conducted raids and rescued the others, Khan said.A 13-year-old rescued from one such factory recounted, I was working at a printing press. About 10 children would dry printing cards all day. My parents told me to do it. I would get Rs 100 per day, and the rest would go to my family. But I havent heard from them since I came to Delhi five months ago.Volunteers said children rescued from rural towns of Nalanda and Jhajha in Bihar often end up at embroidery units in Jahangirpuri and Burari, while bag-making factories are full of children from Darbhanga, Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Purnia, Katihar and Saharsa.A large number of children trafficked from these districts are from Muslim families Traffickers convince their parents that the kids are being sent to study in a madrasa in Delhi, Khan said.According to Prayas records for New Delhi Railway Station, of the 45 children rescued in October, 25 were girls being taken to placement agencies in Shakurpur village, Subhash Place, Kapashera, Laxmi Nagar and Noida. Middlemen tell their families that the girls would be provided an education, but instead they end up as domestic helps, a Delhi Police Crime Branch officer said.Old Delhi Railway Station: Platform number 5Summer is peak trafficking season, with more than 200 trains passing through the city. Children are brought to Delhi during summers because they can sleep out in the open and blend in with the homeless while they work at factories. During winters, they have to be provided more food, clothing and shelter. Plus, if a child dies of the cold, it can attract police attention, Mohammad Hussain from the Salam Balak Trust said.NGO workers said of the 250 children rescued in three months during summers, 65 were en route to embroidery units and small-scale factories in north Delhi, while the rest work at steel, bangle and jeans factories.At a shelter home in outer Delhi, a 12-year-old recounted his experience of working at a steel factory in Wazirpur industrial area: I was paid Rs 3,000 to polish steel. There is no work where I come from. I wanted to help my parents; I didnt really mind the soot which covered us. If I had enough money, I would buy sweets, and maybe a phone.Bhibuti Kumar, who oversees rescue operations at the station, said trafficking hotspots include Jalpaipur, New Cooch Behar and Bongaigaon.In many cases, children are taken further, to work in agricultural fields in Punjab and Haryana during sugarcane harvest season. The numbers are not staggering but they are substantial. Due to heavy oversight, the number of trafficked children rescued has come down to 8-10, Kumar said.Anand Vihar Railway Station: Platform number 7About 35-odd children are rescued every month at the station by volunteers from Don Bosco Ashalayam, with six trains at platforms number 1 and 7 under surveillance. The children are usually rotated at every station, changing coaches and seats between themselves so passengers dont suspect they are being trafficked. If a group of children sit without adult supervision, passengers get alerted, senior DSC RPF (East) Shashi Kumar said.Every few stations, children are given strict instructions by traffickers not to interact with other passengers. Usually three traffickers move with a batch of children in separate coaches, an RPF officer overseeing Anand Vihar Railway Station said.The children are sometimes shown videos of Delhis shopping malls and amusement parks and are promised they would be taken there. The traffickers make sure they are well fed before the journey. At many stations, police only keep an eye out for emaciated-looking children, a senior RPF officer said.Terminating Station: Hazrat NizamuddinAt Nizamuddin Railway Station, it has been over two months since a child was rescued from trafficking. There used to be a time when 15-20 traffickers would be caught every two months. Now most cases are of runaway children, Krishan Kumar from the NGO, Butterflies, said.Volunteers and RPF officers said many traffickers have started taking different routes or deboard at Shahdara, Ghaziabad, Palwal, Faridabad and even Aligarh, where scrutiny is relatively less. Traffickers then take the children by bus or car to their destination, a Delhi Police officer said.Despite more than 70 trafficked children being rescued every month from the four railway stations in 2017, Delhi Police data shows that only four cases of child labour were registered in the capital until October.Even though RPF data shows that until October, 1,198 children were rescued, senior DSC RPF (west) Santosh N Chandran explained, We do not get a lot of trafficking cases as the exchange of money has to be established. In many cases, that is difficult. In the last two months, we had just one trafficking case established at Anand Vihar Railway Station.Further, Delhi Police said they do not keep a record of the number of cases registered under IPC Section 370 (trafficking). Explaining the reason for low reporting of trafficking cases, Supreme Court lawyer Shashank Shekhar said, Police in various states still look at trafficking from the prism of sex trafficking, rather than the wider aspect of exploitation under Section 370. Many times, police end up charging the accused under IPC sections 366-(a) (procuration of minor girls) and 372 (selling minor for purposes of prostitution).However, the biggest reasons why traffickers get away is because they are able to prove that the children are travelling with the consent of their parents. By the time a child is rescued by a district task force and produced before the Child Welfare Committee, traffickers bring the parents to reclaim the child. They testify that the trafficker is a part of the family or that they knew they were sending the child to work, said Satya Prakash, project manager at FXB Indian Suraksha. In many cases, the child turns hostile in court, he said.Many a times, the investigating officer is unable to track the parents. Some children are not able to recollect their exact address. We try to coordinate with the local police station in their state, but missing reports are seldom registered, said an investigating officer tracking the family of a trafficked 12-year-old boy.At a private home for girls, a 15-year-old from Jharkhand showed the names of her district, village and eight brothers and sisters etched across her hands in green ink. I want to go back home, she said.The girl said she snuck out of her hostel after a fight with a friend. She was spotted by a man who offered to take her to the family. Instead, she found herself on a Delhi-bound train. At Nizamuddin railway station, she was left stranded as the man fled after spotting police. She was later rescued by the RPF and sent to the shelter home two months ago.Volunteers said that reuniting children with their families can sometimes take over eight months. If the parents are the ones who sent them away, returning the child home can be problematic as they might be sent back to the factories, said Deepshika, a senior manager from Prayas.Plus, hazy details of the home address or phone number make establishing contact difficult, which is why many children end up in these shelter homes until they turn 18.My father used to drive a car, said the 15-year-old girl, before disclosing the location of the hostel she ran away from  something her counsellors were so far unaware of. For the counsellor, the new clue means new hope: The children end up giving these nuggets of information during the course of their stay. Lets see if we can contact her father.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

(File) The shift toward cryptocurrencies in Venezuela is taking place as the price of bitcoin has climbed to a peak of more than ,000 this month. (File)In the last month, John Villar has bought two plane tickets to Colombia, purchased his wifes medication and paid the employees of his startup business in Venezuela _ all in bitcoin.As Venezuelas national currency loses value at a catastrophic rate, thousands have begun turning to the world of cryptocurrency to salvage what little value remains from their increasingly worthless bolivars, reports AP.This is not a matter of politics, Villar said. This is a matter of survival. Both poor Venezuelan retirees and wealthy business leaders are converting their bolivars into bitcoins online and then using the digital currency to pay for everything from doctor appointments and honeymoons to motorcycles and artisanal beer. The transactions are relatively swift for anyone with a smartphone: Websites like LocalBitcoin and Colibit function as exchanges where Venezuelans can buy and sell bitcoins using a local bank account.The shift toward cryptocurrencies in Venezuela is taking place as the price of bitcoin has climbed to a peak of more than $17,000 this month. The digital currency debuted on a major U.S. exchange with its first futures contract Sunday. But while bitcoin is a speculative venture in developed nations, in Venezuela it has become a tool to keep families afloat, with some Venezuelans purchasing a small fraction of one coin to build their savings.The number of Venezuelans using cryptocurrencies remains unclear, but weekly bitcoin trading volume through one popular website has soared from about $225,000 earlier this year to nearly $2.1 million in the first week of December _ this in a country where the monthly minimum wage fetches less than $2 on the black market. According to data website Coin Dance, thats far higher than the value of bitcoin transactions on the same website seen in more prosperous nations across the region, including Argentina, Brazil and Chile.Venezuelans are taking refuge in digital currencies, said Rafael Useche, the founder of Colibit. One of them is Jorge Ochoa, 34, who liquidated part of his bitcoin savings into dollars so that he could take his wife on a honeymoon to New York City. The flight toward cryptocurrencies in a nation where inflation in bolivar prices is projected to surpass 2,000 percent next year falls in line with what has happened in other countries stricken by war or economic collapse. Following the debt crisis in Greece, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and unrest in Ukraine, rising numbers of distressed citizens utilized bitcoin.In Venezuela, the so-called crisis currency is allowing desperate Venezuelans to make potentially life-saving purchases. Villar has been unable to find several of the medications needed to treat his wifes multiple sclerosis in Venezuela for the last two years, a story not uncommon in a country whose public health system has been crippled by shortages. Instead, he purchased them abroad with bitcoin and used courier services to deliver them to Venezuela.Bitcoin is already, for many in Venezuela, not about a business opportunity, he said. The early Venezuelan bitcoin adopters consisted largely of engineers and business leaders, but these days Useche said he is surprised by the number of poor, elderly Venezuelan making small bitcoin purchases. While the price of bitcoin has been highly volatile, Venezuelans with few or no other means of converting their bolivars into another currency believe it is a safer bet than the Venezuelan bills that steadily depreciate from one day to the next.Trading in bitcoin futures was briefly halted Wednesday after dipping 10 percent. More than an asset that right now is rising in price, it is a reserve, Useche said. Cryptocurrencies have become so fashionable that even President Nicolas Maduro has proposed a government-backed version called the petro, and members of his administration have met with Venezuelan bitcoin entrepreneurs to determine how it might work. Though few details have been released, many in the bitcoin world have responded skeptically to the idea, saying Venezuelans wont trust a digital currency issued by a government they have little faith in.Still, bitcoin has its fair share of detractors, from Wall Street to Caracas. Critics point out that the digital currencys lack of ties to any bank or government, allowing users to spend money anonymously, can facilitate illicit payments. Thats a big concern in a country like Venezuela, which is a major drug transit zone and is rated one of the most corrupt in the world.Authorities have largely permitted trading of bitcoin in Venezuela, though they have heavily fined and detained people who use computers to earn bitcoins by auditing online cryptocurrency transactions. Such mining operations use immense amounts of electricity, which is heavily subsidized in Venezuela _ meaning the state essentially winds up paying for the process.At the bitcoins current value, one miner computer alone can now earn more than $10,000 in six months. Its a really great opportunity for Venezuelans in a desperate position, said Andrea OSullivan, a cryptocurrency expert at George Mason University. While there is no law on the books about mining cryptocurrency in Venezuela, not paying taxes on unreported earnings is illegal.One Venezuelan bitcoin miner who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal said authorities demanded he pay them $20,000 as a bribe but settled on taking 11 of his 20-some mining machines instead. He said the same officials now sometimes contact him seeking technical advice. Others interviewed for this story described being extorted by authorities who asked to be paid in bitcoin.Even as the use of bitcoin becomes more prevalent, few businesses openly advertise that they accept cryptocurrency out of concern they will be extorted. Its still difficult to make many purchases in Venezuela with bitcoin, so people have to convert it into bolivars to buy food and other items. Venezuelans with bitcoin can sell their digital currency on one of a half-dozen virtual exchanges filled with compatriots looking to buy bitcoin.Dollars remain the go-to currency for many Venezuelans seeking to get rid of bolivars, but getting ahold of them can be difficult and generally requires a black market broker. Buying bitcoin eliminates the middleman because transactions can be done peer-to-peer. In addition, saving bitcoin does not require a foreign bank account. Venezuelans cannot hold dollars in a local account.Mariana Leon, a crypto-economics consultant, said she has helped several companies in the sugar, chocolate and rum industries invest their bolivares in cryptocurrencies, keeping them in business even while other companies shuttered operations. The only reason they have survived is because they invested in cryptocurrencies, she said.For Villar, the stakes are especially high, and not just for his business. An engineer who once ran a biometrics enterprise, he is staking his financial future on the development of a game involving an alternative cryptocurrency called PepeCash. A dozen employees operate from a small office filled with computers in an industrial community east of the capital. All receive part of their salary in bitcoin. His wife, also an engineer, is now largely bound to a wheelchair. At this moment, he said. I dont have a single bolivar.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Highly placed sources in the government told The Indian Express the process of completing the loan waiver exercise would not take more than another month. We have shortlisted 69 loan waiver beneficiaries. Almost 43 lakh farmers names have been cleared. For the remaining 26 lakh, the process is under way, said a senior officer who did not wish to be named.The officer added: Once the loan waiver amounts are credited in the accounts of the individual, a coordination committee comprising representatives from the ministries of cooperation and marketing, information and technology and the State Level Bankers Committee will review the process. The final list, along with funds credited to their accounts, would be made public. The government will furnish all details of the loan waiver exercise, highlighting the numbers of debt-ridden farmers, incentive schemes and one-time settlement schemes.The sources said Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had categorically directed officials of the ministries concerned and the State Level Bankers Committee to ensure there is nothing secret about the loan waiver, and hence the names of each and every farmer who availed the benefits would be recorded in public domain. Officials in the Ministry of Cooperation and Marketing claimed that this was the first loan waiver exercise that would document each and every beneficiary. We have no records of the 2008-09 loan waiver beneficiaries, said an official.The governments decision also aims to silence the Opposition, which has accused it of keeping the exercise a secret. Leader of the Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The government should have announced the Rs 1.5 lakh loan waiver to all farmers instead of having different categories. Also, it should make all the decisions related to loan waiver public. Even the farmers offered an incentive of Rs 25,000 for being non-defaulters should get the waiver of Rs 1.5 lakh, he added. BJP members have countered the attack by Congress and NCP leaders, arguing that they had turned a blind eye to higher capital investments of Rs 76,000 crore made in the agriculture sector by the government. Unfortunately, Congress and NCP leaders priorities are more for the sugarcane and dairy sectors. They are raising these issues repeatedly even during the Winter Session being held in Vidarbha, said a senior Vidarbha MLA.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

After the Samajwadi Party (SP) came to power, state authorities had conducted an inspection to discover that while the firm had withdrawn Rs 700 crore from public and private banks for the project, it had spent only Rs 100 crore on construction work, sources said.A month after the CBI rejected its recommendation to probe alleged embezzlement of funds in the construction of the Delhi-Saharanpur highway  a project passed in 2010 under the BSP regime  the Yogi Adityanath government has written to the Centre seeking reconsideration.As per records, the Rs 2,500 crore contract for the highway project was awarded to a Hyderabad-based private firm in 2010, and work had started in 2011. However, the firm had stopped the work citing environment clearance, but did not complete the project even after getting it, said sources. After the Samajwadi Party (SP) came to power, state authorities had conducted an inspection to discover that while the firm had withdrawn Rs 700 crore from public and private banks for the project, it had spent only Rs 100 crore on construction work, sources added.The matter was taken up by the present BJP dispensation as well, and a case was lodged against the firm. On May 16 this year, the government had recommended it for a CBI probe and sent a letter to the ministry of home affairs. Principal Secretary (Home), Arvind Kumar, confirmed that they have again written to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to reconsider the project for a CBI investigation.Over the last seven months, the state government has recommended six matters including the highway project, mostly related to the previous SP and BSP governments, for CBI to probe (see box). The agency has taken up three of these cases so far. Another matter of alleged corruption in connection with the properties of the Shia and Sunni Waqf Boards in the state is being considered to be recommended for CBI investigation, a home department official said.Cases taken up by CBI on yogi govts recommendationDeath of IAS officer Anurag TewariKarnataka cadre IAS officer Anurag Tewari whose body was found outside a government guest house in Lucknow on May 17. Tewari had been posted as commissioner in the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department in Karnataka. The government had recommended the matter for CBI probe two weeks after his death on the request of his family. The agency lodged an FIR in connection with the alleged murder on June 16.Corruption in Gomti River Front ProjectOn November 31, the CBI lodged FIR in connection with alleged corruption and anomalies in the execution of Gomti River Front Development Project. The project was launched during the previous SP regime, and executed by the state irrigation department headed by then minister Shivpal Yadav. After Shivpal was removed from the Cabinet following a feud in the Yadav family, then CM Akhilesh Yadav had taken over the portfolio. Eight engineers of the state irrigation department were booked in the case. The roles of two senior IAS officers are under scanner. The state government recommended the matter for CBI investigation in July.Alleged irregularities in UPPSC examsOn December 8, the DoPT had issued a notification for a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) examinations, whose results were declared between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2017. The state government had recommended the matter for CBI probe around 3 months before the notification was issued.Recommended cases that are pending with CBIAllegations of disproportionate assets against ex-MD of sugar factories co-opOn November 23, the Yogi government had sent a recommendation for a probe against former managing director of the UP Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, BK Yadav, for allegedly committing irregularities and amassing assets disproportionate to his known income.

The Jewish community first arrived in Kolkata from the middle east in 1798, and was involved in development of trade and commerce. The community was involved in jute mills, sugar mills, setting up of the national tobacco company, real estate and finance institutions.The Jewish community in Kolkata is perceived as a dying community. To an extent, it is true. The numbers have dwindled over the past few decades and now there are just 30 of us left in the city. At its height, the community had 5,000 members in the city. Then the migration started in the late 1950s and 60s with Jews shifting to America, Isreal, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and other places, said president and trustee of Beth El synagogue David R Ashkenazy.Kolkatas two main synagogues  Beth El and Magen David  were constructed in 1856 and 1884, respectively. The restoration of the synagogues began in 2015 and restoration architects and experts, who had worked on other Indian monuments, were brought to Kolkata from Delhi and Lucknow. Artisans and craftsmen were hired from Rajasthan and West Bengal as well.The synagogues had become dilapidated and were in a very bad condition which is why the restoration had become urgent. But there is another reason behind this project. In Kolkata, where so many of us lived for so many years, there is all the infrastructure present for the Jewish community to become a vibrant community once more. There are three synagogues, a cemetery and two Jewish schools one for girls and one for boys. This is essentially what any community needs, Ashkenazy said.The idea is the revival of the Jewish community in Kolkata We want to get the message out there that Kolkata is an ideal place for the community, added Ashkenazy. This is the reason why, he said, the community will soon start a programme inviting young Jewish people from across the world to come and live in Kolkata for a selected period of time.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Glancing at the mill buildings rising on the horizon, F. Baskar of Arputhapuram is ploughing his field, as his mother Mary Ammal drops the groundnut seed one after the other in the furrow created.Im in no hurry to return to sugarcane cultivation. People in my village are seeing hope in groundnut and Im following them. Maize gave me some hope last season and I have raised tapioca on a portion of the land, he says haltingly.Mr. Baskar and several of the farmers in the region spread over Thanjavur and Gandarvakottai taluk of Pudukkottai district who had been raising sugarcane and supplying it to the Kurungulam mills have switched over to millets, groundnut, tapioca and maize.The situation is turning worse, says Thozhagiripatti P. Govindaraj, secretary of Arignar Anna Sugar Mills Sugar Cane Suppliers Association.Cane growers are switching over to other crops due to intransigent attitude of some sugar mills in releasing the dues and the growers not getting a remunerative price for the produce.The situation at the private sugar mill units at Pettaivaithalai in Tiruchi district and Pugalur in Karur district has turned grim. Due to lack of adequate cane for crushing, the mills operated far below the installed capacity. Though it could be pricking their management, ultimately it is, we, the cane growers who are left to fend for ourselves, rues K. Anbalagan of Sugar Cane Growers Association, Pettaivaithalai, Tiruchi district.Three seasons nowNeither the State government nor the sugar mills are interested in our welfare. They are not treating us as interested stakeholders. Then how could we carry the burden? The problems that arose because of them has forced us to shift to alternative crops over the past three seasons, he says.Last years drought, coupled with the balance of payments due from the mills to the growers forced many of us to have a rethink on cultivating sugarcane. The remunerative prices we get for maize, groundnut, pulses and even paddy in many areas of the State have all contributed to the paradigm shift from cane to other crops, says Namakkal G. Ajeethan, State Technical Secretary, Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations.Sources indicate that sugarcane cultivation has come down from eight lakh acres about five years back to just about three lakh acres now. This has affected the sugar mills too.While the Fair and Remunerative Price, announced by the Central government, for the current year is Rs. 2,550 a tonne, the State government is yet to announce its State Advised Price though it should have done it in September itself.It is another matter that many sugar mills have not released even the mandatory FRP for the cane supplied in the previous years, allege sugarcane producers, reasoning the shift to other crops."

Themed around Clarity among Variety, the conference is bringing together a variety of specialists  including diabetologists, podiatrists, plastic surgeons, orthopaedics, as well as physiotherapists and others  to share their expertise, said organising chairman of the conference and vice-president of the society, V.B. Narayanamurthy.Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan said the government had begun population-based screening for non-communicable diseases in three blocks. We do opportunistic screening for non-communicable diseases, which involves checking anyone over the age of 30, who comes to a healthcare centre. But now, we have trained health workers, who visit homes, and who are now checking individuals for blood pressure and blood sugar levels, he said.About 15% of those with diabetes get foot ulcers, said Rajesh Kesavan, secretary of the society. Doctors stressed the need to look after the feet. One big challenge, they said, was that most people did not wear footwear inside their homes. With a loss of sensation, patients often do not realise they have a wound, and therefore seek medical help late, they said.We also need to have more trained manpower to identify the problem of diabetic foot in order to refer patients to doctors, said Dr. Narayanamurthy. The conference has about 15 international faculty members."

Express Bhagwant Mapari with the children of his brother Uddhav. ExpressA day after two farmers were injured in police firing during an agitation by sugarcane growers, an uneasy calm hangs over Telwadi village in Paithan taluka of Aurangabad. At Uddhav Vikram Maparis house, relatives console his ageing mother. Her blood pressure has shot up, we are worried about her well-being, said Bhagwant, her youngest son. Mapari is one of the farmers injured in the firing. A few kilometres away, the other injured farmer Narayan Bhanudas Dukales house is locked. Neighbours said the family has been camping at the hospital where Dukale was admitted. We have not known such violence in our village. And to think all this happened because we stood up for our rights, said a villager.Thousands of farmers, including Mapari and Dukale, had taken to the streets in Ahmednagar on Wednesday, demanding an increase in fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane. The farmers had been agitating since November 12. The police said they had to use force to control the large number of agitators. At Khanapur in Shrirampur taluka of Ahmednagar district, they had to open fire to control the protesters, injuring Mapari and Dukale.A bullet hit Mapari on the chest, while another brushed Dukales hand. Four policemen, including deputy Superintendent of Police Sudarshan Munde and police inspector Suresh Sapkale, were injured in stone-pelting. Located near the catchment area of the Jaikwadi dam, cane for Telwadi and other nearby villages is the only source of sustainable income. While villagers do go for crops like cotton and onions, it is cane which gives them an assured income. Both the injured farmers have around 4 acres of cane, which is ready for harvest. However, growers in the area are unhappy with the functioning of the mills. Bhagwant said his brother, being the eldest of three, was concerned over lack of payment by the mills. He participated in the strike so that we get a fair price for our hard work, he said.Last year, mills in the area had promised to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne of cane, but paid only Rs 2,300. Santosh Suryavanshi, Aurangabad head of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, said mills were yet to clear payment to the tune of Rs 34 crore. Last year, farmers in the area had contacted us to support their fight. This year too, they had asked us for support, he said.Nitin Pawar, a villager, said the refusal by mills to even discuss the matter with the farmers had irked them the most. Unlike western Maharashtra, majority of the sugar mills in this area are private-run and thus have just a single payment for cane. Pawar and other farmers alleged the mills indulge in unfair practices and often intentionally reduce the weight of cane being brought for crushing. After Wednesdays violence, mills have declared the first installment price of Rs 2,525 per tonne. The FRP for cane with 9.5 per cent recovery is Rs 2,550 for the present season.The start of the crushing season in Maharashtra is often synonymous with strife between millers and growers over payment. In the cane belt of western Maharashtra, MP Raju Shetti calls for an Oosh Parishad (cane conclave), where he places his demands for the first installment payment. A middle ground is found after discussions with millers after which crushing starts.This year, millers of Sangli and Kolhapur have decided to pay Rs 200 over the FRP following discussions with the Sanghatana. While the crisis in Ahmednagar and Aurangabad seems to have blown over, it is simmering in Solapur. Ravikant Tupkar, youth president of the Sanghatana, said until and unless the farmers were united, they will not be able to get good prices.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Veera Raghava Rao along with farmers and officials inaugurating crushing of sugarcane at the National Cooperative Sugar Mills at Alanganallur on Saturday.Cane crushing at the National Cooperative Sugar Mills (NCSM) in Alanganallur here for 2017-18 season was inaugurated by Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao on Saturday.Owing to the drought witnessed across Tamil Nadu, including Madurai, last year, the officials at the mill said that they were targeting to crush only 50,000 tonnes of sugarcane this season, which is less than one-third of the 1.74 lakh tonnes crushed during the previous year.The average recovery rate during the previous sugarcane season was 9.01 % and a total of 1,57,140 quintals of sugar was manufactured, they said, adding that a target recovery rate of 9.5 % had been fixed for the present season.Stating that it was tough to operate the mill with the low quantity of sugarcane available for crushing, the officials said that best efforts had been made to run the mill this season, keeping the welfare of farmers in mind. A senior official said that the mill was even trying to get sugarcane from farmers who had not pledged their produce to the mill.It has to be noted that a section of farmers from Alanganallur region petitioned the Collector recently, alleging coercive measures by NCSM officials to sell their produce to the mill even if they had not registered with the mill.Mr. Rao said that cane cutting instructions had already been sent to areas falling under the mills jurisdiction and appealed to the farmers to ensure steady supply of cane so that the efficiency of the crushing operations at the mill could be maintained at a higher level, which would, in turn, lead to higher earnings for the farmers.He said that the farmers would be paid the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,550 per tonne of sugarcane fixed by the Union government. He also highlighted that NCSM would be bearing the labour and other cost involved in cutting sugarcane and transporting it to the mill."

While petrol dealers initially shrugged off their complaints, the Pune unit of All Indian Petroleum Dealers Association (AIPDA) has now decided to take up the matter with oil companies such as BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil.Petrol dealers have been receiving complaints from customers, who say that their vehicles have been abruptly coming to a halt and they have not been able to restart it. Some customers claim that their mechanics told them that the petrol contained some amount of water, which was the primary reason for their vehicles not working properly, said Ali Daruwalla, spokesperson of AIPDA.Most of the complaints have been received from rural areas of Pune and Satara districts, said Daruwalla. So far, there have been no complaints from city areas, but people from rural areas have complained about petrol being mixed with water, he said.Daruwalla said they had received information about a petrol pump on the Mumbai-Goa Highway, in Nagothane area of Raigad district, giving free petrol to customers last week after they complained about getting petrol mixed with water.However, Daruwalla said the problem could be caused due to the mixing of petrol and ethanol, which contains water. Two years ago, the government had ordered that ethanol be blended with petrol. This mixing is done at the Loni Oil Depot, he said.However, Vijay Avate, managing director of the Kolhapur-based Shree Chhatrapati Shahu sugar mill, said, Ethanol does not contain water at all. Ethanol is produced only after removing water from it.The AIPDA, meanwhile, stated, Though the government directive initially stated that 5 per cent of ethanol should be blended with petrol, it later raised the amount to 10 per cent.B Bhaskar Rao, deputy general manager of HPCL, dismissed claims of petrol being mixed with water. There is no question of this we have a fool-proof system where we rigorously carry out checks on a daily basis to weed out any chances of water being present in petrol, he said.Rao said the oil companies send 350 tankers to 550 petrol pumps in Pune district. As much as 20 lakh litres of the fuel is distributed across Pune dailythe amount of ethanol in petrol is about 10 per cent, he said. Stating that they have received no complaints so far, Rao said petrol pump dealers should check the underground water tanks, and whether there were chances of water seeping into the fuel.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

State agriculture minister Sadabhau Khot on Thursday wrote to the Union finance ministry and the Council stating that the move will provide relief to sugarcane farmers.The letter accessed by TOI states that as per the circular issued by the finance ministry on November 15, jaggery has been dropped from the list of 'agricultural' produce.""Owing to GST, farmers will get a lower procurement price for selling jaggery to the packagers, while the consumers will have to buy it at higher rates.

However, this year, organisers of agricultural fairs rue the fact that the spending by farmers have gone down which is affecting the turnover of the exhibitors.In the sugar belt of western Maharashtra, Yashwant Krushi Udyog Pashu Pakshi Pradarshani in Karad is a major agricultural fair.Organised by Karad wholesale market, the average turnover of the market is more than Rs 8 crore. Sandeep Gidde, the organiser coordinator of the fair, said that this year the fair could manage to notch about Rs 6 crore worth of business only. The agricultural community does not have money in hand, he said. Last year, this fair had shot to fame after introducing an internal currency called Yashwant chalan to tide over the cash crunch during demonetisation. Gidde said that while cash was no more a problem with the rural market, the spending power of the rural markets have reduced drastically. Giddes company has lined up several agricultural exhibitions in western Maharashtra and Konkan, but he is pessimistic about the business outlook.Milk, which is an important cash earner in this region, Gidde pointed out, has been fetching dirt cheap rates and many farmers who supplement their income through dairy are hit hard. Its ironical that milk prices have collapsed to Rs 19 per litre whereas a bottle of water is priced at Rs 20, he said.Prices of vegetables and fruits for the last few months have also been very low which has hurt the farmers spending power.Niranjan Deshpande, the organiser of major fair titled Kisan, said the quest for farmers for newer technology continues unfazed by their economics. Deshpande mentioned that farmers continue to patronise online registrations with Kisans Green Pass  the online registration facility  recording almost five times as traction as compared to 2016. Till December 6 last year, 2,469 registrations were recorded. This year, we will have a day-long conference by Israeli companies which are looking for tie-ups with Indian companies in terms of technology transfer etc, he said.

(File Photo) The bank aims to issue tenders, inviting applications to either lease or buy non functional sugar mills. (File Photo)For the crushing season of 2017-18, the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank has earmarked Rs 3,500 crore as the cumulative sugar pledge loan to be distributed to the 32 sugar mills associated with it. M L Sukhdeve, chairman, Board of Administrators, also indicated that the bank aims to issue tenders, inviting applications to either lease or buy non functional sugar mills.The bank has approved sugar pledge loans to allow mills to pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to growers. The pledge loan is based on the valuation of sugar, which the bank reviews every three months. Last year, the bank had disbursed about Rs 2,200 crore as pledge loan for the sector. The MSC bank has recently reduced sugar prices by Rs 300 per quintal, which had worried the sugar sector.Sukhdeve defended the move, saying the bank either considers the three months average or the current valuation of sugar and adopts the lower one.Meanwhile, the MSC bank has also decided to change its strategy regarding non-functional sugar mills, which the bank has attached due to default in payments of loan.This strategy, the chairman said, was adopted in view of the benefits of an operational mill for the farmers. Of the 13 mills, which the bank has floated tenders for, one has found a buyer. Sukhdeve said they will be retendering the mills to look for more players.Financially insolvent cooperative sugar mills by the MSC bank has been a politically sensitive matter for the bank with the then Opposition, BJP, leaders accused the NCP and the Congress leadership of intentionally weakening the mills.Between 2006 and 2013, the MSC bank had sold 26 such mills, which later started operating as private mills.Multiple petitions have been filed regarding the matter, with social activist Anna Hazare being one of the petitioners. Last year, the bank had issued tenders for the sale of seven mills, which owed the bank about Rs 300 crore.However, lack of buyers led the tenders to lapse, following which the bank has reissued the tenders.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The meeting assumes importance as the opposition parties have been trying to present a combined front against the government before the start of the state assembly session.Talking about the meeting, Shetti said Chavan had called to ask him to join the farmers protest organised by the Congress. I told him that we will be taking a decision about the same soon, said Shetti. The farmers leader also said that he had thanked Chavan and the Congress for the pro-farmers stance taken by the party. When I had raised the issue of corruption in the way the contract was given for the software to implement the farmers loan waiver, Prithviraj Chavan had supported me. I thanked him for the same, he said. Asked if this meeting could start a new political move in the state, Shetti said it was too early to comment. Such things are never decided in a hurry, he said.Chavans meeting with Shetti comes in the backdrop of the opposition parties taking to the streets to protest against the anti-farmer policies of the state government. The NCP has already started a morcha from Yavatmal to Nagpur to highlight the farm distress in the state while Congress is also planning a similar rally before the start of the winter session of the state legislature.Shetti, along with some farmers leaders, had organised a massive rally in New Delhi earlier this month to protest against the Centre.Shetti clarified that the rally in the national capital was non-political in its affiliation. Since his decision to part ways with the BJP and NDA, Shetti has been vocal against both the state and central government.

It'safternoon, and she's already filled 10 containers with the goodies. More are sitting in the oven. Iris is baking around a couple of thousand cookies, which she plans to sell in the Christmas market at the consulate. The money will go to a charity.""This morning I was running out of sugar. I had to send my husband to get it for me,"" says Iris, counting eggs for her next mix. ""I use everything organic and hence it is not easy to find the right supplies. The sugar I use is organic and free of sulphur. Thank god I got my stuff.""""And thank god, I am off duty to help you,"" chuckles Jurgen as he assists his wife to get everything ready. They are using about 6 kg flour and sugar, 100 eggs and 5 kg butter. ""There is no trans-fat in my cookies,"" says Iris. She doesn't have much time left. ""is the Christmas fair. We were on holiday in Manila last week but I can't give this a miss. We've been doing it for really long now,"" she says.It started in 2003 when Jurgen was posted in Melbourne. ""It was our second year and we wanted to do something for charity. So we organised a small Christmas fete in our garden where I sold my cookies. The money was given to a charity in India,"" Iris recalls.Iris is making 11 different types of cookies  all are typically German and made only during Christmas. ""There should be something unique about this season. Something that is not available throughout the year. Times have changed, and these days you get strawberries round the year. But Christmas should bring special flavours,"" says Jurgen.So here come the Christmas cookies, fresh from the Schrods' kitchen. These are seasonal, largely because most ingredients are available only during Christmas. ""You won't find candied orange peel and lemon zest any other time,"" informs Iris, placing dollops of flourless gingerbread on wafer papers. ""You will find these wafer papers only in two places. Underneath these cookies and in churches all over the world. Priests bless you with these edible papers,"" Jurgen says in jest.Besides gingerbreads with and without flour, Iris has made several other cookies, each different from the other in terms of flavour, shape and texture. While some are soft and chewy, some are crunchy. You can't write about them unless you taste each one of them,"" she says as she puts a whitish cookie on the plate in front of us. ""This is called snowflake and this is crunchy,"" she informs.The tiny biscuit doesn't look like a snowflake from any angle but as soon as you put it in your mouth it melts like snow in the sun. ""It is full of butter and the garnishing of icing sugar does the trick,"" Iris says. It's followed by gingerbreads, whose intense flavours explode in your mouth, light-weight coconut macaroons, angel eyes with cherry and quince jelly, spritzgeback and other delectable biscuits. ""These spritzgebacks look prettier with chocolate glaze. But we can't do it here for the city's climate. The chocolate melts and makes it messy,"" Iris says.The cookies are exotic, rightly balanced and impeccable. And yet she claims that she is not always perfect when it comes to baking. ""I get so busy in the kitchen that I often forget to keep time. The other day, one batch of coconut macaroons was a minute and a half overcooked and I had to discard them all,"" Iris says sadly. ""We ate them and they were perfectly fine. Slightly crispy from outside, and nice and chewy from inside. Thank God it failed her standards. We kept them in our biscuit tin,"" reveals Jurgen.But how much is she selling them for? ""I calculated that if I sell one bag of 10-12 cookies for Rs 200, my cost will be covered. I am doing it for charity and hence there is no question of adding the cost of electricity and labour. Only the price of the raw materials is added. I know the price is a bit steep, but that's how it is,"" says Iris.Besides the basic ingredients of flour, eggs and sugar, there are many other ingredients, and the Schrods source certain items from Germany . ""I get decorative items and sparkles from Germany. While they are widely available there, it is difficult to spot the correct place. It is very tricky to claim you don't get these items in Kolkata because some day you will spot a tiny shop tucked in some shady lane that might sell fancy cake decorations,"" laughs Jurgen.The Schrods don't hide their attachment with Kolkata. ""Among the places where I've been posted during my foreign service tenure, I think Kolkata was the easiest to settle in. Easier than Australia and definitely easier than New Zealand,"" says Jurgen."

Express file Mills, especially those facing a liquidity crunch, have started selling sugar at prices lower than the market rates. Express fileA month after sugarcane crushing season started in Maharashtra, millers in some parts of the state are worried about the momentary slide in sugar prices, which they say might affect their ability to pay growers. Mills, especially those facing a liquidity crunch, have started selling sugar at prices lower than the market average, thus depressing the market for other players.Since the start of the crushing season, November 1, ex-mill prices of sugar have dipped by Rs 120 per quintal. At present, the ex-mill price of sugar is between Rs 3,280 and 3,450 per tonne, with most mills preferring not to sell below Rs 3,400. Some millers, however, are reported to have indulged in price undercutting, which is looked at seriously by the industry. Some newer mills in Marathwada have started this practice as they require cash to pay farmers the first installment payment.Mukesh Kuvadiya, secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Trader Association said the phenomenon was restricted to a handful of mills. Sugar prices have fallen by Rs 100 since start of the season and most millers are selling at around Rs 3,400. However, mills facing liquidity crunch are resorting to lower prices, he said. B B Thombare, chairman of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA), the apex body of private millers, also admitted to this phenomenon. In our region, we have requested millers not to sell at below Rs 3,400 but some of the millers are still doing so, he said.A cooperative miller from Kolhapur said new mills that have already pledged their sugar to traders at lower prices are the ones indulging in this practice. These mills would normally have a short season and need to have ready cash to pay farmers. Growers normally do not trust such mills, pointed out the miller. Most such mills are expected to end their season by mid-January, and sugar prices are expected to stabilise by then.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Since there were already previous failed attempts made to reunite the cubs with their mother, we decided to study the pugmarks and trace the possible track for the grown-up female to make way, said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, a veterinarian whose Wildlife SOS team, operating out of Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar, rescued these leopards.What made this rescue for the team simpler is that the female leopard arrived at the spot not later than half an hour of arranging the cubs under the plastic basket. There was a chance that the female leopard would never ever come in search of her cubs as four days had already gone by, giving her little affection or feel for lactation. We had suspected the female would return as, after the end of the lactation period, female leopards usually abandon her cubs. But, fortunately, in this case, we managed to reunite the family healthy and successfully, said a relieved Dr Deshmukh.The wildlife experts kept a close watch on the cubs until the female arrived.

Solapur, the home district of state Minister for Cooperatives Subhash Deshmukh, has been witnessing violence with cane growers disrupting the movement of cane demanding Rs 2,700 as first installment payment.At the start of the crushing season 2017-18, there were reports of violence from several districts of the state, as cane growers locked horns with millers over the first installment payment. In the cane belt of Sangli and Kolhapur, the confrontation was resolved after millers agreed to pay Rs 200 over the fair and remunerative price (FRP) as the first installment. During the agitation over FRP earlier this week, two farmers were injured in Ahmednagar, when police fired on the agitators.

Millers in the region have expressed their inability to pay the amount. Senior millers pointed to the low sugar recovery in the region, which made the payment non-feasible. A meeting between millers and protesting farmers called by the sugar commissioner on Friday failed to resolve the deadlock.Solapur being his home district, Deshmukh has come under fire from growers.
