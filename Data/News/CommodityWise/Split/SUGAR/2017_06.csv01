The committee, called Krishak Samriddhi Aayog, headed by the chief minister and with the agriculture minister as vice-chairperson, has been mandated to meet its objectives by 2022.The Uttar Pradesh government has constituted a committee to help draft and implement plans to double farmers income through increased crop production and other related means. The committee, called Krishak Samriddhi Aayog, headed by the chief minister and with the agriculture minister as vice-chairperson, has been mandated to meet its objectives by 2022.Other members include a member of Niti Aayog, UP Chief Secretary, Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC), Dr US Singh of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) of Philippines, Prof Sushil Kumar of IIM-Lucknow and nine farmers from the state who have been successful in farming particular crops.According to the order issued regarding the constitution of the commission, the Aayog will focus on 15 points, including assessing strengths and weaknesses in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and sericulture, and also to give suggestion in drafting of policies for sustainable and equal agriculture development.Speaking to The Indian Express, Chief Secretary Rajiv Kumar informed, This aayog is for policy guidance and implementation monitoring and collection of feedback through eminent farmers. He also said that CM wants policy for doubling the income of the farmers with the help of suitable suggestions.Another important task for the commission will include giving suggestion for procuring more production at reduced cost. Aayog will also suggest for strengthening the system for storage and marketing of crops. The body will also analyse factors responsible for decline in the income in the sector. It will also discuss on cooperative farming, contract farming, collective farming and corporate farming and to accordingly suggest for efficiency and cost effectiveness in the farming.The nine eminent farmers included as farmers representatives in the commission belong to Barabanki, Banda, Varanasi, Muzaffarnagar, Lakhimpur Kheri, Mahoba, Deoria and Azamgarh districts. These farmers have been selected on ground of their having expertise in production of potato, banana, tomato, sugarcane, worm compost, animal husbandry, organic farming, floriculture, poultry and fisheries.Sources said that names of these farmers were sought from concerned departments. There are nominees from concerned big companies as well who would suggest the measures for better marketing and production with low cost.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

Ramasami, former secretary of Department of Science and Technology, had recommended that the Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (CIBA) in Chennai be merged with the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in Kochi, and Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) in Coimbatore be made a sub-centre of the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research in Lucknow.Likewise, the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) in Tiruchi may be merged with the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) in Bengaluru.Proposal unjustifiedDMK working president M.K. Stalin said the merger proposals were unjustified and would deprive Tamil Nadu of institutes of national and international repute in Chennai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi.The reorganisation will greatly jeopardise the aquaculture and research development in the State and affect a large number of employees, Mr. Stalin said in a letter to Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh.He urged the Minister to intervene and prevent any effort to merge the institutes with institutes in other States.MDMK general secretary Vaiko was the first to condemn the plan to merge these research institutes.Meanwhile, scientists of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) in Coimbatore explained the justification for retaining the institution, saying that the sugarcane varieties developed by them occupied 99% of the sugarcane cultivation area in the country.They said the Co 0238 variety developed by the institute had helped Uttar Pradesh overtake Maharashtra in the production of sugarcane.The present move to merge this 105-year-old globally renowned instituted with the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research in Lucknow will lead to the loss of a distinct identity, said the Agricultural Research Service Scientists Forum, Coimbatore, in a statement."

Chandrababu Naidu.As the Delta Sugars announced that it would not take up crushing this season, the sugarcane area would have to be re-allocated to the companies willing to purchase the produce from the farmers.As two companies vied with each other to purchase the cane, the Ministers and the MPs of the ruling party lobbied for companies of their choice.One Minister and an adviser, who were apparently close to Mr. Chandrababu Naidu, mounted pressure on him to allocate the entire area to a company based in West Godavari district.However, an MLA and an MP from Krishna district wanted Mr. Naidu to favour a company located in the district.Mr. Naidu was learnt to have told the groups that both were equal to him. He suggested to warring groups to convince the sugar companies to share the entire cane area amicably.All eyes on IvankaThanks to rumour mill, different corners of the City is now abuzz with just one name -- Ivanka Trump.From Old City to Kukatpally, Hi-Tech city and beyond, the grapevine suggests she will visit most known localities in Hyderabad. But, the frenzy reached almost a crescendo when the famed bangle sellers of Laad Bazaar displayed their wears for cameras, in an attempt to lure Ms. Trump.While her schedule does not include bangle shopping, the sellers were seen showcasing the intricate work they do on brass, wax and glass bangles just in case Ms. Ivanka Trump chooses to visit them.In yet another cleaver but unsolicited invitation, a bunch of teens from Kukatpally had posted pictures of traffic crammed roads in their locality requesting Ms. Trump to announce a casual visit to their locality.The tweets and Facebook posts also reminded the State Government of repair the roads needed before Ms. Trumps visit.While Hyderabad is already decked up for Ivankas visit, whether her short, tightly scheduled visit will disappoint many is a question."
5aeb583d9855b73f522c8fac,A layered approach to keeping pets warm in winter,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-layered-approach-to-keeping-pets-warm-in-winter/article20947143.ece,2017-11-27,"Winter is around the corner, which means it is time for pet parents to prepare for the cold and in some places, chilly rain. Just like humans, cold tolerance varies from animal to animal, and depends on several factors. Thickness of their coat, activity level, age, health and bodys fat store, all play a part.Hence it becomes important to understand the needs of pets and take appropriate action to make them feel comfortable in the bitter cold, said N.G Jayasimha of Humane Society International.A release issued by the group noted that pets should be kept indoors, especially at night when the temperatures tend to drop. If left outside, animals can become unsettled, injured, unwell or freeze. Under no circumstances should pet cats be left outdoors, even if they roam outside during other seasons, said the release.Exposed skinAnimals feel cold and the winter chill can be threatening to your pets life if adequate precaution is not taken. Exposed skin on the nose, ears and paw pads is at a risk of frostbites and hypothermia during extreme cold. For this reason, short-haired dogs often feel more comfortable wearing a sweater  even during short walks, said the release.Paw protectants and paw pads can help protect your pets feet from cold-weather injury or damage, such as cracked or bleeding paw pads. Pets also like a comfortable place to sleep and many keep changing their resting location depending on their need for less or more warmth. The release suggests providing them with comfortable bedding and a few options to help them adjust to their sleeping place. Extra energy is used by pets to keep their body warm and a little more food can provide the much-need calories to them. However, do not overfeed the pet because lack of exercise during cold spells could lead to excessive weight gain and obesity. Additionally, make sure your pet gets plenty of clean water so that they are well-hydrated, he said.The other precautions include bathing the pet fewer times than usual. Though it helps remove dirt and keep your pets clean, bathing them often could lead to the loss of essential oils, increasing the chance of developing dry, flaky skin. Seek recommendations from your vet for a moisturising shampoo and/or rinse.Also since your pet will mostly stay indoors, it is important to ensure they do not have access to toxic foods like onions, xylitol (a sugar substitute), chocolate, medication bottles or household chemicals. It is also advisable to use heaters with caution around pets, because they can lead to burns, suffocation and even death.Community petsA whining, anxious or shivering pet shows clear signs of illness. If you suspect your pet is ill, consult your veterinarian immediately, noted the Society.Community pets staying outdoors need as much support as indoor pets. Providing easily accessible food and water sources goes a long way in keeping the animals safe. Also, before heading out check near and around your cars for animals. Warm engines in parked cars attract cats and small wildlife, who may crawl up under the hood. To avoid injuring any hidden animals, bang on your cars hood to scare them away before starting your engine.If you encounter a pet left out in the cold, let the owner know that youre concerned. Some people genuinely dont know the risk cold weather poses to their pets or livestock."

Singh and asked him to take note of the summons issued to AAP leader and MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira by a Fazilka court in a drug case. SAD-BJP has said it would raise Mr. Khairas issue in the Assembly.The Opposition parties have also said they want the contents of the proposed Punjab Control of Organised Crime Act to be made public.SAD may also raise the issue of renaming of the Dyal Singh College in Delhi.Batting for longer sessions, Mr. Khaira said the duration of the Vidhan Sabha sittings is decreasing every year and the members get limited opportunities to express their views in the Assembly.The AAP has extended support to sugarcane growers of the State who have announced plans to gherao the Assembly today.Sugarcane farmers have demanded that the State-assured prices of cane be increased from Rs. 290-300 per quintal to Rs. 350 per quintal. AAP is also set to raise the issue of Jagtar Singh Johal, arrested in connection with targeted killings in Punjab."

Palaniswami during his upcoming visit to Thanjavur on Wednesday. They say they would use the occasion to highlight the plight of sugar cane and paddy farmers in the State.P.R. Pandian, State secretary, Tamil Nadu Cauvery Farmers Association, said that several thousand farmers in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur were yet to get crop insurance claims settled for the year 2016-17. Since the Agricultural Insurance Company of India was undertaking crop insurance work in Tiruvarur district, around 80 per cent of the insured farmers had got the claims settled. But the New India Assurance Company, which was entrusted with crop insurance activities in Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts, had not been up to the task, and its bungling had effectively derailed the crop insurance scheme for thousands of farmers in the two districts, who have yet to get their claims settled, he added.Similarly, some sugar mills have not released the arrears that they owe to farmers who have supplied cane to them over the past two years, despite several reminders. The employees who had embezzled money from the mill fund at the Arignar Anna Cooperative Sugar Mills at Kurungulam in Thanjavur are yet to be brought to book.Demanding action on all these fronts, the Associations members would show black flags to Mr. Palaniswami during his visit to Thanjavur for the MGR centenary celebrations on Wednesday, Mr. Pandian said.Gadkari flayedHe also flayed Union Minister Nitin Gadkari for insisting on linking the Godavari and the Cauvery rivers at a time when Tamil Nadu had been pressing for the constitution of the Cauvery Management Board and the implementation of the final order of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal.This was an attempt to deflect attention away from Tamil Nadus cause when the Supreme Court was about to deliver its verdict on the issue on a batch of cases pending before the court, Mr. Pandian alleged.Some sugar mills have not released the arrears that they owe to farmersP.R.

On November 20, Mahindra opened a plant in the city that hosted the American automobile revolution in the early 20th century. Isnt it wonderfully ironic that an Indian company that began by importing U.S. vehicles from the Willys Motor Company in those days .. is now coming back and is investing in America, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra told The Hindu on the eve of the plants inauguration.The Indian automobile giant had started its journey by assembling American Willys jeeps in newly independent India. The company advertises its new facility as the first new OEM operation in southeast Michigan in over 25 years. Michigan has been in decline.A whiff of fresh paint and new hope filled the air as Mr. Mahindra was joined by U.S lawmakers representing the region and city leaders to cut the ceremonial ribbon, but the product that will roll out from the new factory  an off-roader named Roxor  remained wrapped behind them. The company said it expected to unveil the vehicle in early 2018, but that is only another milestone in the companys American foray, plans for which are ambitious, said Mr. Mahindra. We will blend with this community like sugar with milk, he said, recounting the legend about how Parsis arriving in Gujarat in the eighth century reassured the local king that they would sweeten but not displace the local community.Michigan has also been symptomatic of the political upheaval that put Donald Trump in the White House in 2016. Mr. Trumps last campaign stop in 2016, hours before voting started, was here. Capping his campaign, he said: Were hours away from a once in a lifetime change. Were going to bring back the automobile industry bigger and better and stronger than ever before. Mr. Trump went on to win Michigan. Ronald Reagan was the last Republican to win it, in 1988. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently cited Mahindras increasing investment in America as an example of mutually beneficial commercial ties between the two countries.Mass market aspirationMr. Mahindra has his eyes set on the long-term promise of the American automobile market  the second biggest now, after China. Though there is no hurry, he is clear that the company will enter the passenger car market at some point. Entry into mass market is not imminent, but it is an aspiration he said. The companys plan is to enter the American market using the Ssangyong brand, a Korean company that it now owns.We are going about it in a thoughtful, strategic manner. We have to gradually introduce our brand to the market  tractors, utility vehicles, now this off-roader. We hope we will creep into the consciousness of the American consumer as the maker of very rugged, tough SUVs and cross-overs  this is more of a brand journey.The Detroit plant brought $230 in investment, and another $600 million is planned by 2020. It employs 250 people now, and 400 more jobs are likely to be created by 2020. The group has one billion dollars in investment in America now, and plans to double it over the next five years, he said.The company entered the U.S. market in the tractor segment in 1994 and is now the third-biggest player in the arena. It also makes Generation Zero Emission (GenZe) two-wheelers that focus on electric mobility. A utility vehicle introduced by the company in 2015, Retriever, is also doing well. That project is a shining example of how an Indian company can contribute to Mr. Trumps political priorities, Mr. Mahindra said. It is a very interesting sidebar that an Indian company comes here, builds its brand in America. and triples the business of an American, family-owned manufacturing unit, he said, at a media roundtable at the new plant, referring to the Retriever manufacturer in Arkansas. He also underscored the similarity between the new companys name, MANA, i.e Mahindra Automative North American and MAGA, mor Make America Great Again, Mr. Trumps campaign slogan.Riding the waveOn the one hand, Mahindra wants to ride a new American wave, blending well with the countrys political current; but its Detroit facility is also part of the companys efforts to navigate the uncertain future of the automobile industry. MANA had started in 2013 as a technical centre, employing more than 100 engineers from top firms in the world, led by Rick Haas, who was director of engineering at Tesla.Mr. Mahindra said the aim was to blend the experience of old world manufacturing skills with new age agility. This is to create an incubator for mobility and vehicles. What is the model of a car company for the future? You have Elon Musk of Tesla, who goes to Silicon Valley and says we have to jettison the past then you have conventional car companies what is that sweet-spot? To use manufacturing knowledge along with the start-up mentality, being asset light, experimentation, etc..He said Detroit, which still has significant manufacturing expertise, would serve as a hub for the companys R&D for its operations around the world. Its success in the American tractor market had tremendously added to its standing in other countries, particularly China, he said. With many Silicon Valley start ups now realising that scale manufacturing was not easy, a new respect for manufacturing expertise is emerging, said Mr. Mahindra. He said he did not know what the future held, but was certain there is a bright future for the automobile industry and therefore ignored consultants who warn him of impending death of the sector every three years.Mahindras American dream also envisions delivery of mails to homes in its trucks. The firm is on the shortlist to build next-generation trucks for the U.S Postal Service. The contract will be awarded next year.(The writer visited Detroit at Mahindra groups invitation)"

Running gangs too has proved surprisingly easy.The jail's walls have proved very porous for mobile phones , not just the small ones that can be hidden away in little corners but big smartphones that have for months been sneaked into the jail with connivance of prison guards.Gang violence and drug trafficking, police sources said, are being orchestrated from within the walls of Bhondsi jail . So far this month, nearly 120 cellphones have been seized in multiple search operations, the latest being 18 on Thursday.There are around 2,200 inmates in Bhondsi jail. To stop this, the jail administration has banned the entry of private vehicles, including those supplying essential goods like food items that were suspected to be used to smuggle the handsets into prison. In another step, the authorities have prevented families of inmates from bringing items like fruits, sugar boxes and even bottles of buttermilk ('chhaas') in which cellphones were regularly concealed and smuggled in.Special search drives were carried out and they brought to the fore some jail wardens' role in giving the mobile a free pass. Inspector general (prisons) Jagjit Singh, who has been posted in Bhondi jail on special duty since November 15, has so far transferred 15 wardens, including a woman, and 23 inmates to other jails in Haryana Director general (prisons) KP Singh admitted some jail officials were hand-in-glove with the inmates. ""The mobile phone menace thrives only in this Haryana prison. We have initiated an inquiry against some of them. A few officials and inmates have been shifted to other jails.""Strict action will be taken against the erring wardens and other staff if they are found guilty,"" he said.A former inmate of Bhondsi jail, requesting anonymity, said the mobile phones were smuggled into the prison with help of wardens and sold to prisoners. ""The wardens use many tricks to hide and bring the mobiles and other banned items to jail. All 'influential' inmates in Bhondsi jail have smartphones. If you have money, buying a latest Android phone inside the jail is a cakewalk. Some inmates even run a PCO-like service, allowing other prisoners to call their families for rates that range between Rs 20 and Rs 50. One can buy a good smartphone for Rs 10,000 inside the jail itself,"" he said.The prison has only one jammer installed in its precincts, and it can stop only 3G phones from receiving signals. But prisoners use 4G phones. IG Jagjit Singh said 17 new mobile jammers would be installed in the prison soon.Unfettered communication helps several notorious gangsters lodged in the jail run their illegal businesses outside, and some of them even run extortion rackets, which came to light in August when fake arms licence scam kingpin Manish Bhardwaj approached the police, alleging jailed gangster Manjeet Mahal and his accomplices were threatening prisoners and demanding money from him.On October 31, a woman from West Bengal filed a complaint with Gurgaon police, claiming that her jailed husband was being threatened by gangsters behind bars and told to pay protection money to ensure his safety in the jail. In 2016, jailed gangster Ashok Rathee had allegedly contacted his henchmen and asked them to eliminate his wife, suspecting infidelity. She was later gunned down.A senior jail official confirmed on condition of anonymity that banned items like soap, oil and even fruits were being supplied inside jail by some wardens and canteen operators. A woman warden, who was transferred recently, used to hide items inside her clothes, the official said.IG Singh claimed the jail authorities have been able break the nexus between wardens and inmates to an extent. ""We are taking all culprits to task and won't spare anyone who is found guilty.Some wardens and inmates have been transferred, and many others are under our scanner. Some wardens help inmates for money while others work for a few gangsters out of fear,"" Singh said."
5aeb5cdd9855b73f522c91d5,A toolkit to think local,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-toolkit-to-think-local/article20946388.ece,2017-11-27,"Policymakers in India need reliable disease burden data at subnational levels. Planning based on local trends can improve the health of populations more effectively. Till now, a comprehensive assessment of the diseases causing the most premature deaths and ill health in each State, the risk factors responsible for this burden and their time trends have not been available. To address this crucial knowledge gap, a team of over 250 scientists and others from around 100 institutions who are part of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative has analysed and described these trends for every State from 1990 to 2016. Its report was released by the Vice President of India, and a technical paper published in the journalLancetrecently.The findings of the study are based on analysis of data from all available sources. This includes vital registration, the sample registration system, large-scale national household surveys, other population-level surveys and cohort studies, disease surveillance data, disease programme data, administrative records of health services, disease registries, among others. The estimates were produced as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, which uses standardised methods in a unified framework. The key metric used to assess burden is disability-adjusted life years (DALY), which is the sum of the number of years of life lost due to premature death and a weighted measure of the years lived with disability due to a disease or an injury. This allows comparisons of health loss between diseases, risk factors, States, sexes, age groups, and over time.Inequalities among StatesThe per person disease burden, measured as DALY rate, has dropped in India by 36% from 1990 to 2016, but there are major inequalities among States with the per person DALY rate varying almost twofold between them. The burden of most infectious and childhood diseases has fallen, but the extent of this varies substantially across India. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, iron-deficiency anaemia, neonatal disorders, and tuberculosis still continue to be major public health problems in many poorer northern States.The contribution of most major non-communicable disease categories to the total disease burden has increased in all States since 1990. These include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, mental health and neurological disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, cancers, and chronic kidney disease. The contribution of injuries  the leading ones being road injuries, suicides, and falls  to the total disease burden has also increased in most States since 1990.The continuing high burden of infectious and childhood diseases in poorer States along with the rising tide of non-communicable diseases and injuries poses a particularly ominous challenge for these States. Substantial increases in health spending by the government and expansion of suitable preventive and curative health services are necessary to prevent this potentially explosive situation. It is important to note that the State-specific DALY rates for many leading individual diseases varies five- to tenfold between States. Major differences are also observed for individual diseases between neighbouring States that are at similar levels of development. This points to the need for State-specific health planning instead of generic planning.The leading risk factorsDisease burden can be reduced by addressing the risk factors for major diseases. The findings of the study reveal that three types of risks  undernutrition, air pollution, and a group of risks causing cardiovascular disease and diabetes  are akin to national emergencies as these have the potential to significantly blunt the rapid social and economic progress to which India aspires.First, it is remarkable that even though there is a declining trend in child and maternal undernutrition, this is still the single largest risk factor in India, responsible for 15% of the total disease burden in 2016. Undernutrition increases the risk of neonatal disorders, nutritional deficiencies, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory and other common infections. This burden is 12 times higher per person in India than in China. While this risk factor is relatively worse in the major northern poor States and Assam, it is amazingly the leading risk in over three-fourths of the States across India.Second, air pollution levels in India are among the highest in the world, making it the second leading risk factor in 2016, responsible for 10% of the total disease burden in the country. Air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, respiratory infections, and cancer. The burden of outdoor air pollution has increased in every part of India since 1990 because of pollutants from power production, industry, vehicles, construction, dust and waste burning. Air pollution is higher in the northern States, but is considerable even in the southern States. The unacceptably high disease burden due to undernutrition and air pollution in most of India must be brought to an end through systematic large-scale interventions with robust short- and long-term goals.Third, a group of risks that include unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol and overweight, which increase the risk of ischaemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes, contributed a tenth of the total disease burden in India in 1990, but increased to a quarter of the total burden in 2016. While these risks are currently higher in the relatively more developed States, their phenomenal increase in every State over the past quarter of a century poses a grave threat. Unless serious attempts are made soon to address this surge through massive upscaling of interventions in the health, food, agriculture, housing and urban development sectors, these risks can result in major deterioration in the health status across all States, rich and poor. An important point to note related to undernutrition, air pollution, and the risks causing cardiovascular disease and diabetes is that the interventions needed to address them have to involve extensive collaborations between the health sector and other relevant sectors.Inputs for health planningThese findings reported by the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative provide the most comprehensive mapping so far of the magnitude of diseases and risk factors in every State, their age and sex distributions, and trends over a quarter century  all in a single standardised framework. The chances of achieving the overall health targets for India and of reducing health inequalities among States would be higher now if the biggest health problems and risks identified for each State are tackled on priority basis rather than with a more generic approach that does not take into account these State-specific trends. This new knowledge base and the annual updates planned by the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative will provide important inputs for the data-driven and decentralised health planning and monitoring recommended by the National Health Policy 2017 and the NITI Aayog Action Agenda 2017-2020.Lalit Dandona is Director of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative, Distinguished Research Professor at the Public Health Foundation of India, and Professor of Global Health at the University of Washington.

The delegation also urged the governor to direct the state government to implement Rs 90,000-crore loan waiver at the earliest as promised by it. It said farm suicides were on the rise due to this and farmer accounts had been declared as NPAs (non-performing assets), making them ineligible for future loans.The delegation also submitted that the Congress government had deliberately not hiked the state assured price (SAP) of sugarcane because its ministers were sugar barons and it was a clear case of conflict of interest. A request has been made to the governor to direct the government to hike the price to at least Rs 350 per quintal. It was submitted that Haryana was paying Rs 330 per quintal against Rs 300 per quintal SAP in Punjab.Citing recent manhandling of a general manager of the mining department in a police station when he tried to check illegal mining, the delegation urged the governor to direct the government to take action against sand mining mafia being allegedly run by the Congress legislators in Punjab.The delegation also requested the governor to ensure 60:40 ratio of officers between Punjab and Haryana in the Chandigarh administration, besides enforcing Punjabi as the official language of Chandigarh."

Recently, the quota agitation led by Hardik Patel has left the State government shaken. While communities fight over their need for reservation in education and jobs, Mirror traces the journey of a few Dalits who have worked hard to fulfil their dreams without taking advantage of the benefits doled out to their community.The owner of three successful companies, Junagadh resident Vishal Ravaliyas is a true rags-to-riches tale. His parents were labourers and they lived in a one-room house with no plaster, tiles or windows in. Ravaliya knew education could be his salvation. So after working as a labourer in groundnut fields to help his family, he would take time out to study hard. He secured 76 per cent in Class 10 and opted to study Diploma in Agriculture.The 33-year-old says, I received a scholarship based on my marks, but it was peanuts. While my friends had fun on weekends, I would work as a labourer as I was responsible for my family as well. After finishing his diploma, Ravaliya secured a job as a field officer with an agricultural company through campus recruitment. Several jobs later, he brought in business of Rs 5 crore for a company and got paid only Rs 10 lakh.This was a turning point. I realised I could have easily made that amount for myself. I decided to start a company in agriculture sector but knew the market might not accept or deal with a Dalit. I joined hands with a Patel and Ahir. We earned a fat profit and separated after a year. Ravaliya then set up Agri Crop Chemicals in 2011. He reveals, I wanted to expand but did not have anything to mortgage for a loan. I ran the business for three years to be eligible for a loan. Then, on a visit to Thailand, he realised the demand for Gujarati food among tourists from the State there. This led him to start a restaurant there.Here, people might not accept food prepared by Dalits, but it was a good option for them in Thailand. I also realised how travel-crazy Gujaratis are, and started a tour company to tap into that demand. Later, he also set up a public resort in Sasan Gir. For the industrialist, reservation is poison. He explains, I never opted for reservation. While it has its positive aspects, it is also a reason why many of us do not work hard in life. I wanted to stand on my own two feet. Today, the turnover of Ravaliyas companies amounts to approximately Rs 20 crore a year. He donates 5% of his income for the uplift of his community.Jagannatham Begaris journey from a small village in Telangana to the Central University of Gujarat has been full of struggles. While he did choose reservation while studying, when it came to his job, he applied in the general category and got through. The 37-year-old says, I hail from Huggelli village. My mother was a fruitseller and my father was physically challenged. They underwent a lot of hardship to ensure that I study well. Ambedkars vision and education inspired me. I worked as a labourer in sugarcane fields, on railway tracks and with chemical companies to support my family and fund my studies.He topped his BA class. I applied for scholarship and relied on reservation as people like us cannot dream of studying in higher classes without it, he explains. Begari pursued MA in Political Science, got an MPhil and a PhD degree, too. He secured a UGC fellowship which is highly competitive and given only on the basis of merit, not reservation. In 2011, he joined CUG on contract. A year, he was made permanent in the general category. The Gandhinagar resident says, That I was chosen in the general category boosted my confidence. My interviews, performance, publications and specializations helped me. He donated money to the government school in his village so his community people can study well.Mayur Dholakia belongs to a middleclass family. His father was a Class 2 officer while his mother was a housewife. Yet, unlike many other well-to-do members of his community, he never applied for scholarship or reservation. He scored 66% in Class 12 and secured admission in Chemical Engineering at Nirma University. Dholakia says, I got admission on a self-financed seat. After completing engineering, he secured a job in a renowned company with a starting salary of Rs 19,000 per month. He left his job a year later to pursue his dream of becoming an IAS officer. Though he was not selected for Mains, Dholakia turned a fail into a win by starting a coaching class in 2013 for competitive exam aspirants. He started off with three students in a batch and has four branches today: Junagadh, Veraval, Keshod and Mangrol. Several of his students have secured government jobs. Reservation should not be given blindly to any community. They should be given to the needy not to families who are doing well financially.Scholarships and reservations should always be availed by the needy: This lesson by her parents have always guided Nikita Wankhade. My father is a banker and my mother is a housewife. They always taught me to work hard and achieve success in life than snatch away an opportunity meant for a needy person, she says. The 24-year-old who lives in Ramdevnagar says, I could have used reservation to get into college but I chose not to.Along with BA, I started learning multimedia, animation and IT as parttime courses. By the time I was in SYBA, Iwas earning Rs 3,000 a month. She also wrote scripts for advertisements on YouTube. Then she discovered her love for photography. Today, Nikita clicks food and product photographs for big brands. Her photographs of Ahmedabads heritage site was published by in a renowned geographical magazine. My ancestors took the benefit of reservation, and my family lifted itself from poverty. I think reservation should be availed of only by two generations, she said.Nirav Chauhans father has a government job and his mother is a housewife. The Gandhinagar residents ensured that he never compromised on his studies. A bright student, the 26-year-old never availed himself of any scholarship or reservation. After acquiring his mechanical engineering degree by passing with 7.1 CGPA, he initially struggled to get a job. Gradually, he got recruited as a quality control manager but realised that a job was not his cup of tea. He used his expertise in marketing, production, and dispatch departments to start his own company.He took a loan (not meant for SC/ST) and began a unit producing industrial fasteners in Gandhinagar in 2016. Within eight months, his average turnover was pegged at Rs 1.5 crore. He says, With the government offering several benefits to encourage entrepreneurship among downtrodden communities, several people now approach me to start a joint venture. The entrepreneur adds, Despite coming from a well-to-do family, I have faced discrimination due to my caste. I believe there should be no reservation in education so that meritorious and bright students get ahead in life. But there should be quota in jobs where theres discrimination. And, also in politics so that our voices are heard."

The institute trained them for three days to replicate the ideas in Vizianagaram district which has many sugar factories. According to officials, UP farmers depends on CO-0238 seed to get maximum production.They also cut the crop only three times but in Vizianagaram it is being done more than eight times. Interestingly, the expenditure is also very less in Bihar and UP where farmers spend only Rs. 50,000 per hectare but in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam it is up to Rs. 80,000. The farmers of UP are depending on inter-crops such as pulses and potatoes along with sugarcane to earn more income. We need to adopt those techniques to improve production in Vizianagaram district too, said Mr. Yadav while speaking to The Hindu . As many as 116 sugar factories in UP are in profits with the adoption of new technology, he added. The Vizianagaram administration planned to conduct training programmes for selected farmers to improve the production in the district. The Agriculture Department has been directed to prepare an action plan to implement new ideas from the next rabi and kharif seasons.Revival of factoryAITAM College professor and president of Parivartan Trust Chintada Ravikumar said that one lakh signatures were being collected to step up pressure on the government for revival of co-operative sugar factory of Amadalavalasa in Srikakulam district. Sugarcane growing and production can be made profitable activity if the government looks into the issue seriously. The sugarcane growing will go up in Srikakulam district if steps are taken to reopen the factory which was closed two decades ago, he added."

They found that, for CAM to work properly, the cells must switch on PPCK each night driven by internal circadian clock."

Turns out, about 56,000 quintals (56 lakh kg) of wheat has been left to rot in various warehouses across the state over the last couple of years.Just to give you an idea of what that means: According to National Sample Survey 2011-12, an average rural Indian consumes about 4.3 kg of wheat in a month. This means, the grain being wasted now could feed at least 13 lakh individuals for a month.The huge pile of rotting wheat in almost all districts has caught the government off-guard, and it is now clueless, not only on how to ascertain quality, but also on how best it can dispose of the rotting wheat.An estimation by thehas revealed that 55,999 quintal of wheat is rotting away in the departments warehouses. The department has sought reports from all districts on the quality of wheat and whether it is fit for human consumption after being stored for so long.The department has also ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such a huge pile up of wheat was not brought to the governments notice earlier.Sources in the Food and Civil Supplies Department told Bangalore Mirror that the government had initially announced that it would give 3 kg rice per person along with 2 kg wheat. During that time, it was receiving about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat from the Centre for distribution under the Public Distribution System (), annually.As the government chose to distribute 5 kg rice undersubsequently, which has now been increased to 7 kg per person, the distribution of wheat was completely stopped, resulting in the huge pile-up, a senior official from the department said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister UT Khader told Bangalore Mirror they are finding ways to dispose of this huge quantity of wheat. Considering our supply of 2.5 lakh tonnes, the present pile up of about 56,000 quintal is only a small amount. We are trying our best to clear the stock. First, we will verify whether it is fit for human consumption. All the districts have been ordered to get their stock tested at the food laboratories for quality. Once we get the quality reports, we will decide whether it can be distributed to people or used to feed animals, Khader said.Officials of the department explained to Bangalore Mirror that regular fumigation was taken up at these warehouses to prevent degradation of the grains.Generally, the food grains are stored in a scientific manner and the floor is covered with fine quality tarpaulin. If the district administration has failed to ensure these measures, then there are chances that the food grains are spoilt. We will conduct quality tests for wheat that was stored for a long time. If the results are negative, it will be given to animals. If the tests declare it unfit even for animals, then we may have to dispose it of in some other manner, an official attached with a warehouse insaid.So, though the government is clearing all its stock of salt, ragi, sugar, palm oil and green gram, only in the case of wheat, it has chosen to await the quality report from various district centres."

Asia Palmyra palm being the state tree of Tamil Nadu , we have lost considerable number of trees in the recent times,"" said collector K Ganesh adding that the mass plantation of palmyra will secure the future.While every part of palmyra tree is useful and is a potential revenue source, 2,000 trees in every village panchayat would help it attain self-sufficiency. Terming the initiative to be a future investment, he said every tree would take at least 10 years to fully grow and bear fruits.""While the world is shifting towards palm sugar after realising its worth in the recent time, by the time trees grow, we will witness it having huge demand,"" he said.Apart from palmyra, plantations are underway for 9 other types of trees, which can grow on its own if a branch of the tree is planted across the district. Peepal and banyan are the primary trees that are being planted in large numbers."

The forum termed the move discriminatory and said the government has not explained why it has chosen not to give the gift to the card holders.In the letter, the forum said the government announced free Pongal gift to all card holdersaround 1.84 crore peopleincluding, Sri Lankan refugees, But, not for nearly 10 lakh citizens of Tamil Nadu , who are holding ration cards with sugar option, which is discriminatory, biased and unfair.The Pongal gift pack contains one kg each rice and sugar, a 2ft piece of sugarcane, 20g cashew nuts, 20g raisins and 5g cardamom.The forum went on to add that multi-millionaires, senior bureaucrats, class-I officials, industrialists and ministers were eligible for all freebies and Pongal gifts as they hold rice ration cards. We are not blaming them since they did nothing wrong as per the government norms. Unfortunately, many poor people, who preferred sugar card for various reasons in 1997 are ineligible for all freebies announced by the government, the letter added.The forums secretary K Kathirmathiyon told TOI that in 1997, people had the choice to select the type of card they wanted. About 10 lakh people opted for the sugar card. This also included people such as small tea and sweet shop owners. They opted for sugar card as they needed sugar for their business. Such people are being discriminated against. Also, the government has not explained the reason for not providing Pongal gift to sugar card holders. I wrote a letter to the Centre about the discriminatory attitude three months ago and the Centre had directed the state government to provide an explanation. But, there has been none so far, he said.The forum said it did not encourage freebie schemes. But, if at all freebies are to be given, it should be for the needy and poor, the letter said.When such schemes are done under a universal system, one section of people should not be discriminated against, Kathirmathiyon said. If it is a targeted system, then it is fine to give freebies only to a section of people. But, there is no basis for keeping out sugar card holders, as the cards were not given based on financial status or age, he added.According to the state civil supplies website, there are 10,76,552 sugar card holders in Tamil Nadu."

We are looking at winning 113 seats in the 224-member legislative assembly and forming the government on our own.We have already committed to the people that we will waive all farm loans (which adds to Rs 50,000 crore) if we come to power. We have promised to complete all pending irrigation projects and improve Bengalurus infrastructure. We cant achieve all this if we have an alliance partner, so we have to get 113 seats and come to power on our own. As of now, we are in a comfortable position in about 140-150 constituencies. The people have voted for BJP and Congress in the past; we are requesting them to vote us to power and see how we perform.If Congress and BJP are so confident, why are they poaching potential candidates from our party? BJP doesnt have suitable candidates in around 80-90 constituencies. Their situation is so bad that they cant find candidates for elections to graduates constituencies. Congress is also feeling the heat and the big question is: Can Siddaramaiah win comfortably in his own constituency in Mysuru?I have learnt a lot now and have gained more experience. I know where I erred earlier, what the reasons were and how the damage could have been controlled. I will be cautious this time.Definitely. Both Congress and BJP want the coastal region to be on the boil for their political gains. We are telling the people that they should vote for JD(S) if they want development.The chief minister claims to have allocated thousands of crores of rupees for development of North Karnataka, but the reality is that a majority of the amount remains unspent. Where has development happened in the region? The Mahadayi river row and Lingayat issue may backfire on Congress and BJP.People in the Old Mysuru region are dependent on agriculture, but their miseries have only worsened because of faulty policies of BJP at the Centre and lack of timely response from the Congress government in Karnataka. The farmers in Mandya and Mysuru are angry with the state government as they have been forced to switch over to ragi from sugarcane and paddy cultivation. More farmers have committed suicide in Mandya and Mysuru.As of now, only two persons from our family will be contesting. Our primary goal is to increase the partys score at the hustings."

He is not only expected to play a crucial role in getting the states agriculture and irrigation schemes on track but also may monitor the end-to-end implementation of Modi's people centric policies in Gujarat to prepare the state for Lok Sabha polls in 2019.Kailashnathan had retired as additional chief secretary of the Gujarat government in 2013. But he was reemployed on a contract basis for two more years in chief ministers officer with a new designation-chief principal secretary. Having worked with three CMs Narendra Modi, Anandiben and Vijay Rupani , Kailashnathan, essentially Modi's man is known to regularly engage with officials in the Prime Minister's Office on Gujarat and policy-related decisions of the government.Believed to have gained Modi's trust by setting up Gujarat's extensive drinking water pipeline grid and through Hus work at Gujarat Maritime Board in privatisation of ports, Kailashnathan also held a number of key infrastructure positions in the government, apart from being the managing director of Gujarat State Financial Services.A top source in the government said it was possible that Kailashnathan would have been rewarded a good position in the capital or any other constitutional post had the BJP managed a sweep or even retained the scale of victory as last time.Kailashnathan's major achievements, according to sources in the government include the grid constructed around the Narmada basin that serve 70% of the states population, the state government's flagship Sauni Yojana taking Narmada water to Saurashtra and Van Bandhu yojna aimed at increasing the support of tribals for the state government.With the BJP forming the government with a thin majority, Kailashnathan's role, according to sources, will be far more crucial in the days to come, as the BJP prepares to counter the opposition that for the first time in many years will have a significant 77 seats in the assembly. His main work will be also to guide Vijay Rupani through bureaucratic and administrative hassles. KK's strength, sources said, was his ability to get work done out of people with a strict no nonsense attitude ""He won't waste time even in offering tea or indulging in casual conversations with anyone. He is not interested in image building or coming into the limelight or being judged for his inter-personal skills. He doesn't sugarcoat issues so the PM takes him seriously,"" an official said."

About five lakh farmers, mostly small and marginal, are expected to benefit from improved tank irrigation systems.Tamil Nadu, being a water-stressed state, continues to experience shortages which are expected to further exacerbate in the future. Rehabilitating and modernising irrigation tanks will improve the reliability and availability of irrigation water for farming communities, making them less prone toclimatic hazards. More than 1.6 lakh hectares of currently partially irrigated land will come into full irrigation under this project, said Union economic affairs joint secretary Sameer Kumar Khare The project is likely to rehabilitate and modernise about 4,800 irrigation tanks and 477 check dams, spread across 66 sub-basins, in delivering bulk water to irrigation systems. The project will help Tamil Nadu scale up efforts to unlock the full potential of agriculture sector.

If the farmer repays his debts fast, he is entitled to get 3 per cent waiver on interest. So the actual rate of interest on crop loan is only 4 per cent, said Puliyur A Nagarajan , state organiser of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress He said that if farmers were to obtain loan from primary agriculture cooperative societies, they would have to pledge their jewels at the bank for the amount which would be given at 12 to 14.5 per cent annual interest rate. It is unfair and injustice being done to the farmers, he lamented.This apart, the state should order the cooperative societies to offer crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh without any collateral security as is done in the nationalised banks, said Nagrajan.He argued that the nationalised banks accepted a letter of the assurance by the landowners to sanction crop loan while the PACCS are demanding transfer of the title deeds in their name for availing of Rs 3 lakh loan.Nagarajan said he had forwarded a representation to the Reserve Bank of India and registrar of cooperative department of Chennai, mentioning the difficulties farmers face in getting loan from PACCS.Echoing his sentiment, N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson for Bharatiya Kisan Sangam, said the nationalized banks were also offering secured crop loans for farmers. Sadly, most of the beneficiaries in this category were pawnbrokers, not farmers, he said.Virtually the nationalised banks are offering crop loan to farmers if they are ready to pledge jewels. Most of the beneficiaries here are not farmers, but pawnbrokers. They are the ones who make use of the opportunity under the guise of farmers, Veerasekaran said.With plantain and sugarcanes farming becoming a costly affair, the state should relax its norms on PACCS and come forward to offer loan at feasible interest rate, he said.When contacted, a senior official from the cooperative department said that crop loans and jewel loans have been offered to the farmers as per the norms laid down earlier by the cooperative law."

No sooner was he admitted to hospital, than Gandhinagar MLA and KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao arranged for an ambulance to be stationed at the protest site, opposite the BJP head office Jagannath Bhavan in the city.Doctors suspect that Hanumanthappa has hypoglycaemia or low blood sugar, which resulted in body ache, weakness and dizziness.Dr Suresh said: When the patient was brought to hospital around 3pm, he complained of dizziness and weakness which could have been due to the stress of taking part in the protest. Following a general checkup, we suspect that he suffers from low blood sugar, and have kept him under observation.According to the protesters, at least 20 men and women were administered oral medication and injections for minor health issues. However, unfazed by health concerns, they continued their agitation, seeking answers from Yeddyurappa. The former CM will be in Bengaluru on Tuesday for the state units core committee meeting.Earlier in the day, the JD(S) took an official stand to back the farmers, who are demanding that Yeddyurappa meet them and clarify whether he can convince the Goa chief minister to immediately release water from the Mahadayi, or accept that he is unable to do so. They claim they will call off their agitation after meeting him.JD(S) emissary and MLC Basavaraj Horatti met the protesters on Monday. Horatti told reporters that he would discuss the farmers concerns with opposition leader in the legislative assembly Jagadish Shettar and impress upon him the need to hold discussions with party leaders to clarify whether the saffron party can prevail upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the Mahadayi dispute and resolve it.Later, in a three-page release, the Raitha Sena of Karnataka said their agitation was apolitical and will continue till such time that Yeddyurappa clarifies whether the BJP will be able to resolve their concerns or not.The Raitha Sena also took exception to Yeddyurappas statement asking them to protest in front of CM Siddaramaiahs home, instead of the BJP head office.We urge the BJP state president, who has taken oath as chief minister in the name of farmers and claims to be a leader of farmers, not to belittle and offend farmers by asking us to shift our protest without giving a proper response to the letter and agreement reached upon by the Karnataka BJP and Goa government, the letter said.Amid the political one-upmanship, protesters also got support from the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce and senior artistes from Sandalwood.Towards late evening, the Social Democratic Party of India also joined the farmers in their protest against the BJP.The letter written by Goa CM Manohar Parrikar to state BjP president B S Yeddyurappa has no validity. Parrikar should have written to the Karnataka chief minister or chief secretary. Now, let the Goa government clarify its stance and we will speak with the Goa Congress to seek a resolution on the issue. Without any valid proposal to the government to resolve the issue, how does it make sense to blame us?Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar has shown his magnanimity by agreeing to release water to Karnataka for drinking. Such a gesture has been stalled by the Congress in Goa, who are opposing any release of water. The Congress is the villain in the entire Mahadayi and Kalasa-Banduri Nala issue, and it is only the BJP which is trying to resolve it. When B S Yeddyurappa becomes CM, we will ensure the issue is resolved.Dharwad: Several organizations have expressed support to the call for a North Karnataka bandh on Wednesday. Convener of the Mahadayi Agitation Committee Laxman Bakkai said in a release that a meeting of all organizations supporting the bandh call will be held at the Circuit House in Dharwad at 11am Tuesday.Gururaj Hunasimarad will preside over the meeting to discuss the Mahadayi issue and the next step to be taken. tnn"

Mahua sugar cooperative factory president Mansinh Patel lost polls, which were held on Saturday , after more than 15 years and in all likelihood will now lose top post in the Gujarat Sahakari Khand Udyog Sangh too.Two groups owing allegiance to different factions of BJPs Surat unit had adopted various methods to see that their rivals lost elections of Mahua sugar cooperative factory. A group led by newly-elected BJP MLA Mohan Dodiya took 12 directors on a two-day vacation to Saputara. Mansinh Patel, a former BJP MP, too came up with an innovative scheme to keep the directors in good humour. However, Patel lost the polls and could get only seven out of the 12 votes of the directors. Balwant Patel, who was supported by Mohan Dodiya, got 12 votes. Dodiya said, He got the result that he deserved. He is officially with BJP but had worked against the party in the assembly elections by supporting Dr Tushar Chaudhary of Congress.Patel and Dodiya have been at loggerheads for the last one decade over their attempts to gain control of the sugar and milk cooperatives in Surat district. The Patel camp alleges that Dodiya has been harassing him in SUMUL forcing the formers Vanskui Milk Mandli to approach court when an attempt was made to keep its members out. Some BJP workers alleged that Patel was the first to oppose candidature of Dodiya from Mahua seat describing him as an outsider. Patel supported Congress Tushar Chaudhary and worked to see that Dodiya was defeated. However, BJP was able to retain the seat in the assembly elections.A director of Bardoli sugar cooperative society said, This fight has been going on since many years. It is about time that the party leadership enforces discipline because this kind of rivalry can affect BJPs prospects in other seats and sugar cooperatives."

On pilot basis, 22,000 hectare has been identified where mixed farming is being practiced.According to statistics, provided by district programme office, there are around 3.39 lakh children in the district. Of these, while 49,000 are malnourished and around 20,000 children are acutely malnourished. These kids are from 0 to 5 years old. Besides this, women are also suffering from anemia.According to official, it is because of increase in sugarcane cultivation area. In west UP, including Bijnor , farmers had almost sidelined other crops. Most of the farmers are growing only sugarcane.The district cane officer OP Singh said, We have assigned a target of sowing 22,000 hectare intercrop in sugarcane. Earlier, Bijnor district is a hub of sugarcane crop. Farmers have adopted it as a main crop as it is a cash crop and does not require much labourer. On our suggestion, the farmers have started growing some crops like cauliflower, bringal, tomato, capsicum, radish, salgum, gram, ourad, mong, masoor with sugarcane crop.Director of agriculture department, JP Chaudhary , said, The initiative will help improve the health of malnourished kids and women in the district. We are holding meetings in every village and motivating the farmers. Efforts will start bearing fruits soon."

5b23957f9855b7242741b964,One hydrocarbon project  many fault lines,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/one-hydrocarbon-project-many-fault-lines/article17411101.ece,2017-03-05,"Sixty-seven-year-old G. Subramanian of Neduvasal is not one to shy away from a fight. Certainly not when somebody tries to deprive him of his fertile land that feeds his joint family of 10.Mr. Subramanian, who has been fighting to hold on to his lush, eight-acre piece of land and prevent it from being taken on lease, has, in a way, been the man behind the mass protest against the Centres hydrocarbon exploration and extraction project at Neduvasal that has been raging for over a fortnight now.The sprightly farmer, who, as a young man, aspired to join the Army but was not allowed to do so by his parents, is celebrated as a hero by many in the village. But for him, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) would have already sunk an exploratory well in Neduvasal as it had done in half-a-dozen neighbouring hamlets.For the past four years, Mr. Subramanian has been stubbornly refusing to part with a portion of his land  about four acres  sought by the ONGC, which had zeroed-in on this exploratory location through seismic surveys conducted over the past several years.Although some of his neighbours had given their land on lease to the ONGC, much against his advice, Mr. Subramanian has been holding on to his four acres, as if for dear life. Articulate and well-informed, he recounts the attempts to take over his land on lease: On April 4, 2013, a group of officers, apparently from the ONGC and the Revenue Department, arrived and started taking measurements around my field. I was working in the field and wasnt bothered initially. But soon, they started fixing boundary stones. Taken aback, I rushed in, asking them what they were doing on my field without my consent. They said they were conducting a survey. I asked them whether they knew who the owner of the land was. Was I dead?After a bout of discussion, Mr. Subramanian politely told them to remove the boundary stones as it would be disrespectful to the officials if he himself were to do so.They complied with my request and left, narrates Mr. Subramanian.The day marked the beginning of a long fight. Ever since, it has been a torture as the officials kept coming at frequent intervals, asking us to hand over the land, says a frail-looking Parvathi, his wife. She underwent a mastectomy a few years ago, and the family spent nearly Rs. 5 lakh on her cancer treatment by raising loans.The family has already been through some troubled times. Apart from Parvathis poor health, the couples elder sons wife died, leaving two young children in their care and the younger son doesnt have a steady job. The land is my only source of income and I raise a range of crops to meet the expenses. As we cannot afford to hire labourers due to high wages, we ourselves toil in the field, he says.Though the visiting officials kept changing, their demand remained the same  sign on the dotted lines. They even called me for peace talks with senior officials at Tiruvarur. I went alone, ignoring my wifes advice. They tried to coerce me into signing the lease document. But I stood my ground, he recalls.They offered to hike the compensation but I said I will not give up the land even if they gave me Rs. 5 crore. They came calling even about six to seven months back, but I explained my position to them. Let them go to court, I will fight it out. They can take over my land, but only over our dead bodies, says Mr. Subramanian.Giving up landsAt neighbouring Karu Nallandarkollai, just two kilometres away, P. Kulandai Velar, aged over 70, sits on a bullock cart outside his tiled house, looking forlorn. He was one of those who had agreed to give their land to the ONGC without a murmur when they came asking for it in 2006.I, along with my brother, gave up six acres when they asked for the land, saying they were going to be drilling for kerosene. I didnt ask any questions then. They started work in 2007. They are still paying me Rs. 60,000 annually. I used to earn more growing paddy, sugarcane and banana using a borewell, he says.A potter by profession, he doesnt get much income from the trade these days. Both my wives died, unable to bear the fact that I had given away the land. I have sold many of my cattle, he claims.An exploratory well sunk by the ONGC in his field presents a stark danger to the villagers even though there has been no activity at the site for the past few years. A square-shaped ground level tank, about 100 metres away from the well, still has a substantial quantity of what looks like crude oil  apparently leakages from the well.The land is barren now and I have no hopes of restoring it to take up cultivation again, says Mr. Kulandai Velar.Protests gather massThe tale of the two farmers, and the likes of Mr. Kulandai Velar, who had given up his land for ONGCs exploratory wells, has stirred what has now grown into a mass protest, almost akin to the recent pro-jallikattu protest in the State. Much like the jallikattu protest, this stir intensified with the support of the youth and celebrities, mobilised through social media.On February 15, when news broke that Neduvasal was only one among the 31 contract areas of small fields where exploration of hydrocarbons is to be taken up across the country, many villagers rushed to meet Mr. Subramanian, asking him whether he had signed the lease document. Relieved to hear that he hadnt, the villagers got into a huddle and launched the protest the very next day.Ever since, the village square in front of the Nadimuthu Mariamman Temple and the adjacent temple tank have become the setting for the sit-in, which over the past couple of weeks has turned into a strident protest with the support of farmers organisations, environmental activists, youth mobilised through social media and political parties. It was not long before villagers of Karu Nallandarkollai and Kottaikadu, where the ONGC has already drilled exploratory wells, went on protests at their respective villages.Black flags in front of houses and hoardings decrying the hydrocarbon project greet visitors all across the villages. Hundreds of people keep pouring into Neduvasal every day, even as the police keep watch on all visitors. Vehicle numbers and mobile phone numbers are noted down. A section of young agitators have alleged that students are not being allowed to enter the village, but policemen deny the charge.The villagers are keen on ensuring that the protest does not take a political hue. While politicians are welcome, they are asked to conduct demonstrations near the bus stand, just behind the temple.Indeed, politicians have been heading to Neduvasal, like bees drawn to honey, or issuing statements in support of the agitation. The protests reached such a crescendo that Union Minister for State for Road Transport and Highways Pon. Radhakrishnan, who hails from Kanniyakumari, made an assurance recently in a speech he made in the delta region: The Centre will not go ahead with anything that would be harmful to the people of the State. Other major political parties joined cause with the farmers, though they had to keep their physical distance from the core protests.The villagers play eager hosts and are generous in their hospitality. Hundreds of people are fed daily by a community kitchen adjacent to the protest venue. Over 20 people, many of them women, cook the food. Variety rice is served to all, from 1 p.m. till six in the evening. The villagers contribute rice and vegetables voluntarily. We are happy to feed the people who support us. It is our culture. No one should go hungry. We want to ensure that our village is saved, says P. Poomalai, who is busy cutting vegetables in the kitchen. About 15-20 bags of rice are cooked every day by a team of men and women who begin work as early as 6 a.m.On Friday evening, the farmers of Kottaikadu, one of the two villages adjoining Neduvasal, where protests were being held against the hydrocarbon exploration project, called off their stir temporarily. They said the State government had assured them that it would address their two main demands: Complete closure of the well sunk by the ONGC in the village and the restoration of lands to the 11 persons who had given them on lease.A village transformedThe most striking feature of the landscape for anyone approaching Neduvasal is the almost abrupt change in topography  expanses of dry scrub jungles, cashew and eucalyptus groves en route to the village suddenly give way to refreshingly lush green fields of paddy, groundnut, vegetables and coconut groves. Gardens in front of large houses are full of jackfruit, mango and other trees.This is a place where we grow almost everything. Except apples and a few hill-grown vegetables, we grow everything we want, asserts C. Balakrishnan with pride.This indeed is the refrain of the farmers who are agitating against the project. Pudukkottai is normally considered a dry district. But we have toiled over the past 30 years to change it. Using borewells extensively, we have managed to change our landscape. The Cauvery Modernisation Project canal also runs along our village. Today, we raise three crops a year, including paddy, in addition to horticulture and floriculture. You will not find even a single piece of barren land here, says A.S. Thirugnanam, a member of the Save Neduvasal Campaign Committee.Villagers claim that no information has been provided to them on the project so far. They had sought to take some lands on lease a few years ago, saying they were drilling to extract kerosene. How can the ONGC offer our land to a private company without our consent? a villager wondered.The villagers are consumed by apprehensions about the exploration plans of the government  from the depletion of water table depriving them of their livelihood, to the contamination of fields and incursion of sea water in the water table. Some claim that the execution of the project would cause earthquakes and even make the local population more vulnerable to certain diseases.The villages youth believe that the project also involves extraction of methane and shale gas. The project is nothing but an attempt to tap methane, asserts R. Nirmala, a B.Sc. Microbiology student from Karu Nallandarkollai, who had skipped her classes to join the protest. Others see an ulterior motive. Their (the governments) ultimate objective is to mine lignite, claims G. Palanivel (38), who, after finishing a course in catering technology, had worked in Singapore for three years. He had returned recently to help his aged father in agriculture.We have already seen the dangers of the project as the site where the well was sunk has turned barren. Thats why we are protesting, says Sundar Mahesh from Karu Nallandarkollai.The villagers are not willing to buy the explanations of the ONGC or the government. They say it will not affect the environment. But how can they guarantee that? Some say we should make sacrifices for the countrys development. But we dont want to be martyrs. Our land is precious; we will not cede even a cent of land, maintains Mr. Thirugnanam."

Addressing his first election rally for the State polls since Model Code of Conduct came into force, a day after a trader was looted and killed in Meerut, Mr. Modi said, The Samajwadi Party had encouraged the goondaraj in the State. I want to ask from the party which ruled the State why are innocent citizens and innocent traders being killed. Why is it that there is no fear of law among criminals?Promises farmersAddressing the sugarcane farmers, a large votebank in western U.P., Mr. Modi promised that if voted to power in the State, the BJP government will clear all dues of sugarcane farmers within 14 days.While blaming the SP government for being an obstacle in the development of the State, Mr. Modi also alleged that the funds allocated by his government for the development of U.P. was not reaching the State."

Low-quality jaggery from Tamil Nadu marketed as Marayur jaggery is a threat to sugarcane farmers in the region.The government initiative to secure the Geographical Indication (GI) certification for Marayur jaggery has brought cheers to the sugarcane farmers of Marayur whose prospects are affected by the flooding of markets by low-quality jaggery from Tamil Nadu.Marayur jaggery is handmade and is identifiable by its dark brown colour and sweet taste while the fake jaggery is golden brownish in colour and has a salty taste.Farmers complain that the low-quality jaggery from Tamil Nadu is packed at Maryur and branded as Marayur jaggery to get a better price.Poor demandThis results in poor demand for Marayur jaggery, said an office-bearer of the Marayur Hills Agriculture Development Society (MHADS), one of the three recognised agencies of sugarcane farmers. The other two agencies are the Marayur Agriculture Products Company (MAPCO) and Anjunadu Karimp Ulpathaka Samithi.He said artificial colours were added to the Tamil Nadu jaggery to get the dark brown colour to make it appear like Marayur jaggery.The GI certification is given to a produce, product or craft of a specific region as per the agreement of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The GI certification allows no agency other than the recognised ones to use the tag Marayur jaggery.300 productsNearly 300 items from the country have received GI certification under the WTO agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Right (TRIPS). The GI-certified products from the State include Navara Rice, Changalikodan Banana, Pokkali Rice, Malabar Pepper, Vazhakkulam Pineapple, Wayanad Jeerakasala Rice, and Wayanad Gandhakasala Rice.The move to get GI certification for Marayur jaggery received a shot in the arm with the visit of Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar to Marayur recently. He entrusted a team from Kerala Agriculture University(KAU) led by C.R. Elsy, coordinator IPR Cell, with the preparation of the project. The team is scheduledto visit Marayur next week to finalise the project report.Long-standing demandGI tag for Marayur jaggery was a long-standing demand of the farmers of sugarcane, the mainagriculture produce in Marayur.Poor price is forcing farmers in the region to shift to other crops.Marayur jaggery is traditionally made in units attached to the farmland. Market fluctuation and fake produce had resulted in poor market for Marayur jaggery.As per the records available at the Marayur Krishi Bhavan, the area under sugarcane cultivation has been reduced by one third in recent times.The aim is to bring back the Marayur sugarcane fields to their past glory by marketing Marayur jaggery under the brand name."

According to the Ahmad, collection of toll for tractors laden with sugarcane and fining of tractors with sugarcane by the road transport department escalated costs for the farmers.Another farmer from Madhampatty sought Collectors intervention in delivering compensation for the failure of G 9 banana tissue culture plants purchased from a private company. According to frmer Mohan from Madhampatty, he had cultivated an acre with G9 variety tissue culture banana plants purchased from a private agro firm in Hosur. The banana plants that should flower in 9 months and yield fruits in a year, had not flowered even after 17 months, Mohan claimed. Also according to him, the National Banana Research Centre in Tiruchi had tested the sample and had verified that the problem was in the tissue culture itself, he said.Mr.Mohan sought the intervention of the Collector for compensation from the private firm for the loss incurred. Proliferation of poultry farms in Kelamangalam and Shoolagiri was raised by a section of farmers. According to them, sanitation and hygiene around these poultry farms led to breeding of flies that in turn affected the agricultural fields in the vicinity. Farmerssought regulation of existing farms by the pollution control board and denial of permission for new poultry farms around agricultural fields. Drought assessment was also found lacking by few farmers. According to M.G.Velu of Krishnagiri, the fields were not assessed for drought thoroughly and therefore a reassessment of the fields should be carried out by the administration.Presiding over the meeting Collector C.

Palanichamy, President, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, said that the proposal to desilt the Vaigai dam had been kept pending for many years and the government should make use of the prevailing drought situation to carry out the activity.It should act swiftly to desilt the dam before the next monsoon season, during which we hope there will be more inflow to the dam, he said.M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, said that the district administration should also begin desilting and maintenance of all waterbodies and allow farmers to take the desilted soil instead of allowing private vendors to use it.Alleging that Public Works Department (PWD) was not helping farmers in taking the desilted alluvial soil, another farmer from Peraiyur said, We are willing to submit specific documents relating to the vehicle that will be used for transporting the soil and the survey number of the land in which it will be used. PWD should help the farmers, who are already suffering a lot.Responding to the queries, PWD officials said that a detailed project report on desilting the Vaigai dam has already been submitted by WAPCOS Limited, the company which has been engaged for the work, to the State government and it was up to the government to decide now.

There are affordable people who by opting for rice and not sugar card have become eligible for the Pongal gifts. freebies. But, unfortunately, many poor people who opted for sugar card for one reason or another like tea stall or sweet stall owners have become ineligible for no fault of theirs.

ExpressHaving completed 100 days in office, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday released a progress report of his government in the form of a booklet containing brief details of its achievements and plans for the future. In the presence of all his Cabinet ministers, he spoke at length about the governments consistent efforts to fulfill the promises made in the manifesto his party had released prior to the Assembly elections held earlier this year, which it had won by a landslide.The 48-page booklet, titled 100 Din Vishwas ke, contains brief references to the governments take on various issues including law and order, policing, farmers issues including payment of pending sugarcane dues and loan waivers, steps being taken to attract investment, setting up industries to aid employment, infrastructural development as well as Metro rail operation in Lucknow and other cities.The first claim made is zero tolerance on law and order. The booklet mentions Adityanaths directives which include strengthening of police patrolling to stop incidents of theft and dacoity, effective action against crimes, to make police more alert and vigilant so they can fix responsibility at all levels while reviewing law and order.One of the pages in the booklet refers to the government as Aam jan ki sarkar (government of the common man).

The statement came after the division bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Anuja Prabhudessai said that Hazare could not invoke extraordinary jurisdiction of the high court for CBI probe in his allegations, without first using available alternate remedies.The bench has now posted the public interest litigation filed by the 79-year-old activist for further hearing on February 13, after Talekar sought time of one month to pursue alternate remedies.Hazare has sought in-depth probe in the sale and privatisation of 47 CSFs alleging that the scam has been maneuvered by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and his nephew Ajit Pawar. In the PIL filed through advocate Vinod Sangavikar, the social activist has alleged that the cooperative sugar factor scam has engulfed Maharashtra and pushed the state back by at least 50 years by causing loss of over Rs10,000 crore to the state exchequer. He also claimed that the move put the state under a debt of over Rs1 lakh crore.According to the PIL, most of the CSFs  31 of the 47 have been sold by the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank. In 2011, the Reserve Bank of India scrapped the board of directors of the MSC bank, and appointed two administrators. The move came after the bank in 2009-10 reported net loss of Rs 775.98 crore and bad loans of over Rs 500 crore  about 30 % of its total advances, and the net worth of the bank had gone below zero - at minus Rs140 crores.Thereafter, the Commissioner for Cooperation had appointed a senior official to enquire into the affairs of the bank and enquiry officer in his report of January 2014 concluded that the sale of the CSFs was illegal, causing losses of about Rs2,000 crore to the bank. Besides, 77 directors of the bank are facing charges of misappropriating funds to the tune of Rs 1,076 crores, stated the PIL.Anna has alleged that all the strings were pulled by Shri Sharad Pawar, who was holding the portfolio of the Union agricultural minister at Centre at the relevant time and also the ex-officio chairman of Vasantdada Sugar Institute. His PIL further alleges that most of the sugar factories have been sold to the associates of Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar, the then deputy chief minister, has purportedly played a role in his capacity as the then chairman of Pune District Central Cooperative Bank and as director of the MSC bank.Read more: Sugar scam: Sharad Pawar to file suit against Anna Hazare"

He is restricted to the hospital ward and officers are visiting him every two hours to find out how he is doing. He has also been isolated from the rest of the inmates. This more or less sums up a day -- every day -- now in the life of Rose Valley chairman Gautam Kundu, who is behind the bars at Presidency jail.He has been in jail since March 2015, but has never been put under such security.Kundu is at the centre of a scam that is being investigated by CBI and ED. It has witnessed heightened activity and has shot to the headlines especially after December 30 when Trinamool MP Tapas Pal was arrested and January 3 when the same partys leader in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay was taken into custody by CBI.The quantum of funds involved in the Rose Valley scam is more than Rs 15,000 crore and some estimates put it at Rs 17,000 crore, a figure six times more than the Rs 2,500 crore figure of Saradha scam.Jail authorities fear that Kundu, who is the sole owner of that chit fund empire, may face attacks by a section of inmates who are pro-Trinamool Congress. The heightened security arrangements were put in place on January 3 when Bandopadhyay was arrested by CBI triggering widespread protests by his party and angry reaction by the chief minister.Kundu took over the reins of the group after his elder brother Kajal, who, along with his wife and son, were killed in an accident on their way to Guwahati from Agartala in 2003. Kajal Kundu established the company is 1997 after selling insurance products for more than a decade.Gautam Kundu is lodged in the jails hospital ward. Two warders are keeping a watch over him 24 hours a day. Jail officers visit him every two hours. No one apart from doctors, male nurses and jail officials are allowed to enter the hospital ward, said a senior jail department official.Every two hours, a senior jail officer visits him and talks to him in the ward to make sure everything is under control.There is a chance that a section of inmates who are outraged by the arrest of the ruling party MPs may attack Kundu. This level of security has not even been provided even to American Center attack mastermind Aftab Ansari and IS operative Muhammed Mussa who are lodged in Alipore central jail, said an officer.Kundu is suffering from a severe case of piles, apart from high blood pressure and sugar. He has been in the hospital ward of the jail for a long time.The jail authorities have decided to appeal to a medical board at SSKM for help. Doctors will be asked to visit the jail to check him instead of sending him to the hospital. Significantly, former minister Madan Mitra, who was in jail for his involvement in the Saradha scam, spent several months at a SSKM cabin.Jail sources said Kundu expressed surprise after the arrest of the Trinamool Congress MPs. He has also said that the leaders of various political parties were equally close to him. A section of his employees has allegedly usurped substantial amounts of money after an investigation was launched against the chit fund.The jail authorities have also asked Kundu not to move out of the hospital ward. Now, Kundu spends time staring at the flat screen television set in the hospital, apart from reading newspapers. Sometimes, he prays before a statue of a goddess kept in one corner of the ward.He (Kundu) keeps mostly to himself but is watching television a lot after the arrest of the Trinamool Congress MPs. The only time he gets out of the ward is to make calls from the telephone booth inside the jail premises. The two warders follow him wherever he goes, said an officer of Presidency jail.In keeping with procedures, Kundu can call three numbers  among them are his lawyer and relatives. Sources said he communicates regularly with them.He follows a strict diet, prescribed by doctors, which includes chapatis, vegetables, fruits and egg white. Given his love of bright colours, he still wears colouful shirts and track pants in the ward."

This year, the police have arrested 667 people in 542 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for drug peddling and smuggling, an official data said.The drug menace is a bigger challenge than terrorism. When I joined, I had announced an all out war against drugs and the people running it, the director general of police (DGP) told PTI. The officer said that the police alone cannot fight the menace and there was a concern about narco-terrorism.There are a lot of drugs and narcotics being pumped into J-K from across the border. It is very clear who is pumping drugs and narcotics into this state, he said without naming Pakistan.I am trying to convince everybody, including the police force, about the bad affects. It (drugs) has the potential to destroy the society. We have made huge seizures, but there is difficulty on the legal and de-addiction fronts, the DGP said.It may be recalled that 70 kg of heroin was recovered in Uri and 20 kg in Jammu. Roughly 100 kg recovered here came from across (the border), he said, adding that everybody needs to make efforts to save the current and future generations from this menace.Of the 667 people arrested in 542 cases, 214 were arrested in 163 cases in the Kashmir region and 453 in 379 cases in the Jammu province, the data said.The data said that as many as 12 alleged drug peddlers were arrested under the Public Safety Act (PSA) in Jammu and Kashmir this year as compared to 27 in 2016.It said that as many as 822 people were arrested in 608 cases of drug peddling and narcotic smuggling in 2016, and this year 568.94 kg of marijuana was seized, five times more than the seizure made during this period last year in the Jammu region.In 2015, 24.3 kg of cannabis was seized and 107 kg in 2016. In the case of poppy straw, this year 5,610 kg was seized against 3,268 kg in 2016 and 1,846 kg in 2015, it said. There was a significant drop in the amount of brown sugar seized.Last year, 13.1 kg of the contraband was seized against 1.306 kg this year. In 2015, the police had seized 4.4 kg of brown sugar, the data said.Till August 2017, 39.315 kg of heroin was seized against 64.143 kg in 2016 and 14.953 kg in 2015 in the same period, it said.

Still High,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dry-still-highkallu-or-toddy-tadimahuakinnauri-195757?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-24,"Sonia SarkarBREWCREW: A Muria Gond tribal woman of central India prepares liquor from mahua (AFP)For tipplers in India, these are no happy hours. Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."

But we have a huge flow of devotees every day, and keeping everyone informed about the new norms is difficult,"" he said.However, many religious bodies in Ujjain, home to 13 influential akharas (religious orders), are resisting the restrictions.It had all started with a citizen's body, the Ujjain Vidwat Parishad, petitioning the apex court saying the Shivalingam was shrinking because of excessive pouring of bhang (a beverage made from cannabis) on it - a ritual different from the jalabhishek. The parishad also questioned the practice of rubbing sugar powder on the idol.On August 25, the court formed the expert committee, which included officials from the Archaeological Survey of India and the Geological Survey of India.The committee did not find any corrosion from the bhang but still suggested the beverage be replaced with panchamrit - a mixture of milk, curd, honey, sugar and ghee - with a devotee allowed to pour only 1.25 litres of it.It further suggested the use of reverse-osmosis-purified water for the jalabhishek, limiting the volume to half a litre per devotee, and sought exhaust fans inside the sanctum sanctorum.Manch convener Dinesh Shrivastava told The Telegraph the temple authorities were imposing ""arbitrary norms"" and spreading ""wrong information"" that the idol was shrinking.Last week, Manch activists had brought in five urns filled with water from five rivers - the Ganga, Narmada, Kshipra, Kalisindh and the Gambhir - and performed the jalabhishek while police and temple staff made feeble attempts to stop them.In November, the temple had put up boards saying these norms had been enforced under Supreme Court orders. But the bench of Justices Arun Mishra and M.M. Shantanagoudar directed removal of the boards, saying the court had merely endorsed the panel's suggestions and forwarded them."

Growers in this region will get Rs 200 above the fair and remunerative price (FRP) as the first installment payment of cane.Disagreement about the first installment payment between the millers and the growers had led to an impasse at the start of the crushing season. While millers had insisted on payment of the FRP as the first installment, growers, led by the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, had asked for Rs 3,400 per tonne as the payment.Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti had asked for a higher payment which millers said they would be unable to pay. In view of the impasse, the majority of sugar mills in the cane rich Sangli and Kolhapur region had deaccelerated their crushing as Sanghatana members had disrupted harvest and transport of cane. The crushing season 2017-18 had started from November 1 but only 16 mills had started their operations.On November 2, a meeting chaired by state cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh had failed to resolve the impasse. In view of the stalemate, the guardian minister of Kolhapur and states revenue minister Chandrakant Patil had held another round of meetings between the millers of the district and the Sanghatana. In the meeting, it was decided that the first installment payment for the season would be Rs 200 above the FRP. Shetti, speaking about decision, said the first Rs 100 of the amount would be paid along with FRP within a fortnight of cane harvest while the remaining amount would be paid two months into the season.In view of the increased FRP this year, the farmers actual realisation would be Rs 325 per tonne more than last years, said Shetti. The average sugar recovery (sugar produced versus cane crushed expressed as a percentage) in Sangli and Kolhapur region being 12.50 per cent, growers are expected to be paid any amount between Rs 2,600 and Rs 3,200 per tonne of cane crushed. In Kolhapur district, the highest FRP is expected to be Rs 3,250 per tonne with a recovery of more than 13 per cent.Sugar prices in the last one year have hovered between Rs 35 and Rs 36 per kg  and should remain there, millers say, for them to be able to pay the increased FRP. Prices, say analysts, might remain in this range or might see a slight depreciation as the season progresses.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b298fd29855b711f570c4df,An interlocutor’s doomed mission,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jammu-and-kashmir-interlocutor-dineshwar-sharmas-doomed-mission-4990466/,2017-12-20,"Dineshwar Sharma (File) Dineshwar Sharma (File)The Government of Indias special representative Dineshwar Sharmas close-door interactions with individuals, groups and organisations in Jammu and Kashmir are certainly not an icebreaker, a prelude to some bigger and more serious political initiative for resolving the dispute. What, then, is the purpose of his mission?So far, he appears to be surveying the results of the BJP-led governments iron-fisted policies on Kashmir. Previous such initiatives would be rolled out in sugar-coated rhetoric and to the accompaniment of visits by all-party delegations and confidence building measures. Even if those initiatives were no more than time-buying exercises, the mood used to be conciliatory.In contrast, what preceded Sharmas appointment and what is happening on the ground currently is perfectly in line with what has come to be known as the Doval Doctrine, which posits that under no circumstance should the state be seen as yielding, either tangibly or symbolically.What preceded Sharmas arrival was the army chief, Biping Rawat, warning civilians of stern action if they persisted in disrupting anti-militancy operations. Civilians have not stopped coming in between militants and government forces during encounters. Many have been shot dead and injured after Rawats warning. Also, major figures in the first and second-rung separatist leadership have been arrested in the crackdown by the National Investigation Agency. Ahead of no earlier engagement did New Delhi imprison those who have been named stakeholders in the Agenda for Alliance worked out by the PDP and BJP in the state in 2015. But Sharma ruled out the release of political prisoners during his second visit to the state last month.Throughout his two trips to the Valley, there was no cessation of the cordon-and-search operations, which locals perceive is a euphemism for collective punishment. In military terms, what we have currently is the softening of the target and area domination, meaning subduing the other to an extent that one can dictate terms to it. In the wake of last years protests that spanned several months, as many as 1,100 youths have one or both their eyes impaired. About a thousand protesters and separatist activists are in jail even after the release of more than the 8,400 others who had been arrested during last years protests. A new law criminalising damage of property during protests that makes dissent even more difficult has been enacted.Prime Minister Narendra Modi further truncated Sharmas mission, even before his first trip, by likening P. Chidambarams call for the restoration of J&Ks autonomy to an insult to the martyrs.Perceived to be Indias only assets in J&K, Kashmiri mainstream politicians too have been marginalised, so much so that they seem to be useless in effecting any change. Earlier, the National Conference (NC) and PDP would position themselves as facilitators, if not the drivers, of any dialogue. This time, apart from obligatory courtesies and welcome statements, they exuded no hope.The BJP has kept its alliance partner, the PDP on a tight leash. On a wider plane, the Sangh has kept the PDP in a permanent state of anxiousness by mounting an assault on whatever is left of the autonomous character of the state through its affiliates. Chief minister Mehbooba Mufti had to warn New Delhi that no one will hoist the tricolour in Kashmir if the Article 35(A) or the Article 370 are abrogated.During a discussion at The Indian Express Adda, Mehbooba pleaded for the return of power projects J&K calls its own from the NHPC. The government of India has repeatedly turned down the demand. Recently, the home ministry directed the state government to withdraw cases against first-time stone throwers, a measure apparently meant to provide Sharmas endeavour a patina of rapprochement. But an embarrassed Mehbooba hurried to say that her government had planned to actually roll out the amnesty for stone-throwers in May last year. She was not even allowed to take credit for it.Now, for international consumption probably, Sharmas foray can be sold as some form of political engagement in a conflict region, emulating the Congresss history of such elaborate exercises in futility.To understand the legitimate aspirations of people in Jammu and Kashmir was how Home Minister Rajnath Singh spelt out the purpose of Sharmas brief when he announced his appointment. History has made it abundantly clear that only New Delhi can define what a legitimate aspiration is, depending upon the situation. Thus the demand by the highest elected official in the state for power projects is fit for the purgatory.Noted existentialist psychiatrist, R.D. Laing, once listed the ways in which a person can drive another crazy. One way is to expose a person simultaneously to stimulation and frustration. Something similar is being tried in Kashmir. The prime minister, in a rare moment of softening, said Kashmiris need embrace, not bullets. Recently, government forces pumped hundreds of pellets into the belly of a 16-year-old boy, damaging his internal organs. While the army has been sponsoring cricket tournaments, a few days ago, it also carried out a survey of the houses, marking them with numbers, a practice that has evoked sharp public criticism in the past. Sharmas mission, therefore, inspires no hope.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

State Congress president Shantaram Naik said if Karnataka was allowed 7.56 TMC ft of water from the Mhadei basin, there would be a severe impact on River Mandovi.Why do you need talks with Karnataka if our stand that Goa is opposed to give any water to Karnataka is consistent? Naik said. The agreement may appear to be an interim compromise but in reality, Parrikar is going to sign a final compromise agreement to the detriment of Goas interest.Curtorim legislator Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco warned that if the state government agreed to Karnatakas demand to divert water from the Mhadei basin, the Congress would launch an agitation.Goa does not have sufficient water, Lourenco said. We are not taking this lightly. We will hit the roads because this (Mhadei) is a lifeline of Goa.The MLA alleged that Karnataka was already preparing to divert water from Dudhsagar waterfall by constructing four dams on the River Khandepar. Lourenco also said the committee of experts appointed by Goa to study the Mhadei issue had said River Mhadei had a water deficit basin and that no scope for diversion of water existed.Contradicting Karnatakas claim that water was needed for drinking purposes, Lourenco said, The only reason for Manohar Parrikar to take an anti-Goan decision on Mhadeis water is to win the 2019 elections by all deceptive means.The Congress has claimed that Karnataka wanted the water for irrigation purposes for the Hubballi-Dharwad region, where sugarcane farming is popular."

Movement towards healthy food habits is common among many. One food item - soft drinks - that was lacking natural alternatives till now, has got a counterpart with a recent government order.In the GO, the state government has framed rules for tapping Neera from coconut trees. The drink, which was dubbed as non-alcoholic natural health drink, could be made by coconut producers after getting a licence from the district administration.The GO dated on December 21, which was released by prohibition and excise department, has ordered the farmers to use anti-fermentation technology to stop the fermentation of the drink. The technology should be developed or patented either by the Coconut Development Board or by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research ICAR ).Farmers from Pollachi have welcomed the move. We can produce Neera and value-added products like coconut sugar and coconut honey. This would provide employment opportunities for many people, said Dhanapal Muthusamy , director of Anaimalais coconut producers company limited. He recently set up a Rs 1.5 crore Neera processing unit at his farmland near Anaimalai.The licence shall be given to coconut producers company or the farmers cooperative society. The licence should be produced on demand before government officials.The inspecting officer could take samples of the drink to chemical analysis to ensure that they were fit for human consumption and did not contain any alcohol.The licence would be given to some trees only.

Political observers have said it is a major shot in the arm of SP which had no strong farmer face in the Jat-dominated Bijnor constituency.RK Chaudhary, a founder member of BSP and a former aide of Mayawati , also joined the party. A former minister and two-time MLA from Mohanlalganj, Chaudhary said it's time for all political outfits to come together to give a befitting reply to the BJP in the 2019 elections.Omvesh joined the SP along with a host of leaders, including former MP Rama Shanker Bhargawa.On the occasion, RK Chaudhary also announced the merger of his political outfit BS4 (Bahujan Samaj Swabhiman Sangharsh Samiti) with the SP. Welcoming Chaudhary and Swami Omvesh, who was earlier with the Rashtriya Lok Dal and is an influential leader among farmers of west UP, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said such political alignments can effectively counter the prevailing politics of dividing people on the basis of religion, caste and creed.""Such associations will go a long way in uniting people from all walks of life to push forward a socialist agenda"", Akhilesh said.""A similar situation had emerged in early 1990s which saw then SP president Mulayam Singh Yadav and BSP chief Kanshiram come together and a slogan was coined: ""Mile Mulayam-Kanshiram, hawa ho gaye Jai Sri Ram (Mulayam and Kanshiram have joined hands to counter BJP)"", Chaudhary, a Kanshiram loyalist, said at a news conference at the SP headquarters here.Swami Omvesh started his political from Bijnor as BKU leader and has always known to be a strong farmer leader. He contested his first poll as an independent candidate from Chandpur seat and won it. Later, he joined RLD and again won Chandpur seat in 2002 and became the state minister for sugarcane. In 2014, he quit RLD during the Lok Sabha Swami Omvesh, said to be very close to Swami Ramdev , joined Kisan Majdoor Party after he could get a BJP ticket in the 2014 Lok Sabha or 2017 assembly polls.Chaudhary had left the Bahujan Samaj Party in June 2016 after accusing Mayawati of running the party as her ""own private real estate company"". His association with the BSP goes back to 1981 when he founded the BS4 - a prototype of Kanshiram's Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS4). He was considered as the face of Pasi community in the BSP, a key votebank of the party. Mayawati had sacked Chaudhary in 2001 but re-inducted him in 2013 before he finally left the party in 2016."

After all, whats Christmas without these signature Anglo-Indian delicacies! That said, theres an open secret not many talk about so openly  everyone loves their Christmas goodies, but not everyone today has the time or the know-how to make them. Thats true. Just one generation ago, the house used to be filled with the aroma of Christmas cooking right from the first Sunday of December. We were a home full of children. If one of us got busy with picking, peeling and cutting up guavas for the guava cheese, another used to be responsible for stirring ginger and pineapple wine jars. Everything from rose cookies and kulkuls to salt-cured meat for Christmas breakfast was made at home, says Gladys, a retired teacher, nostalgically.But not anymore. Today, my nieces dont even know what goes into making these age-old delicacies. Even if they did, where is the time? All the boys and girls are busy working right up to the eve of Christmas, adds Gladys.What Gladys says holds true for almost all the young Anglo Indians of the Twin Cities. And yet, remarkably, on Christmas day you will find that no Xmas table is bereft of all the above delicacies that have been the mark of the communitys celebrations over the ages. But pray tell us how? We call this our lil Christmas miracle, says Sabrina Rao, a biotech professional and mum of two, chuckling. Yes, I want my boys to have all the Xmas goodies I grew up eating and nope, I havent learned how to make a single one of them, unfortunately. But thats the beauty of this beautiful community of ours, you see. We have all these uncles and aunties whove perfected their family recipes for years, and now bring them to youngsters like us who are hard-pressed for time. They are the real Santas for us grown-ups, adds Sabrina, as she rattles off the names of a long list of goodies she procured from Anglo home bakers from Lallaguda, Mettuguda and Mudfort.To get a real idea of why the likes of Sabrina are so indebted to these small-time bakers of the community, one only has to step in to the tiny eatery run by Jacqueline Nicholas in Secunderabad. The aroma of cakes and bakes, the cheerful Xmas decor and the happy clients who pop in and out chiming Merry Christmas gives you the festive feel right away. Oh! this year we took orders for over 50 kilos of rich fruit plum cakes! even now people are turning up, but sadly, I have to turn them down... there is already a lot to deliver and Christmas is just round the corner, says Jacqueline, as she sees off a client, who heads out with a smile, carrying bags laden with goodies.Christmas is Christmas for many like us because of a handful like auntie Jackie, auntie Victoria and all, who have decided to take Anglo Indian cuisine to many a tastebuds, both within the community and to others like Parsis, Malayalis or anyone else who wants to bite into something Christmassy. None of these delicacies are readily available in commercial bakeries or eateries, so their contribution is commendable, says Christina DSouza, an NRI who looks forward to gorging on these delicacies at home in Hyderabad during the holiday season.Orders start pouring in months in advance, says Victoria, adding, This year the kids wanted mince pies, kulkuls, diamond cuts and more.For decades, Johns Bakery in Abids was the place where everyone flocked to for quality cakes and Xmas bakes. Its a childhood memory we can never forget. Uncle Johns is a name that resonates with many anglo families even today. but since they shut shop about 10 years ago, there has been a void, points out Jacqueline, adding, Among anglo-Indian families with older folks, these things (goodies) are not a huge deal as we still make stuff for our own consumption. its only when some from younger generation cant make them, that they seek our help.So whats on the menu? Guava cheese, which is a fermented jelly made of guava juice, is a speciality because its winter and guavas are abundant in the market. Ginger pop, which is a sugary concoction, has also become an Xmas season staple over the years as it helps heal the cracking throats from the cold and all the carol singing. Ginger pop is a must after the midnight mass, because you end up eating so many sweets at home, so the tangy ginger pop helps wash it down and you can make space for more, says Larry Hatch, from Abids.A surprising addition to the list of Xmas goodies are the savouries which are being ordered in large numbers. Meatloaf and shepherds pie are a hit this year. They can be priced economically, so they dont pinch the pockets either. Going for the traditional christmas day delicacies like chicken roast or turkey roast can throw prices off the roof, so not a lot of customers prefer the same, adds Jacqueline. If all the traditional Anglo yummies werent enough, the home bakers also have popular Telugu savouries with an anglo-Indian makeover. So while murkus have become jeera straws, the cheeslings are fashioned as Cheese Straws. And as long as they are up for sale, no ones complaining!"

Onlookers said her relatives pleaded with the protesters and police to make way for the ambulance, but none could help them. The 65-year-old died in the ambulance even as the RJD denied that the bandh led to the womans death.Another ambulance carrying one of the men injured in the sugar mill blast at Gopalganj was also stuck in the snarl on the Gandhi setu. However, police managed to clear the jam for it.Meanwhile, reports of another death due to road blockade at Katihar also came, but the Katihar police denied it.Protests were organised all across the state, including Patna, Gaya, Ara, Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Nawada. The bandh supporters also stopped trains at a number of places, including Sheikhpura, Darbhanga and Forbesganj.The RJD agitators took to the streets as early as 6am in the party-dominated areas like Maner, which has become the epicentre of anti-sand mining policy protests. The protesters led by Maner MLA Bhai Virendra blocked the NH-30 by burning tyres in the middle of the road. The state and national highways were blocked at several other places as well.The RJD workers forcefully closed shops and did not allow plying of buses in many cities. They also smashed window panes of cars and damaged many two-wheelers at Bhagalpur. Minor clashes between RJD and NDA workers were reported from Munger town.RJD chief Lalu Prasads son and leader of opposition in assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav and party functionaries, including vice-president Raghvansh Prasad Singh and Bihar unit president Ram Chandra Purbey, led a march and courted arrest near the Dak Bungalow crossing in Patna.Tej Pratap had come to the crossing on a tractor, while other party leaders marched on foot from the RJD state HQ on Beer Chand Patel Path. They were taken to the Kotwali police station from where they were released after competing formalities.The bandh was successful as not only RJD workers but common people also participated in it. The RJD has always fought for the cause of the poor and it will continue to do so in future as well, Tejashwi said after being released.The RJD had called the bandh, alleging the state governments new sand mining policy has crippled the construction sector and rendered thousands of workers unemployed.The JD (U), on the other hand, said the bandh was called to defame Bihar in front of thousands of Sikh devotees, who were coming to Patna City to participate in the concluding ceremony of.350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh. There was no need for the bandh after the state governments decision on Wednesday to allow sand mining as per the old policy, JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said"

But climate conditions are conducive to pest attacks in these crops and farmers have to keep a close vigil on them.The pesticides have to be used if the attack exceeds beyond economic damage to crops and organic pesticides like panjakavya, neem cakes, neem oil are more advisable. Light emitting traps could be used in the fields and one trap per acre has been found beneficial. The flies laying eggs in crops are attracted to light and light traps help in minimizing pest attack, officials said.In case farmers decide to opt for chemical pesticides, they should seek the guidance of local agriculture department officials and use low-intensity pesticides. Right dosage and the right amount should be sprayed and spraying hours should be limited to 10 am and after 4 pm in the evening. The pesticides should be well diluted as per the advised limit and people involved in spraying should wear all safety gear.Spraying should be done in the direction of the wind. Excessive spraying of pesticides at a single time, 10 tanks for power sprayer and 16 tanks for hand-sprayer, will result in a serious health hazard. Spurious pesticides should be avoided and person spraying chemical pesticides should keep a limit of 2 acres per day, the authorities warned.Madurai Collector, K Veera Raghava Rao urged the farming community to follow all safety norms while dealing with chemical pesticides to fight pest attack and safeguard the health of people around."

Several textile, dyeing, cement and chemical industries located along the river course discharge tonnes of harmful effluents.The presence of major ions such as sodium and chlorine was much higher in the Cauvery, particularly near industrial areas, coast and confluence of tributaries, compared to the other rivers studied, said L Elango, professor of geology who headed the study.High levels of sodium can cause hypertension and reproductive toxicity in humans. Researchers attribute this to (human) activities such as discharge of industrial effuents, letting out of sewage and agricultural activities along the 800km course of the river, from Thalacauvery in Karnatakas Kodagu to Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu where it empties into the Bay of Bengal TheBureau of Indian Standards(BIS) has set500 mg per litre as the desirable limitfor TDS in drinking water, but TDS of groundwater in most the sampling locations exceeded this limit due to longer residencetime, says thestudy.The values of pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were high near the coast, particularly in Poompuhar, making the river water and groundwater there unfitfor consumption.While high pH in water can cause eye and skin irritation, higher values of EC could reduce aesthetic appearance of water and is also insensitive to infants and heart patients, say researchers referring to a 2003 World Health Organisation (WHO) report.Magnesium Hazard (MH) values of groundwater range between 9 and 71, and for river water, it ranges from 13.20 to 74.29. MH values greater than 50 are harmful for irrigation, Ilango added.On the positive side, the total hardness for most of the river and groundwater samples, except near Thalacauvery, was below theBIS-permitted600 mg per litre. Water salinity was high in thecoastal region as river water mixedwithsea water.The study, basedon samples collected thrice a year ( monsoon, non-monsoon and intermittent periods) from 2013 to 2016 at 25km intervals, suggested stringent enforcement of effluent discharge norms by industries and townships along the river. The river, which accountsfor about3% of thecountrys total cultivable land, was dry for a large part of this year as the region sufferedone of the worst droughts in the past two decades. Consequently, production of rice, sugarcane (deltaic region) and coffee (upper region) were hit."

With the Doklam crisis slowly receding into the background, traders living along the border in Himachal Pradesh want Indian authorities to start talking to their Chinese counterparts about some rather mundane issues.The Kinnaur Indo-China Trade Association recently submitted a memorandum to the Kinnaur deputy commission-cum-trade authority for Indo-China border trade via Shipki La and demanded a quarantine laboratory at the trade centre at Chupan (Namgia) so that livestock trade can resume.The association also wants Indian authorities to talk to Chinese officials during flag meetings about having a proper mule track from Shipki La Pass to the China trade centre at Shipki village along with provision for water and electricity.In the last four years livestock imports from China have been banned through this route which has severely affected the business of the sturdy Chamurthi horses and Chigu goats  the main attraction of the cross border trade. The animals are in great demand in Kinnaur and other mountainous regions.In 2013, the customs commissionerate had informed the Kinnaur deputy commissioner that livestock import was governed by the Livestock Importation Act, 1898, which restricted import of horses and other equidae to the four international airports  Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai. Since then no horse or goat has been imported through this route. The biggest hitch is the absence of a quarantine station.The Chamurthi breed is in high demand here because it is native to high altitudes and is used extensively as a beast of burden. Besides being popular in Himachal Pradesh, it is also popular in Uttarakhand . Although the government has a breeding centre in Spiti valley, the demand is so high that the animals need to be imported, mainly from Tibet Hishey Negi of the Kinnaur Indo-China Trade Association says, To ensure that trade starts from June 1, we have demanded that the process of trade passes be completed by May 15 every year. We have also requested the authorities to raise the issue of having a proper mule track from Shipki La to the China trade centre.He adds that a demand has also been made to include items like thermos flask, yak tail, religious books, religious Buddhist flag, local ornaments of gold and silver, wooden craft, Thanka paintings in the list of imported goods. They have also demanded to include items like sugar, dals (pulses), Kesar (saffron), butter tea leaf in the list of exported goods.Kinnaur-based social activist, Shanta Kumar Negi, says Chamurthi horses are known for traveling long distances in difficult terrain in altitudes of 5,000 meters above sea level and higher. He said that there is great demand for breed even in the army. But the import restriction is affecting the trade, he says."

You decided to start the office in Parli-Vaijnath. I am a resident of Parli. The labour minister should accompany me and show me where the office is located. He should also provide the names of sugarcane labourers who have been given some benefit by the corporation. He should also tell me the name of the managing director and other officers of the agency, he said.Labour minister Sambhaji Patil-Nilangekar said an office of the corporation existed in Mumbai and the Parli office would be started within a month.Counter attacking Congress and NCP, Nilangekar said many of the leaders of the two parties were owners of sugar mills. This was objected to by many opposition MLCs."

Turning the tables on the opposition, he even called on them to demand such a list under RTI from his government, but they would be unable to provide it, as it didnt exist.The startling revelation came while Fadnavis was replying to the marathon discussion under Rule 293 moved by the opposition benches, which lasted over two days. He also disclosed that many sugar factories had taken loans in the name of farmers, without informing the farmers themselves, by submitting their 7/12 extracts to banks during the UPAs loan waiver.Citing Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report, he pointed out that many influential persons from Kolhapur and Satara were granted benefits in the UPAs loan waiver. This included Yuvraj Patil, who received Rs38 lakh, and Vijay Sinh Patil, who received Rs9.11 lakh. I will provide the list of farmers being given benefit by our government, unlike yours, he taunted.When Jayant Patil pointed out that many of these beneficiaries didnt receive the money, after objections were raised and cases were pending in the Supreme and high courts, the CM asked where all this money had gone, and hinted at a bigger scam here. We will inquire into this bungling. Our government has learnt from your mistakes, he said.While admitting blunders in depositing loan waiver amount into accounts of non-beneficiaries, including MLAs, he passed the buck to banks, for having sent wrong names to the government. Its true that the amount was deposited in the account of MLA Prakash Abitkar, but it was the banks fault since original beneficiary was Prakash Sutar. We received about 37 applications with Abitkar surname, of which one had initials of Prakash. Similar thing happened with Vasant More, where original beneficiary was Latabai Patil.Blaming the banks for the mess, Fadnavis said the government had already inked a pact with them for data validation of beneficiaries, and they would be completely responsible for any error. We havent provided our data of farmers to them. We asked them to prepare their own list after validating it. We then matched it with direct applications invited from farmers. We initially received over 1.03 crore applications. After biometric tests and removing duplication, about 77 lakh accounts were found to be genuine. After subtracting ineligible beneficiaries as per our new norms, weve decided to deposit money into accounts of about 67 lakh farmers.Earlier, the CM added to his figures of loan waiver, which he had announced last week while replying to discussion on the same subject and on the same motion but moved by the treasury benches.He said about 48 lakh accounts had been cleared till Wednesday out of 67 lakh applications received from farmers. Of them, 34 lakh were loan accounts while 14 lakh were of those provided incentives for timely repayment of loans. Cumulatively, an amount of Rs23,300 crore has been disbursed so far. Since last week, weve cleared 4.72 lakh more accounts and approved Rs2,578 crore payment under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana and daily updation is underway. There would be no discrimination between farmers, whether backing BJP or NCP.NCP leader Ajit Pawar demanded action against sugar mills owners for duping farmers, and even bank officials. On Hasan Mushrifs query, Fadnavis said the banks were told to close those accounts and not to levy any interest.Meet of MLAs from drought hit areas todayAgriculture minister Pandurang Phundkar announced that a meeting of MLAs from drought-hit areas of Vidarbha would be convened on Thursday at 4pm. After receiving inputs from them, we will consult with the CM and take a decision to benefit rice and cotton growers, whose crops were destroyed due to incessant rains or bollworm and aphid attack.Even the CM endorsed him, saying that the government would announce a package before the end of the winter session on Friday."

And then there are songs of food. Of how much ghee you should pour into a dish, or the elaborate buffet of sweet and savoury dishes that were given to Shiva and Parvati to celebrate their union.And it is food that comes to the fore in the workshops and panel discussion being hosted by Rakesh Raghunathan this week to celebrate the December season of food and music. The TV show host and culinary enthusiast, who curates food tours through his company, Puliyogare Travels, plans to recite poems and stories that talk about the connect between food and Margazhi.In the songs of Andal that are sung during the Margazhi season, in terms of food, there is one that stands out for me, says Raghunathan. It talks about how one must put lots of ghee, till your fist or elbow is submerged in it, into the food you are preparing, says Raghunathan, who adds that there is mention of dishes like akkara adisal or sweet pongal in classical songs of yore.In another talk at Amethyst, Raghunathan will be in discussion with singer Sudha Raghunathan on her foodmusic connect. On a personal note, I am always singing or humming tunes when I cook because I find that it keeps me calm as well as keeps up the tempo in the kitchen, she says, adding that there are several songs that are themed on food. The song Bhojanam seyya vaarungal, for instance, is traditionally sung at weddings, she adds.Pradeep Chakravarthy , a behaviourist who conducts heritage tours, says references to food can be found in dancedramas dating to the Maratha period. There were two dance-dramas Shiva Pallaki Prabandham and Vishnu Pallaki Prabandham  that were performed during the reign of Shahaji, one of the Maratha rulers of Thanjavur. They speak of the food served to Shiva and Parvati. The songs describe dishes such as moru kozhambu (gravy made of buttermilk), curd rice and Pongal, and the meal ends with water from the Ganges and vethala pak (betel leaves), says Chakravarthy.In the 9th century, Periyalvar, says Chakravarthy, one of the 12 Alvar saints of south India, mentions the sweet kummayam, one of Krishnas favourite dishes made of rice, green gram, cows ghee, curd, banana and sugar in the verses of Divya Prabhandam.Art is inspired by food and vice-versa, says Raghunathan.

The hillocks in the district is the perfect spot for the wild cats to laze around, But with indiscriminate stone quarrying many of them are being driven out of their habitat thus forcing them to stray into sugarcane fields and on the fringes of villages.Senior forest officers say that most cases of leopards straying into human habitat were reported in Pandavapura and KR Pete taluks where stone mining activities are rampant. As many as 20 leopards entered villages and killed livestock and in many cases injured people in and around Baby Betta, Kunti Betta, Melukote and Hulikere semi-forest areas. The hillocks where stone mining is rampant happens to be the natural habitat of the big cats. The presence of humans, drilling, use of explosives and other methods at quarrying sites force these elusive animals to enter villages in search of easy prey, said a forest officer on condition of anonymity.Most illegal stone quarries are in and around Baby Hill Kaval deemed forest area. After pressure from villagers and a protracted legal battle launched by RTI activist Kallahalli Ravindra against illegal mining in Baby Hill Kaval forest areas, the district administration imposed prohibitory orders banning mining.Forests areas including Baby Hill are the ideal habitat for leopards given their love for the rocky terrain and semi-forest landscape. Most leopards have now disappeared from this area, say foresters.The straying of these animals has meant more villagers are being attacked especially when they are working in fields.explosives extensively damaging the environment including wildlife.

He continuously rolled the matchsticks on the chapathi slab to collect inflammable powder from the matchheads and then tightly packed it into an elbow pipe filled with rusted iron nails (which would become the shrapnel). And this is how he rigged up the Improvised Explosive Device (IED), with nail polish-filled Christmas lights, to announce the arrival of Daesh ()-inspired lone-wolf attack on Indian soil.On December 28, 2014 at 8.30 pm, Afridis IED exploded with a loud bang on Church Street, killing(37), who was out on a Sunday evening stroll with her family. He managed to slip out of the city and cool off in Mumbai, but his luck soon ran out and thefinally arrested him in January 2016, but only after he committed arson on theon MG Road.On Monday, Afridi will start facing the legal consequences of his actions with the trial in the Church Street blast case commencing at the Special NIA court here. Charges were framed against him in custody in September 2017 and with P Prasanna Kumar appointed as the special public prosecutor about three months back, the state is set to try him for his crime.A Gujarat riot victimAfridi hails from Juhapura in Ahmedabad and is a survivor of the 2002 Gujarat riots. He faces as many as 35 terror cases in Gujarat for his involvement in the 2008 Ahmedabad and Surat serial blasts. He reportedly was an active member of the SIMI. In two cases registered in Odhav police station there, Afridi is charged as the bicycle bomb planter at two of the 14 spots of the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts.Sources told BM that Afridi crossed onto the dark side to avenge the Gujarat riots but later started harbouring a deep-rooted hatred towards Israel, claiming it was the reason for the global hatred against his community. He drifted out of Gujarat and was on the run under multiple guises as a lorry mechanic and salesman at a sweet shop in Haryana.During his stint as a lorry mechanic, he made friends with interstate drivers and one of them suggested he move to Bengaluru sometime before 2010, said a source involved in the case.After arriving in Bengaluru in 2010, Afridi assumed the identity of Mohammed Rafiq and managed to get ID cards and bank account in that name.He joined as an apprentice to an AC mechanic near BTM Layout. He also got married in the city and managed to take a house on rent. He started taking independent Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) of air conditioners in various commercial buildings in the city.According to the NIA probe, Afridi started watching anti-Israel videos online. He also reportedly participated in some of pro-Palestine and anti-Israel protests in the city and had extremist literature in this regard in his possession. He committed arson twice at the Israeli Visa centre here on MG Road on August 5, 2014 and November 29, 2015.The NIA chargesheet also says that he had conducted a recce of the Jewish synagogue in Kochi and wanted to execute a strike there but was caught before that.In July 2014, Afridi came in touch with a Facebook user under the profile name Abdul Khan. After months of online chatting, Khan told Afridi that an Israeli delegation would be at Hotel Coconut Grove on Church Street on December 28.Afridi wanted to target the Israeli nationals and so decided to plant the bomb, the source said.The bomb makerAccording to the charges levelled against Afridi, the NIA has stated that Abdul Khan forwarded a password-protected online link for a crude IED assembling manual on December 16, 2014. Afridi had exactly 12 days to get his bomb assembled and he bought an elbow-shaped iron pipe with 2.5 inch inner diameter and 5 mm thickness from a scrap junk shop in Bommanahalli. He bought two couplings for it from a hardware store in Madiwala. He also bought 1 inch nails, battery, a small analog table clock, 250 gram sugar, a set of Chinese decoration lights and hundreds of matchboxes and set to work. He started rolling the match sticks on the Chapathi belan to collect the flammable chemical which was to be tightly filled inside the iron pipe and then sealed with sugar as a combustion fuel along with nail shrapnels.He took off the outer covering of the decoration bulb and then poured nail polish and then sealed it again as it was to serve as the detonator to initiate combustion of the explosive after its circuit was completed with battery and timer, said sources. The NIA chargesheet states that at least 250 grams of the chemical mixture from matchheads were used in Afridis IED.The lone-wolf attackOn December 28, Afridi had his IED assembled along with the timer unit. He purchased an Andhra Jyothi newspaper to wrap his bomb and headed out on his two-wheeler, which he parked on Mission Road in Shantinagar and reached Church Street on foot at around 5.30 pm. His target was to keep the bomb near Hotel Coconut Grove. He had picked a spot during his recce on December 23.At 7:15 pm, he managed to plant the bomb and made a quick exit from the spot. He took his bike and reached home at 9.00 pm. The next day he went to Nelamangala to sell his bike and then stayed for a couple of days with his friend in BTM Layout, then fled to Mumbai for a couple of days.Suicidal tendenciesThe NIA had informed the court that Afridi tried to ingest stones to kill himself when he was picked up. During his stay as an undertrial at Parappana Agrahara prison, he claimed he was feeling extreme guilt and had suicidal tendencies.Afridi was provided medical help but he stopped taking medicine and started hoarding it to carry out suicide threats. These were heavy dose sedative tablets, sources added. The NIA in its charges has stated that Afridi had 20 sleeping pills in his possession at the prison.The NIA has also named the users of online aliases  Abdul Khan and his aid Ayan Khan Salafi  as the second and third accused in the case. The NIA in April had deported Azam Khan, a Rajasthani based in Saudi Arabia, suspected to be an online recruiter for the Daesh in the sub-continent using the name Ayan Khan Salafi."

""For last one month we have been visiting various schools across the city to spread awareness against excessive consumption of sugar. We have received a good response so far,"" said Dubey.He added, ""Children are more prone to consuming chocolates, ice cream and all kinds of sweet items. Excessive consumption of sugar leads to diabetes, blood pressure and teeth problems, among others. This further affects the kidney, eyes and skin.

(Manob Chowdhary)Ranchi: As night temperatures plummet below 10 degrees in the capital, authorities at state-run Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park in Ormanjhi are pulling out all stops to offer extra warmth to its 1,200-plus wild residents.Heaters, blowers and hay padding in enclosures, special diet, chopping unwanted vegetation to help animals get extra space to bask under the sun, curtains for enclosures to guard winter winds during night are a few measures that have started to beat the chill at the 104-hectare zoo, officials said.Speaking to this reporter on Saturday, zoo vet Ajay Kumar said around 25 blowers/heaters had been installed at strategic enclosures where carnivores such as lions, tigers, leopards, hyenas, jackals and others were lodged.At night, we cover enclosures with curtains of dried grass (pual) and cane as shield against cold winds, said Kumar. For the three elephants, special bonfires are lit every night at a distance. Hippo enclosures have been given sand banks to help them sit under the sun and get heat from the sand too.For other herbivores such as spotted deer, bison, sambar and others, enclosures are padded up with dried grass with the dual purpose of keeping animals warm during night and ensure they can nibble on them if they feel hungry, said Kumar.Diet is also reflecting the weather change as food intake and digestion in animals improves in winter, much like humans. ""Carnivores get extra meat. For instance, against 9kg of meat a day to a tiger, 10kg is given,"" he said. Sugarcane, bananas and gram have been included for elephants, he added. Each has 10kg of sugarcane, 5kg of bananas, 3kg of gram and 150kg of green vegetables.All animals are also offered mahua, jaggery and multivitamins this season.""Foods with high carbohydrate content are being served so that animals can cope with temperature fall. When it gets colder, we will give them hot soups,"" he said.A zoo official maintained the turnout of visitors, specially during weekends, has gone up. For example, last weekend, no less than 50,000 a day turned up at Birsa zoo. This weekend, footfall might increase, zoo authorities expect. ""Though we closed the snake house on November 20 as reptiles went into hibernation, the new aquarium that debuted earlier this year is compensating for the footfall,"" he said.Vet Kumar explained why animal sightings were more in winter. ""Animals tend to bask more under the sun in winter.""Do you have any suggestion for Birsa zoo authorities to keep animals warm? Tell ttkhand@abpmail.com"

I told them mahua can be used to make items other than liquor. They invited me and my team to demonstrate the laddoo and impart training to the tribals of Kutch area which has some 15,000 mahua trees at one place. We prepared laddoos in Jharkhand and launched them on November 10 where Dr Vasava loved them and immediately gave us cheque of Rs 15,000 as advance,"" Kiro, also general secretary of Hodopathy Ethno Medicine Doctors' Association of India (HEDAN), said.Asked about the details of the mahua laddoo, she said each would weigh 20gm and be packed with the goodness of sesame seeds (til), flax seeds (tisi), coconut, cheronjee nut (chiraunji) and others. ""The best part is that no sugar needs to be added as mahua itself is a sweet fruit. Besides being tasty, it will be highly nutritious and cost only Rs 10 apiece.""Anil Goel, a senior scientist at the Lucknow-based National Botanical Research Institute, had already at the November 10 seminar dubbed mahua a paradise tree, calling its fruit rich in vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, calcium and iron.

5b2e01889855b7245313c5d8,There's Room for Everyone: How Mumbai's Chawls Have Been Housing People for 27 Years,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/there-s-room-for-everyone-how-mumbai-s-chawls-have-been-housing-people-for-117-years/story-8CxvzzERjF5xTEpS6pJfpL.html,2017-04-19,"Glen Martis, 45, was worried after his son, Alston, was diagnosed with acute anaemia. He, however, found solace in one thing. He knew if his son ever developed convulsions in his absence, his neighbours at Tambawala Trust building  a chawl at Dongri  would rush to his sons aid, arrange for help and would even wait at any hospital.Martis situation symbolises Mumbais chawl culture  where one floor of a multi-storied building comprises houses in a single row with a common verandah and toilets. Think of a joint family, but one in which its members are not related by blood. All residents, despite their small skirmishes, would celebrate festivals together and lend a helping hand to each other in times of crises.But all this is set to change, as chawls in the city have begun to give way to skyscrapers following government orders. Those who lived in cramped, 100-200-square feet houses for decades are to be shifted to 260-square feet apartments with toiletsFor Martis, it is a tough choice as he is worried whether one can retain the same kind of kinship he enjoys now. But then, with his building in a dilapidated state and the surrounding clamour for big houses, which offer both privacy as well as accommodate a growing family, shifting to a new place is imperative.When it all beganChawls were first built in 1900, when the then British government encouraged many traders to set up textile mills here. These mills needed labour and the workers  mostly from the coastal Konkan region  made a beeline for jobs here. In order to ensure houses for these labourers close to their mills, these dwellings were constructed in 100-200 square-feet areas by mill owners. Taking advantage of this situation, many landlords also constructed chawls as rent was a source of lucrative income for them. As Mumbai grew, the workers then started bringing their families to the city and lived with them in these chawls. The children were sent to municipal schools. Freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak started the Ganeshotsav festival from Keshavji Naik chawl in Girgaum with the whole aim of bringing people together. In the freedom movement, chawls played a vital role with many youngsters jumping into it.Rents in chawls range from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a month. (Illustration by Shrikrishna Patkar)The chawl cultureThese chawls had a large verandah as well as a big ground where children could play. In the night, adults would take a stroll in the compound, which also served as a meeting point for the residents. In these chawls, various festivals like Ganpati, Dahi Handi and Diwali were celebrated with gusto. In case of weddings and functions, as people could not afford halls, a pandal used to be erected at the ground and the whole function used to take place there. In case of a celebration at someones house, all the women in the chawls would come together and cook for the guests. The exchange of commodities like sugar, milk and other eatables is commonplace in these chawls. The chawl culture also played its role in Marathi literature and theatre. The workers theatre also gifted a number of playwrights and actors to Marathi theatre. The chawl culture has been portrayed in the works of several Marathi litterateurs like P L Deshpande. Socialist and leftist parties also got tremendous support from the tenants of these chawls for a few decades since the 1940s and 50s.The story of Mumbais multi-storey chawls Chawls are rows of rooms with a huge verandah in front. A chawl consists of two to four storeys with at least 40 roomsA typical room, popularly called kholi, is a 100-sq ft to 200-sq ft area and comprises a hall and kitchenRents in chawls range from Rs 50 to Rs 200 a monthChawls go back to British rule when traders set up textile mills in Mumbai and hired workersTo house these workers close to textile mills, these humble dwellings were constructedThe textile boom and dipMost chawl dwellers worked in the textile mills. Many of them also managed to get their children jobs in these mills once they grew up. The Shiv Sena, which was started in 1966, was able to attract youths from these chawls. Top leaders like Manohar Joshi, Vithal Chavan, Dattaji Nalawade, Wamanrao Mahadik and Suryakant Desai all trace their origins to these chawls. But, in January 18, 1982, the entire textile sector went on strike, which proved to be a death knell and the strikes direct effect was borne by chawls. As the strike lingered on, many mill workers sold their houses and returned to their villages or went to the distant suburbs. Many unemployed youths began to get attracted to the underworld. Chawls like Dagdi Chawl at Byculla and 144 tenements at Chinchpokli gained notoriety as it became a recruitment place for gangstersAt presentCurrently, chawls pose to be lucrative real-estate for builders. From the governments point of view, chawls offer a great opportunity to offer affordable houses after rehabilitating the existing tenants. The BDD chawls spread across 92.86 acres in prime areas like Lower Parel, Worli, Naigaon and Sewri promises to be a well-designed township with all modern amenities for its residents. Next on the block are the 133 Bombay Improvement Trust (BIT) chawls  located in prime areas such as Mumbai Central, Agripada, Sion, Parel and Mazgaon  another potential goldmine in the space-starved city. Apart from these are the chawls owned by textile mills, which are also set to be redeveloped. The chawls owned by landlords are also on the revamp radar, but now the recession in the real-estate market has slowed down the entire process. For how long the remaining chawls will survive is anybodys guess.What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city?

(HT Photo)According to both, there is a qualitative difference between the way the two countries approach tea -- while its a part of Chinese culture, in India its just another business.The entire value chain from tea planters to growers and traders have a lot to learn from China, both Robertson and Lochan said.The Chinese have blended their culture, history and understanding with scientific research to produce more than 10,000 different tea varieties. India has only few a varieties, said Robertson.Indian producers readily agreed. S K Saria, the MD of Songachi Tea Company that owns four tea gardens in Darjeeling hills and Dooars in North Bengal said, In China and oriental countries, tea is not a commodity but is virtually worshipped and treated as a rare gift of God.Read: Drink tea to heal everything from cough to cavitiesThe Chinese are far better than us in terms of agriculture practices, machinery, processing units and products. There are many lessons to learn for India from China while China has nothing as such to learn from us, said Ashok Kumar, the partner of Goomtee Tea Estate in Darjeeling.The bulk of tea consumed in India is of CTC variety which is boiled with milk and sugar. (HT Photo)In 2004 Rajiv Lochan became the first entrepreneur to introduce Indian tea in China. Chinese tea industry has lots to offer in terms of innovation, entrepreneurship and quality and welfare of the workers to India, he remarked.Lochan, who owns Lochan Tea Limited, told HT, China has more demand for India CTC tea while a miniscule part of the export comprises premium Darjeeling tea.However, according to Lochan, there is one lacunae in the Chinese tea industry and that is the absence of a regulator like the Tea Board of India.Read: Starbucks is brewing tea in India, launches Teavana speciality teasAccording to unofficial figures, in 2016 China imported four million kg of Indian tea, while India imported only a few thousand kgs. India imposes 130% import duty on tea from China, while China imposes only 17% duty on tea from India.Green tea is fast becoming popular in Indian cities due to its therapeutic values. (HT Photo)Traders say the high import duty makes Chinese tea expensive in India and only a small quantity in consumed in big hotels.As Chinese workers are healthy they produce more tea, said Lochan. There is also a yawning gap in earnings. A Chinese tea worker gets Rs 1,000 per day while their counterparts in northern parts of West Bengal gets only Rs 131.50 p per day in addition to fringe benefits like ration, housing and medical treatment.Lochan said that Chinese tea workers do not have to worry about their health as the government takes care of their social and health security. India desperately lacks this, he said.However, Indian black tea (CTC variety) has become a fashion for young Chinese. Lochan, who recently attended a tea exhibition in China as a judge, said, Drinking black tea of different flavours has become a fashion statement for the young Chinese. More than 90% of Indian export to China is black (CTC) tea and hardly 10 percent is Darjeeling orthodox tea.Read: Demonetisation leaves lakhs of tea, jute workers in Bengal, Northeast unpaidRobertson also thinks that Indian factories have a long way to go to produce green tea like Chinese factories do. Incidentally, green tea is fast becoming popular among urban Indians for its therapeutic properties.Tea plantation and production began in India in the nineteenth century. The British began it to break the monopoly of the Chinese in the tea industry. Indians took to drinking tea on a large scale after a marketing campaign by the Tea Board in the 1920s. (HT Photo)Chinese tea growers are serious about replantation of tea bushes after certain intervals. It is an area neglected in India. Most of the bushes are very old and the yield is low, said the US businessman.In 1994 Robertson took tourists from the US to China. He also deals in Chinese tea and sells it throughout the world. Years ago I started to make a documentary on Chinese tea industry. It was supposed to be under one hour, but I could never complete it as the history is too rich and varied and needs to run for hundreds of hours, he told HT.Read: More reasons to love your morning chai. A cup of tea a day can keep dementia awayThough China has always remained number one in the world tea production, Kenya the third largest producer has been dominating the world tea export market. India, the second largest producer, is the third largest exporter.China has numerous tea gardens and none is sure of their number. In 2015 the country produced 2,278 million kg compared to 2,096 million kg in 2014. In the same period India produced 1,209 million kg and 1,207 million kg.China contributed 18% in the world tea export while India contributed 13% in world tea export in 2015."

He said the suspect used to watch the writers show on a popular television channel and keep tab on his movement in India. The official said some of Fatahs activities and statements had been criticised by Muslim groups.The four suspects, however, gradually realised and it was not easy to target the writer so they also prepared an alternative plan to target some more places and persons to show their presence, said the official.Asim Arun, inspector general (IG) of police, ATS, said the writer was one the terror suspects targets but they dropped the idea as they were unable to track his movements.Arun said they later planned to target a Shia worship place in Amrohas Naugawa Saadat. He added that an alert has been sounded in Amroha, Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar after startling revelations made by Mufti alias Faizan (who was arrested from Bijnore) and Zaqwan alias Ehtesham (who was arrested from Narkatiyaganj, Bihar), during rigorous interrogation.Faizan and Ehtesham were on Saturday taken on eight-day remand by ATS sleuths for further quizzing. The two other suspects, Umar and Ghazi Baba (who was arrested from Jalandhar), were produced in the court of special chief judicial magistrate on Monday after being brought to Lucknow on transit remand. The court sent them to judicial custody till May 4. The ATS will move court on Tuesday to seek their police remand.The IG said the terror suspects had planned a bomb attack at some crowded place in Haridwar, Uttarakhand during some holy gathering. He said they also had plans to eliminate a police officer in Mumbai and set ablaze a sugar mill in Narkatiyaganj, Bihar. They were also planning to target some gas cylinder shop or battery shop located in a crowded place so that it could cause major damage, he said.Arun confirmed that the four suspects had even made advance payments to two persons of Bijnore to arrange gunpowder, firearms and ammunitions to be used for the attack but they were arrested before they could carry out their plan.Read more| Uttar Pradesh on alert: Police warn of spectacular attacks by ISI-trained sadhus"

The central bank left policy lending rate (repo) unchanged and hiked borrowing rates (reverse repo) at the last policy review on April 7.RBI has already signalled that uncertain monsoon and low statistical base effect will keep CPI inflation at 4.5% in the first half and 5% in the second half of 2017-18. The government may also increase the minimum support prices (MSPs) of crops, which will put an upward pressure on inflation, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.A pick up in new currency in circulation helped revive consumer demand after a bout of severe cash crunch during the demonetisation drive of November-December of 2016.The March inflation number was still higher compared with the 0.45% fall in WPI during March 2016, as prices of petrol, diesel and minerals, firmed up due to an upward trend in global prices.Festival demand pushed up prices of vegetables by 5.7% and fruits by 7.6%. However, potato prices fell 17%, onion 10.8% and pulses 6.1% from a year ago.Mineral prices were up 23.5% while fuels were costlier by 18.2% as petrol and diesel prices were revised up.Last week, government data showed a rise in the prices of sugar, confectionary, snacks and fruits during Holi pushed up Indias consumer price inflation (CPI) to 3.81% in March from 3.65% in February.The slowing pace of remonetisation, or pumping new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes into circulation, during March to replace the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in November, helped inflation to stay within 4% in the financial year ending March 2017.Consumption and investment activity were dampened after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced the bold decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.While the demonetisation weeded out Rs 15.44 lakh crore or 86% of currency from circulation, the government and RBI has been able to pump in about Rs 13.35 lakh crore worth of new notes so far."

We have booked the officials and prompt action will be taken against them accordingly, said Vijay Bahadur, regional food security officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Singh informed that the district administration had carried a similar raid and inspection campaign in 2016 as well.Last year, we had conducted inspection of 1,002 shops and raids at 157 shops, where a total of four FIRs were lodged. We cancelled the license of 18 shops and suspended the license of 21 others. We also recovered commodities such as 63.5 quintals of wheat, 52 quintals rice, 59 quintals of sugar, 800 litres of kerosene and 27 LPG cylinders worth Rs 1,73,500 back then, said Singh."

They wait for the hour-long lunch break that day with keen anticipation.All 28 of them rise ten minutes before the clock strikes 1pm, go to their chambers for a quick change and then proceed towards the common dining hall where a delectable three-course meal awaits the lordships.The lip-smacking cuisine from a particular part of the country is not sourced from a restaurant or hotel, but is home-cooked.A sitting SC judge hosts the weekly common lunch. The dishes are part of the host judges home state, prepared at his residence.A minimum of five food items have to be served in the main course and paan  as per each judges choice  is a must to end the lunch. Sources said judges sometimes call cooks from their native place to prepare dishes with the right local flavour.On other working days judges eat lunch in their own chambers.This Wednesday the judges tucked into home-made traditional food from Madhya Pradesh that was cooked at Justice Arun Misras residence. Pumpkin soup, bharvan bhindi and baingan, malai-kofta and paneer lababdar were on the menu. More than the main course, the dessert was much appreciated. The roasted kheer, pineapple kesar halwa and maalpua were just to die for, a judge told HT.Last week Justice RK Agrawal from Uttar Pradesh was the host. Dry green peas, kadhai paneer and dum aloo flavoured with local spices were laid out at lunch time.THE JUSTICES ARE SERVED In a charming tradition, Supreme Court judges meet for lunch every week, with each of them taking turns to bring ghar ka khana from his or her home state 1 Jagdish Singh Khehar 2 Adarsh Kumar Goel 3 Deepak Gupta 4 N.V.

Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the delicacy that afternoon.And before that the judges had Rajasthani delicacies from Justice AK Sikris kitchen - bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi.Vegetables from Justice Kurien Josephs own kitchen garden were used to cook traditional dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, followed by neatly chopped pineapples. The unusually long ripe bananas from the state were served after the meal.Justice J Chelameswar, who stirred a controversy with his decision to skip collegium meetings, too was a good host when it was his turn. His lunch treat of spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi left the judges licking their fingers.An unwritten rule is strictly followed at these lunches  only vegetarian cuisine is served to respect the sentiments of those who do not eat non-vegetarian food. The host is selected according to the judges seniority.Justice AK Patnaik, who retired in June 2014, fondly remembers how the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had added a new rule not to convert the lunch into a competition between judges. He introduced a penalty for those who exceeded the number of dishes fixed by him, Justice Patnaik recalls.Behind every successful meal is a judges wife, a senior judge told HT. But not for Justice R Banumathi  the lone woman judge  who would have to supervise the lunch herself when her turn comes.The Wednesday lunch not only gives judges an opportunity to taste a variety of Indian cuisines, but also shows their bonhomie. Work is never discussed and judges leave their differences at the door. Food is the only topic of discussion with some of the judges boasting about their local cuisines.A senior judge is appointed as the marshall and he penalises any judge who breaks the rules. At present Justice Bobde is the marshall. An argument with the marshall can aggravate the penalty.A marshall is like a class monitor to whom a complaint is made if a judge is seen breaching the rules. He is also the one who announces the end of the dinner that follows a standing ovation for the host judge, a sitting judge told HT on condition of anonymity.Retired judge Justice Kuldeep Singh who suggested the idea of the weekly lunches in the early Nineties gets nostalgic when asked about what triggered the idea. Justice Ranganath Misra was the Chief Justice then and he agreed for the weekly lunch so that we could all get together. It gave a personal touch and became an exciting event which everyone looked forward to, Justice Singh said.It was an opportunity to unwind and relax over food. Therefore, the rule that work should never be discussed. When we left our gowns in the chambers, we also left our work behind. I always looked forward to meals from south, Justice Singh recollects.Justice GS Singvhi who retired three years ago also has fond memories to share. Those were the only moments when we never discussed work. The lunch ensured that we brushed up our knowledge related to food cooked in our houses he told HT.Nor can he forget the south Indian dishes he had at these lunches. Home-made paisam (dessert), rasam and brown rice of Kerala were my favourites. I never eat sweets due to my sugar problem, but I could not resist the home-made paisam served by a brother judge from the south, he says.Yes, it was difficult for judges to avoid home-cooked preparations, despite health issues. When it was my turn I got two types of dessert ready, which included a sugar-free dessert. To my surprise nobody touched the sugar-free sweet and I always thought that judges were too old, muses Justice Patnaik who enjoyed the variety of chutneys his brother judge from the South got for lunch.A judge recollects how Justice Aftab Alam in his farewell speech on April 18, 2013 described the Wednesday lunch as a congregation of mini India. He said the one thing he would miss post retirement would be the weekly lunch, the judge recalls.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha holds a similar view. The Supreme Court is a mini India. You have judges from all over the country. The lunch used to a gastronomical delight of regional cuisine, he told HT.Justice Lodha had served dal-bati when it was his turn to host the lunch. It was soaked in ghee and I remember that after the lunch session all the judges felt so sleepy. Justice Singhvi, who also got dal-bati, says his preparation was different from Justice Lodhas family recipe. Dal-bati is cooked differently in the Jodhpur region and in the Jaipur region of Rajasthan. That is the beauty of Indian food, he explains.The lunch is laid out on a large rectangular table presided by the CJI. The host sits on his right and gives a brief introduction about the dishes. The rest sit wherever they like.However, the seating arrangement keeps changing. During former CJI HL Dattus tenure, the judges used to sit around circular tables and places were decided as per the lucky draw. A judge recollects how the present CJI JS Khehar ended up sitting next to Justice Dattu thrice. And when the former CJI asked him what conspiracy he was up to, CJI Khehar said it was the lucky draws fault!"

She is responding to treatment, according to a doctor.Meanwhile, police inspector Manoj Chalke, from Manor police station, said he will question the MSEDCL on the wire, which flouted height norms.Rupali, a resident of Chahade in Palghar, got stuck to the tree, which was noticed by a sugarcane-juice vendor,who alerted the locals and they informed the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), the source said. According to the source, the company immediately disconnected the supply, after which Rupali was pulled down and rushed first to a hospital in Palghar where the medical officer advised her father to admit her in the Dr Dhawale Hospital in Palghar.At the Dr Dhawale Hospital, the girl was given first aid and later referred to the Civil Hospital, Thane, as Rupali had sustained 40 per cent burns and severe head damages,which was bleeding. From there, a government ambulance broke down, following which the father arranged for a private ambulance that had no doctor onboard, the source said.However, the doctors found Rupalis condition to be serious, so they advised her father to admit her at JJ Hospital. There, they were told that there was no empty bed to admit Rupali, following which an activist helped them by arranging for another ambulance to get her to Nair Hospital, the source said.READHigh tension wire snaps in Ghaziabad, two electrocuted"

The waiver will cost the state exchequer around Rs 3,500 crore.The farmers having outstanding power bills of Rs 10,000 or more will be allowed to pay the same in four installments, the cabinet decided.It also decided to ensure that transformers were changed in 48-hours, instead of 72 hours, in rural areas and within 24 hours in the urban areas.The farmers will not be required to transport the malfunctioning transformers to the power station. This would be responsibility of the power corporation officials, Sharma said.A memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed under the union governments power for all project in the presence of Yogi Adityanath and union power minister Piyush Goyal in Lucknow on April 14, the minister said.The pact will be inked to meet the Centres target of making the state energy efficient by 2018.Relief for potato farmersThe cabinet decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potato at Rs 487 per quintal to protect the interest of potato farmers.The government wants to give adequate price to potato growers. Even if we cannot give them profit, we will ensure they do not incur loss, Sharma said.He said district magistrates were asked to set up procurement centres wherever needed.If the previous SP regime had played a proactive role, the condition of potato growers would have been better, he added.Sugarcane dues to be paid in 14 daysThe government also made it mandatory to clear the current dues of the sugarcane growers within 14 days and previous dues within 120 days.Legal action will be initiated against sugar mills if they fail to make payments, Sharma said.Steps to end shortage of building materialsThe state cabinet also decided to amend the Uttar Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1963, in a bid to end the shortage of sand and coarse sand, which is adversely impacting construction activities.Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state cabinet had constituted a committee, headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, at its last meeting to look into the issue.The committee had submitted its report, he said.The state government will allow transportation of minor minerals with valid transit permits from other states.As a short term measure, district magistrates will issue e-tenders to allocate up to 10-acre area for sand mining for six months. He said short term measures had been initiated as implementation of long-term measures may take six to eight months."

Hence, core CPI is a worry, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist of Care Ratings.We expect CPI inflation to range between 4.5-5% for FY18 assuming a normal monsoon, he added.Last month, government data showed wholesale price index-based (WPI) inflation flared up to two-and-a-half years high of 6.55% in February from 5.25% in January mainly due to a spurt in mineral and fuel prices while food prices started rising following rapid remonetisation.Fearing a spurt in CPI and WPI inflation due to pent-up demand after demonetisation, the RBI tapered the remonetisation pace in March.The increase in currency being circulated was 5.9% week-on-week in January 13. It slowed to 4.6% in February 10, and further to 4% on March 10.Latest Reserve Bank of India data shows that the currency in circulation increased by 1.7% week-on-week to Rs 13.35 lakh crore as on March 31, 2017.The RBI also kept policy lending rate unchanged at its April policy review but hiked the reverse repo to suck out extra cash from banks.Between January 2015 and March 2017, the RBI has lower rates by 175 bps while the government has stepped up spending and speeded up reforms to pump prime the economy amid a feeble global recovery.CSO has projected economic growth is projected at 7.1% for 2016-17 as compared with 7.9% in 2015-16, on expectation of a fall out of demonetisation on the consumption demand during the second half of the fiscal year."

Umesh Raghuvanshi spoke to minister for finance Rajesh Agarwal on the challenges ahead.How challenging was the loan waiver decision?Loan waiver was certainly a challenge. The new government has just taken over. But we know the condition of states small and marginal farmers has deteriorated in the last few years. Natural calamities have left a direct impact on agriculture production and the condition of farmers.How will loan waiver be implemented?The BJP decided to bring out a Sankalp Patra instead of a poll manifesto. The BJP leadership resolved to fulfil the commitments mentioned in the Sankalp Patra. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the loan would be waived in the first meeting of state cabinet. No other party has made such a categorical commitment. We had long meetings with the chief minister, officers and banks etc. to find out the total loan amount. The CM proposed the loan waiver and the cabinet happily approved it. We have started the procedure to take this to the state assembly in the annual budget for 2017-2018 in the days to come.How will the government mobilise funds?The decision to waive loans of small and marginal farmers up to Rs 1 lakh has been taken. We are considering options. The Centre has already indicated it would not provide any direct assistance. We will find a way out.Will the government float kisan bonds?We will propose all options to the CM and go ahead with whatever decision he takes. We will come up with the decision in the Vidhan Sabha. We are committed to bringing about an improvement in the condition of farmers. The state cabinet has decided to write off the dues of seven lakh small and marginal farmers. We have brought one-time settlement (OTS) to bring these farmers to the mainstream and make their future secure. We will request the economists to suggest a way out.Are there other commitments too?We have to pay arrears of the seventh pay commission to state government employees. This will also put an additional burden on the state exchequer.What are other challenges that the government faces?We are switching over to the GST. Its a challenge but it is good for the state and traders. We will have to train the staff. We will ask respective departments to hold seminars and inform people about the advantages and disadvantages.Did the new government receive empty coffers?I am yet to see where the coffers are.Will there be inquiries against financial irregularities?Yes. We have come to know about irregularities in implementation of a number of schemes. There has been corruption. The CM has said there will be an inquiry in all such cases and those found guilty will be punished. There will be no political vendetta and we will not allow any public interest scheme to be affected. There will be no wastage of public money.Has the CM ordered an inquiry into the sale of 21 sugar mills under the BSP government?The CM has ordered an inquiry. The value of scrap would exceed the amount for which the sugar mills have been sold. The CM has also ordered action against the sugar mills that have not paid the dues of the farmers.Read more: If saffronisation means shaping talent of students, I am doing it, says BHU VC"

If necessary, the state government would also recommend a CBI inquiry into the issue, the chief minister said when presentations about sugarcane development department were made before him at his Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhawan office here late on Friday evening.Adityanath said nobody had any right to sell government properties at unreasonable prices. The state government would not allow anybody to misuse government property under any circumstances, he said.The Mayawati government had decided to sell 21 sugar mills on June 4, 2007. The running mills put on sale included Amroha, Bijnor, Bulandshahar, Chandpur, Jarval Road, Khadda, Rohana Kalan, Sakauti Tanda, Saharanpur and Siswa Bazar.As there were accusations of corruption, the opposition had demanded a CBI inquiry. After taking over the reins of the state, the then Samajwadi Party government had ordered a Lokayukta probe on November 6, 2012.The Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its report had estimated losses to the tune of Rs 1,179.84 crore due to sale of these sugar mills.It had observed that the land and buildings of the sugar mills were undervalued. Besides concession granted to undervalue the land and buildings of these sugar mills, no stamp duty was levied on the sale.The auditor had also observed that no competition was possible due to connection among the bidders. It noted that the bidders were aware of the expected value before the bidding was opened. Bids that were 50% below the expected value were kept alive and the Swiss challenge method was used.The process of opening the bids was changed, the CAG said, adding that the core group of secretaries on disinvestments did not value the land and the buildings appropriately and focused on the discounted cash flow method."

The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Anticipating non-repayment of loans, the state government has made it clear that those paying their dues will get bigger benefits through different schemes.The government plans to bring a scheme under which those farmers repaying their agriculture loan on time will get bigger benefits, state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar told HT.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.What we have seen is a growing tendency among borrowers who are otherwise capable to repay loan but postpone their decision. The repeated loan waiver is hampering the culture of repayment of dues as honest people do not see any incentive in paying back the money they borrowed from the bank, Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager, Bank of Maharashtra, said.In western Maharashtra, where farmers produce sugarcane, the recovery of loans has gone down from the previous year, officials said.Solapur district, which has highest number of sugar factories, recorded farm loan recovery of up to 65% till March, compared to 77% during the previous year, according to district central cooperative bank officials, who did not wish to come on record since they were not authorised to speak to the media.In Ahmednagar district, farm loan recovery for the outgoing financial year was just 33%, slightly less compared to previous year, an official of Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank, which through its network of agriculture credit societies along with other financial institution distributed agriculture loan, said.When there is a demand for farm loan waiver, people naturally prefer to wait, hoping they get relief. But there are many borrowers who repay their dues, said Charudatta Arkatkar, secretary, State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), a representative body of all lending institutions in the state.The fall in loan recovery has been recorded despite a good monsoon this year with the economic survey predicting a 12.5% growth rate for agriculture in 2016-17 from the minus 4.6% in 2015-16.Congress workers raising slogans with Tamil Nadu farmers during a protest against Centre in Coimbatore on Wednesday, demanding farm loans waiver. (PTI)The UP government on Tuesday decided to waive farm loan worth Rs 36,369 crore. The same day Madras High Court, while hearing a plea, asked the Tamil Nadu government to provide relief to all the farmers by waiving farm loan.Coming under pressure from opposition and ally Shiv Sena, chief minister Fadnavis said his government is in favour of loan waiver and was studying the UP model.Against growing demand for loan waiver, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel cautioned about the moral consequences of such a scheme saying, waivers undermine an honest credit culture.Kishore Tiwari, an agricultural activist and chairman of government constituted task-force on recommending solutions to agrarian crisis, said the relief should be offered only to farmers affected by drought and those who cant repay dues.There is no point extending the farm loan waiver to all the farmers the way government did in 2008. Only those who are financially in bad shape due to successive droughts and other reasons should be given relief, he said."

Though governments changed at the Centre and the state over the last 16 years, the project failed to kickstart.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has instructed all officials concerned to coordinate with the civil aviation ministry to get necessary approvals, so that the project is completed at the earliest. The project is crucial because it will help in bringing investment, setting up industries and creating jobs in the region along Yamuna Expressway, Suresh Rana, minister of state (Independent), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development, said.Officials hope that the project will be a reality soon as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power in both the Centre and the state.In the last 16 years, the mantle of administration at the Centre and the state passed from one party to another, delaying the project. Over the last five years of the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party (SP) government, the project did not see much progress because of the dispute over airport location between the state and the Centre. While the state wanted the international airport near Agra, the Centre wanted it at Jewar. This kept delaying the ambitious project, said a senior official of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), which has the mandate to provide the 5,000 acres of land for the project.The Union government had, in July 2016, sought an obstacle limitation survey (OLS) of the airport site at Jewar from the state government. But the state is yet to send that report to the civil aviation ministry.The state was supposed to take a decision whether OLS will be done by the state or by YEIDA. Now, we will take a call and get it done soon, said Amarnath Upadhyaya additional chief executive officer of the YEIDA.Dr Mahesh Sharma, Union minister of state for tourism and culture also met UP CM Adityanath to discuss the airport project in Lucknow on Wednesday.Former chief minister Rajnath Singh had conceived this airport project in 2001. And our government will speed up the implementation of the project. Everybody knows why the previous governments did not take the project forward, Sharma said.Read I Jewar airport: Civil aviation asks for survey to study areaIndustrial and realty sectors are upbeat following the UP CMs push to revive this project.If and when the airport project at Jewar becomes a reality, this area will emerge as a logistic hub. The project will spur demand for residential, commercial and institutional property. It will have a positive impact on the realty sector. The best part is that it will create a positive sentiment among property buyers, Amit Modi, vice-president of the realtors body CREDAI (Western UP), said.The Yamuna Expressway authority said it will begin acquisition of land from farmers once it gets official instructions from the UP government.The airport project at Jewar will benefit manufacturing units and other business in Noida and Greater Noida immensely. Gurgaon and Manesar witnessed growth just because these were close to Indira Gandhi airport at Delhi. Similarly, Jewar airport along the Yamuna Expressway will have a similar impact on the economy. Foreign investment in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway will go up by leaps and bounds once the airport becomes a reality, Vipin Malhan, president of Noida Entrepreneurs association, said.Timeline:Different governments at the state and the Centre failed to get the Jewar airport project off the ground2001: Then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Rajnath Singh proposes a Greenfield Taj international airport and aviation hub (TIAH) at Jewar2010: Chief Minister Mayawati supports the aviation project at Jewar2012: The UPA government at the Centre says an airport cannot come up within 150 km of the IGI Airport in Delhi2013: The UP government shifts the project to Agra, 200 km away from the IGI airport2014: Dr Mahesh Sharma, BJP leader and Gautam Budh Nagar MP, promises to revive the project at Jewar2015: Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav expresses willingness to implement the project and the Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) reserves 5,000 acres of land for it2016: The state and central governments pledge support to the projectApril 2016: UP civil aviation director Devendra Swarup conducts site inspectionJune 2016: Union Ministry of Defence clears the projectSeptember 2016: State government asks Yeida to conduct Obstacle Limitation Survey (OLS) in the area"

And its making waves in literary circles across the world. Published in March this year, Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows is flying off the book shelves in places as far apart as Melbourne and London. A dark but heart-warming comedy, the novel delves into the lives of Punjabi widows, who may have spent a lifetime being dutiful in the shadows of their fathers, husbands and brothers, but whose white dupattas hide their rich and colourful inner lives.Balli Kaur Jaswal, the 33-year-old author born in Singapore, is no stranger to literary acclaim. In 2014, she was named the Best Young Australian Novelist by Sydney Morning Herald for her debut novel Inheritance. Her second novel Sugarbread was a finalist for Singapores 2015 Epigram Books Fiction Prize. Her current work was inspired by the time she spent in Southall.Balli Kaur Jaswal, author of the novel Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows (HT Photo)According to The Bookseller, HarperCollins bagged Erotic Stories in a strong six-figure deal after staving off five other publishers to win the title at an auction. Director Sir Ridley Scotts production company, Scott Free Productions and Film4, which produced The Martian, has bought the film rights to the book.Jaswal, whose father was in the foreign services, has lived all around the world, including Australia, Japan, Russia, the Philippines, Turkey, the US and the UK, but her Punjabi upbringing is at the heart of all her three novels.Erotic stories follows Nikki, the 22-year-old self-appointed fem fighter who starts a creative writing class for women in a Southall gurdwara. To her dismay, the barely literate middle-aged and elderly women in her class are not interested in her feminist talk. But as they begin to open up, they start sharing steamy stories about their womanhood, sexuality, and hilarious escapades. Soon, Nikki realises that their stories may place them at a risk in a community policed by a group of unemployed men called the Brothers.The book has received a warm response from reviewers. The Economist writes: Ms Jaswal has written a funny and moving tale of desire and its discontents. It serves as a reminder that even the most traditional societies often come in 50 shades of grey. Strongly recommending the novel, The Straits Times writes: If you like your erotica with a social conscience, this is the book for you.Jaswal, who teaches English, turned to writing after receiving the David TK Wong writer-in-residence fellowship at the University of East Anglia, UK, in 2007. She has also received a writing fellowship from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.Hailed as a leading voice of the Punjabi diaspora in Singapore, Jaswals first two novels are set in the island nation. Inheritance revolves around the mental illness of Amrit, the protagonist, who disappears in the middle of the night, only to return as a different person. Nobody in her conservative Punjabi family knows how to tackle her problem and their attempts to do so result in disastrous consequences.Sugarbread is the coming-of-age story of Pin, a Punjabi girl growing up in Singapore, and trying to find out a secret about her mother. The book also tackles racism, and how hurtful it is even if its rooted in ignorance. Pin, for instance, is forbidden from wearing her kara (Sikh article of faith) during soccer practice. The school prefects also punish her for wearing jewellery to school.Jaswal was teaching English at John Monash Science School in Melbourne when Inheritance was published. Her last teaching assignment was at an international school in Istanbul in 2015-2016.She is married to Paul Howell, an Australian journalist, and the couple lives in Singapore."

These steps have hurt their savings and hit their daily budgets hard, the Congresss chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a statement.He said the only development people are getting to see is that of rising prices, an expensive digital India, arbitrary bank charges levied by banks.Surjewala said the Modi government has dealt a big blow to the pockets of crores of people who avail health insurance.Apart from allowing higher commissions to agents, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has also proposed up to 50% increase in insurance premium for cars, motor cycles as well as commercial vehicles.He said the government was withdrawing subsidy on sugar sold through public distribution system or ration shops, and has lowered the interest rates on small saving schemes such as PPF, Kisan Vikas Patra and Sukanya Samriddhi scheme by 0.1%.The interest rate on one of the most popular small savings schemes  PPF -- is cut by 10 basis points to 7.9%, the lowest level since 1980, thereby adversely affecting the savings of crores of Indians and their future, the Congress leader said.He also raised the issues of income tax changes and charges on delay in filing tax returns.Deception of voters and betrayal of people's faith is the hallmark of Modi ji's brand of politics. The BJP government is making all efforts to hurt and backstab the hardworking middle class and poor of India. The Congress demands immediate rollback of these anti-people policies of the BJP, Surjewala said."

This gives him a clear edge over his ministers as Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his election campaign in the state had expressed his resolve to uproot corruption if the BJP won the election. Rawats decision to keep that department (Suraj) would also deter the officials, especially the higher bureaucracy, his ministers and the party legislators from indulging in corruption of any kind while discharging their duties.The CM also managed to clip the wings of his main adversary and influential BJP leader from Kumaon Prakash Pant who too had been in the race for the post of chief minister. Rawat has given his rival peripheral departments ---legislative and parliamentary affairs, finance, language, sugarcane development and sugar industry, potable water and cleanliness. The only plum post that Pant has got is the department of excise. The chief minister, in comparison, seems to have elevated Satpal Maharaj, the senior most cabinet minister, by giving him the key portfolios such as tourism, pilgrimage, religious fairs, culture, besides Indo-Nepal and Uttarakhand river projects.A cursory glance at the list of portfolios also shows that most of the five Congress turncoats, including Maharaj, have got a better deal. For instance, Harak Singh has been assigned forest and wildlife, environment and solid waste management. Subodh Uniyal has been given agriculture, agriculture marketing, agriculture education, food processing, and horticulture. Rekha Arya, a minister of state (MoS), has been assigned the departments of women empowerment and child development, besides five other departments including animal husbandry.CM though did try to balance things by assigning higher education to the other minister of state (MoS), Dhan Singh Rawat, a BJP veteran. Dhan Singh has been assigned three other portfolios namely cooperatives, dairy development and protocol.Among other two BJP veteransArvind pandey and Madan Kaushik --- the latter has got a better deal in comparison as he has been assigned the departments of urban development, and housing among others. None of the five portfolios Pandey has been assigned --- school education, Sanskrit education, sports, youth welfare and panchyati raj --- is considered plum, according to political observers.Rawat govt sets up eco-tourism devp corpThe Uttarakhand government has constituted Eco-tourim Development Corporation. The conglomerate is mandated to carry out environmental conservation and create employment opportunities for the locals.Chief secretary S Ramaswamy presided over the first meeting of the corporation at the state secretariat, according to an official release. At the meeting officials decided that an action plan for eco-tourism development would be submitted to the government. In the next 15 days the corporation officials would select a pilot project to develop infrastructural facilities required for promotion of eco-tourism, the note read. Under the project, the activities like mountain climbing, wellness camps and home stay facilities etc would be promoted across the state."

5b2e0c349855b7245313d129,This Doctor Is First Woman MLA from Ghaziabad in 32 Years,https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/this-doctor-is-first-woman-mla-from-ghaziabad-in-32-years/story-9spu0hbhswotmTZe9WLHZN.html,2017-03-20,"Service to others is nothing new for Dr Manju Shivach. She has been treating patients and performing surgeries for over 20 years till the voters decided that its time she donned a new role to serve the people  as the MLA of Modi Nagar in Ghaziabad.First-timer Dr Manju Shivach, who defeated two sitting MLAs in the 2017 UP assembly polls, became the first woman in 32 years to win an assembly seat in Ghaziabad district.The last woman to win from Ghaziabad was Congresss Vimla Singh who won the elections in 1985.Dr Shivach, a gynaecologist, was the only woman candidate to get a ticket from any major political party this elections. Although she was considered a non-entity by many, especially in the hinterlands of western Uttar Pradesh, she proved them wrong to claim the seat.Dr Shivach hails from a small non-political family from Dehradun. Her mother worked as school teacher and father as an accounts officer with UP Roadways.Her first political stint came in 2012 during the chairman election for Modi Nagar Nagar Palika seat which her husband, Dr Devendra Shivach, intended to contest but could not as the seat was reserved for women.Instead, she took up the challenge but lost. The couple had been classmates in medical college and decided to marry before settling in Modi Nagar from where her husband hails. They also set up a small hospital there in 1996.However, after the defeat in the nagar palika election, in 2013, she was entrusted to look after the womens wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party as its district president.There was no looking back since. Women joined me in large numbers and we joined every event, protest and agitation called by the party. It is hard for any woman to stand up in a male dominated region such as western UP. I remember carrying out publicity campaigns in the 2014 general elections for the party and drove through interior villages day and night. There were motorcades deployed by other parties to woo voters and they indulged in hectic campaigning. Still, it did not deter me, she said.During December and January, she stood in bus stops of Modi Nagar and urged people to join the BJP. Her ticket for the assembly seat was not confirmed till she came to the attention of party leaders.I remember that I had gone to partys regional office at Ghaziabad when the names of contesting candidates were being finalised. I was returning home and I had just reached Raj Chopla near my hospital and was on my phone. I lost the connectivity just then and could not figure out the names of the selected candidates and my heart was beating fast. When I reached Modi Nagar, people were celebrating outside my house and they told me that I will be contesting, she said.I could not believe it and I rushed back to the regional office for a confirmation. Since that day, I started preparations for the election. All my hospital work was taken over by my colleague Dr Shobhna Sengar. The networking part with leaders of dominant groups was taken over by my husband. These two people have been the driving force behind my success, Dr Shivach said.On March 11, the doctor was declared as winner from Modi Nagar seat after she trounced sitting BSP MLA from Murad Nagar Wahab Chaudhary and Rashtriya Lok Dals Sudesh Sharma, the sitting MLA from Modi Nagar seat. She was the only woman candidate among the nine who contested from the assembly seat.Her political duties aside, the doctor never misses her morning deadline to attend to patients who come from every section of society and far flung areas. Even after being elected the MLA, Dr Shivach is a regular at the hospital, attending to patients.She is a strict administrator and looks after the hospital personally. It is her personal touch with her patients that makes her respected and loved by all, Dr Sengar said.Her hobbies range from preparing Indian cuisines to reading literature and mythology. Even as she moves on to a bigger and challenging role, Dr Shivach says she will always be available to her patients and at the hospital.I had a lot of support wherever I worked. Even my patients supported me. Now, the time has come to take up a bigger challenge to serve people on a larger scale. I have a definite agenda to implement and take up issues of women security, sugarcane farmers and easing traffic related issues before the 2019 general elections. I will do all this at any cost, the new MLA said.Grill-session: Dr Manju Shivach, BJP MLA Modi NagarYou will be under pressure to perform before the 2019 general elections. What agenda will be your priority?My focus will be on reviving the industrial town of Modi Nagar, holding camps for the unemployed and seeing how they can be provided skills and jobs. Apart from this, I will also persuade all parents to compulsorily get their daughters admitted to schools. I will also try to bring Central schemes to my constituency.What other local issues you will take up?I will work to expedite payment of pending dues to sugarcane farmers who have been suffering for a long time. This is a major issue that has been delayed by local politics. I will also try to promote local craftsmen and revive the area as a textile hub. There will also be proper electrification in villages.It will also be on my agenda throughout to provide school and college-going girls better transport as they travel from far-flung areas. The party has already promised measures for safety and security of women and girls. Bypassing of traffic from Modi Nagar will also be a priority as the town in marred by heavy flow of vehicles.Several parties have held tampering with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) responsible for their loss in the election. Your view?The EVMs are tried and tested and we have full faith in the Election Commission. Had there been any issue with the machines, there are several checks and balances to prevent malpractices. Also, the media would have raised the issue earlier. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are trying to hide their loss behind EVMs. They cannot figure out why they lost, but it was more because of their caste-based and appeasement politics.Does your victory despite being a first-timer suggest dominance of polarisation this election?It is not about polarisation, but the works of PM Modi that have made people believe he will bring development. The people of UP were fed up with the rule of smaller parties who came to power one after the other. It was in fact a vote in support of PM Modi and his policies. People also supported demonetisation even though they had to stand in queues.I was confident of winning as I have been working on the ground for the past three years. People from all groups supported me. After my victory, a Muslim woman named Momina came to congratulate and gifted me a framed photograph of Lord Krishna.Representation of women has suffered as women MLAs have not been given due chance in the UP cabinet of late? What if you are given a chance as minister?Women have performed well and need due representation in the new cabinet. Representation of women will motivate other women to enter politics as well. They bring a more disciplined approach to politics. If I am given a chance, I will respect the partys choice and work honestly and with utmost transparency. Although I am new, I will learn this job as I learned to become a doctor with training."

Action including the closure of polluting industries will be initiated against those units found violating norms, said a ministry official.Approximately 500 million litres per day (MLD) of effluents are discharged daily into the Ganges. According to the ministry data, the municipal sewage generation from the 118 towns along the river in five states is estimated at 4,790 MLD. As against this, currently treatment capacity of 1,017 MLD is available.Cleaning up the Ganga 500 MLD*: Effluents discharged daily into the Ganges.4790 MLD: Municipal sewage generation from the 118 towns along the river in five states.1017 MLD: Current treatment capacity available.*MLD: million litres per dayA CPCB survey in the past has shown that over 52% of sewerage from small and mid-size towns along the Ganga goes untreated into the river.Among the industries that contribute to maximum untreated effluents are those manufacturing pulp and paper, sugar and chemicals. We have found that Ganga is most polluted between Kannauj and Kanpur. Some industrial units have put up common effluent treatment plants. But they are not enough. Many of the smaller units, to cut cost, have failed to install CETPs, a ministry official added.The ministry had earlier issued directions to five main industries -- distillery, sugar, pulp and paper, tannery and textile  that contribute 90% of inorganic load into the river system to achieve zero liquid discharge by March 2017.We will now check how many of them have complied, an official said."

Singh had joined the BJP just before the UP elections, before that he had been with the Congress for around 30 years. It was on his bike that Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi had ridden pillion to visit the village of Bhatta Parsaul during the farmers agitation there some years ago.As BJP candidate, Singh has defeated Bhati who had been winning the Jewar seat for the last three elections.Many attribute his victory to more than just the Modi wave. It was his reach among different communities in the constituency  be it Jatav, upper castes, Muslims or Gujjars  that led to his victory.Read more: Backed by Muslims, BJPs Dhirendra Singh defeats three-time BSP MLA in JewarPost his win, Singh intends to focus on his poll promises that include construction of an airport in Jewar, setting up of a womens college and reopening of the areas closed mills.For the last 40 years, the sugar mills in Jewar have remained shut due to various reasons. Successive state governments have not changed the conditions of the mill. Now, Singh says he wants to revive them from the ground level.For far too long, the people of Jewar have suffered due to the unavailability of mills. I promise them that the BJP government will revive the sugar mills and factories to ensure job opportunities for the workers, the first-time MLA said.He also believes his poll promise of construction of an airport at Jewar will contribute towards providing employment opportunities to the areas young voters.Tourism will increase with the construction of an airport. More and more job opportunities will be created with construction of hotels and restaurants near the airport, he said.In an election rally in Rabupura last month, Union home minister Rajnath Singh too had reiterated Singhs claims. He had also said that the permission to construct the airport has been approved by his ministry.Singh has also promised to set up a degree college for women, the lack of which has ensured that higher education remains out of reach for many young women in his constituency.Earlier, our sisters and daughters had to travel outside Jewar to pursue higher education. Many did not attend college because of this reason. The situation will improve once a college is set up for them, he said."

But the government was firm. It said such a step would lead to a fiscal collapse and not benefit farmers.Mungantiwar said of the 1.36 crore farmers, 1.07 are indebted, 67 lakh of them hold less than 1 hectare of farmland. To strengthen their financial condition, developing agricultural infrastructure is key, not a waiver.For this, the budget earmarked Rs 8,233 crore for pending irrigation projects; Rs2,812 crore for completion of 26 shortlisted projects nearing completion under PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana. To give a boost to the long-pending Krishna Marathwada project, the state made a separate Rs250 crore allocation, keeping it outside the governor formula. The project will irrigate 33,945 hectares in drought-prone Osmanabad and Beed and provide drinking water to 288 villages. NCP leader and former finance minister Jayant Patil, like many others in Opposition, criticised the states decision. The state talks of allocation over and above the what was done as per guidelines of the Governor, but figures show it couldnt even release funds allocated for irrigation projects.Mungantiwar said the governments focus is on doubling agriculture income over the next four years by increasing production and productivity. The budgets allocations show the states focussing on irrigation, electricity, food processing, technology, and to push for direct marketing of produce. The budget allocated Rs 979.10 crore for electrification of agicultural pumps in east Vidarbha. Tax on buying sugar cane imposed on sugar factories was waived to enable them to pay fair prices to farmers. This will cause a burden on the state exchequer for 2015-16 and 2016-17 of Rs700 crore. To encourage use of milk testing to curb adulteration, the state removed VAT of 13.5% on these kits.On farm loans, CM Devendra Fadnavis said the Centre was positive about institutionalising the credit system and the state will bear its share. The three-tier system will let farmers take fresh loans even if they are defaulters as the institutions providing loans are governed by RBI.Experts are not confident about the provisions. I dont think any of these schemes will directly benefit farmers. Take the farm pond scheme. The staten provides Rs 50,000 to farmers but it costs more than Rs1 lakh. Sugarcane tax waiver will benefit the factories, said SS Magar, former vice chancellor, Konkan agriculture university.Read: Maha budget 2017-18: Heres what Mumbai gotFocus is on making farming sustainable: Maharashtra finance ministerOppn burns Maharashtra budget, Shiv Sena stays calm"

Jogawat was kept under observation for 24 hours after he complained of minor fever and a burning sensation in his urinary tract on Tuesday night.It was a minor infection. It subsided after initial treatment. I am doing well now, Jogawat told to Hindustan Times. Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, who had successfully performed a bariatric surgery on Jogawat ,said he is currently stable and will be able to rejoin the workforce soon.Jogawat had been suffering from a urinary infection for a while. However, the condition was unrelated to his bariatric surgery, which took place in Mumbai. He called me after persistent episodes of fever and chills. I requested the local doctor to run primary tests and to not put him on heavy antibiotics as the complication wasnt severe, said Dr Lakdawala.The Neemuch doctor treating Jogawat, Dr Vipul Garg, said he was discharged after a day and will be on oral medication for the next five days. The patient came to the hospital complaining of chills and a severe burning sensation while urinating. We initially thought that this may have resulted from the major surgery he underwent, but later realised it was a urine infection said Dr Garg.Dr Lakdawala said the infection was probably related to his diabetes level. However, as Jogawat is on a strict diet, his sugar levels are expected to come under control. The doctor asked me if we needed to do a CT scan. I told him that Jogawat was stable and there was no need to for additional tests, he said.ReadCop fat-shamed by Shobhaa De develops post-operation complicationsFat-shamed MP cop Daulatram Jogawat undergoes surgery in MumbaiEman Ahmed vs Daulatram Jogawat: Two obese patients with different treatment"

The Congress is preparing for a grand Holi at Chandigarh on Monday before Amarinder is formally sworn in as chief minister for the second time on March 16.The party is hosted every year by Amarinders confidant and Punjabs richest MLA, sugar baron Rana Gurjit Singh, at Chandigarh. Though Rana had drawn flak for holding grand celebrations even when the Congress had lost in the 2012 polls, this time there is every reason for the party to celebrate. Its dry run in Punjab polls has finally ended and that too with a thumping victory, which has left even Congress leaders wondering at the hows and whats.But before the celebrations, the party put into motion the process for forming the next government in the state. After reaching Chandigarh from Patiala on Sunday afternoon, Amarinder was unanimously elected as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) at the Congress Bhavan here in presence of partys emissaries  former Rajasthan CM and head of Congress screening committee for Punjab elections Ashok Gehlot, AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab, Asha Kumari and AICC secretary Harish Chaudhary.Later, Amarinder, accompanied by Gehlot, Kumari and Chaudhary, went to Raj Bhavan to meet Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore and formally staked his claim to form the next government. The swearing-in ceremony will take place here on Thursday, March 16, at 10am.Though as CM this time, Amarinder wont have to look over his shoulder as the party high command has been further weakened by poll drubbing in UP and Uttarakhand and the Gandhis need him more than ever before, Amarinder, after meeting the Punjab governor, said the size and ministers of cabinet would be decided after his meeting with Rahul on Tuesday.Going by internal party dynamics, Amarinder is far more well placed in 2017 than he was in 2002, the first time he became the CM. For one, he had ensured a majority of the tickets went to his loyalists. So the CLP is packed with his loyalists and even the partys three senior-most leaders are now out of the way.He had debarred his prickly rival and former CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal from changing her seat, Lehra, where she was facing four-term anti-incumbency by bringing in the no swap rule for sitting MLAs on general seats.Former leader of opposition Sunil Jakhar who was sulking after Amarinder did not bat for his Rajya Sabha nomination, too has lost his bastion, Abohar. Amarinders other rule of one family, one ticket kept another potential power centre, Lal Singh, out of the poll race. Lals son, Rajinder Singh, has won the Samana seat.Though Fatehjang Bajwa, the younger brother of his other bitter critic, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Bajwa, has won, he poses no threat of dissidence to Amarinder.Now there only loyalists in the new CLP. The only question would be of who is more loyal. But in his last term as CM, Amarinder is not likely to play the favourites card. He will go by merit and seniority while trying a balance between factors of caste, religion, gender and region as he has won on the promise of good governance, a senior party leader said.Sidhu as deputy CM?Though Amarinder said the decision to appoint a deputy CM rests with the party high command, the party circles were abuzz with speculation that Navjot Singh Sidhu would be sworn in as Amarinders deputy. The other prominent portfolio of finance is likely to go to former finance minister Manpreet Badal.Some senior ministers in the race for cabinet berths on basis of region, caste and religion arithmetic are Tripat Singh Bajwa (Jat Sikh, Majha), Aruna Chaudhary (Hindu, woman, Majha), Brahm Mohindra (Hindu, Malwa), Charanjit Singh Channi (Dalit, Malwa), Pargat Singh (Jat Sikh, Doaba), Sukhbinder Sarkaria (Jat Sikh, Majha), Razia Sultana (Muslim, woman, Malwa), Amarinder and Kuljit Nagra (Rahuls confidant, Jat Sikh, Malwa)."

No swivel doors, reflective floor tiles or any of the on-duty staff welcoming you with a smile --- some of the characteristics that one would normally associate with a VIP section at a government hospital.State health minister Kali Charan Saraf on Saturday reportedly said that the BJP workers can go to Room No .23 and avail VIP facilities. The comment evoked a sharp reaction from the opposition Congress following which the minister claimed that he was misquoted.Old ceiling fans dangle in the room that has been divided into seven cubicles. A steel almirah near the wash basin in the room bears the writing in white paint: Room No 23 / VIP.Outside the room, patients and attendants shuffle around with papers in their hands while some flock to the drug store opposite to it. Signboards inform about the WiFi service at the hospital and also about the area being under the CCTV surveillance.Kali Charan ji jaisa koi mantri nahin hai poore Rajasthan ki dharti pe. Koi bhi chala jaye uski madad karte hain (There is no minister like Kali Charan Saraf in Rajasthan. He helps everybody), says Pintu Sharma, who claims to be working for the minister. He is accompanying another BJP worker who is constantly scratching his body and has come to seek treatment at Room No. 23.Sharma blames the media for distorting Sarafs remarks. The minister meant that the rooms facilities are already being used by ordinary patients and the BJP workers too should not face any kind of problem in medical consultation, he adds.A woman patient in the room seeking medication for the swelling in her leg says she did not know that it was a VIP room.A hospital staff says that the room was meant for routine check-up. IAS, IPS, and RAS officers or MLAs are given preference if and when they come. Otherwise, the room serves the general patients, he says requesting not to be named.Navratan Sharma, a patient in his sixties recalling his long association with the Congress and his grandfathers role in the independence movement, alleges that the minister was trying to attract people to the BJP by extending such benefits. He has come to the Room No. 23 to get his blood sugar level checked.Another BJP worker, Vinod Mathur, was also present in the room. He had come after hearing the ministers remarks. Working at the BJP office since past 26 years, he had come to get his eyesight checked. Here, the turn comes a little earlier, he adds."

The 55-year-old resident of Holland was here to fulfill her fathers last wish  which comprised tracing their familys roots in Mainpuri with nothing more than a vague address to go by.Shantas father was just a boy of nine when the British sent him and his mother to Surinam in South America over 105 years ago. Later, he shifted to Holland.I have been here twice since 1984. So, this is my third attempt to trace our roots in Mainpuri, and it certainly wont be my last. I will find them sooner or later, she says.During this visit, Shanta and a friend  Seema Kiran  visited the residence of Mainpuris late Raja Tej Singhs sarvarakar (custodian) to look for records, but in vain. Raja Tej Singh was the ruler of the region in the beginning of the 20th century.Shantas father, Shyam Sundar Ram Ratan, had passed away in 1976. My grandmother and my father had to leave Mainpuri on April 3, 1912. The British regime took them to Kolkata on the pretext of making a trip to the Shri Ram Temple, from where they were sent to Surinam by ship. They were made to work as bonded labourers at a sugarcane farm in Surinam, she says.Though Shanta knows Suraj Kali was 25 when she reached South America on May 14, 1912, she has no knowledge of what happened to her husband. That was yet another mystery to be unraveled.However, it may not be a very easy task  considering that Shanta is aware neither of the caste nor the address of her fathers long-lost family. She was seen moving around Mainpuri through Sunday and Monday, making enquiries about the past from local residents.Way back in 1984, Shanta had visited the British embassy in Surinam to look at the records of people brought in to work in plantations. They told him that the name of her grandmother, a Myanmarese citizen married to a Mainpuri resident, was Sonkali Ram Sahai. However, it wasnt clear if Ram Sahai was her husband or father. The clue that brought me here this time was an address  Chappatti Mohalla in Mainpuris Kotwali area, she says.Shanta, who has four children and a husband back in Holland, speaks Hindi. She will be flying back to Holland from Delhi on March 10."

The vendor then called the police. The police said the body was stuffed inside a plastic cover used for dumping waste.We have not identified the victim so far and are conducting investigations. We suspect the body is of a 35 to 40-year-old male. There are no external injuries, so we have to wait for the autopsy report to find out the cause of death, said Vijay Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sadar police station.The man was found wearing socks, a black shirt and black shorts. No other item has been recovered that could lead to his identification.The autopsy will be held off till Friday in case someone comes looking for the body. Police suspect that the victim died a few days ago.This is the second such incident to be reported from Rajiv Chowk.

But as it goes to vote on Saturday, this constituency could present a bouquet of thorns for politicians.The fields of Sikanderpur assembly constituency in eastern UPs Ballia district once used to spread fragrance of different flowers  roses, jasmine (Juhi, Chameli) ) and kewda. Fragrance of gulab jal (rose water) once overpowered the foul smell emanating from drains.Horticulture made Sikanderpur a famous centre for perfumes of gulab and kewda, jasmine oil, rose oil and attar. Farmers who cultivated them in acres after acres are now wary.We have scaled down flower cultivation. There is no return now, said Sheodas Rajbhar, who used to grow rose, bela and chameli. The scaling down had an immediate impact on perfume manufacturing. Sikanderpur, which had more than a dozen factories, is left with only two units.The farmers are angry as no political party has taken up their issues, nor has the government showed interest in its revival.It was a good business for us. Bur after the closure of factories, my two brothers left for Gujarat while I stayed back and make ends meet somehow by selling fruits, said Subhash Kumar Paswan of Sisotar village.Nearly 70% of cultivable land in the area was under flower cultivation earlier. But unfortunately, the government never brought in any new technology or innovation, said Ajay Tiwari, who switched over to farming of sugarcane, wheat and paddy.The main reason, says Ram Narayan Gupta, a retired havildar major, is the price. Sattidars (middlemen) purchase roses at Rs.300 per kg, which they sell to mill owners at a profit of Rs.200-300 per kg and the mill owner earns between Rs.3,000 and Rs.15,000 per kg."

The CBI investigation revealed that shots were fired from revolver number 161-24871 of .38 bore, which was issued to Belur.Belur was not named in the chargesheet but the Ghaziabad court had summoned her under section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) as an accused on September 14, 2007.The ballistic expert has also opined that the second bullet recovered from the body of Jasbir Singh was fired from the revolver issued in the name of Smt Jyoti Belur, then ASP Modi Nagar. She was not present at the spot when (A-1) Lal Singh fired at Jasbir Singh, according to the eyewitnesses, the CBI chargesheet stated.While narrating about the rounds fired by the personnel in the sugarcane field, convict Lal Singh had stated in the FIR that the Belur had fired three rounds. He also mentioned names of other officers and the rounds fired by them.Belur had moved Allahabad high court in a criminal revision petition against the September 14, 2007, summons issued by the special judge (CBI). Belur was summoned to face the trial for the offences punishable under sections 193, 201 and 302 of IPC.Her petition, filed in 2010 through lawyers, maintained that no case was made against her. No case for summoning the revisionist said to be made out. The court below has erred in relying upon the deposition of P.W.-7 (prosecution witness) Mukim who has not said a single word in respect of the revisionist (Belur). The depositions of P.W.-17 and P.W.-26 also do not reflect the involvement of the revisionist, the court had stated.The trial court has ignored the fact that at the time of taking the cognizance, the ballistic expert opinion was a part of the record but no cognizance was taken against the revisionist. The court has acted arbitrarily because, after the examinations of 61 prosecution witnesses and court witness, the revisionist has been summoned, it stated.However, the court order mentions the CBI reply, which stated, Learned court below has taken into consideration the statements of prosecution witnesses P.W.-7 Mukim, P.W.17 Randheer Singh, P.W.-26 Chaman Singh, P.W.-29 Navin, P.W.-30 Chandrapal, P.W.-32 Sri Abhijeet, P.W.- 55 Ram Chand and has come to the conclusion that the Revolver No.161-24871 of .38 bore was with the revisionist.Belurs petition was dismissed by the court in 2013. She had filed a recall application but it was also dismissed by the high court in 2013. She later approached the Supreme Court but her petition was rejected. However, Belur has failed to appear at court.She is an accused in the case and proceedings can only begin once she appears at the court. The court has also issued non-bailable warrants against her. We will try for her extradition from the UK, Rajan Dahiya, public prosecutor, CBI, said."

Higher growth in rural areas (43.7%) than urban (30.3%), is an encouraging trend, indicating that rural populace is waking up to production activity and value addition, it says.The number of agro-based units, based on Bihars core agricultural strength, has been rising to reach 407 units till August 2016.

The post-Partition face of the Indian Muslims, Maulana Azad, was keen to contest an election from a constituency with a sizeable Hindu population to prove his secular credentials when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insisted he contest from Muslim-majority Rampur district instead. Nehru didnt want to take a risk with the electoral fortunes of one of his key lieutenants. A reluctant Azad eventually agreed, and although he managed to have his way by contesting from Gurgaon in the 1957 elections, the die had been cast: a Muslim politician in UP was seen to need the crutches of his co-religionists to win an election.Azad at least had the stature to be seen as a genuine ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Azam Khan, the Samajwadi Partys (SP) most-prominent Muslim face and its MLA from Rampur, typifies a dangerous brand of aggressive Muslim-first politics masquerading as secularism. His strident rhetoric is designed to consciously appeal to his Muslim constituency: Rather than speak of how he intends to lift the community from the morass of under-development, his focus is on stoking their worst fears and insecurities. In the Azam Khan worldview, the way to win elections is to portrait Narendra Modi as an ogre, someone Muslims should be very frightened of.Read: My India My Vote: Uttar PradeshAnd yet, despite his abominable public utterances (one of the worst was when he suggested that the Kargil war was won by Muslim soldiers), the SP has chosen to stick with Khan because it suits their political agenda of wooing the states 18% Muslim vote. The partys original vote bank was built in the early 1990s on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, with Mulayam Singhs shoot-at-sight orders against kar sevaks at the height of the Ram Mandir movement conferring him the honorific Maulana Mulayam. The standing joke in Lucknow was that if any influential Muslim cleric approached Mulayam, he would be rewarded with an official post.Truth is, the SP has failed to offer the UP Muslim genuine security or social uplift: Patronage of Muslim elites or donations to madrasas have had almost no impact on the lives of citizens. The numerous small and large riots that have occurred in UP in the last five years are indictments of the claim to have ensured communal peace: The worst example being the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots where the local administration clearly failed to act swiftly or in a non-partisan manner.Perhaps, sensing an opportunity, the BSP leader Mayawati has attempted to challenge the MY alliance with her own DM (Dalit-Muslim) social engineering. By giving tickets to 100 Muslims including mafia dons like Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati has made an attempt to break the Yadav stranglehold over the Muslim vote. There have been previous attempts to create a Dalit-Muslim unity, most notably in Maharashtra, but never has it been tried on the scale that Mayawati is now seeking. It is this fear of a divided Muslim vote rather than any principled commitment to secular values that has spurred the Samajwadi-Congress alliance.Read: UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe BJPs response is even more troubling. Despite the PMs promise of sabka saath, sabka vikaas, on the ground there has been a concerted attempt by the local BJP leadership to identify issues that will create a Hindu-Muslim polarisation. If in 2014, the party exploited the Muzaffarnagar riots, this time, issues like a proposed ban on slaughter-houses, a national debate on triple talaq, the alleged flight of Hindus from Kairana in western UP, have been raked up on election eve with the sole intent of consolidating a Hindu vote. The pernicious love jihad campaign of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and the hate speeches of BJP MPs like Sakshi Maharaj and MLAs like Sangeet Som expose their bigoted mindsets.Trapped then between the opportunistic politics of the so-called secular parties and the demonisation by Hindutva forces, the average UP Muslim voter is left feeling angry and frustrated. They dont want to embrace the self-appointed thekedars of the community like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid who pops up just before elections despite his growing political irrelevance.They may be attracted to a more articulate leader like Asaduddin Owaisi but are also acutely aware that the Hyderabad MP is only a spoiler at election time. Indeed, if the Muslim voter prefers the SP-Congress alliance today, its because of a visible lack of options, and the fear that he will be soon left without any political voice in the state when confronted with the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the first when not a single Muslim was elected MP from UP.Read: Why UP matters: Can Indias most populous state decide the fate of Delhi?The answer to the Muslim dilemma does not lie in the growing radicalisation of the young who want to express themselves in more violent terms. Nor is it in seeking sops from the state, which are seen as token appeasement. It must lie, at the very core, in the recognition of the economic inter-dependence of communities: A Jat land owner in a sugarcane field in Baghpat must make common cause with the Muslim agricultural labourer as must a Muslim weaver in Banaras with a Hindu sari shop owner for mutual benefit. This can only be enabled by a leader with vision and credibility who enjoys the trust of both communities: Uttar Pradesh is crying out for a 21st century Azad and Nehru.Post script: In the aftermath of the post-Ayodhya riots, Lucknow was remarkably free of any bloody communal conflict. An elderly gent explained it to me with a poetic touch: In this city, Hindu and Muslim are like taala and chabi (lock and key), one cannot do without the other.What Lucknow thinks today, hopefully India will think tomorrow.The writer is senior journalist and authorrajdeepsardesai52@gmail.com"

It impacted the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but whether it would impact the 2017 polls to the assembly--no one can predict still.I was a party to a very passionate debate in the interiors of Muzaffarnagar at Lalukheri.

I have undergone a bypass and I cant queue long enough to vote. I queued up before a bank for long hours to return without cash. My son is to be married. Now you tell me, what do I do next and how, he said.A young man who overheard the conversation reacted violently, My entire savings have been seized. We heard the bank had been replenished with cash after eight-ten days. I rushed there, only to find that the currency had run out. I do not have a penny in hand.Even before I could react, a third voice rose above the din, this time full of anger. What are you talking about? We are voting to elect an MLA. What you talk of is plain nonsense, first talk of the issues facing the state. My MLA never does reappear, once he wins it.What about the MP, I wonder and pat comes the reply. He too is absconding. Most people here debate in anguish how Netaji and his minions just gave up the people--whether they won, or lost.I thought the debate on demonetisation and its impact was over, when a gentleman challenged me, saying, Forget the banks. Lets visit an ATM. Dogs wallow in them. That set off a general commotion--some for demonetisation, some against. Demonetisation does shadow the general debate, wherever one goes, though whether it would colour this election is not a given.To take the debate off it, and further, I cautiously probed, whether they got the right price for their crops. The answer was cryptic, bitter.Farmers here have been drowned in debt. The state promises loan waivers and promises fresh loans. But most have been caught in a vicious cycle of banks and moneylenders. It would have been better had we got a good price to clear our debts and were able to add broad base farming activity, said one. This area of western UP is known for the vicious web of private money lenders and the trauma of those caught in their web.See the irony. This is the area which sprung the politics of late Chaudhary Charan Singh. Many still mistake him for just a Jat leader. Its true that the Jats constituted his major vote base but he was the first to raise the issues of farmers, and over generations--right from the streets up to Parliament. This is again the heartland of the towering kisan leader Mahendra Singh Tikait whose one call was enough to make people spill into the streets. The issues then were as complex, as they are now.Leaders have come and gone. Elections too have come and gone. The state is in for another election but it would seem there is nobody to debate the issues of farmers any more. I asked, why is it so?The invectives which followed stunned.Why dont you put the issues before people who ask for your votes with as much stringency? I asked. The answers were many, the summary of which largely was that politicians just care for their own community, caste and creed. They hardly have the time or patience to talk to the last man.Custodians of caste and religion are now out with different slogans of development, while dwelling on caste configurations or raising the bogey of faith in danger.How much does all of this impact the voters? To understand, I ventured to ask people how they personally reacted to religion, caste and development, and which of them mattered most.They reacted with intelligence--it has to be security, then development. It does not require much to understand that by security they emphasise caste and religion. That could only reinforce the Muzaffarnagar model of politics that so shaped the past elections in these parts.MEN WHO MATTER IN MEERUT-SAHARANPUR ARC5 REASONS WHY REGION MATTERS1. Farmers in this arc make the backbone of politics and commerce. Mangoes from this area are exported in large number to several countries2. Meerut is the hub of sports culture and has the biggest bullion market in the state. Jaggery and iron industry of Muzaffarnagar make for a region speciality3. The arc has a mixed population. Jats, Gujjars, Tyagi, Thakur and Muslim community are largely well to do4. The area is economically much ahead of Poorvanchal with roads and power linking every village5. Meerut-Saharanpur area has 12 private and government universities, besides 10 medical colleges. 5 CHALLENGES IN THE REGIONLaw & Order: Muzaffanagar witnessed riots in 2013, Meerut in 1987.

5b2e171b9855b7245313dc7c,Tall Order to Keep Kids Away from Junk Food,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-safe-are-our-kids-tall-order-to-keep-them-away-from-junk-food/story-03mlmBkYLIl1RJHeWU8PiL.html,2017-02-08,"Parents can monitor what their children eat at home, but once they step out, healthy options dry up. Instead, childrens palate is assaulted with unhealthy food high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and low on essential nutrients they need to grow mentally and physically.Chips, sweetened beverages, instant noodles, fries, samosas, bread pakoras and patties are the standard fare in most school cafeterias. When schools ban them, enterprising vendors set up makeshift kiosks and sell meals-on-bicycles outside schools. With no running water or quality control for cooking and storing, most children end up with empty calories and very often, gut-destroying germs.All refined, fried and processed foods are just empty calories because most of the essential sugar and fat the body needs is present naturally in food, such as sugar in fruits and fat in dairy, seeds, nuts, meats and cooking oil, says Rahul Verma, founder of the Delhi-based non-profit Uday Foundation, which filed a PIL in the Delhi High Court in December 2010 asking for a ban on the sale of junk food in schools. Though traditional snacks are freshly made and do not have additives such as colour and preservatives added to them, they are usually high in low quality oils, salts and sugars, Verma underlines.In March 2015, the Delhi High Court asked the administrator of Delhi to issue healthy eating guidelines under Rule 43 of the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, and directed the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to formulate guidelines, which have since been circulated but are not binding.While many private schools in Delhi and Mumbai have not waited for government guidelines and moved towards healthier snacks years ago, Punjab, where the states child rights commission banned junk food in schools in January 2016, unhealthy foods are still widely available.Delhis Springdales School, Pusa Road, removed fried snacks and aerated drinks from their canteen menu a decade ago. The shift in the attitude occurred after a survey showed 70% of the students were overweight and were either suffering from associated conditions or would grow up to be unhealthy adults.Children have only one meal in school during recess. To make the child healthy over-all, we have to involve the parents. Too many children were getting two-minute noodles, fried potato taters or foods high on sugar and fats, says Ameeta Wattal, principal, Springdales, where poha, idli sambar and wholewheat sandwiches are sold along with drinks like lassi, chaach and lime juice.Read | Out of the box: Healthy eating is now part of school lunchroomsThese foods are also part of the cafeteria menu at Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, where the menu is changed periodically to include seasonal vegetables. The school also has a committee  consisting of teachers, students and some parents who work in the field of nutrition -- that monitor the nutrition value of the food, the taste and the oil it is cooked in. Our canteen is outsourced, but we strictly monitor it to make sure that the quality of the food is maintained, says Manohar Lal, principal of the school.In Lucknows La Martiniere Girls College, children are encouraged to eat more fruit and vegetables from kindergarten. The practice was introduced by our former principal Late Farida Abraham and it is still continuing, vice-principal Aashrita Dass told HT.In Mumbai, parents associations are sore at the lack of guidelines in Maharashtra. Schools receive cutbacks from vendors, and canteen contractors also prefer such items because it boosts their sales, says Jayant Jain, president, Forum for Fairness in Education, a parent-teacher body.Read | Boys in India eat better than girls: Oxford studyEven education officials admit they do not check whether schools serve junk food as there is no regulation against it so far. We cannot stop a school from serving junk food, as there is no official ban in place. We can at best advise them to opt for healthier choices, concedes BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai division.While many schools said it is difficult to restrict junk food in its vicinity, some have come up with innovative ways to restrict fast food in the campus: Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri serves fresh, hot and hygienic food breakfast and lunch on campus and doesnt allow home food to ensure parents dont send unhealthy food. Aerated drinks are banned.At Ryan International, Kandivali, teachers patrol the streets after school to ensure children walking out dont stop at the nearby McDonalds or other junk food joints.In government-run schools, the hot meals provided under the National Programme of Nutritional Support to Primary Education (Mid Day Meal Scheme) are nutritive and safe but remain a challenge in many districts. The scheme was launched to increase enrolment, retention and attendance while improving the nutrition levels of children by giving them 300 calories of energy, 8-12 gm of protein and adequate micronutrients.The meals were not good enough to keep children in school. A 2015 audit of the action taken on the Comptroller and Auditor Generals 2008 Report on Mid Day Meal Scheme showed that the enrolment of children in the midday meals-covered schools dropped from 14.69 crore in 2009-10 to 13.87 crore in 2013-14, while enrolment in private schools shot up by 38% in the same period.The audit also found children were given less than the prescribed quantity of 100/150 gms of foodgrains and prescribed inspections were not carried out to ensure quality. Most schools sample checked in the audit were lacking in infrastructural facilities like kitchen sheds, proper utensils, availability of drinking water facility etc. There were several instances of food being cooked in the open in unhygienic conditions, the report found.Few lessons seem to have been learnt from the shocking case of negligence that left 23 children dead and dozens others seriously ill after they ate a pesticide-laced midday-meal at a primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman in the Saran district in Bihar in July 2013. A month later, 30 children fell ill in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh; and in November 2014, 25 children fell ill after eating their mid-day meal at a government school in Gaya district in Bihar.In July 2016,40 students fell ill in Chincholi village of Adilabad district of Telangana after eating food prepared in the school kitchen for a farewell party for seniors. In September that year, 25 students were hospitalised in Kolar district in KarnatakaIn September 2015, about 150 students in Chandoor town and Ilapuram village in Telangana started vomiting after their mid-day meal.Such cases of food poisoning are very rare and take place in remote areas due to lack of proper supervision and maintenance of kitchen. Otherwise, there is a periodical check on the quality of food by officials, parents committees and teachers. Even we eat the same food regularly to ensure the quality, said L Ravinder Rao, a senior headmaster in a government school in Ranga Reddy district of Telangana."

After staying for nearly 30 years in Congress, Maharaj quit it in March 2014 and embraced BJP alleging that he was not given his due for the services rendered. He is now contesting his first election as BJP candidate as Hindustan Times catches up with him on the campaign trail in Chaubattakhal assembly constituency.His day starts with 45-minutes of meditation followed by a review of the work done till last night. He then checks out the days plan while leafing through newspapers and passing instructions to his team on how not to fall foul of the Election Commission.He spares 15 minutes for breakfast  dhokla, chutney and sugar free tea --- before leaving his office-cum-residence at Satpuli few minutes past 10 am to address the first election meeting of the day at Thanikhal village, 25 kms away.People have stopped farming in many parts of Chaubattakhal owing to destruction caused by wild animals and small land holdings, Maharaj tells HT. Agricultural land needs to be rejuvenated and better utilised, which is possible only after proper land consolidation. It will also help increase the farmland size in hill areas and check migration.As he reaches Thanikhal around 12.30 pm, he is welcomed by the local BJP workers with traditional Garhwali folk bands. He moves to a canopy raised nearby where locals from from nearby villages have gathered. Maharaj assures the villagers of creating new walnut and pomegranate orchards and introducing herbal farming after proper testing of soil. In his 25-minute speech, Maharaj talks of early completion of drinking water schemes and providing employment to locals via promotion of homestays for tourists. He also takes a dig at chief minister Harish Rawat over his saviour of Uttarakhand video that has gone viral.He then starts for Satpuli. On way, he stops at Ganikhal market and meets local shopkeepers requesting them to support BJP. Back in his SUV, he points towards the high tension transmission line running parallel to mountains. These can be hazardous for flying machines like helicopter and must be marked with coloured flags for identification. he says.He takes lunch at Satpuli and 30 minutes later sets off for another meeting at Kandakhal village on way to Lansdowne cantonment. Maharaj repeats the promises he made at Thanikhal but here his focus is mainly on checking migration. Our main effort will be to check migration from this area by providing employment generating entrepreneurship skills to the youths and assuring them minimum earning, says Maharaj.He also questions Congresss alliance with Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh saying the ruling party in the neighbouring state was responsible for unleashing atrocities on women who agitated for separate Uttarakhand. Harish Rawat who talks and swears by the hills, was scared to contest from hill constituency, he adds.Maharaj then leaves for another public meeting at Peeda village ahead of Kandahal, yet another area bearing the brunt of migration where population has come down by nearly 80% in the last 25 years. At Peeda, apart from land consolidation, migration and other local issues, Maharajs speech is focused on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and how demonetisation has reduced stone pelting at security forces in Jammu and Kashmir in addition to having demoralised the naxalites. We will make efforts to create, Shakya, Shaiva and Vishnu circuits as important religious tourist zones in the state if voted to power, says Maharaj ending the speech with appeal for pressing the lotus button.He joins local BJP workers for tea before leaving for party office at Satpuli as the sun sets in."

Sources say fielding him from the Shirsufal-Gunwadi constituency in the Pune zilla parishad elections was a conscious decision on the part of the Pawar family. However, his entry into politics was a low-profile event.The late Appasaheb is highly respected in Maharashtra for his contributions to the development of the farm sector. Rohits father, Rajendra, is also respected for work performed through the Baramati Krishi Vikas Pratishthan.Sharads mother, Shardabai, was a member of the local board in the pre-Independence era. The NCP chief, who launched his political career by being elected as an MLA from Baramati in 1967, has been in politics for five decades now.Others in his family  daughter Supriya Sule and nephew Ajit Pawar  have also found their calling in the profession.At present, the Pawars are locked in a gritty battle to protect their traditional bastions of Baramati and Pune. The first indication of a decline in their hold over the two constituencies came in 2014, when Supriya Sule managed to retain the Baramati Lok Sabha seat with a relatively small margin of 70,000 votes. On the other hand, she had won the 2009 Lok Sabha elections with a margin of over three lakh votes.In 2014 assembly elections, Ajit secured 28,000 less votes as compared to the 2009 polls.Elections held to municipal councils over the last two months continued to show a similar trend. Anti-Pawar forces managed to win every municipal council election conducted in the vicinity of Baramati, including Daund, Indapur, Saswad and Shirur. In the Baramati municipal council, the ruling BJP managed to win four seats for the very first time.The Pawar family is now struggling to retain its hold over the Pune Municipal Corporation, the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and the Pune Zilla Parishad. Several NCP leaders in Pune have joined the BJP over the last few months, making survival seem even more difficult for the family.Now, it remains to be seen whether Rohit can reverse the dipping fortunes of the Pawar family."

He also made a reference to slaughterhouses, in a joke, juxtaposing it with a specific caste.An aggrieved elderly citizen belonging to the Jat community once visited our office to register his complaint. He told me that one morning, while he was carrying his sugarcanes in a bullock cart to the nearby market for sale, he stopped mid-way to buy guavas. When he came back with the guavas, his bull was missing. I told him to register a complaint with the police because the UP police was already tracking Azam Khans lost buffaloes. But then he revealed that his bull was stolen by the slaughterhouse people, Shah said.As the crowd cheered to his dog-whistle narrative, Shah announced that the BJP, when it is voted to power, will come down on slaughterhouses from Day 1. When BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, we will ban all unregulated slaughterhouses on Day 1, Shah said.Shahs speech also evoked the Dadri lynching incident, in which an unruly mob had lynched a Muslim man to his death, over allegations of cow slaughter. Bisada, the village where the incident took place, is located around 20km from Noida.In 2016, several incidents were reported across the Hindi heartland, in which cow vigilantes had beaten up meat transporters. The Bisada lynching and the cow vigilantism had attracted nationwide attention and saw BJP on the back foot as the party, including the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier campaigned heavily against bovine slaughter.Even in 2014, during the Lok Sabha elections, party president Amit Shah and BJP leaders Sangeet Som and Sanjeev Balyan had faced criticism for their inflammatory speeches in western UP belt, in the wake of the Muzaffarnagar riots. Around 60 people were killed in the riots and thousands have been displaced.Shah also attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav saying that he asks for the caste and religion of the people before giving them free laptops. He said that only his party will not discriminate people on their caste or religion.Akhilesh Yadav promised free laptops to the youth of UP but have the Noida youth received any? It is because Yadav asks for your caste and religion before handing out laptops. We will never ask your caste before giving free laptops, Shah said.In his thirty-minute speech, Shah discussed issues ranging from the development of the state, job creation for youth to cow slaughter and anti-Romeo squads to safeguard women.We will ensure that our girls are safe in the state from the Samajwadi Party goons. Every police station will have anti-Romeo squads, which will hang these SP goons upside down and teach them a lesson, Shah said."

CM sahab to neta hain, der ho he jati hai (CM is a political leader and delays are bound to happen).With next 10 minutes, chief minister Harish Rawat arrives, with staff and Congress poll managers, over two hours late from his scheduled departure. He goes through the days appointments and instructs leaders on what to share with media over the next two days.As the chopper takes off, Rawats son Virendra serves brunch  cabbage sabzi, chapatti and dahi. This food will drive CM for another 12 hours. I prefer simple food.

Its a do or die battle for the 69-year-old who managed top save his government even as nine party MLAs rebelled against him last March. His days programme is fixed for Udham Singh Nagar district that has nine assembly seats. Rawat is contesting from two seats, including Kichha in Udham Singh Nagar. BJP has fielded Congress turncoats at two seats  Jaspur and Bajpur.Chief Minister Harish Rawat campaigns with local candidate Manoj Joshi in Kashipur . (Anupam Trivedi/ HT Photo)At Jaspur, the crowd goes berserk. BJP ko sabak sikha kar hi dam lenge sahab (well teach the BJP a lesson), they shout as the chopper lands. Having an experience of five decades in active politics, CM senses the public mood. He takes position atop an SUV and starts the roadshow, waving hands, and accepting sweets and garlands while moving through the narrow lanes of Jaspur, which has 1.3 lakh voters including 32,000 Muslims and 18,000 Chauhans.BJP thought we have gone bankrupt (after three-time local MLA joined the saffron party), says Rawat. He is hopeful that political greenhorn Adesh Chauhan has a good chance in this constituency, bordering Uttar Pradesh.The next stopover is Kashipur. In 2012 polls, a rebel had eaten into the Congress votes here, but this time it is the BJP that is facing the problem with its former MLA Rajeev Agarwal contesting as an independent. The constituency has a mix of Muslim, Kumaoni and Sikh voters. Congresss Manoj Joshi had lost last polls by 2,200 votes. He is again in the fray. Manoj lag jao, ye tempo banaye rakho (maintain the tempo), CM instructs.Rawat spends maximum time in Bajpur. BJP has fielded Congress turncoat Yashpal Arya from the seat.As Rawat speaks, Harvinder Singh, a Sikh farmer listens patiently. He nods his head when CM says, Bhajpa wale Congress mein sahara dhoond rahe hain (BJP is looking for support from Congress leaders).Bajpur, an SC reserved seat, is traditionally a Congress stronghold. Harvinder says he will stick with Congress. Rais Ahmad, a Muslim labourer, seconds Harvinder.The game-changerPeople used to say we have no chance in Bajpur but we proved them wrong. We have changed the rules of the game, Rawat tells HT.Congress has fielded Sunita Bajwa, wife of a Sikh BJP leader who joined Congress last month. Sunita hails from an SC family. This seat too has a mix of Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs and Tharus (tribals).Rawat stops every 50-70 meters. He exchanges greetings with the crowd near national highways. He is spending a good amount of time in two districts  US Nagar and Haridwar, which together have 20 seats. In 2012 polls BJP won 11 of these seats.Babuji (father) is full of energy. He never gives up. We want to become like him, Rawats son says as others try to keep pace with him.Its 9.30pm when CM addresses another meeting at Sultanpur Patti. He takes a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi referring him as Dilli wale Baba. I came to know that achhe din (good days) are stuck in Delhis traffic, Rawat says as the crowd cheers. He also talks about notebandi (demonetisation) here. Though demonetisation is not a political issue in the hills, it matters in the plains, where a large number of people survive on daily earnings.No breaks for CMCM refuses to take a break. Sipping sugar free black tea while travelling, Rawat speaks to Congress strategists Kumari Shailja and Ambika Soni and central observers. He fixes a programme of party vice president Rahul Gandhi before switching back to local issues.He takes feedback on Sitarganj seat from where former CM Vijay Bahugunas son is contesting on a BJP ticket. Congress has fielded a Bengali local female candidate from this seat. At 11pm, CM visits the house of a former MLA Premanand Mahajan. After 20 minutes both come out happily.Life of a neta is like this, Rawat tells this correspondent with smile on his face.When its 15 minutes past midnight, his cavalcade reaches Haldwani. As we call it a day, the CM gets busy again with his colleagues planning the next days schedule."

He alleged that an alliance between the two will give rise to more corruption.Shah led an attack on the construction of the Agra-Lucknow Expressway developed by the SP government. He said that highways being constructed by the Central government cost nearly 18 crore per kilometre, while the Agra-Lucknow Expressway cost nearly 31 crore per kilometre.I want to ask Akhilesh where 13 crore went... whether it went to the uncle or the nephew. During the 10-year rule of the Congress, many scams came to light. Now, the Congress has come together with Akhilesh. There is something called law and order. But in UP, there is lo and order karo (take and give orders, alleging corruption), he said.He claimed that one party looted the nation while the other looted the state. He also questioned the SP about the development that it took after the Central Government sent nearly 2.5 lakh crore to the state.Shah was in the textile hub in Pilkhuwa and arrived in support of former MP Dr RC Tomar who is contesting from the Dhaulana assembly segment and pitted against SPs sitting MLA Dharmesh Tomar.During the last 15 years, the state has also suffered on account of the repeated governments of the SP and the Bahujan Samaj Party. If you got to the BJP-ruled states, you will see the development for yourself but your state has lagged behind. I have been roaming around in UP for six months now, and there is a similar Modi wave in UP like there was in the 2014 elections, he said.He also attacked the law and order situation in the state and cited the example of killing of policemen in violent incidents at Jawahar Bagh in Mathura in June last year.Once, the BJP comes to power, we will get all illegally occupied land freed up from mafia within 15 days. We will get the pending payment of sugarcane farmers done within a time frame. I have come to know that there is pending payment to be made to farmers in Dhaulana , amounting to nearly 200 crore.

The entire operation was filmed.Farmers spotted the cubs while working in the fields on Wednesday morning. Forest officials moved the cubs away from the area to avoid a situation where the mother could run into people while searching for her babies.It is not uncommon to spot leopards in this area, as there are sugarcane fields that provide safe cover to the cats. But this also gives rise to conflict situations when farmers harvest the sugarcane, said Sanjay Gaikwad, forest officer from the area. We received a distress call from the village and a team was dispatched.Forest officials rescue the cubs. (Wildlife SOS)Forest officials, veterinarians form Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre (MLRC) and representatives from NGO Wildlife SOS reached the place to help the cubs. After conducting a meticulous veterinary examination for parasites and injuries, the cubs were found to be in good health and fit for release, said Dr Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinarian, MLRC.Forest officers were informed that an adult female leopard had been spotted in the vicinity. After they were sure that this was the mother, the team put the cubs in boxes and placed them in the field where the leopard was last seen. We also placed two remote controlled camera traps to document the cubs and the reunion, said Gaikwad.Officials put the cubs in baskets and place them where the mother was last seen. (Wildlife SOS)After a two-and-half-hour wait, the team heard the mothers calls as it looked for her cubs. After checking her cubs, she carefully carried them by the scruff of the neck and moved back into the forest, said Deshmukh. Over the past eight years, we have seen many rescue operations but for the first time, witnessing a leopard family being reunited was an emotional moment for us.Over the past eight years, the state forest department has successfully reunited 60 leopard cubs with their mothers that were lost, injured or separated.The leopard came looking for the cubs, picked them up by the scruffs and carried them off. (Wildlife SOS)Forest officers added that female leopards find the tall and densely cultivated sugarcane fields good sites to give birth to and rear cubs. The issue is that when they go hunting, they leave their babies behind, said Gaikwad.Past instances of leopard cubs being reunited with their motherJanuary 9, 2017 - A three-month-old female leopard cub was rescued from a sugarcane field at Nasik, Maharashtra. After several attempts by the forest department to reunite the cub with its mother went in vain, forest officials transferred the cub to the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Center that currently houses 32 leopards.November 14, 2016 - In a 13-hour rescue operation, three two-month-old leopard cubs were successfully reunited with their mother by forest officials on Sunday at a farm near Vadgaon Rasai village, in Shirur, almost 80 kilometres away from Pune.September 17, 2016 - A one-and-half-month-old male leopard cub, separated from its mother, was rescued and reunited from a sugarcane field near Sangamner, Ahmednagar district, by forest officials.July 5, 2015  Forest officials rescued a three-month-old leopard cub from a dry well at Vadgaon Anand village in Junnar taluka, Pune district and reunited it with the mother after a 10-hour rescue operation.May 4, 2015 - Wildlife authorities at Narayangaon range in Junnar reunited four leopard cubs separated from their mother early, after treating them at a local rescue centre.(Source: Maharashtra Forest Department)READ MOREIn Mumbai: Oldest captive resident of SGNP, female leopard Krishna dies at 18"
