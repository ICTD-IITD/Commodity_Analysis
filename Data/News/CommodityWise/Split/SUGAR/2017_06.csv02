Ask Those Who Voted for Modi",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-the-achhe-din-ask-those-who-voted-for-modi/story-zSkharcZSfHdLRtDtwd5UJ.html,2017-02-05,"Rocking the youngest of his five children in his arms, street vendor Daata Ram watches his wife tend to two sick cows whose milk once supplemented their meagre income.The 66-year-olds family of seven survives on what he now makes by selling small quantities of puffed rice in Pandra Sikanpur, a one-street, hardscrabble town of 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh.I took a loan of Rs 30,000 to buy those cows but I think they are no good now, says Ram, who uses a fourth of his monthly earnings of Rs5000-6000 to repay the local moneylender.Across the street from Rams thatched hut is the sprawling house of Neeraj Kumar Singh, a well-off sugarcane farmer who lost multiple crops to back-to-back droughts three years ago, and then suffered when farm prices crashed last year.It takes two harvesting seasons to recover the loss of one, says Singh who wants his sons to find jobs outside farming so that their lives wouldnt be held ransom to the vagaries of nature.But his four children have found no jobs, and the 60-year-old farmer is angry that he must now divide his 10 acres of cropland to secure their future.Daata Ram and Singh sit on different points on the countrys income spectrum but, in their collective discontent, the two symbolise the rising pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver on his emotive election vow to bring achhe din, or good times, to Indians.The Feb. 1 budget was a chance for Modi to unveil measures that would fulfil his 2014 guarantee of growth and more jobs, a task made all the more tough by his abrupt decision to drain out 86% of all cash in the economy in his fight against illicit wealth.Its also a challenge that is urgent, given that Modi has already crossed the halfway point of his tenure.Read | Budget 2017: Akhilesh says BJP could not fulfil promise of achhe dinTo his admirers, though, Modi has already made great strides  from reinvigorating the ossified hand of a government system that hobbled progress to biting the bullet on tough decisions needed to pull Indias economy out of a dangerous morass.Many of his moves on inclusive, accountable governance and a freer hand to bureaucracy have resonated well with Indians tired of a rudderless government mired in corruption scandals and whose indecisiveness had left more than 700 major industry projects in limbo.Rambir Rathi , a Uttar Pradesh farmer at home (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Growing economySome of that good work is showing.The countrys annualised retail inflation is below the mid-point of the central banks target; public finances are better than before with higher income from taxes, monsoon-sown grain production is the highest in at least 14 years and the economy is more open to business than it has ever been. In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal. (Mujeeb Faruqui/HT PHOTO)Nothing has changed. It seems there is nobody to follow Modijis principles of hard work and integrity. Corruption is rampant . It seems there is no monitoring system in the country. I am hugely disappointed, says Omprakash Sethia of Bhopal.I thought there would be a boom on the job front but despite emphasis on digital India I dont see many job avenues, says Subhanshu Sethia, a commerce student in Bhopal.The demonetisation move worsened the plight of the vulnerably placed in the labour market in several ways, the most stress arising out of closure of establishments in the informal sector.Back in Pandra Sikanpur, Singh says he will think twice about voting for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the next general elections scheduled for 2019.That view is far from universal, but is already on the radar of a government, which swept to power with promises of economic reforms and pro-business policies that appealed to aspirational Indians living in big towns and cities.Modi has already started turning his attention to the hinterlands. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election. Where are those jobs? he asks.I know how I feel is how many many more Indians feel.(With inputs from Ranjan Srivastava and Sumanta Ray Chaudhuri)"
5b2e1aa39855b7245313e026,?Killer? Litchi the Cause of Mysterious Disease Plaguing Children of Muzaffarpur,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/killer-litchi-the-cause-of-mysterious-disease-plaguing-children-of-muzaffarpur/story-S95TsejrWeqzN1D74CVjfJ.html,2017-02-02,"Since 1995, every year a mysterious disease has been haunting Muzaffarpur in Bihar, in which large numbers of children would get feverish, then proceed to having seizures and convulsions and finally slipping in and out of consciousness. Scores of researchers and experts have launched exhaustive searches to find the root cause of this deadly disease, but to no avail. Until now.In 2014, hundreds of children were admitted to hospital with symptoms of this illness, locally called as chamki ki bimari, or tinsel disease. Of 390 admitted for treatment, 122 died, reports CNN.A new report published in The Lancet Global Health medical journal, claims to have discovered the source of the disease, which is the litchi fruit.The illness, whose symptoms are said to resemble encephalitis, have several factors contributing to it including, heat, humidity, malnourishment and pesticides.Researchers from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Indias National Centre for Disease Control compared test results of children who had developed the mysterious illness, and children who had not.According to the study, most the sick children had consumed the fruit recently and were also six times more likely to have visited a fruit orchard in the last 24 hours.Muzaffarpur, is the largest litchi farming region in India.The results said that children who fell ill were twice as likely to have skipped dinner, which, according to the researchers probably resulted in night-time hypoglycaemia.However, urine samples showed that two-thirds of the ill children showed evidence of exposure to toxins found in lychee seeds -- found in higher levels in unripe fruits.In the presence of these toxins glucose synthesis is severely impaired, the study said, leading to dangerously low blood sugar and brain inflammation in the children.Following the developments, the Centre had issued a statement advising children to henceforth minimise litchi fruit consumption in affected areas, and eat an evening meal during the outbreak period."

Film producer Dr Satish Rai, a Girmitiya with roots in Uttar Pradesh, is all set to make a movie on the subject.This first-of-its-kind film, titled Awaaz  the Girmit Conspiracy, has already received clearance from the UP government.Rai is a Sydney-based film producer, academician, politician and community development worker who has been holding talks with the UP government on issues concerning Girmitiyas. It was in 2015, during the first ever Pravasi Diwas organised by the state government that the idea to shoot a movie on the subject first came to me, he said.A big chunk of the film will be shot in UP, the worst-affected state during the dreadful indenture system (1828 to 1916), under which millions of Indians were herded off to British colonies to work as bonded labourers in cane plantations - the most profitable business of those times.Rai said the movie will primarily focus on the movements that were launched to abolish the indenture system - a form of slavery. This film will cover the epic story of the international struggles that were launched to abolish the dreadful system of labour trafficking. It will largely focus on the battle to bring back thousands of stranded indentured Indians in Fiji and the international conspiracy to prevent them from returning to their homes so that theyd continue working as cheap labour in Fiji, he said.SLAVERY AS INDENTURE SYSTEMAfter the British Slavery Abolition Act came into force, eliminating slavery throughout the empire, a new avatar of the malpractice was introduced in the form of the indenture system. It was a sort of debt bondage in which around 1.2 million Indians were deported to Fiji to work in cane farms. The majority of these people were from UP - from places like Gonda, Basti, Faizabad, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Rae Bareli and other districts, said Rai, who is also an active member of the International Girmit Association.While the movie will be a work of fiction, it will be based on historical research and will features characters of internationally renowned public figures such as Pt Totaram Sanadhya, Kunti, Mahatma Gandhi, Annie Besant, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Sarojini Naidu, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Winston Churchill, Edward Knox and Thomas Hughes. Pt Totaram Sanadhya and Kunti were two indentured Indians in Fiji who returned in 1914 to join the abolition movement and be at the forefront of the struggle, said Rai.The shooting will start after the UP assembly election. At present, I am shooting another film  Vijaypath - a road to victory, he added.Rais grandparents were deported from Faizabad to Fiji with their two young sons in 1911. The film producer said that he struggled for almost a decade before he managed to trace a kin of his in UP in 2004. I finally found my grandparents cousin who lives in Sridutt Ganj in Balrampur district with his four sons, he said."

In Gurdaspur, where hes from, he says the families of fallen soldiers have been given a raw deal. The widows of those martyred in last years terror attack in Pathankot  the border town where hes headed  are still running from pillar to post for their compensation, he claims.Driving his truck through the electorally significant Doaba region, Sukhbir and his assistant, Gagandeep, survey a landscape that, they say, has been chronically maladministered.As the winter morning breeze makes the cabin colder, the two get agitated in tandem, recounting their litany of woes in poll-bound Punjab.The son of an ex-army man, Sukhbir is a class 12th pass out. His immediate surrounding never held out hope and he is employed as a low-paid helper in a truck and gets to drive occasionally when the driver opts to take rest.Driven by despair, many in his village have left: his younger brother Jaspreet is waiting for a medical test before he can attempt to go abroad.Sukhbir has no means to escape the dreary existence, and hopes that the assembly elections on February 4 will change things for the better for people like him.He and Gagandeep differ on the possible outcome of the polls. Gagandeep feels the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will win. Sukhbir is not so sure which of the two  AAP or Congress  will emerge victorious, though he agrees that the Badals will lose due to anger against the ruling family.Truck tales part 1 | Punjab election: Who are the truckers voting for?The two men, however, agree on one thing  Punjab desperately requires a surgical strike to set right the wrongs. And both feel that residents of Doaba  the region with 23 seats  will determine Punjabs future course in great measure.A large number of AAP supporters from abroad have begun campaigning in Doaba, also famous as the NRI belt.Sukhbir, on the contrary, says the Congress led by Captain Amarinder Singh has an edge. The party had won 6 of the 23 seats in 2012 and hopes to improve its tally. It has fielded sugar baron Rana Gurjit Singh  Punjabs richest candidate  from Kapurthala.The duo pulls up at a roadside dhaba in Machiwara for lunch and other drivers join them in an animated discussion on the polls, spicing up the food on the table.Manjeet Singh, 47, a trucker for 26 years, is angry with the Badals, so much so that he blames the ruling family for taking credit for roads built by the Union government.A government driver is paid Rs 20,000 and a private driver barely makes half that amount despite working for 24 hours. We also have children to raise. We want change too, no matter who comes to power, he says.Deep in Doaba, drug abuse is an issue thats topping the election agenda alongside unemployment. Most of its residents blame the administration for the festering menace.Why do drivers have to depend on drugs to travel in the night. The demand will decrease if the supply is reduced, suggests Gagandeep as Sukhbir gets the documents and the vehicle checked at a check post.As the truck travels past a police training camp in Jalandhar, the conversation between the two turns to corruption and nepotism.Punjabis either want to do farming or join the army or police force. Under Badal rule, even a 7-ft high candidate is not selected while a 5-ft gets a job in police, just because he is close to the ruling family, Sukhbir says as the truck crosses the toll plaza at Tanda.The issues confronting Doaba have been crying out for redressal since long. Politicians and their parties have promised solutions in the past but failed to deliver, resulting in voter fatigue.Nearly 400 km into their journey stretching 23 hours, both Gagandeep and Sukhbir are visibly tired. An agreement still eludes them on who will win. Then they decide to let it go: Ki farq painda paaji. Chalani to truck hi hai na (How does it matter who comes to power. We will continue to drive trucks anyway, Sukhbir sighed, as Pathankot neared."

There has been experience of imposing labels on junk food in some countries part of one of the recommendation on the food, said the FSSAI chief.Pawan Kumar Agarwal, CEO of Foods Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). (via Livemint)The FSSAI came into prominence after the Nestle Maggi fiasco, soon after which Agarwal joined as its CEO. An officer with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Agarwal, sees a huge requirement to make people aware and educate them about food, and help them follow a healthy diet.In the past, he has brought large temples and mosques under the regulators surveillance. Shree Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai, Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Tirupati and Sai Baba temple in Shirdi, follow safety standards for the Prasad or bhog that they offer to its devotees.The regulators move to introduce junk food label comes at a time when India is going through an era of higher degree of urbanisation. A large number of small towns and cities are being exposed to the American burgers and Italian pastas, and millions of kids are acquiring new tastes. This has led to a debate on introducing a fat tax on junk food.There is a larger problem  obesity. India ranks third after the US and China, with 41 million obese people, according to Global Burden of Disease Study.To control the growing problem, FSSAI had set up a committee to prepare guidelines on healthy diet for Indians. The committee has made eight recommendations in the report, and a lot of it is about public education, Agarwal added.So will there be a special label for junk food? Agarwal said it is under consideration and a final decision will be taken soon.FSSAIs bigger problem will be to regulate local shops selling Indian fried snacks such as samosa and cutlets. That is the challenge There are practical difficulties in the Indian context for street food. You can do it in potato chips, but if someone sells a samosa on the street, it is difficult, Agarwal said.However, Agarwal is not giving up yet. Based on the committee report, he has chaired multiple discussions to see how street food vendors can be regulated. We are applying our mind because there is a lot of public interest Large, vocal and articulate consumer organisations say that something should be done, but the practical problems have to be taken into consideration, Agarwal said."

We feel that the crushing will yield more sweet than molasses, but as a ruling party there are several who have lined up at the BJPs footsteps to have a share of the tilgul.Both the Sena and BJP are preparing ground to contest independently in case the seat-sharing talks fail, and are already training their guns against each other ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls.The Sena added, the BJP has never let go a single opportunity to criticise parties such as the Congress, the NCP, Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, Lalu Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress and so on for harbouring people with criminal records.People think it is the BJP that can clean the murky Ganga of national politics, and the Modi-led party will cleanse the countrys political system. But such things are happening that make one wonder if the tilgul is a bite of sugar or stones that can break teeth, the Sena said.The party cited the recent induction of 91-year-old Narayan Dutt Tiwari from the Congress fold. Tiwari, a loyalist of the Gandhi family, has been the chief minister of two states, a Union minister and a Governor, though he had to resign after a sex scandal.The BJP should come clean as to how Tiwaris experience and guidance is going to exactly benefit the party, the Saamana editorial said.READ MOREBJP, Shiv Sena go on a poaching spreeBMC polls: Uddhav Thackeray mum on tie-up with BJP, announces sops"

Of the various idiosyncrasies our families have with their eating habits. Well, my immediate and extended family is definitely blessed with these crazy virtues, at times even freaking out the servers at restaurants, cafes and coffee shops.Have you ever heard about a warm cold coffee? I am sure you havent because a warm cold coffee is a cold coffee, which is microwaved for 10 seconds. Thats what my younger brother orders, sending almost every waiter into a tizzy, unless of course the waiter has a younger sibling with similar demands.This is just the tip of the iceberg. How about plain cornflakes, with sliced banana? And, of course, no milk with it. Thats my favourite these days, a recipe I invented on the Kalka-Delhi Shatabadi. Bhaji, eh dudh vi dindey ney (they also provide milk), said my co-passenger a tad upset with a Singh not drinking milk. And moreover, I wasnt even doing paisa vasooli because the butter cube was also lying idle.Sir, I also eat porridge without milk. I boil it in water, I replied. But yes, my fathers Mamaji (maternal uncle) is a great milk fan. A professor emeritus at the Panjab University, he drinks a glass of milk with Papaya chunks in it, I added. That my co-passenger had got a new fruity milk recipe was clearly visible when he finally started focusing on his breakfast. I knew I had built his appetite.Pity that he backed off soon because what I failed to tell him was my love for caramel custard with chicken curry. Since I dont have a sweet tooth and I love caramel custard, the only way I can savour it to maintain the right balance is either with chicken curry or dal. For your kind information, I dont add sugar to my coffee or tea to make it sweet. I add a bit of sugar just to remove the phikka (bland) taste. Ask the Sector-11 coffee shop folks and theyll explain exactly what I mean by removing the phikka. In other words, the sweet dish in our house is virtually sweetless and food saltless.Im glad my wife is not around while Im writing this column. Otherwise she would have cringed and complained about how I prefer cakes without oil and butter. She refuses to commit such sacrilege, a great baker that she is. She also hates my idea of cooking a rajma-chawal biryani, nor does she approve of us serving air-fried (in an air fryer) okra, aubergine, zucchini and long gourd to our guests. This is torturing them, she says.It seems that I had let off my brother easily because joining me as I write this column is my son. I have seen chacha eating a bhartha (aubergine mash) sandwich. Yuck, he says, without realising that he has given his dad a new sandwich idea other than jam toast stuffed with fried egg. No, wonder this teenager refuses to go out with me to diners or restaurants. Dad, who orders a lamb cheese burger without cheese? is a question he consistently asks me whenever I have the privilege of his company. And you ruin the spicy chicken burger by asking them to serve it without mayonnaise. Yuck, he says again, after which I narrate him an incident at a fast food joint in Denver, America, when I asked for a double whopper in plain buns without cheese and mayonnaise.You aint got anything in it. Just take it free, replied the Hispanic sales girl, apparently disgusted with my order. Punjab goes to the polls on February 4. Please dont make a hash of it like the chicken khichdi that I love. Vote decisively for a better and tasteful Punjab.(nsinghkhushwant@hotmail.com)"

Now its time to focus on social infrastructure. With increase in revenue generation, our government will focus on adopting means to create more job avenues, he said.Besides increasing benefits under the atta-dal scheme by adding 2-kg desi ghee and 5-kg sugar per month at subsidised rates to blue-card holders, the manifesto promises to increase the retirement age of government employees to 60.On the lines of the Congress, the BJP has also promised to provide one job per family in the entire state, with the slogan Ek Parivar, Ek Rozgar.Going beyond the promise made by the Congress and the AAP to provide 5-marla plots to homeless Dalits and backward classes, the party has promised 5-marla to 8-marla plots.The manifesto proposes no new schemes for industries, just promising extension of the existing ones. Besides promising to make complaint redressal board accountable for empowering industries, the party said it will speed up repayment of value-added tax (VAT).Since we are contesting polls in an alliance, our manifesto has been prepared after due consultation with the Akali leadership, said state BJP chief Vijay Sampla."

As such, the proposals are expected to have a huge captive market.S Sidharth, principal secretary, industries department, said, Several proposals for rice mills and units based on fly ash have also been cleared. It is indicative of entrepreneurs desire to be present in sectors where the demand exists and has a potential to grow.The state is set to have a huge supply of fly ash as by-product from thermal power units, both the existing ones and several new units coming up. Similarly, five projects for manufacturing LPG cylinders and setting up LPG bottling plant also came up for consideration, apparently to tap the potential thrown open by the Centres Ujjwala scheme.A Rs 97-crore ethanol project of Majhaulia Sugar Industries Pvt Ltd was also cleared. It aims to take advantage of revised ethanol off-take policy of the Centre to encourage its blending with petrol in excess of 10% benchmark.A project aiming to leverage Bihars maize producing capacity as a summer crop came in the form of a starch manufacturing plant at Thakurganj by a Kolkata-based company and another, for hallmarked jewellery, by Ankur Jewellers, were also cleared.We have been able to take up all online applications submitted till January 11 for consideration.

SMS and e-mail would be sent to 109 entrepreneurs whose projects have been approved.Stage 1 approval will be followed by stage 2 clearance at the principal secretary level, for projects up to Rs 2.5 crore and at the ministers level for up to Rs 10 crore projects, while Rs 10-20 crore worth of projects will be approved jointly by finance and industries minister.Anything above it would go to the cabinet.Stage 3 will see time bound approvals within 30 days by concerned departments or lead to deemed approval by principal secretary, industries, while the last stage clearance at the production level would entitle a unit to claim post production subsidy."

High on local brew, these tuskers have run amok, damaging settlements and claiming over 50 lives last year alone.Some villagers have heeded the advisory, many are still reluctant, according to forest department officials conducting awareness drives against homemade liquor. Elephant herds come sniffing from more than 10km away for the pungent beverages, said Naved Shujauddin, divisional forest officer of Surajpur.Sashi Bhushan Kirketta, a resident of Neematoli village of Jashpur district, is among those who have decided to quit brewing the liquor. We have stopped brewing liquor from mahua (a nectar-rich flower) because of elephants. Whoever is still brewing it is ensuring it is sold quickly to avoid storing it in the village. Kirketta acknowledged people always knew homemade liquor caught the fancy of elephants, but their incursions had become too frequent and destructive to ignore.Apart from entering villages while foraging for food  particularly jackfruit, sugarcane and paddy  elephants also get drawn to mahua sharaab and paddy-based drinks favoured by tribals. Their forays often lead to houses being destroyed and even deaths.Though a comprehensive official report is awaited, more than 50 people died across Chhattisgarh in human-elephant conflict in 2016, said an official who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.The fatalities marked a rise from 2015 when, according to forest department data, 44 people died in human-animal conflict. Such conflicts are routinely reported from Jashpur, Balrampur, Surguja, Surajpur, Dharamjaigarh, Raigarh and Korba regions.Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha have 10% of the elephants in India but, on an average, account for approximately 65% of human casualty due to the human-elephant conflict, according to a Greenpeace report.Forest guards are at the forefront of the governments awareness drives against homemade liquor. They are engaging youth under the Hathi Mitra Dal (friends of elephants) programme and also training them on preventing elephant attacks and good practices, said Manoj Pandey, divisional forest officer (DFO), Jashpur. Hathi Mitra Dals abound in north Chhattisgarh.Senior forest department officers said the human-elephant conflict in the northern parts started in the late 1980s when 18 elephants migrated from neighbouring Jharkhand (then a part of Bihar) and Odisha. These officers estimate the number of elephants in the region has now swelled to more than 300.Bilaspur-based wildlife activist Neetu Gupta blames the human-elephant conflict on decreasing forest cover because of mining and development projects. Incidentally, Sarguja, Raigarh and Korba have nearly 100% of the coal reserves of Chhattisgarh. Wildlife activists claim most mining areas are on routes elephants use."

The center acts as a transit home for injured cats or others trapped after they were found in human habitations.According to the forest department, there is an increase in leopard sightings during the harvest season. Female leopards find these tall dense fields a suitable shelter for giving birth and rearing their cubs but since farmers fear for their life, they scare away the mother, said a local forest official from Nashik. We have observed numerous instances where the mothers abandon their cubs, never to return.On early morning December 26, the cub was spotted by farmers from near Chapadgaon village, Nashik while they were harvesting their crop. The cub was shivering when we found him and immediately informed the forest department, said Vilas Darade, sugarcane farmer from Chapadgaon.Veterinarians from Wildlife SOS and forest officials spent a week waiting for the mother to come back to the spot by isolating the cub, especially at night. However, she did not return, said officials. Young leopards, especially less than six-months old, cannot survive on their own. The chief wildlife warden of the forest department decided to place it under the permanent care of Wildlife SOS, said Yuvraj Mohite, assistant conservator of forest, Nashik.The baby leopard is quite active, said Ajay Deshmukh, veterinarian, Wildlife SOS. A preliminary medical examination was conducted and she was checked for external parasites and injuries.He added that she was lucky to have completed the cycle where she required her mothers milk on a daily basis. We have currently kept her on a solid diet and she loves eating chicken. We will continue to monitor her health as baby leopards are very susceptible to various health issues and are quite delicate at this age, said Deshmukh. We will have to hand-rear her as she cannot be returned back to the wild.Past instances of leopard cubs being reunited with their mothersNovember 14, 2016 - In a 13-hour rescue operation, three two-month-old leopard cubs were successfully reunited with their mother by forest officials on Sunday at a farm near Vadgaon Rasai village, in Shirur district of Maharashtra, almost 80 kilometres away from Pune.September 17, 2016 - A one-and-half-month-old male leopard cub, separated from its mother, was rescued and reunited from a sugarcane field near Sangamner, Ahmednagar district, by forest officials.July 5, 2015  Forest officials rescued a three-month-old leopard cub from a dry well at Vadgaon, Anand village in Junnar taluka, Pune district and reunited it with the mother after a 10-hour rescue operation.May 4, 2015 - Wildlife authorities at Narayangaon range in Junnar in Pune district reunited four leopard cubs separated from their mother early, after treating them at a local rescue centre.(Source: Maharashtra Forest Department)Also read: At 14.4C, Wednesday was coldest day in Mumbai this winter"
5b2e1f879855b7245313e530,Are Maratha Protests in Maharashtra Losing Steam?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/are-maratha-protests-in-maharashtra-losing-steam/story-fyoZnPdLTwDJSAO5HCW1lN.html,2017-01-09,"By late September 2016, the silent Maratha protests had reached a crescendo in the state with nearly 20 districts  more than one third of Maharashtra  covered by agitators demanding reservation in jobs and education for the community.The protests by the dominant community that makes up 32% of Maharashtras population had rattled the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, even as rumours about his ouster started making rounds in political circles.Just four months later, the Maratha protests, seem to have lost its steam with Fadnavis-led government having the last laugh. On Sunday, in an indication that the protest organisers are confused, the plan to conduct a mega march in Mumbai on January 31 was put on hold, fearing a tepid response. The organisers fear that the ensuing code of conduct for the local elections including the crucial Mumbai civic polls will hamper their supporters  engaged in campaigning for their respective parties  from putting up a strong show of strength.And, therein lies the irony of the apolitical protests of the community and also perhaps its Achilles Heel.The faceless protest marches that claim to be non-partisan and leaderless have nevertheless been organised and oiled by workers across all major political parties. Initiated by hardline Maratha groups that have had an allegiance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the protests were soon hijacked by all parties, with local Maratha leaders contributing to the effort with resources or numbers.To make matters even more complicated, a section of the organisers from the Sambhaji Brigade, enthused by the ground swell of support of the community, is now making a foray in active politics. Sambhaji Brigade plans to contest a majority of the upcoming municipal corporations as well as Zilla Parishad polls.It is very difficult for the discontent of the Maratha community to be consolidated as a vote bank in favour of one or the other party. While NCP is seen as a party of Marathas, all political parties including BJP have presence of Maratha leaders. The votes will then be spilled locally on party lines especially in local polls, said a senior Congress leader and former minister.He added, ``This also brings down their capacity to impact or affect state politics in a big way unless there is a clear leadership or ownership of the unrest with one party.The state government has also been successful in stemming the protests by offering sops like the fee waiver for all Economically Backward Students up to an income limit of Rs6 lakh per annum that will extend to the Maratha community (at the cost of Rs 700 crore to the exchequer). Besides, the government recently laid the foundation stone for the Shivaji memorial (long standing demand of the community) and set up the state backward class commission to look into the demands for the reservation by the community.For the time being these efforts and local polls has diluted the protests. But, the issue is far from over and is likely to heat up once again before 2019 polls.There are two reasons for this. One is that the central demand of the community for reservation is jobs and education is unlikely to get implemented in two years. Secondly, the BJP government is seen as targeting the established Maratha leadership that controls rural economy through its network of sugar co-operatives and co-operative banks.Political analysts feel that the upcoming elections in district councils or zilla parishads (ZPs) that are responsible for rural administration will give an indication of how the Maratha protests issue can impact politics in the state.The Marathas issue has a stronger resonance in rural areas and hence will be important in ZP polls. The polls results will tell us whether the community is likely to do any strategic voting. Secondly, there has been a buzz in certain areas that Other Backward Class (OBC) may consolidate their vote bank by rejecting Maratha candidates and this could affect certain parties, said Surendra Jondhale, political analyst."
5b2e1fee9855b7245313e596,Can BJP Breach Congress-NCP's Rural Bastions?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-bjp-breach-congress-ncp-s-rural-bastions/story-5PCaZozwG9o5TGRx1YZiEN.html,2017-01-12,"Next month, 25 district councils, or local government bodies that administer rural areas, will go to the polls.For the first time the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will make a serious bid for the rural vote bank across Maharashtra.In the states polity, the Congress and its offshoot, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), have traditionally been the parties with a rural base, while the saffron alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena are strong with the urban voter.This premise may be challenged this time, if the saffron alliance dents the Congress-NCP. After all, after the 2014 Assembly polls, the BJP and the Sena effectively control nearly two-thirds of the state through their elected legislators.More than the results of the municipal corporations or municipal councils that administer big cities and towns, the district council polls will indicate if the Congress and NCP bastions can be breached. At stake is more than 75% of the states rural population.The Congress-NCP have dominated rural politics as they control the agrarian economy through a network of sugar and credit co-operative societies and co-operative banks.The control of these co-operative structures gives the parties direct access to lakhs of farmers, who form their support base. Over the years, while the saffron parties have tried to make headway in these rural structures, the power has stayed squarely with the Congress and NCP.This time round, however, this status quo may change. And, if it does, the Opposition will find it difficult to make a comeback in the 2019 Assembly polls.Apart from local issues, the Centres demonetisation decision is also likely to have an impact, as the rural economy was hit worst by the cash crunch. Will this result in a vote against the BJP or only strengthen the Prime Minister? Can the Opposition leverage the issue to its advantage?The Congress is hopeful of covering lost ground.In the ZP polls, we will do well, as both demonetisation and the anti-farmer policies of the government will hurt the BJP. We expect a better show than in the municipal council polls, where we managed to come second and retain most of our seats. These elections, however, have to be seen from the prism of the 2014 polls, which give the BJP the advantage, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.The BJP concedes it will have a more difficult time in the Zilla Parishads, than in the municipal corporations.Our assessment is that like in municipal councils, we will vastly improve our tally in these polls and emerge as the number one party. We will do well in Zilla Parishads also, where we currently rank last. But here, our success may not be as big as in the cities. In the Zilla Parishad polls, local equations such as control of banks, sugar co-operatives and panchayat samitis matter. And, they (Opposition) have more of a presence in this network, admitted BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Going just by the results of just the 2012 polls in these 25 ZPs, the BJP has an uphill task.The party ranks last in terms of presence in these ZPs, with just 165 of the total 1,516 seats in its kitty. It has a lead only in Jalgaon and Jalna. In several ZPs, especially in Western Maharashtra, like Satara, Sangli and Solapur, the party has no presence.The NCP leads with 511 seats, in 10 ZPs and as such, has the most at stake in the upcoming rural bodies polls. The Congress too has a considerable presence (419 seats) and the partys challenge will be to maintain this advantage.The Sena ranks third with 233 seats. For both the main alliances, contesting these polls together may help. But, given the lack of trust between the Congress-NCP and BJP-Sena, such a tie-up may not work out across the state.A lot rides on these elections for all the four main political parties, and the mandate has not been so interesting for the state as a whole in a long time.Also readCongress, NCP to tie up for elections?Congress, NCP will go solo for BMC elections in 2017"

I remember as youngsters, we could take a dip in any tubewell or raid any sugarcane field and have a feast; no questions were asked. I broke almost every window pane around my house in Jalandhar without being boycotted by neighbours.Things have changed and how. Now I hear about youngsters, with so much potential, taking to drugs, which is alarming. Drugs will not take them anywhere; sports and studies will. Please dont let drugs kill Punjab.I am also worried about the rising incidence of cancer in the state. I hear about the train from Bathinda, the Cancer Express that carries people for treatment to Rajasthan. Sadly we have brought this scourge upon ourselves through unhealthy farming practices. Our body is what we eat. And we have made a mess of it by spraying our crops and vegetables with deadly chemicals.I am proud of our farmers reaping a rich harvest, but they have to think of the land as well. Growing four crops a year with the help of chemicals may be profitable but has anyone considered what it is doing to our land? It is the same with our water. Every year, the water table dips further. Dont milk the land dry. Dont turn Punjab into a barren desert.I am also dismayed by the urban sprawl eating into our fields. What will happen to our eco system if we build houses everywhere? What will happen to our green fields ? We must stop this mindless building drive.I wish I could bring back the old times. I like the khulla-dulla, hara (open and green) Punjab with its warm neighbourhoods. I want a happy Punjab. A Punjab where farmers lead the nation with environmentally sustainable agriculture.

5b2e4c1b9855b726401155dc,Volvo Trucks drives towards automation,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/623408/volvo-trucks-drives-towards-automation.html,2017-07-18,"Volvo Trucks is also into another pilot  Renova Refuse Truck. There is a risk of accidents when refuse trucks reverse in housing areas. But what if there is a self-driving truck that reverses automatically and the driver collects refuse around houses? This is exactly what Volvo Trucks is doing in association with Swedish waste management company Renova. Volvo Trucks is currently testing and researching how automated vehicles can contribute to safer, more efficient refuse handling and create a better working environment for drivers.The automated systems being tested are in principle the same as those fitted to the autonomous Volvo truck operating at the Kristineberg mine.Experts at Volvo Trucks in Sweden also explained the concept of platooning. Using connectivity, trucks in a platoon can communicate with each other. Trucks are closer to each other and communicate. If the first truck applies brakes, the second and the third one will also brake automatically. Platooning helps reduce fuel consumption. The ultimate aim of all these pilots is to evaluate how systems with different degrees of automation can contribute to higher productivity, a better working environment, and improved safety.Five levels of automationExperts feel rather on-road, automation will happen in confined areas first. There is a higher chance of commercial application in confined areas. What about commercial applications? They opine that they have the technology and that it is difficult to say when the actual rollout can happen.It will be automation supporting the driver. Apart from regulatory challenges, there are also commercial and technological challenges in case of automation, says Cuklev. There are five different levels of automation  starting from driver assistance in Level 1 to full automation, which is Level 5. While driver assistance is using no feet, Level 2 is partial automation  no hands, Level 3 is conditional automation  no eyes, and Level 4 is high automation, which involves no attention, and full automation involves no driver. Level 5 is something that can be applied in confined areas. We are working across all levels, Cuklev says.Zero accident visionAbout 35% of people suffering serious injuries or fatalities in accidents involving heavy trucks are vulnerable road users. While 90% of accidents happen due to human factors, 30% due to environment and 10% due to vehicles.According to the 2017 Volvo Trucks Safety Report, which focuses on vulnerable road users, the number of serious road accidents involving trucks is dropping, but the safety of vulnerable road users must be improved. Stressing on the importance of seat belt, Carl Johan Almqvist, Safety Director, Volvo Trucks, says that in order to cut accident rates, it is necessary to continue the development of a number of technical solutions that can help the truck driver avoid potentially hazardous situations. Moreover, all road users need to become more aware of the risks that exist in the traffic environment and how we can best reduce them, he adds.The 2017 Volvo Trucks Safety Report is based on Volvos own accident investigations and on data from various national and European authorities. One of the reports conclusions is that there is a greater need to focus on reducing risks for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, moped riders and motorcyclists.Volvo Trucks Accident Research Team (ART) has investigated truck accidents since 1969. These are facts that are not only important to our own product development, but also to everyone who works for a safer traffic environment, says Peter Wells, Head of the Volvo Trucks Accident Research Team. In order to reduce the risk of accidents with other vehicles, Volvos trucks are equipped with various active safety systems. But if an accident does occur, it is a tried and trusted part of the safety equipment that is the most important life-saver  the seat belt, says Almqvist.The safety belt would have saved 50% of unbelted truck occupants, according to the report. The report reveals that far too many truck drivers dont use their seat belts even though we know that half of the unbelted truck drivers who have died in road accidents would have survived, had they been wearing their seat belts, he adds.A visit to the Driving Simulation Centre at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute, which is considered as one of the most advanced centres globally, showed how various researches are conducted to develop safety for vehicles.Collision warningWith automation comes safety. Automatic emergency braking function is an EU-wide legal requirement for two- and three-axle heavy trucks since 2015. The aim is to reduce accidents in which a truck drives into the back of a vehicle in front of it, an accident scenario that accounts for about a fifth of all road accidents involving trucks.Though there is no such legal requirement in India, this automatic emergency braking in India could save many lives, especially on the highways.Volvo Trucks has developed a system, which was introduced in 2012, which focuses primarily on alerting the driver about the risk of a collision.In many cases, this is enough for the driver to quickly assess the situation and avoid an accident, explains Almqvist. At the Volvo Trucks Experience Centre, this writer experienced Volvos emergency braking function.The system monitors the vehicles in front with the help of camera and radar technology. If there is a risk of collision, the driver is alerted via a gradually escalating light and acoustic signals. If the system does not detect a response from the driver, the truck automatically starts braking gently.At a time when we talk more about self-driving cars and global companies investments in technology, especially automation, what about self-driving trucks that are put to use in confined areas? With no requirement of driver, these trucks are on their own, and can increase productivity and safety.At Boliden Mine, Sweden, self-driving Volvo FMX trucks are being tested in regular operations; Renova Refuse truck reverses automatically and the driver collects refuse around houses; use of automation in sugar cane harvesting in Brazil helps in reduction of up to 100% of truck trampling-related losses; and platooning can reduce air drag, as trucks can drive close to each other in a controlled convoy.The above are some of the pilots that Volvo Trucks is involved in along with partners. A visit to Volvo Trucks headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden, throws open the world of automation in trucks and how the global truck manufacturer is preparing itself for the automation journey, viewing safety as the highest priority.Technology is changing rapidly, and automation is already happening in society. It will change the industry in terms of productivity, safety and energy efficiency. There are different solutions in different areas  like confined areas and on-road, says Mikael Karlsson, Vice President (Productivity and New Concepts), Volvo Trucks.In case of automated solutions, humans are very much at the centre. Volvo Trucks automation first works with confined areas like mining and private yards, among other areas, and then comes on-road.Elaborating about automation in mining, Sasko Cuklev, Director of Customer Solutions and New Concepts at Volvo Trucks, says that Volvo FMX trucks are being tested in regular operations at the Boliden mine in Kristineberg, Sweden.The aim is to examine how this technology can contribute to safe and productive transport in tough geographically limited application areas. The vehicles used in the mine are series-built Volvo FMX trucks equipped with new functionality.Among other things, they include a system incorporating radar/laser-based sensors. This system is initially used to monitor the mines geometry and to generate a map of the route that the truck has to traverse. The collected information is then used to regulate the vehicles steering, gear changes and speed. On every new trip, the sensors are used to continuously scan the area around the truck and further optimise both the operation and the route.Apart from mining, Volvo trucks are also undergoing pilots in other areas, such as sugarcane harvesting in Brazil.The new self-steering truck is said to be a significant productivity booster for Brazilian sugarcane growers. The truck, which is used to transport newly harvested sugarcane, is steered with great precision through the fields in order to avoid damaging the young plants that will form the following years crop.It helps the driver avoid running over the crop for the next years harvest. With the help of GPS receivers, the truck follows a coordinate-based map across the sugarcane field. It helps in reduction of up to 100% of truck trampling-related losses, says Cuklev."

What began as a quest to find a niche for itself in a biscuit and cookie market nurtured and dominated by traditional giants like Britannia and Parle, has set Bengaluru-based Unibic on course to define pure cookie pleasure for the Indian market, backed by a strong Australian heritage.The story goes as far back as 2004, when Australian Michael Quinn visited India and sensed the need to introduce the country to premium biscuits and cookies. Partnering with Nikhil Sen and Dhruv Deepak Saxena, the trio set about evaluating the markets challenges and opportunities, sniffing out that gap which they could fill up with their baked indulgences.The Indian market then served imported offerings (like Oreos and Chips Ahoys) which somehow came into the country almost six to seven months old, and not very fresh, while the best Indian offering was Good Day, Sen, who is the Managing Director of Unibic Foods, tells DH.In the early 2000s, the biscuit market was roughly divided into low price, high price, health and indulgence offerings. The low price segment was occupied by glucose (dominated by Parle G) at 50%, while Britannia Tiger held 20% market share, and Sunfeast barely made double-digits. Then there were brands like Sona, Priyagold and Biskfarm which did anything that the larger players did, but at a 20% discount, selling a value for money offering, by sacrificing margins. Also, there existed brands operating in a sort of high on health, high on price segment.The final option that Unibic observed was a have a price, have indulgence space, with cookies, premium sandwich creams and indulgent crackers as potential offerings.We had the advantage on the virtue of our Australian heritage and wire-cut technology, and felt thats what we must look at investing into as it would give us an edge over other players. This was an area where we could play innovator in the marketplace, by getting in new technology, and also pushing products which the Indian market hadnt seen, Sen says, reiterating that the company decided to play in the indulgence cookie arena. Those days, cookies had standard staple offerings of cashew, butter and chocolate, with players selling to a mass market. Unibic decided to set up shop at the top-end of the market, wanting to sell at a premium over the competition.Unique bickiesUnibic has positioned itself on its uniqueness, not only in terms of variety in offerings, but also in the way it has sold products.Today, the company sells 21 variants (Fruit And Nut, Honey Oatmeal, Cashew, Chocolate Chip, Muesli, Choco Nut, and Sugarfree, among others) in the cookie segment, across 100 SKUs (2-biscuit packs, 60 and 70 gms boxes, 15-200 gms family packs, pouches, display packs, cartons, tins, export range, and so on).With premium emerges the demand from discerning customers for a differentiated, higher class of products. What sets Unibic apart? Among other things, its the packaging, says Sen. Any attitude test will tell you that a single act of consumption would be between 21 and 25 gms. Supposing I serve you cookies on a tray, you would normally have anything between two and three cookies. You would hardly go for a fourth, unlike a bag of chips. We thought, Can we come up with something wherein, if we cant charge a price premium, we could charge a weight premium? While the competition was at 100 gms, for 10 cookies at Rs 10, we came up with a 75 gms offering for 10 cookies at Rs 10, by which we would be able to provide the same perceived value to the consumer, he says.And, people eat with their eyes first. Our tray made the product packs look much bigger, as you had three rows of four, three and three biscuits each. What we couldnt spend on advertising, we spent on shelf display. Thanks to modern trade and standalone formats, we got some traction, he adds.Also, Unibic offered more in every bite. While the competition offered 2-3% cashew, Unibic gave 11%, and when the competitors were at 2-3% butter, Unibic was at 15%. With chocolate chips, Unibic offered 20%, while the others offered a half.With cookies and biscuits comes the inherent annoying issue of breakage, be it at the factory or bakery stage, or at the store during handling. This problem was solved through technology, predominantly wire-cut.Wire-cut technology is a widely-adopted factory baking technique abroad. At the factory, biscuits come out of a moulder, fully-made. In comparison, with wire-cut, dough is pushed through nozzles and gets precisely cut by a wire, with measured pieces hitting the oven. This artisan technology ensures that no two cookies are similar, allowing each to develop on its own, stronger and better baked. Traditionally, a wire-cut or a drop-deposited cookie would be richer than a standard moulded one.Today, Unibic boasts of the biggest wire-cut facility in India, with five lines and a capacity to produce 100 tonnes a day. The production claims 95% localisation.Baking Down UnderStrategising for the Indian market and diving deeper into offering unique treats, Unibic has heavily depended upon its Australian heritage. For trivia, honey n oat cookies have been synonymous with Australian and New Zealand soldiers during World War II. During those days, cookies were baked for ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps) soldiers who left for the battlefront. The ANZAC Cookie was one of Unibics earliest offerings, launched along with chocolate chip cookies (named Bradman Cookies in honour of Aussie cricket legend Sir Donald Brandman), as a private label for Caf Coffee Day. Today, Unibic contract manufactures private labels for several leading airlines as well.The Rs 27,000 crore Indian biscuit industry encompasses cookies, creams, crackers, marie (semisweet offerings), health offerings (digestives, milk biscuits), and glucose. Close to 30% is contributed by the cookie segment, which along with creams, is one of the largest segments, and at its premium end, is one of the fastest growing at around 15%, while Unibic is growing at 50%. Serving the spaces of traditional trade, modern trade, institutional sales, online, HORECA, defence, exports, and private labels, around 95% of Unibics revenues is contributed by its branded business. Having held significant share in South India, the cookie-maker now aims to gradually bake more ground pan-India, with more unique offerings and variants in the quarters to come."
5b2e7b309855b72640115e29,How big firms got Brazil hooked on junk food,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/633933/how-big-firms-got-brazil.html,2017-09-19,"Childrens squeals rang through the muggy morning air as a woman pushed a gleaming white cart along pitted, trash-strewn streets. She was making deliveries to some of the poorest households in this seaside city of Fortaleza, Brazil, bringing pudding, cookies and other packaged foods to customers on her sales route.Celene da Silva, 29, is one of thousands of door-to-door vendors for Nestl, helping the worlds largest packaged food conglomerate expand its reach into a quarter-million households in Brazils farthest-flung corners.As she dropped off variety packs of Chandelle pudding, Kit-Kats and Mucilon infant cereal, there was something striking about her customers: Many were visibly overweight, even small children.She gestured to a home along her route and shook her head, recalling how its patriarch, a morbidly obese man, died the previous week. He ate a piece of cake and died in his sleep, she said.Da Silva, who herself weighs more than 200 pounds, recently discovered that she had high blood pressure, a condition she acknowledges is probably tied to her weakness for fried chicken and the Coca-Cola she drinks with every meal, breakfast included.Nestls direct-sales army in Brazil is part of a broader transformation of the food system that is delivering Western-style processed food and sugary drinks to the most isolated pockets of Latin America, Africa and Asia. As their growth slows in the wealthiest countries, multinational food companies like Nestl, PepsiCo and General Mills have been aggressively expanding their presence in developing nations.A New York Times examination of corporate records, epidemiological studies and government reports  as well as interviews with scores of nutritionists and health experts around the world  reveals a sea change in the way food is produced, distributed and advertised across much of the globe. The shift, many public health experts say, is contributing to a new epidemic of diabetes and heart disease, chronic illnesses that are fed by soaring rates of obesity in places that struggled with hunger and malnutrition just a generation ago.The new reality is captured by a single, stark fact: across the world, more people are now obese than underweight. At the same time, scientists say, the growing availability of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods is generating a new type of malnutrition, one in which a growing number of people are both overweight and undernourished.The prevailing story is that this is the best of all possible worlds  cheap food, widely available. If you dont think about it too hard, it makes sense, said Anthony Winson, who studies the political economics of nutrition at the University of Guelph in Ontario. A closer look, however, reveals a much different story, he said. To put it in stark terms: The diet is killing us.Even critics of processed food acknowledge that there are multiple factors in the rise of obesity, including genetics, urbanisation, growing incomes and more sedentary lives. Nestl executives say their products have helped alleviate hunger, provided crucial nutrients, and that the company has squeezed salt, fat and sugar from thousands of items to make them healthier. But Sean Westcott, head of food research and development at Nestl, conceded obesity has been an unexpected side effect of making inexpensive processed food more widely available. We didnt expect what the impact would be, he said.Part of the problem, he added, is a natural tendency for people to overeat as they can afford more food. Nestl, he said, strives to educate consumers about proper portion size.The story is as much about economics as it is nutrition. As multinational companies push deeper into the developing world, they are transforming local agriculture, spurring farmers to abandon subsistence crops in favour of cash commodities like sugar cane, corn and soybeans  the building blocks for many industrial food products. It is this economic ecosystem that pulls in mom-and-pop stores, big-box retailers, food manufacturers and distributors, and small vendors like da Silva.In many ways, Brazil is a microcosm of how growing incomes and government policies have led to longer, better lives and largely eradicated hunger. But now the country faces a new nutrition challenge: over the last decade, the countrys obesity rate has nearly doubled to 20%, and the portion of people who are overweight has nearly tripled to 58%. Each year, 300,000 people are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, a condition with strong links to obesity.Brazil also highlights the food industrys political prowess. In 2010, a coalition of Brazilian food and beverage companies torpedoed a raft of measures that sought to limit junk food ads aimed at children.What we have is a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food once produced by the farmers around you and the producers of ultra-processed food designed to be over-consumed and which in some cases are addictive, said Carlos A. Monteiro, a professor of nutrition and public health at the University of So Paulo. Its a war, he said, but one food system has disproportionately more power than the other.Da Silva reaches customers in Fortalezas slums, many of whom dont have ready access to a supermarket. She champions the product she sells, exulting in the nutritional claims on the labels that boast of added vitamins and minerals. She became a Nestl vendor two years ago, when her family of five was struggling to get by. Though her husband is still unemployed, things are looking up. With the $185 a month she earns, she was able to buy a new refrigerator, a television and a gas stove for the familys three-room home.Nestl increasingly also portrays itself as a leader in its commitment to community and health. Two decades ago, it anointed itself a nutrition health and wellness company. Over the years, the company says it has reformulated nearly 9,000 products to reduce salt, sugar and fat.Nearly 9% of Brazilian children were obese in 2015, more than a 270% increase since 1980, according to a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. That puts it in striking distance of the United States, where 12.7% of children were obese in 2015.The rising obesity rates are largely associated with improved economics, as families with increasing incomes embrace the convenience, status and flavours offered by packaged foods."
5b2e7ba29855b72640115e3f,"Thyroid: Watch out, men",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/650484/thyroid-watch-men.html,2017-12-28,"If you're a man dealing with sudden weight gain, forgetfulness, fatigue, hair loss, unexplained infertility, have your thyroid checked out to see where you stand.Thyroid disease - be it hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism  although commonly seen in women, are frequently being diagnosed in men too.Statistics reveal that women are eight times more at risk of developing a thyroid disorder, but the fact is that we cannot rule out the threat it poses to men. It is a myth that men do not suffer from Thyroid, and one that needs to be busted.Your thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly that sits low in the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. The thyroid gland makes and stores hormones that help regulate: metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and the rate at which our food is converted into energy.The hormones produced by the thyroid gland are essential for the proper functioning of virtually every cell in the body.Although it is an easy-to-detect and less expensive to treat disease, symptoms go unnoticed especially by men which impacts their overall health and well-being. Typically, Indian men tend to brush off fatigue and hair loss as signs of stress, dry skin and lethargy are dismissed as not so important.People who have a history of thyroid problems in their family would be at more risk to thyroid abnormalities.Genetics play a role to detect the level of thyroid hormones. If men show such signs, it's time to check their thyroid levels.Hypothyroidism  means a low thyroid function  is a common disorder where the thyroid gland releases inadequate amounts of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 into the body. Generally, thyroid diseases are seen in elderly men but there are exceptions to the norm.A few symptoms like hair loss, decrease in muscular strength, even erectile dysfunction and decrease in sex drive are more frequently seen in men.The thyroid/fertility connection in men: Hypothyroidism in men is linked to reduced sperm volume and motility. Hypothyroidism can also cause low libido and erection problems. Hyperthyroidism in men (Graves' disease) is linked to fertility issues too.To diagnose hypothyroidism, your endocrinologist will check your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone levels with a blood test.Thyroid requires care and an early diagnosis. Sub-clinical hypothyroidism is silent as a disease, in it, thyroid level falls below normal and is being increasingly diagnosed in the Indian population.The corrective treatment usually involves thyroid hormone replacement. It is an effective treatment that can avoid complications.Don't suffer in silenceFind a doctor who understands the nuances of thyroid, uses comprehensive testing and practices personalised medicine. Don't suffer in silence. Talk to your doctor about all of your symptoms, and don't be afraid to discuss what you are going through. Your symptoms are not all in your head.Take the endocrinologist recommended tests. Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get proper sleep and make changes that will create a lifetime of good health. Consuming the recommended iodine amount as a part of a balanced diet of nutritious fruits and vegetables is a first step towards maintaining your thyroid health. Avoiding smoking and limiting your alcohol intake can have a positive effect.Apart from this, follow a regular exercise system to maintain sound body functions and compliment your medication regime.While testing is important, you can resort to a more natural approach (besides the medicinal dosage). The natural approach can support the thyroid gland and fertility.Start with diet changes.Foods such as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and uncooked bhindi should not be consumed raw. Cooking destroys the goitrogens. Take soy products preferably in the night if you are on thyroid medications.Studies have shown that frequent endogenous insulin spikes can damage the thyroid gland. Sugar spikes cause the adrenal glands to secrete excess cortisol which suppresses the pituitary function and that can affect the thyroid gland.(The writer is consulting endocrinologist, St John's Medical College & Hospital, Bengaluru)"
5b2e7c049855b72640115e51,Diabetes: A father sues to curb junk food in India...,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/650246/diabetes-father-sues-curb-junk.html,2017-12-26,"Rahul Verma's son was born gravely ill with digestive problems, but over years of visits to the boy's endocrinologist, Verma saw the doctor grow increasingly alarmed about a different problem, one threatening healthy children. Junk food, the doctor warned, was especially dangerous to Indians, who are far more prone to diabetes than people from other parts of the world.One day in the doctor's waiting room, Verma noticed a girl who had gotten fat by compulsively eating potato chips. He decided he had to do something. ""On one side you have children like my son, who are born with problems,"" said Verma, ""and on the other side you have children who are healthy and everything is fine and you are damaging them giving them unhealthy food.""Verma, who had no legal training, sat late into the nights with his wife, Tullika, drafting a petition in their tiny apartment. He filed the public interest lawsuit in Delhi High Court in 2010, seeking a ban on the sale of junk food and soft drinks in and around schools across India.The case has propelled court-ordered regulations of the food industry to the doorstep of the Indian government, where they have languished. They have outsized importance in India, population 1.3 billion, because its people are far more likely to develop diabetes - which can lead to heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations - as they gain weight than people from other regions, according to health experts.Since 1990, the percent of children and adults in India who are overweight or obese has almost tripled to 18.8% from 6.4%, according to data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The International Diabetes Federation projects that the number of Indians with diabetes will soar to 123 million by 2040 as diets rich in carbohydrates and fat spread to less affluent rural areas. ""We are sitting on a volcano,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of a diabetes hospital at Fortis Healthcare, one of India's biggest private hospital chains.In the years since the court ordered the government to develop guidelines to regulate junk food, the case has encountered ferocious opposition from the All India Food Processors Association, which counts Coca-Cola India, PepsiCo India and Nestl India as members, as well as hundreds of other companies.Subodh Jindal, president of the association, said in an interview that junk food was unfairly blamed for diabetes and obesity. It was overeating, not the food itself, that has caused the problem, he said. The government this year took a significant step that public health experts believe will help combat the rise of obesity. It partially implemented a tax on sugar sweetened beverages, instituting a 40% tax on such drinks that are carbonated, though not on juices made with added sugars that many children drink.But so far, the regulations to ban sales near schools sought by the court in Verma's case have led to naught. As the case has played out on Twitter and in newspapers, some schools have voluntarily stopped serving junk food.Verma, 42, quit his job as a corporate marketing executive after his son's birth in 2006 and set up a foundation in 2007 to help families like his with sick children. At one point, though, Verma begged the judge to let him withdraw the petition.But Chief Justice Dipak Misra refused. Instead, spotting a senior advocate, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, in the courtroom, the judge ordered him to act as the pro bono lawyer for Verma's case. As Kaul, 54, approached the bench, he recalled, he joked to the judge, ""You've got the wrong guy. I like junk food.""Scientists searched for genes that predisposed Indians to diabetes, but did not find them. Instead, a growing body of research suggests that Indians' body type - one that is smaller but with more abdominal fat - may be responsible.Being born to a malnourished woman - a common phenomenon in India - may also increase the odds of developing diabetes.Dr Chittaranjan Yajnik, a diabetes specialist, and Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, are among the researchers exploring a theory that Indians evolved what Yajnik has called ""a thin-fat"" body type over millenniums as a way to survive famines when monsoons failed.In the 1990s, Yajnik began following the pregnancies of hundreds of women in villages outside Pune, a city in western India, and tested their offspring as they grew up.Compared with infants in Britain, Indian newborns were about 1.5 pounds lighter but had more abdominal fat and higher levels of certain hormones in their cord blood, he found, suggesting a predisposition to diabetes.Yajnik said he believes Indians' susceptibility to diabetes may have emerged as their diets changed with rising affluence - and that their bodies, attuned to scarcity, couldn't handle an overload of food. Although obesity and overweight are far less prevalent in India (24%) than in Canada (60%), for example, adults there are just as likely to develop diabetes as in Canada, a New York Times analysis of data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found.Insatiable hungerIn the years since Verma filed his suit, sales of packaged foods have increased 138%; fast food 83%; and carbonated drinks 58%, according to Euromonitor International, the market research firm. Coca-Cola Co's chief executive James Quincey, in an interview earlier this year, said that he expected the Indian market to eventually become the company's third largest in sales, up from sixth.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the Indian market. They have also said they plan to increase their offerings of drinks with less sugar and more fruit.Sanjay Khajuria, a Nestl India spokesman, said the food processors association, which opposed Verma's case, had ""taken into account inputs received by the association from its members,"" and declined further comment. He also noted that the company has joined other companies in India to restrict advertising directed at children younger than 12 to products with a certain level of nutrients. A Coca-Cola spokesman referred questions on the lawsuit to the food association. PepsiCo India's vice president of sales, Harsh K. Rai, also declined to comment on the lawsuit. He said the company has stopped advertising to children 12 and younger.In early 2015, the food authority in the Health Ministry finally recommended regulations to the court, including some limitations on the sale of junk food around schools. The judge ordered the recommendations carried out within three months. Instead, the food authority appointed yet another committee.Agarwal, chief executive of the food authority, insisted his agency is finally ready to start adopting new rules early next year for labeling healthy food with a green light and those high in fat, sugar and salt with a red light. But he said taxing junk food and banning it around schools were long term goals. ""There is no point in confronting industry on these issues,"" he said.Verma was emphatic that someone needs to continue the fight; he is just not sure that someone is him. He is convinced the unending legal battle gave him high blood pressure.His former partner on the case, pro bono lawyer Kaul, said India needs more than Verma to make change happen. ""You need a movement to fight the inertia of the system,"" he said, sipping a can of Coke."

It is a pure white, spongy ball of 'Chhana' dipped in light sugar syrup, CIPAM said in a tweet. The Cell for IPR Promotions & Management works under the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion.""Banglar Rasogolla is a syrupy dessert popular in all over India and abroad,"" the CIPAM said.An official said that there was no tussle or dispute between West Bengal and Odisha over the GI tag on the sweet. West Bengal had applied for this and we have granted them, the official added.Both states had set their eyes on the GI tag. Odisha has claimed that the sweet originated from the Jagannath Temple in Puri, where it is a part of the religious rituals since the 12th century. Odisha calls it Pahala Rasgulla.Odisha had even formed a committe under an eminent Jagannath cult scholar to study the origins of the rosogolla. Last year, the committee had endorsed Odisha's claims in a 100-page report.On the other hand, West Bengal had asserted that confectioner Nobin Chandra Das is widely known as the one who created the rosogolla in the 1860s.A GI is a sign used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to that origin.Such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness which is essentially attributable to its origin in that defined geographical locality.Darjeeling Tea, Mahabaleshwar Strawberry, Blue Pottery of Jaipur, Banarasi Sarees and Tirupati Laddus are some of the GIs.Also Read:Panel seal on rasgulla's Odisha origin"

Every morning I would witness the same scene unfolding in the kitchen. Around 7 am, three dishevelled and yawning adults would emerge from their rooms. Milk and cereal would be dumped on the dining table and coffee maker would be plugged in.Half an hour later, they would emerge again, dressed and smelling of deos and aftershaves. Black coffee would be poured into large mugs. Cold milk would be poured over a bowl of cereals and gulped down hurriedly. Or a bread toast of three shades of brown would be carried around in one hand while the eater would be searching for keys or answering the phone. Ten minutes later there would be sounds of doors opening and closing and cars leaving the driveway. I could not help reminiscing about the hustle bustle in our kitchens in the mornings.Our homemakers had to be ingenious and creative to cater to the brood at home. Imagine a different breakfast for every day of the week. And the dabbas! No homemaker worth her salt would stuff the same breakfast into the lunch box and send it out. The lunch when opened should not be too runny, gooey, mushy, dry, bland, or too spicy. Creating something that would taste of home several hours after it was prepared was an act of genius.By the time my generation became independent homemakers, things were a little better. We had two LPG cylinders, refrigerators and supermarkets to help us cope. Yet, our challenges were no less intimidating than that of our mothers and aunts. The men we had married came from large households with excellent cooks. Mothers, aunts, grandmothers, and daughters-in-law vied with one another to show off their culinary skills and flaunt their family recipes. This had given these men palates as discerning as that of judges on cookery competitions. (I am always awestruck when these chefs comment, The starter was underwhelming, Dory for the main was well seasoned but a bit over, salad needed some acid, and the dessert lacked texture.) The idlis had to be super soft, dosas thin and crisp, and upma fluffy and crumbly!There were more worries worth mentioning. Before vegetarianism became a fashion, we worried about depriving our children of proteins. It was a huge task to make kids accept, if not love, veggies. You fought a losing battle with chips, chocolates and ice creams. Added to all this, myyoung children couldnt distinguish between capsicum, beans and green chilli.My husband always hid his face behind the newspaper at breakfast. Invariably, there used to be episodes of one of them biting on a chilli. Then the drama of leaky nose, watery eyes, and attempts to soothe the burning mouth with honey, sugar, or water would ensue. Soon, while making breakfast, I would remove the offending chilli and then serve the dish.One day, the sevai upma was ready and it needed the accompaniment of a chutney. But I had run out of green chilli and there was no time to procure it. Then, I saw the glistening chilli rescued from upma sitting on the kitchen counter. I just chucked them in the mixer with coconut. When served, I could almost hear the judge chef say, Chilli fried in oil has elevated the chutney to a new level. Call me cheap or creative, I dont care. My elevated chutney is really delicious. Desperation is the mother of creativity in the kitchen."

But how far should healthy eating stretch?A close relative of mine had some rigid ideas about eating certain types of food and believed that he had made the best choice, which became a habit over a period of time. After he got married, his wife cooked according to his taste and requirement and all went well until one day he complained of mouth ulcers.That day, lunch came with a special kind of greens to treat mouth ulcers, along with a detailed account of the hea lth benefits of the herb. Notwithstanding the unpleasant taste, he had to devour it to achieve the expected results! That was the beginning of his health capsule.Health problems of various degrees are common in every household, and he or the children would occasionally complain of stomach upset, sore throat, cold, etc. The lady of the house, keen on restoring the family's health, started her research on home remedies. She came up with a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices that were ""good for health"" and helped relieve many problems. She made the healthy eating strategy a routine, whether or not there was any issue!Bittergourd was cooked to check blood sugar. Banana stem, considered good for kidney stones, was used, while fried plantain and potato curry that were starchy and lead to gastric problems were avoided. As detoxifying agents, salads became a must. Since oily and fatty food raised bad cholesterol, steamed and boiled food was regularised. To maintain a stable BP and heart condition, a low-salt diet and use of garlic was introduced. Buttermilk/curd (Lacto bacilli) was compulsory after every meal to avoid stomach infections.To augment weight loss, vegetables with more water content like, cucumber, ash gourd and chow-chow made silent entry into the kitchen. Many other unfamiliar ""healthy vegetables"" became more familiar! Now, health mattered most than the taste! If someone had anattack of cold, the entire family was served pepper-jeera rasam!Oats pongal, millets idli and ragi dosa, occasional rice idli/dosa and cereals with low-fat milk were in the breakfast menu. A generous use of herbs and spices in every dish was incorporated for their special properties like healing, alleviating gastric problem, nausea, allergies and to serve as antacid.Evening snacks comprised a bowl of mixed fruits and nuts. Green tea was a forced favourite drink of the family. The entire range of ""healthy foods"" was stocked for the whole year. This revolution happened amid the initial, timid resentment from the rest of the family!During one of our visits to their house, we were baffled seeing him eat something which he had condemned as ""cattle feed"" long ago. Then he exclaimed, ""Every meal in this house is a medicine. I eat this for digestion and weight control. In this house we seldom eat 'tasty'... sorry 'unhealthy' food""!"

Abig banner outside a super bazaar caught my eye. Fabulous offer! 25% discount on rice, wheat and sugar! it read. I was intrigued. In this day and age, when expenses are swirling like smoke from a heap of garbage on fire, the screaming banner appeared to be manna from heaven.I strode into the shop purposefully and asked for details. The offer was on 25 kg wheat and rice bags and 10 kg sugar bag. As I wasnt planning to open an eatery or to cater to a wedding party, I retreated, quite disappointed. A 5% discount on a kilogram would have helped, I thought ruefully.Flippancy aside, space is a constraint and storage poses a problem. And with the passing of time and the growth of technology, we have become soft. Even lifting not-so-heavy weights leads to aches and pains. This, in turn, entails medical expense, loss of time and a drop in productivity. Most of us prefer small packs even if at an extra cost.Recently, I received a sipper with a ready-mix pack. I refused the free gift because the baby of the family is a sturdy 21-year-old! With a packet of jelly, I was offered a mould free. I wasnt impressed and took just the jelly. That the mould was horrendous in colour didnt endear it to buyers!Another time, when I picked up a bottle of Nescafe, the shop assistant favoured me with a shaker that accompanied it. I pretended to forget it and left it behind.The alert shop assistant came after me with it. I told him I didnt want it. He extolled its usefulness, right there in the middle of the busy road. Dodging traffic and dealing with the persistent shop assistant was, to say the least, rather a difficult task. Wanting to avoid drawing the attention of passersby, I took the wretched thing and stuffed it into my shopping bag.A similar experience awaited me when I picked up a box of cereal. Here is a bowl for you! said the fresh-faced, bright-eyed youngster who attended to me. It was done with the air of a conjuror! Meekly, I accepted the plastic eye-sore, even thanking him, as I didnt want to be subjected to another sales-pitch barrage!Needless to say, I discarded it, followed by the sipper, the shaker and the mould, though I am not sure if it was strictly in that order."

I joined the primary school in Sylvan Kilpauk and learnt my 'a-b-c' there, as well as my 'a-aa-e-ee-'. We played in the sand-pit, swung high and low and thumped on the seesaw while imbibing the rudiments of two languages and arithmetic. We sang hymns with the headmistress tapping the piano keys, quizzed on the capitals of Poland or France or even the US of A, and heard the story of King Bruce and the spider with the motto, ""Try, try, try again!""When I came to Class V, my parents, now posted to Thanjavur, reclaimed me. I switched to the Tamil medium at high school. It was wartime: 1940. On the coast of Coromandel, British Raj was galvanised by air-raid sirens, underground shelters, rationing of rice, sugar, petrol, plus inflation and black markets.I loved forming letters in copybooks with pages evenly ruled in three-line sets, like telegraph lines along the railway. Thathu was a stickler for neat handwriting. He wrote a ""copperplate"" script, inked by steel-pens, legible even after a 100 years. I liked the loops for h, j and y, above the middle line or below; but disliked the instruction, ""cross the t's and dot the i's"".Miss Devadas, my dear teacher, rejected shoddy work; we tried to write the letters fluently in cursive script, the capital letters and the linking to the lower case letters. Later, this habit became an obsession. I lost respect for those who wrote fast, but at the cost of clarity. In middle age, I was aghast when I could not make out my own scribbles. Yoga apart, medical science is frustrated to remedy weakening motor reflexes. Literacy is a lifelong quest.So, my second childhood sends me back to the copybook. At first, it was a chore to write a page in my notebook anthology. Someday science will turn to calligraphy to improve brain cell-muscle-nerve co-ordination. I had a decent hand, but my lettering sprawled over sheets like plump chicks with angular beaks and crooked legs. A Cambridge don once lauded my handwriting, if not the content of my tutorial essay.The eras of the typewriter, first, followed by the computer, iPad and iPhone have overtaken us. Calligraphy is a decorative art which I admire from samples I have seen in Europe, China and Japan. Graphology is an aspect of penmanship relying on the distinctness of each person. I would hesitate to give my writing to an expert, who may be troubled by syndromes unknown to me.We have come a long way from papyrus and reed pens, stylus, rock-face and palm leaf, to the era of inscriptions in cyberspace. How unique everyone is, how precious as a fellow-being, past, present or future. In Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Edward Fitzgerald's famous English version), the poet says: ""The moving finger writes, and having writ/ Moves on..."" Not half a line of it can be cancelled. (No 'delete button' there). I recall our native idiom about ""one's destiny being written on the forehead"" and the phrase about ""the writing on the wall"".I still enjoy the feel of pen and paper, if the pen does not leak, the sheet is bond paper and my hand stays true to my intent. I mentally salute Thathu and Miss Devadas for guiding me to the treasury of script and letters."
5b2e88dc9855b7264011614c,Ordinary pleasures,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/661749/ordinary-pleasures.html,2017-12-12,"For the ordinary human, and I am one, the carrot dangling before the closed eyes just before they open on reluctant mornings is the steaming cuppa, be it tea or coffee, based on one's preference. In fact, on any odd blue evening or night, the very thought of waking up the next morning to the aroma of hot filter coffee is sufficient to pep me up. My morning time with a delicious cupful and the daily is indeed a cherished anticipation.I remember the giant filter that was used during my childhood at my maternal home for the scores of inmates, including sundry guests on any given day, and consumed at least three times daily. The earlier brass filter, and later a steel one, took charge of filtering the coffee powder, purchased assiduously from a shop called Krishna Coffee Works. The powder here would be freshly prepared by grinding the beans right in front of us, to the desired consistency.My tryst with coffee started only after entering the hallowed age of 20! Coffee was meant for adults and we children made do with the likes of plain milk and Bournvita. If at all we stared at the elders drinking the 'ambrosial liquid' with a greedy glint in our eyes, the cook would then cautiously put a drop of decoction into our milk and declare that it was indeed coffee for us. That concoction was consumed with a secret thrill as the forbidden was attractive, always. That scene was replayed as my little daughters grew up amid the wafts of coffee fumes in the house.Tea was a rarity in the house. A special type of tea called Congo tea was served at the popular Hotel Sudha in my town, and once I crossed my teens I was allowed to taste it on rare occasions as it was a unique blend of chocolate and tea! At home, I tried a variant with coffee and Bournvita blended together and named my innovation, 'Bobrew' which changed into 'Bobru' once the instant appeared as a standby at my house.Unlike in the West, coffee and tea here are mostly consumed with milk and sugar, and in certain towns, the more the sugar, the more it is appreciated by the locals! I sometimes wonder if I have prepared ""sherbet"" instead of tea for my domestic help and the odd labourer working at my house.My toddler grandson, Kanishk, once on a visit, was wont to relish a warm cup of milk, sipping it through a straw, beaming and repeating the words,""Galam, galam chai!"" On one occasion he happened to see all the elders drinking a brown coloured liquid - puzzlingly, also called 'chai' - and demanded the same. Imagine his delight when I poured a few drops of tea into his milk! His innocent eyes saw the brown liquid mixing with the as-yet-white coloured beverage in his cup with awe. I saw my own little self and my young daughters in my grandson. I smiled as history had repeated itself."
5b2e89629855b72640116167,Rural boost will shore up economy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/657878/rural-boost-shore-up-economy.html,2017-12-12,"The Economic Survey had indicated that this year's Union Budget was to be seen as a pre-election budget. This meant that there would be expenditure compulsions to cater to certain voter constituencies. That is why we see that there is big focus on rural and agriculture sectors.In any political economy, the expenditure pressures are from focused interest groups, whereas revenue is raised from the wider diffused body of taxpayers. Hence any democracy has an inherent deficit bias. The challenge for a finance minister is to be able to cater to various spending priorities and yet keep within fiscal limits.India's tax to GDP ratio is one of the lowest in the world, so there is some room to go on the revenue side. It is fortuitous that demonetisation and increased formalisation of the economy have led to big jumps in direct and indirect taxpayers. That is why the direct tax collections are in line with the target set last year.Next year's spending is budgeted to go up only by around 10% whereas, due to higher inflation, nominal GDP will go up by 11%. The direct tax collection, thanks to a widening net, will go up at twice the rate of spending, that is nearly 20%. Hence, the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP is reasonable and credible.The finance minister said that the minimum support price (MSP) assured to the farmer would be 150% of the cost of production. The MSP is like an option or insurance. It kicks in only if the market prices drop below a particular threshold. If prices stay high next year (as seems likely in the case of soya and sugar, for instance) then the outgo on MSP would be minimal. Hence, budgeting for MSP is difficult to quantify.Not surprisingly, the budget documents show only about 20% increase in food subsidy (which includes MSP), not much different from last year. So, despite a big political announcement, the impact on the exchequer is small.The other measures, like a tax holiday to farmer producer cooperatives, or the cluster approach for certain agricultural commodities, modernising 22,000 rural mini-marts are all measures that could help the farmer.Ultimately, what is needed is unshackling agriculture from various input and output controls and connecting farm-to-fork. What is needed is to increase value-adding activity like agro-processing, and basically make farming a viable business proposition, not something that needs to be reimbursed for or subsidised.The biggest announcement in the budget was extending health insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh to 10 crore families. The actual premiums paid would be much smaller, and actual drawdown would depend on hospitalisation. Hence, impact on the exchequer will perhaps not be very high.As such, India's expenditure on health and education as a proportion of GDP is much smaller than its peers. Nevertheless, this is a first step toward universal health insurance and should be welcomed. Of course, merely providing health insurance financing will not suffice. It must be accompanied by a substantial increase in healthcare facilities like beds, hospitals and doctors.The focus on health and education is to be seen as enhancing India's human capital. Hence, expenditure on teachers and doctors' salaries should not be counted as revenue spending, but rather capital spending. India's demographic potential cannot be fully realised without enhancing human capital in terms of skilling, education and health.Welcome measureOne significant and welcome step was the reintroduction of long-term capital gains tax after a gap of almost 21 years. The LTCG which escaped taxes was estimated to be about Rs 3.7 lakh crore last year. LTCG accrues mostly to the higher income classes. Also, a tax on LTCG is a direct tax, unlike GST, which is an indirect tax, like excise on petrol and diesel. Indirect taxes tend to be regressive and hurt the poor disproportionately. The ratio of indirect taxes in total taxes had been going up steadily in the last three years. Hence, it is good that LTCG has been introduced.The government overachieved its disinvestment target, which is quite impressive. But this was done partly by the left pocket buying from the right pocket. The other non-tax revenues from spectrum fees and auctions as also dividend from the RBI have been falling. So, next year's target is only modestly higher, and achievableFor the urban middle class, there is not much to cheer. But then, the growth boost from increase in the rural purchasing power will benefit them indirectly. The focus on social sectors like health, education and the elderly is welcome. The other priorities, like job creation or boost to exports and manufacturing, have each got some support, but nothing as big as the health insurance initiative.With some luck, the global macro environment will be favourable (despite the rise in oil prices). This can induce better growth in exports and manufacturing in India, and support growth at around 7.5%. Such an outcome would be a validation of the growth-inducing effect of the budget.(The writer is an economist and Senior Fellow, Takshashila Institution)(The Billion Press)"
5b2e93529855b72640116356,Artificial Beta Cells: hope for diabetics,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/668312/artificial-beta-cells-hope-diabetics.html,2017-12-12,"The discovery of a single dose of Artificial Beta Cells (ABCs), which can maintain steady blood glucose levels for as long as five days, is a major breakthrough in the treatment of diabetes. Especially for many diabetic patients who have to jab a needle, sometimes twice or thrice, it would make an important difference. The ABC injection obviates the need for daily insulin injections, according to the study published in Nature Chemical Biology, October 2017.India, the 'diabetes capital' of the world, has over 70 million diabetic patients. Over the past few decades, diabetes mellitus has hit low and middle-income class families the most. This trend could be attributed to sedentary lifestyles characterised by little physical exercise and an unhealthy diet, besides the genetic predisposition of Indians to diabetes.The main problem that plagues many diabetic patients is that they have to consume medicines lifelong. Whether the medicine is an injectable or oral formulation, it cannot control blood glucose levels efficiently, in the manner that normal insulin-secreting pancreatic cells are able to. To some extent, transplants of pancreatic cells can solve the problem, but such transplants are expensive and there could be a long wait to get donors.Researchers, under the guidance of Prof Guin of the University of North Carolina, have made a breakthrough that could benefit diabetic patients across the globe. They have successfully synthesised ABC (Artificial Beta Cells) which have been extremely effective in keeping glucose/blood sugar levels normal.They administered a single injection of ABC to mice, which restored normal level of glucose within an hour. It also kept the blood glucose levels steady for five days with controlled release and regulation of insulin. If the same results can be re-created in humans, it would significantly benefit those diabetic patients dependent on insulin shots/injection or even mechanical pumps.Given that around 5% of the country's population suffers from this malady, there should be increased awareness about timely intervention to reduce the burden of this disease. Many people tend to be unaware of the symptoms that precede diabetes.They are also unaware of the significance of the pancreas, a small gland located at the back of the stomach near the small intestine, which plays a critical role in controlling blood sugar.Beta cells of the pancreas secrete a hormone called Insulin. This hormone can convert excess glucose in blood to a stored form called glycogen. So, in normal people, even if blood glucose shoots up by intake of more food, insulin can keep the blood glucose under control. Diabetic patients have hampered Beta cells and hence reduced (Type II Diabetes) or zero (Type I Diabetes) insulin production. This leads to increased blood sugar and urine sugar. If untreated, this will adversely impact other organs in the body like the heart and kidney, among others.Risk of vulnerabilityDiabetes can decrease life expectancy by almost 10 years due to the risk of vulnerability to various heart diseases and an almost 20-fold increased chance of lower limb amputations due to impaired nerve and sensory perceptions. In turn, this causes serious infections and bacterial sepsis.Diabetes can also cause gradual damage to the retinal veins behind the eyes that cause them to bleed or leak fluid, ultimately leading to blurred vision and even blindness. Diabetes has a wide variety of symptoms, such as increased urination, increased thirst and hunger accompanied by sudden weight loss. It is also known to cause recurrent vaginal infections in women and lead to an overall state of fatigue and nausea.The ABC function more or less like natural Beta cells. Researchers at North Carolina University were successful in recreating the actual process of delivery of insulin by Beta cells and mimicked it to near-perfection. The scientists synthesised ABC which possess a two-layered lipid membrane with specially designed pouches with insulin in them. Whenever there is an increase in blood sugar level, the surfaces of these pouches fuse with the ABC's outer membrane and thereby release insulin into the blood stream.According to Zhaowei Chen, one of the researchers, ""This is the first demonstration using such a vesicle fusion process for delivering insulin"". Unlike transplanted Beta cells or genetically engineered cells, these artificial cells can be produced on a much larger scale and enjoy a much longer shelf life. The ABC doesn't cause complications with respect to dosage-related issues and is completely self-sufficient, thereby making it the best bet to combat diabetes.So far, using pills as a mode of delivery for insulin has remained a challenge despite being conceived decades ago. This is due to the huge size of the insulin molecule which, upon ingestion, is easily degraded by digestive juices and acids. Due to its controlled and almost near-perfect similarity to actual Beta cells, ABC could prove to be a huge leap forward in the management of diabetes. And any potential strategy to treat diabetes would be welcome in India.(The writers are Associate Professor and undergraduate student, respectively, at the Department of Life Sciences, Christ Deemed to be University, Bengaluru)"
5b2e959b9855b72640116445,Elephant management: a jumbo challenge,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/634429/elephant-management-jumbo-challenge.html,2017-09-23,"The population of elephants in the country has declined by nearly 10% in the last five years, as per figures released by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on World Elephant Day recently. In 2012, when World Elephant Day was launched, the population of elephants was estimated to be around 30,000. In 2017, it is said to be just over 27,000. Although the government claims that the reduction is due to a more scientific count this time, concerns regarding elephant habitats and their population remain.Conversely, human deaths due to encounters with wild elephants have risen across the country. In the last four years, one human life was lost every day due to human-elephant conflict. A total of 1,465 people have been killed in that time. Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Orissa and West Bengal experience varying levels of human-elephant conflict (HEC), in which annually 400 people, mostly agriculturists or farm workers, lose their lives to this phenomenon.Today, the three coffee plantation districts of Chikkamagaluru, Hassan and Kodagu are adversely affected by the magnitude of HEC which has resulted in several human deaths over the last few years. The economic impact of HEC on the coffee plantation has significant societal ramifications given the number of people involved in the coffee industry.An estimated 27,000 wild elephants are distributed over an area of 65,000 sq km, which covers less than 3% of the countrys geographical area. These mega mammals are dispersed across four large regions, each with several sub-populations from small herds in isolated forest patches to several thousand elephants in large inter-connected landscapes. They are spread across 32 elephant reserves which comprise Protected Areas (PAs) and forests. Unfortunately, all such PAs and forests in our country are highly fragmented because of poor forest management.Poor forest management is evident from the sight of monoculture tree plantations with only single species of trees like teak, silver oaks or rosewood in the midst of national parks. Such trees are devoid of fodder value and their nutrient deficient leaf-litter prevents the proliferation of undergrowth which drives elephants elsewhere in search of food and also makes these animals vulnerable to poachers.Additionally, the unchecked growth of invasive weeds like Lantana camara impedes the free movement of elephants through the forests. These weeds also curb the growth of grass which results in starvation deaths of the Asian elephants, Elephas maximus.More importantly, the presence of railway tracks or highways/local roads in the middle of some PAs results in the collision of elephants with rail engines or heavy vehicular traffic, particularly at night. The PAs also have multiple beat roads for forest staff to patrol, which are unscientifically designed and located close to each other. When elephants take alternative routes to avoid contact with humans, they inadvertently clash with humans in other areas enhancing HEC risk.Another knotty aspect is the inadequate survey and demarcation of forest boundaries, which abut cultivated areas. This results in human intrusion into forest zones, disturbing animals and escalating scope for HEC. In northern Karnataka, Orissa and Jharkhand, elephants have lost large chunks of habitat to mining and encroachments. It is this shrinking of habitat and annoyance in the available area that compels the animals to enter into human habitations in search of food and water.Main stakeholdersThe three HEC stakeholders include man, elephant and the government. Therefore, scientists, foresters, scholars, cultivators, panchayat representatives, elephant lovers, and veterinarians need to deliberate over the problem. The MoEFCC and the seven forest departments where elephants are concentrated should demonstrate the seriousness of intent backed by political will to tackle HEC.The forest departments can consider planting nutrient-rich jackfruit, coconut, corn, sugarcane etc inside the PAs to prevent elephants from crop-raiding elsewhere. To keep them confined inside forests, solar fences and trenches also need to be well maintained. Since it is proven that elephants become panicky when they hear the buzz of bees, farmers involved in honey bee rearing (apiculture) on the periphery of forests can be encouraged to adopt beehive fences through government subsidies.Importantly, raid-friendly farming could be substituted with flowering plants in agricultural areas which adjoin the PAs. It would beautify the landscape and provide nectar for bees while also successfully keeping elephants away. Such practices should involve a politically-backed elephant management policy through consolidation of the animals habitats and the need to maintain the integrity of elephant corridors with necessary budgetary support.The elephants visibility and presence across diverse eco-systems are higher than the tigers. As India pushes forward with development, elephant habitats will come under greater threat, jeopardising their existence. If corrective measures are not immediately undertaken on a war-footing, the big-eared mammal faces the imminent threat of becoming an endangered species.(The writer is Professor, Department of Zoology, Christ University, Bengaluru)"

(Bishwarup Dutta)Garden Reach: A statue of a couple carrying a sack of belongings each stands on the bank of the Hooghly, a stark monument to the indentured labourers crammed into a ship that had set sail from there in 1873 to reach the former Dutch colony of Suriname.Called the Mai Baap statue, it is a replica of the original monument of the same name in Parimaribo, the capital of Suriname on the east Atlantic coast.Minister of state for external affairs M.J. Akbar on Saturday unveiled a Dutch plaque on the base of the Mai Baap statue in Suriname Ghat during an event coinciding with the tiny nation's Independence Day. The memorial previously had plaques in English, Hindi, Bengali and Suriname.""The word 'indentured labour' hides the inherent exploitation of these poor workers. They were taken as replacement slaves and not employees. They were cheated... thaga diya. They had been told that they could come back after five years. But that was not to be,"" Akbar said, harking back to February 26, 1873.That was the day a ship named Lalla Rookh set sail from the jetty of the Calcutta port, carrying 400 labourers, most of them from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They were being taken to Suriname to work in the sugar plantations there.The ship reached its destination on June 5, a day that is since observed in Suriname as ""Indian Arrival Day"".Sixty-four more ships would sail to the South African, African, Caribbean colonies after that historic first trip, carrying millions of indentured labourers.The gathering at Suriname Ghat on Saturday included the Surinamese ambassador Aashna Kanhai, herself a descendant of indentured labourers. She said the labourers had left Indian shores with just two pairs of clothes and a copy each of the Hanuman Chalisa and the Bhagwad Gita.Kanhai said India's relationship with the former Dutch colony had since undergone a sea change.The focus has shifted from exploitation to reconnecting with the huge Indian diaspora and ""strengthening the bond"" through various programmes.Dutch ambassador Alphonsus Stoelinga recalled that slavery being abolished in 1816 was the trigger for the influx of indentured labourers to the colonies.""This created a huge demand for cheap labour in the plantations. In 1871, the Dutch bought recruitment from British India,"" he said.On Lalla Rookh, Stoelinga said the name of the ship came from the eponymous poem by Thomas Moore that speaks of the love of the tulip-cheeked princess of Aurangzeb."

Initially I couldnt find a gardener  my security guard helped out  and I couldnt find a nursery nearby  I had to hop over to the one in Salt Lakes IB Block  but things have settled down now and my plants are flourishing.On the terrace I have cacti, Karamcha, Lemon Grass, Millis and bonsais that are 35 years old. Initially I had planted an Aloe Vera as I wanted to see its beautiful white flower in bloom. But then I read about its medicinal properties and my husband and I started having a tablespoon of Aloe Vera juice daily. Today I give it credit for keeping my blood sugar in control.The neighbouring buildings block much of the sunlight from entering our driveway so I try to grow plants here that prefer the shade like Coriander, Orchid, Money Plants and lots of Bananas. I also have medicinal plants like Tulsi and Basab, the leaves of which cure the cough. So many people would come to ask for these leaves that I planted the Basab outside the house for all to access easily.But Im concerned by a rising trend in New Town. While I have a lot of greenery in my compound, the other houses here are giving a concrete cover to the entire land within their gates. Soil, they say, will give rise to plants and that will have to be cleaned and looked after.

No starch can be added. Careful kneading is recommended because the ""mouth feel"" of a Banglar Rasogolla would depend on how well this has been done.The spherical dumplings should weigh around 10gm each. The syrup needs to be light - the stipulated sugar concentration is 30 to 40 per cent - and have a transparent appearance.""The chewiness and hardness of Banglar Rasogolla is lower compared to the ones made in other states, including Odisha, Jharkhand and Bihar. Average moisture content is about 50 per cent compared to 55.49 per cent for others,"" said an officer of the team that had led Bengal's campaign for the GI tag.A manufacturer would be allowed to use the Banglar Rasogolla logo only after meeting all these specifications. ""We can help manufacturers do that, if they are willing (to be guided). But till their product meets the prescribed quality, it will not get the branding of Banglar Rasogolla,"" Hom Choudhury said.The Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabasayee Samity comprises more than a lakh sweetmeat dealers, excluding those in Darjeeling district.Given the standards that have to be adhered to, nobody knows how many would be keen to invest time and resources into getting the Banglar Rasogolla tag.""We are not sure if we really need the branding of Banglar Rasogolla.

Pictures by Sudeshna BanerjeeShe came to CK Block, where her in-laws live as a joint family, as a new bride 24 years ago. Her brother-in-laws son Shashank, then just three years old, was devoted to her, because, among other reasons, Chachi was a fabulous cook.My school friends wanted to come home just for the food she would rustle up. She knew Marwari food and she would also make ravioli and risotto. She would cook Dum Pukht Biryani actually in a pot, says Shashank Agarwal of his aunt and now business partner Sarika Agarwal.The aunt-nephew duo started with a small health food joint as a franchisee for a year opposite Bengal Tennis Academy. But that did not work. People wanted a fulfiling meal. So they have now opened Studio Cafe at the same spot. Opening a cafe was always my dream. I told Shashank: Just give me a carpenter and a painter, I will do the rest. I purchased everything for the decor.Studio Cafe is a combination of a studio on the first floor and a cafe downstairs. The first floor is let out for parties for which the catering is done by the cafe. In the weekends, we host workshops, says Sarika.On the ground floor, the cafe is a 45-seater, part of which is designed to be let out separately. We have planned our menu like a delis, incorporating dishes from Continental, Thai and Chinese cuisine, says Shashank.A highlight of the food served is the option of avoiding flour in the list of ingredients used. Even our pizzas and pastas are wheat-based though we can make normal versions too in case a guest insists on it. Pizzas are all thin-crust.Similarly, their risottos are made with barley, oats or quinoa, instead of rice. Our Panini sandwiches are wheat-based too.In some dishes, she has given a Marwari touch. Our paneer fritters are wrapped with papad, Sarika smiles.Her teenaged son Krish loves parking himself at the joint when he is hungry after tennis lessons. He loves the mojitos, smoothies and hot chocolate that they make here, Sarika smiles. We also keep protein shakes for gym-goers and kids favourites like potato wedges.Why avoid wheat: Some experts believe that giving up not just gluten, but wheat altogether, could lead to weight loss and health benefits. Aside from some extra fiber, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is really little different, and often worse, than drinking a can of sugar-sweetened soda or eating a sugary candy bar, cardiologist William Davis writes in Wheat Belly.Dish of our pick: Chicken Malay Laksa, a thick gravy dish with a touch of lemongrass that is proof of its Far East origin. It has babycorn, broccoli, beans, zucchini and chicken underneath a forest of crisp rice noodles placed in a heap on top.Spot that caught our eye: A cosy alcove for two where a pair of lovers can snuggle.

Picture by Sanat Kr SinhaCalcutta: The number of children with Type I diabetes has gone up from four in 100,000 to 15 in 25 years.The reasons could be fewer mothers breastfeeding their babies and more adults suffering from the disease, according to doctors.But keeping the blood sugar level in check, taking the right insulin dose and a controlled diet can help a person lead a normal life.""Deficiencies in the immune system of a child will make him/her more prone to viral attacks... this can act as a trigger for Type I diabetes to set in,"" Subrata Dey, paediatric endocrinologist, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals, said.Breastfeeding a child strengthens his/her immune system.The practice is on the wane as more and more young working mothers get to spend little time with their children apart from lack of awareness, he said.Dey spoke to Metro on the sidelines of an Apollo Gleneagles programme on Tuesday on the occasion of World Diabetes Day and Children's Day.Fifteen children with Type I diabetes attended the programme with their parents.Another key factor behind the rise in Type 1 diabetes is the growing number of people with Type 2 diabetes, Subhankar Chowdhury of SSKM Hospital said.Chowdhury heads the department of endocrinology at the hospital's Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research.Children of parents with Type 2 diabetes are more likely to get Type 1 diabetes if they are predisposed to insulin deficiency, he said.Latest studies show Scandinavian countries like Finland have the highest percentage of children with Type 1 diabetes, Chowdhury said.""In comparison, the percentage in India is lower. But a small percentage in India means a large number because of the population,"" he said. More than 120,000 people have Type 1 diabetes in India, according to the studies, he said.In both types, people suffer from deficiency of insulin, a hormone that converts sugar and starch into energy.Type 1 diabetes is found mostly in children and Type 2 mostly in adults.Chowdhury said a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research across 10 states had showed that the urban-rural divide was waning when it came to diabetes.At the Apollo programme, many of the parents whose children were diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes long ago assured parents of children diagnosed with the disease recently, some a week ago, that the disease is manageable.""My daughter was diagnosed two years ago.

On December 15, a group of environmentalists who went to survey the lake and watch birds on the lake were shocked to see foam spilling over. We could not stand there for more than 10 minutes. The stench was unbearable and it became suffocating, said Vinny R Peter, an independent research scholar.The lake was once a hotspot for water birds and migratory birds. As per the environmentalists, the entire outlet channel is filled with foam.K Mohanraj, who had posted a video of the lake foaming in 2010, said, All the lakes in the downstream of the city are polluted. The main cause is the industrial sewage that gets mixed in the lake. We need to analyse and find out where the inlets are being polluted. There are more than 100 inlet channels for the lakes in rural areas, he said. He added that it was not just Irugur lake. Such foaming is often reported at Ondipudur near the road level bridge. Foaming is also reported near Thondamuthur and at Teungupalayam near Sugarcane Breeding Institute.Earlier, dyeing industries were set up here. But they were all shut down but now we think some people are illegally running it at home. Continuous monitoring is required to understand the causes, said Mohanraj. Environmentalists also pointed out agricultural pesticides could also be a reason for the foaming. Unless a study is carried out, they said, the exact reason could not be pointed out.Mohammed Saleem, of an environmental conservation group, said no steps were taken in the past decade by the government to stop such foaming. The government is not making environment a priority. Long term solutions are not taken and only temporary solutions are implemented. First and foremost thing is to avoid untreated sewage from entering the lakes. They keep telling us that sewage treatment plants will be set up under various projects but not a single plant has been set up so far, he said.Saleem said that despite institutes such as SACON and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in the city, it was surprising that not a single study had been carried out on the city lakes. Nobody has taken any initiative to study nor have they come out with solutions, said Saleem. The pollution control board officials and the district administration officials could not be reached for a comment.City environmentalists called for a holistic plan to stop sewage from entering into the drains and canals. Strict legislations and rules need to be followed to save water bodies. Several high court and Supreme Court orders are yet to be implemented. Encroachments around the lakes have not been removed despite warnings. Unless the state government takes it up seriously, water bodies will continue to get contaminated, said Mohanraj."

Pilibhit is among the narrowest tiger reserves in India, and in many areas, fields along the edge merge with the forests.Disquiet has given way to clamour in the fields around Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Uttar Pradesh. At the heart of this clamour is an unfolding tragedy, as one or more tigers continue to claim human lives. Fifteen people have lost their lives since last November. Villagers have blocked highways and traded charges with forest managers. But the solutions considered thus far to mitigate the human-animal conflict in Pilibhit have been mostly poorly thought out.Misconceptions around the human-tiger interface in PTR are widespread. For instance, it has been reported in a section of the media that unlike other tiger habitats, humans live cheek by jowl with big cats in Pilibhit, and thus routinely fall victim to them. Another theory is that the areas tigers, being unaccustomed to humans, have taken to attacking them. Another theory pins the blame on the emergence of a population of man-eating tigers. Some contend that Pilibhits tiger population has doubled since its designation as a reserve three years ago, and therefore the big cats are spilling out into farmlands in search of habitat and prey. Until its creation in May 2014, the area today that constitutes PTR was one of north Indias most productive timber-yielding reserve forests.Logging crews and local residents, grazing their cattle or harvesting minor forest resources frequented the reserve on a daily basis. Given this, Pilibhits tigers are likely to be accustomed to human presence. Many generations of the regions human population have also lived in close proximity to tigers  presumably todays residents of the region are also well aware of the perils of venturing into the forest after dark, and of other basic precautions they need to take when living in the vicinity of tigers.Pilibhit is among the narrowest tiger reserves in India, and in many areas, fields along the edge merge with the forests. These fields, especially when seen from the eyes of a wild feline, are grasslands, extensions of natural habitats and corridors. They hold water because they are well-irrigated, and shelter pigs and hog deer and are thus attractive for wild carnivores. These farmlands have replaced expansive tracts of forest and riparian habitats, with land-use change that began in the colonial area. The presence of tigers in these farmlands is thus neither novel nor unexpected. For the most part, they move through such areas, silent and unseen under cover of darkness, avoiding humans, light and noise.Data also does not support the claim of a rapidly growing tiger population in PTR. Instead, the population has fluctuated greatly since 2010, and is characterised by high turn-over (where the same tigers are not seen from one year to the next) and moderate adult survival. The occurrence of a large tiger population, a dense human population within five kilometres of the forests edge, extensive sugarcane cultivation and the forests narrow geography do increase the potential for the spatio-temporal overlap of humans and tigers.It is also untenable that Pilibhits tiger population is biologically predisposed to preying on humans, more than any other tiger population. Recent attacks on humans in and around PTR could primarily be attributed to one or two animals that could be young individuals in marginal habitats without territories, older individuals with disabilities, or those with debilitating injuries. Conflict mitigation in PTR needs to shift from a case-by-case response to a cohesive and coordinated approach. There are lessons to be learnt from the Sunderbans in West Bengal where tiger attacks on humans are managed on a regular basis. The state has evolved mechanisms to identify and relocate the conflict-causing tiger(s). It has also established quick response teams to ward off straying tigers and aid in their capture, when necessary.Following the Sunderbans example, PTRs administration should take steps to build rapid response teams comprising wildlife veterinarians, forest department staff, and local volunteers trained to contain conflict-prone animals and engage irate crowds. The local police too needs to be integrated into these response teams and assist in crowd control. Educators and public health professionals need to engage communities to enhance their preparedness for conflict and reduce casualties.The proposed solution to fence the tiger reserve is not feasible. Fencing in tigers and their natural prey will lead to new problems. These will limit animal dispersal and may increase conflict in the long-run.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Doklam points to the need for a larger response  that takes into account Chinas growing ambitions.The stand-off with China in Doklam is not about who blinks first, it is about a much broader game India has always been a part of. We need to understand what is motivating China in initiating these flare-ups and how we can protect Indian interest. The increasingly aggressive Chinese foreign policy is primarily driven by two factors: A build-up of nationalistic fervour in domestic politics and the Chinese economys hunger for new markets. Soon after taking over as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in 2012, Xi Jinping spoke of the Chinese dream, a term that, among other things, referred to national glory. Soon after he took over as the Chinese president in 2013, Xi undertook efforts to expand the Chinese footprint worldwide.These nationalistic efforts have also resulted in sparking conflicts with inconvenient neighbours. Since 2014, we have seen a pattern: From the PRCs escalating tensions with the Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea to increasing conflict with Japan over Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, from the downturn in relations with South Korea over Seouls deployment of US THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Air Defence) to the tensions over Doklam. Interestingly, each time a conflict arises, the state-run Chinese media drums up patriotic war-rhetoric. A strong nationalist sentiment helps Xi consolidate and look beyond just the next term, which looks certain now. With five of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee set to retire at this years Congress, President Xi is looking to consolidate his hold by getting loyalists like Wang Huning into the PB.Economically and geo-strategically, Xis Chinese Dream is manifesting itself in the project of the century, the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative. The project, announced in 2013, is estimated to cost around $900 billion. It aims to connect 60 per cent of the worlds population from China to Europe in a web of roads, high-speed rail, power lines, ports, pipelines and fiber-optic lines with the goal of stimulating growth in the scores of developing countries that lie en route. Its total estimated cost is less than a third of the $3 trillion foreign exchange reserves China holds and slightly less than the $1 trillion held in the US treasury bills. Apart from politics, there are hard economic compulsions driving OBOR. Unlike India, which remains a consumption-led economy, the Chinese economy has been largely driven by capital investments and exports, which together constitute about two-thirds of its GDP while domestic consumption accounts for the remaining one-third.Since the global financial crisis of 2009, the Chinese economy is confronting the twin problems of falling global demand for its exports and an internal bubble of having invested into over-capacity. China realised that it could not continue to invest more domestically without this bubble bursting and that it couldnt only rely on traditional world markets like the US/Eurozone with global demand failing to pick up. It needed new markets for its exports and for making investments, hence OBOR. It is not OBORs grandeur but rather the speed with which it is engulfing the entire Eurasia that is catching everyone by surprise.Bangladesh signed up for OBOR in October 2016, Nepal in May 2017 and Sri Lanka, already a signatory to OBOR, signed the Hambantota port deal with China last month. The deal gives the Chinese 70 per cent stake in the port at an expected cost of $1.2 billion, but China does not have to pay anything as they have converted part of their $6 billion loan to Sri Lanka into equity. The Hambantota port is crucial to the Maritime Silk Road because it will connect China to Europe, via Mombasa in Kenya, and the Suez Canal to Europe and beyond. Pakistan, one of Chinas close allies, is busy changing its Constitution by recognising the illegally occupied Indian territory of Gilgit Baltistan as its fifth province to facilitate OBOR projects. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), being expanded at a cost of $1.62 billion, is also part of OBOR, aiming to open up development possibilities in the landlocked western parts of China.To our governments credit, we have not played along with China on OBOR. This, as well as our growing strategic engagements with the US, has irked China which was looking for an easy Ahmedabad jhoola ride to further its strategic interest  sugarcoating it with some OBOR economic deals.Even an angry China would not want a full-scale war with India because of the possible collateral consequences. However, it is also clear that it wants to keep India suitably engaged for at least three reasons: First, to provide steady fuel to domestic patriotic rhetoric; second, to put pressure on India to play ball on OBOR; and finally, to ensure we are not able to use our geo-strategic advantages to build a strong international alliance against global Chinese dominance, especially in view of our increasing strategic engagements with the US and Japan.Not joining OBOR is not enough. Time has come to clearly spell out a broader strategy on China. Nothing in Sushma Swarajs statement in the Rajya Sabha in the first week of August indicated that the Narendra Modi government sees the big picture on China. In stark contrast to the BJPs fierce political rhetoric on China during the 2014 election campaign, Sushmaji laid down the timeless virtues of bhasha sayyam in the Rajya Sabha. Is unilateral bhasha sayyam on Doklam standoff in the face of war-rhetoric by PRC an adequate response?With the US distracted by domestic issues, Japan still reeling from stagflation, Russia hit by low oil prices and Eurozone engaged internally post-downturn with questions on Greece turmoil, immigrants and Brexit, the key question that remains unanswered is: Can the world afford to ignore a China looking to dominate a unipolar world? And can we?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The aroma and taste of these ethnic food items are unique. These traditional cuisines, tasty and nutritious, have remained unexplored. Most people in the cities do not know about the value and flavour of these dishes and I am sure our customers will love them, said Ankit Khachi, executive chef of Trident Hotel, Bhubaneswar.Exotic preparations such as kanti, a sweet dish made of black gram cakes coated with sugar syrup, lauki ka paratha and lauki pitha (rice-based flatbread flavoured with bottle gourd), mischi ka saag (a kind of spinach), pani kakharu (water gourd) halwa, muga kakara (moong dal cakes) and mansa pitha (chicken and rice flatbread cooked between sal leaves), bamboo shoot pickle and cakes made of mohua flower were the biggest hits among the chefs. People are becoming more and more health conscious, and eating traditional food is becoming popular nowadays. Most of the items displayed here are slowly getting lost.We would love to introduce some of them in our Odia food restaurant, said Bijay Parida , chef, Mayfair Convention . More than 80 varieties of ethnic food were displayed at the exhibition by people of different communities residing in and around Sukinda. Among these were 30 varieties of traditional cakes, 10 types of rice, 25 curries, and 35 dishes using roots and tubers. The aim behind organizing the food festival is to encourage conservation and promotion of ethnic and tribal foods. This is part of a series of initiatives we have been taking to contribute to the National Biodiversity Target of 2020, said R R Satapathy, general manager, SCM.The festival also provided an opportunity to the tribal women to showcase their traditional culinary skills. Most of the dishes are not cooked these days due to changing lifestyles and the unavailability of many ingredients. If these dishes are included in the menus of big hotels, people can taste them and the items will become popular again, said Baijayanti Murmu of Bhelutangar village in Dhenkanal district."

If the government wants to do it faster, there could be some lessons from Indias nascent and Chinas well-developed futures markets.The agri-futures market is one way to ensure that farmers planting and selling decisions are forward-looking, and not based on past prices. This can help smoothen the typical boom and bust problem in agri-prices. However, there are two key problems with Indian agri-futures: One, they are often disrupted by sudden bans or suspensions by the government as many policy-makers have a deep mistrust in the functioning of these markets; and two, very few farmers or farmer producer organisations (FPOs) trade on futures, which in turn reinforces the mistrust of policymakers. No wonder, the overall size of agri-futures in India remains trapped at low levels, and the most worrying part is that since 2012, it has been tumbling down (see Figure-1). Although the onus of reviving this trend largely lies with agri-commodity exchanges and the regulator, it may be worth looking at the Chinese experience in this context, and see if anything useful can be learnt.Interestingly, India recorded the first trade in futures in 1875 in cotton in the Bombay Cotton Exchange, just 10 years after the first trade was consummated in USA. But Indias agri-futures could not develop much due to a series of suspensions around the Second World War in view of the shortage of essential commodities. This mindset continued post-Independence, and only pepper and turmeric were allowed to trade in 1977. However, it was the bold vision of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that in 2003 three national exchanges were set up and all commodities were allowed to be traded in futures markets. But since 2003, 15 commodity futures were suspended, leading to uncertainty in the market. Despite there being sufficient evidence that spot prices broadly converge with future prices, there remains a mistrust in commodity futures amongst policymakers. No wonder, agri-futures remained at low levels, forming only 2 per cent of 1.6 billion global agri- futures contracts during the triennium average ending (TE)-2016.In comparison, look at China, which started in the early 1990s, and by TE 2016, it was the largest player in global agri-futures contracts with a whopping share of 69 per cent. (Figure 2). What is the secret of Chinese success? China also did a lot of experimentation in the early years, starting as many as 33 commodity exchanges in 1993, but many of them had to be shut down by 1998, and several commodities suspended. One of the key lessons that China learnt from CBOT experts of the US was that a spot or wholesale market of sufficient size and efficiency has to be developed before establishing a vibrant futures market.The other takeaways from the Chinese success in agri-futures are: One, state participation in the futures markets through the State Trading Enterprises; two, no abrupt suspensions of commodities; and three, focus on choice of commodities, which are not very sensitive from the food security point of view. As one can see in Figure 2, the Chinese volume of contracts is much higher in soya, mustard, and corn complexes, which are basically for feed. Palm oil, sugar, cotton and rubber are other commodities that China imports in large volumes, and they are not part of the core food security basket.So, what is the lesson for our regulator and commodity exchanges? The key lesson is: Pick the commodities carefully, and deepen their markets first. SEBI has tried to come up with some indicative criteria in the choice of commodities to be developed for futures markets, but the basic distinction between feed and food commodities is missing. And it is here that the Chinese experience is relevant as they first tried to develop futures in commodities that are non-sensitive from the food security point of view.In this context, in a larger paper with Siraj Hussain, former Secretary, Agriculture, we carried out a Principal Component Analysis taking several commodity parameters into account with a view to identifying the most promising commodities for futures markets. Our results show that commodities with the highest potential for futures trading are either feed material (soybean meal, rapeseed meal, maize) or fibre (cotton), followed by spices and edible oils. Basic staple food items like rice, wheat, and even pulses get a low ranking due to their food security concerns. India being now the largest importer of edible oils, especially palm and soya oils, these are promising candidates for agri-futures provided global players are allowed to trade in these.It is thus obvious that a well thought-out strategy to pick the right commodities is a better way to develop agri-futures rather than a frequent stop-go policy. The trust in commodity futures will enhance once more FPOs start trading on agri-futures, and they start gaining directly or indirectly from agri-futures. SEBI can help incentivise the participation of FPOs on the futures trading platform, but the real onus lies with agri-commodity exchanges, and it is here that the progress has been extremely slow.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational)Chhattisgarhs government schools have been directed to install a large mirror and keep nail clippers and a comb handy, so that students can check for themselves how tidy they are. Self-image is indeed important for young people preparing to go out into the world, and putting their grooming into their own hands also teaches responsibility towards oneself. But along with this very welcome self-image, three images which have nothing to do with learning will also be enshrined in school premises  portraits of the president, prime minister and chief minister  ostensibly because students are asked questions about these political luminaries. Logically and fruitfully, they could be replaced by images of Thiruvalluvar, Sugarloaf Mountain and a wombat, since students are also tested for their knowledge of literature, geography and the life sciences.Back in the 20th century, there was a credible reason for letting the pantheon of the freedom struggle beam down upon students, who were presumed to be preparing to join the project of nation-building. However, in a mature democracy, politics and the people who drive it should be kept out of the schoolroom. Now, pedagogy should be conducted in a culture of openness and enquiry, in which children are encouraged to explore possibilities, instead of restricting them to the narrow tunnel of politically mandated projects. No credible reason remains to overawe students with images of the ruling deities of the political firmament.The world of knowledge has enough heroes of its own. Are school students familiar with the faces of K.G. Subramanyan, M.N. Srinivas and Meghnad Saha? They should be. Images of pathbreakers like Marie Curie, Johannes Kepler and Rene Descartes grace the labs and libraries of European schools. Indian schools neglect to teach students very much about the Indian stars of the firmament of knowledge, such as Aryabhatta, Varahamihira, Sushruta and Kalidasa. By all means, let us have pictures of them put up in schools all over India, and not only in Chhattisgarh. Of the trinity that will preside over the states schools, only the president stands apart. On Teachers Day last year, he taught an excellent class on political and constitutional history in a school on the Presidents Estate in Delhi. But then, his picture will have to be replaced when he demits office in a couple of months, so even that doesnt count.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Empirical evidence also suggests that weakened credit discipline from repeated waivers creates disincentives for further lending by banks.The seeds of loan waiver sown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the form of a promise made during the UP assembly elections, have now turned into a full-grown tree spreading its roots across states. What began with the UP governments announcement in April, followed by Maharashtra, yet another BJP-ruled state, has now been emulated by Punjab and Karnataka where the Congress is in power. The loan waiver amounts vary from Rs 50,000 in Karnataka to Rs one lakh each in UP and Maharashtra, and up to Rs 2 lakh in Punjab. While the UP and Punjab schemes target those with less than five acres holding, the Karnataka and Maharashtra waivers seem to extend to all farmers, albeit restricted only to loans taken from cooperative banks. Either way, given the sheer number of potential beneficiaries, the fiscal costs  for the four states alone, the currently estimated burden is over Rs 85,000 crore  are going to be huge. And these will only mount, as the fever spreads and more states join the bandwagon.Its true that the farming community has gone through a harrowing time, whether due to adverse weather events in 2014-15 and 2015-16 or the more recent price crash across agri-commodities following demonetisation. If at all there is anybody deserving of special support today, it is certainly farmers. Putting the rural economy back on the rails is, moreover, in everybodys interest. But are loan waivers the right way to go about that? To the extent that they impose fiscal costs, these schemes also entail diversion of public resources that could have gone to build rural roads, hospitals, schools and irrigation works. Empirical evidence also suggests that weakened credit discipline from repeated waivers creates disincentives for further lending by banks. The ultimate sufferers from both  less public investment in rural infrastructure and reduced agricultural lending  would be farmers themselves.A loan write-off would be worth it if it specifically targets farmers who have fallen out of the institutional credit system. These farmers, and also those who have always been dependent on borrowing from local moneylenders and traders, have every right to be able to access formal finance that makes them more productive. But farmers would be better helped if they are allowed to realise remunerative prices for their produce. Why is the Modi government still persisting with restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and export of pulses, edible oils or sugar  when none of these exist for steel or software? There is also a case for reviewing import duties on most agricultural commodities; currently, these are way below the rates that India has bound with the World Trade Organisation. Better price realisations, not blanket waivers, is what farmers really require today.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

5b5060109855b708a7ccc122,New health cover to cut old age premium,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-health-cover-to-cut-old-age-premium/articleshow/62110502.cms,2017-12-18,"TNNMumbai: Apollo Munich Health Insurance has introduced a health cover where part of the payment during the earlier years can be used to fund higher rates in future. The advantage for the customer in paying a higher rate now is that the premium is eligible for tax breaks and most youngsters do not use up the full amount of Rs 25,000 for this.Unlike life insurance where insurers are allowed to level the risk premium and charge a uniform rate, health insurance rates rise progressively with the age of the insured. While non-life companies cannot offer products with savings components, Apollo Munich has devised a Health Wallet plan where part of the premium goes toward reserve benefits. The reserve premium can be used to fund health-related costs not covered by insurance. Every year, the unused reserve amount gets carried forward and earns a 6% bonus. This accumulated reserve kitty can in turn be used to pay up to 50% of the renewal premium, after five continuous renewals.To illustrate, a Rs 10,000 annual contribution towards reserve from age 30 will result in a cumulative reserve of Rs 8.48 lakh by age 60. This factors in the 6% bonus on the carried-forward amount every year.The out-of-pocket expenses the reserve funds can be used for includes purchase of medicines, vaccinations, dental expenses, diagnostic tests, spectacles, contact lenses, medical devices like blood pressure and sugar monitors, and consultations with medical practitioners.Apollo Munich Health Insurance CEO Antony Jacob said, It addresses the Indian savings and returns mindset and allows the customers to fund for their health insurance premium in the later years. After retirement, people are worried about funding health insurance premiums. These pertinent concern areas of customers led us to reinvent the industry.For customers who can take care of the first few lakhs of healthcare expenses either with their personal funds or corporate insurance policies, Health Wallet also comes with a deductible option. By opting for deductible, the customer chooses how much expense he/she will be able to take care of in case of a health emergency."

Report after report of the National Family Health Survey has pointed out that more than 50 per cent of expecting mothers in the country suffer from anaemia and around 50 per cent of such women suffer from malnutrition.The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani and Homeopathy (Ayush) has some suggestions for pregnant women. Besides asking them to detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment and lust, and hang beautiful pictures on the wall, the ministry recommends that mothers-to-be shun non-vegetarian food.These pious tips are part of Ayushs booklet Mother and Child Care. Ayush minister, Shripad Yesso Naik, who released the booklet, claims that the booklet puts together relevant facts culled out from clinical practice in the fields of yoga and naturopathy and contains wisdom accumulated over many centuries of yogic practice. But Mother and Child Cares sermons on abjuring non-vegetarian food betray a lack of seriousness about the nutritional requirements of mothers-to-be.Report after report of the National Family Health Survey has pointed out that more than 50 per cent of expecting mothers in the country suffer from anaemia and around 50 per cent of such women suffer from malnutrition. Nutrition deprivation among pregnant women, it is now well-known, perpetuates an inter-generational cycle of such deprivation in children. There is also a vast body of literature on the dietary needs of pregnant women. The guidelines of the National Institute of Health and Nutrition, for example, recommend a diet rich in folic acid, calcium, iodine and protein. While nutritionists might differ on whether plant foods deliver these nutrients as effectively as meat, fish and eggs, the pertinence of non-vegetarian foods for mothers-to-be has never been in question. Mother and Child Care does not even make a pretense of joining this debate.It slots non-vegetarian food in a list of avoidable eatables and beverages that include refined flour, fried items, coffee, sugar and garam masala, but says nothing about how these diet tips could help deal with nutritional deficiencies in pregnant women. The Ayush booklets omission stems from the government body taking a highly moralistic approach to what is essentially a health issue.Ayush got a facelift under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Earlier, a department under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the independent ministry is now a lynchpin in the governments plan to revive the countrys indigenous medicine systems. It was hoped that under Ayush, such systems of medicine would contribute to addressing some of the pressing medical issues in the country, including maternal malnutrition. But going by Ayushs tips to pregnant women, it seems that the ministry is nowhere close to fulfilling that vision.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The state averaged an agri-GDP growth of 5.7 per cent per annum between 1972 to 1986, more than double the all-India average of 2.3 per cent in the same period. But thereafter, the Green Revolution began to gray. The growth rate of Punjabs agriculture fell to 3 per cent per between 1987 to 2005  almost the same as that of the 2.9 per cent growth rate registered by the country in agriculture during this period. Between 2006 and 2015, the states agri-growth rate plummeted to 1.6 per cent  less than half the all-India average of 3.5 per cent (see Graph 1). During this period, states such as Madhya Pradesh registered a growth rate of more than 9 per cent in agriculture.It is not that Punjab has a high value of agri-output per ha that is slowing down its growth rate. The state is nowhere near the top in that ranking (see Graph 2). Getting the state back to a 5 per cent growth path is thus a matter of serious concern. Punjab used to have the highest per capita income amongst the 21 large states of the country till 2003. But it has slipped to the seventh position, and unless there are drastic policy changes, the state is going to slip further.Punjab is endowed with one of the best possible infrastructures for agriculture in the country. It has the highest irrigation cover amongst all states  98.5 per cent of its cropped area is irrigated. Almost 80 per cent of irrigation is from groundwater sources, facilitated by highly subsidised power. Power subsidy in the states current budget has crossed Rs 7,000 crore. This is much higher than the subsidy provided to any other agricultural input. Much of the large power subsidy goes into the cultivation of rice, a water-intensive crop  it requires 25 rounds of irrigation in a season. The power subsidy, then, is leading to the depletion of the states water table. Punjabs water table receded at the rate of 70 cm per year during 2008 to 2012  110 of the 132 blocks have been declared as over-exploited. This is the biggest bane of Punjab agriculture.Punjab does have advantages in other areas. Almost all villages in the state are connected with pucca all-weather roads. The network of regulated mandis in Punjab is one of the best in the country. A robust and fast-moving procurement system has reduced the market risks of wheat and paddy growers in the state. Almost 90 per cent of the market arrivals is procured at the minimum support price (MSP). But this system has also made Punjabs farmers risk averse. This is today the biggest bottleneck in farmers diversifying from the wheat-rice cycle, which occupies more than 83 per cent of Punjabs cropped area.What can be done to make Punjabs agriculture sustainable, especially with respect to its groundwater resources, without hurting farmers incomes? Diversification from common rice to hybrid maize is one option, which can save power subsidy and groundwater, and yet give farmers almost the same income as paddy. But farmers are reluctant to switch to maize because there is no effective procurement system for this crop. Our suggestion to the Punjab government is to tap the savings in power subsidy  roughly Rs 10,000/ha  which could accrue once farmers switch from paddy to maize. The state could use these savings to cover the risk of maize farmers by promoting feed mills for poultry and silage units for milch cattle and encouraging starch industries that use maize.With the new GST regime coming into force, the processing industry could be incentivised to prefer Punjab over other states in purchasing agricultural raw material. To help the state regain ecological balance, any losses on account of procurement may be borne by the Centre. Measures have to be taken to offset the reduction in the area under paddy in Punjab (except basmati, which delivers much higher price to farmers). There should be vigorous efforts to increase productivity and procurement of rice in the eastern states which get much higher rainfall and are more suitable for paddy cultivation. Simultaneously, Punjab should promote the use of micro-irrigation, especially for sugarcane and fruits and vegetables.The dairy and meat industries are other sources of diversification for Punjabs agriculturalists. The state has the highest yield of milch animals in the country and its per capita consumption of milk is also the highest in the country. But the state processes just about 10 per cent of the milk it produces  Gujarat, in contrast, processes about half of the milk it produces. Punjab needs to incentivise private and cooperative dairies to invest in processing milk and milk products. It should target a 20 per cent increase in processed milk in the next five years. More than 67 per cent of milch animals in Punjab are buffaloes. If the state can eradicate the foot and mouth disease, buffalo meat from Punjab can be sold at premium rates in international markets, ultimately benefiting the states dairy farmers.The states farmers should also diversify towards fruit and vegetables. Less than 3 per cent of the cropped area in Punjab is under fruit and vegetables. This needs to go up to 10 per cent over the next five years. However, the government will need to invest in marketing infrastructure for fruit and vegetables, as it did for grains by creating a robust mandi infrastructure. With protected cultivation and an integrated cold chain, backed by a robust food processing industry, Punjab can tap the market for fresh and processed produce in West Asia and Central Asian countries. A modern expressway from Khanna to Kandla could be helpful in the faster transportation of fruit and vegetables.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Its unlikely the current drought in the peninsula would cause any food inflation that the RBI has to be worried about.No monsoon is perfect. Even in the best of years, there are patches that register deficient rainfall. During the current southwest monsoon season (June-September), India as a whole, so far, has received rainfall that is 3 per cent above the historical average or normal for this period. But the countrys southern tip  the old Mysore region (south interior Karnataka), Kerala and Tamil Nadu  has had roughly 25 per cent below-average rains. This comes on top of rainfall deficiency that amounted to over 35 per cent last year. Simply put, this contiguous belt has replaced Maharashtra as the new epicentre of drought, with back-to-back rainfall failures similar to what Marathwada experienced in 2014 and 2015 (thankfully not in 2016 and this year).Its unlikely the current drought in the peninsula would cause any food inflation that the RBI has to be worried about. Lower sugar, maize or jowar production in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will be more than made up by output rebound in other states, especially Maharashtra. The same goes for milk, where the big producing states  from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh  have all recorded enough rain to ensure plentiful fodder and feed availability. But merely because the countrys overall agricultural production will not take a hit cannot be reason to ignore the crisis thats bound to unfold in the deep south  it may be no less political, more so with assembly elections less than eight months away in Karnataka.Last September saw a major stand-off when the Karnataka government, in deference to a Supreme Court order, was forced to release water from its reservoirs on the Cauvery river basin to the Mettur dam across the border in Tamil Nadu. It triggered violent protests by pro-Kannada groups who contended that there was hardly any water in the Krishna Raja Sagara and other Cauvery reservoirs to meet their own farmers irrigation needs. The reservoir levels now are lower than even last years. Fresh tensions could erupt in about a month from now, when farmers in Tamil Nadus delta districts start transplanting their main Samba paddy crop. This is precisely the time for the Centre to convene a meeting of the three states to initiate drought relief work in advance and also arrive at some understanding on sharing of waters, of the Cauvery or the Periyar.

But, disappointingly, he has not been up to the task.Less than a week after assuming office as Punjab Chief Minister, Amarinder Singh announced that his government would follow a zero tolerance policy on corruption. On Tuesday, he vowed to clamp down on corruption with an iron hand. In the past six days, when his government has been embarrassed with allegations of corruption against the states irrigation and power minister,Rana Gurjit Singh, the Punjab CM has had a chance to put his strong words into practice. But, disappointingly, he has not been up to the task. The Punjab government has asked retired high court judge, Justice J.S. Narang, to probe the allegations of impropriety against the minister in last weeks multi-crore sand mining auctions. If the Punjab CM is indeed serious about curbing corruption, he should remove his colleague from his position in order to facilitate a fair probe.Opposition parties, the Aam Aadmi Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have been demanding the sacking of Gurjit Singh for allegedly acquiring sand and gravel mines through benami transactions in the name of his former cook, Amit Bahadur. Gurjit Singh has denied links with Bahadur, who was formerly employed with Rana Sugar, the outfit which successfully bid for a Rs 26.5 crore sand mine in Nawanshahr. The charges against the minister are too serious to be addressed by such disclaimers. The sand mines in question are in the rivers whose upkeep Gurjit Singh is responsible for as the irrigation minister.And in his election affidavit, the minister had disclosed financial transactions with three companies headed by Bahadur. This conflict of interest should have been apparent to the Punjab CM in the first place. It is unfortunate that he has chosen to maintain a guarded silence even after these facts have come to public light. During the SAD-BJPs stint in office, Amarinder Singh accused the Badal family of letting the mining mafia have a free run, leading to a drain of the states resources.The Congress manifesto in the elections, which brought it to office in Punjab, promised to get rid of nepotism in the states administration. After taking over as CM, Amarinder Singh has often emphasised transparency in governance as the key to raising the states growth rate, much below the national average. Such lofty words will mean nothing if the Punjab CM cannot ensure a fair investigation into the allegations against Minister Gurjit Singh.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Laxman. Actually, one  Virat Kohli.When a simple variation of the light bulb joke sums up Indian crickets farcical state of affairs, while getting dragged for a month and half, it ceases to be funny. It was in the last week of May that the BCCI, when pressed by Kohli to replace coach Anil Kumble, asked former players to post their CVs at coachappointment@bcci.tv.Trust the charmingly acerbic Farokh Engineer to foresee the satirical drama that was to follow. Engineer disdained the coach selection process, saying greats of the game need to be invited for an interview and not made to apply like clerks or purchase officers. Even Engineer wouldnt have anticipated that in the days to come the search for the next India coach would end up as some grand diabolical roast that lampooned the stalwarts of the game and the system they were part of.In hindsight, had the petulant skipper been indulged early by putting sugary sweet Ravi Shastri in a cone or on a stick  depending on his preference of course  and handing it to him in May itself and not as late as mid-July, the sun would have continued to shine brightly from the rainbow-hued skies of cricketopia. A few tears would have been shed for the outgoing coach but remember, at the end of the day, Anil Kumble was a bowler. The 619 wickets are fine, thanks for the effort, but he wasnt the Fab Four, was he?As for Tendulkar, Ganguly and Laxman, with their halos glowing ever so brightly, they would have continued to wave and smile at fans through their retirement years. The BCCI suits would have strained their hands patting their own backs. The Committee of Administrators, for overseeing the quick coach switch, would have expected to get a very good from the bright red pen of Supreme Court in the margins of their homework book. All they needed to do was give Shastri to Kohli the moment he made a face. It was as simple as giving a candy to a child.They eventually did that  late night on July 11  but long after the ceiling fan at Indian crickets Hall of Fame had thrown the fertiliser around. It was ugly from the start. The initial cast was: Kumble, the conniving autocratic alpha male; Sehwag, the establishment candidate; Shastri, the yes man. Its easy to blame the media for this name-calling and ridicule them for trusting their sources but they were merely being messengers. There were insiders ready to express their angst, or on some occasions, pedal their agenda.After the three protagonists came the perpetual optimists  Tom Moody and Richard Pybus. You wondered what chance these outsiders had in this reunion of men who had spent their entire youth together. How could Paaji, Dada and Lachhubhai pick Moody or Pybus over Viru or Ravibhai? A more representative panel than the one that had three close buddies from the same generation would have been more suited for this job. More so in this season of revamp, when the howling winds of change were carrying words like conflict-of-interest and good governance from the rooms of the Supreme Court to the cricket maidans.Once Kohli remained stubborn and rejected his one-time seniors call to sort out his differences with Kumble, the spotlight was on Ganguly. Thats because Shastri had re-applied. Just a year ago, Ganguly had rejected Shastri, even humiliated him, by not turning up to interview him and asking Kumble to apply. Till a day before the eventual announcement, Ganguly seemed to be hinting it was anybody but Shastri.It all changed overnight. Surprisingly, Ganguly hasnt yet thrown a fit, a tantrum or a resignation letter. Had Shastri improved as a coach in a years time or has Ganguly mellowed? What happened to the man who had kept Steve Waugh waiting? Where was the prince who took on the establishment? By all accounts, Ganguly too loves being in the commentary box and sitting on the Bengal cricket chiefs throne at Eden Gardens. He is also an expert on a news channel. It so happens that the same media group that has Ganguly on its rolls first broke the stories about Kumble quitting and Shastris selection. Someone needs to run a fine comb into Gangulys media contracts to see if he, along with giving expert comments, also needs to break stories.Then theres V.V.S. Laxman who shares the dug-out with Moody during the IPL season  the latter was among the coaching aspirants. Laxman is said to have recused himself during Moodys presentation. Thankfully, no one from the Mumbai Indians dressing room applied or else Tendulkar too would be doing the same. The meeting room would have needed a revolving door.Such situations arise since these are not paid panelists. Unpaid part-timers on ad-hoc committees cant be held accountable. While most sporting bodies globally are embracing professional sports administration, crickets superpower believes in honorary roles. They still want the world to believe that Indias former greats live on air and adulation. Our superheroes cant have salary slips tucked in the pockets of their tights.The BCCI officials too came across as bungling figures. They first failed to smell the dressing room rift, they later brazened it out and eventually got beaten by the media in announcing the name of the new coach. At the end of it all, the SC-appointed administrators were sporting a forced smile, exposing their lack of teeth. They werent informed when the BCCI, in a bid to accommodate Shastri, extended the deadline to apply for the coachs job. It didnt disturb them that the cricketers committee was in a conflict of interest situation.A day after the coach saga ended, they sent out a statement. Defining the role of a coach they said, A coach is a mentor  a friend and an elder buddy. The coach has to provide backroom support. They could have just said the coach has to be Ravi Shastri. They go on to conclude that they wanted to put the immediate past to rest and hoped that the sun shone brightly from the rainbow hued skies of cricketopia.Postscript: Those who bought that dream also bought flying pigs and walking fishes.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The release of the tax rates in the public domain has happened 40 days before July 1, the day the GST regime kicks in.With the legislative groundwork for the transition to the Goods and Services Tax regime largely wrapped up, the GST Councils 14th round deliberations in Srinagar over the last two days were focused on the most contentious non-legislative agenda items  the approval of the GST rules, the fitment of over 1,200 commodities into the five pre-announced tax slabs and the tax rates on services. On Friday, the second day of the meeting, the Council decided to tax services under four slabs of 5 per cent, 12 per cent, 18 per cent and 28 per cent. The culmination of the two-day meeting  where the Council cleared seven of the nine draft rules, approved the fitment of 1,211 items into the designated tax slabs and also cleared the service tax rates  marks a resounding success for Centre-state deliberations and takes the GST implementation into its last lap. The draft rules, alongside clarity on tax rates, are crucial for India Inc. to realign its existing processes and reporting mechanisms to the requirements of the new regime. The release of the tax rates in the public domain has happened 40 days before July 1, the day the GST regime kicks in.This is much better than the 14 days notice expected earlier.The biggest takeaway, though, is that despite pulls and pressures from disparate lobbies and the wrangling generally witnessed among states, the Council has managed to achieve an agreement on clubbing the bulk of the items into the two standard rates of 12 per cent and 18 per cent. To its credit, the Council has also substantially pruned the list of exemptions, with only seven per cent of total items indicated to be kept nil-rated. As expected, foodgrain and milk have been exempted from the GST while mostly essential consumer products, such as edible oil, sugar and tea, are bracketed under 5 per cent. Notably, items constituting 52 per cent weight in the consumer price index remain exempt even now. Nevertheless, the low GST rates on daily items consumed by households lend credence to Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys assertion that the new regime will be non-inflationary and that many commodities could see a reduction in prices due to the elimination of the cascading effect of taxes.Having come under fire earlier for having too many tax slabs, which is essentially seen as a distortion of the original single-rate GST structure, the big success of the two-day meeting pertains to the overall macro picture  that the two standard rates of 12 and 18 per cent account for 60 per cent of all items and only around 19 per cent of the items have been pushed into the higher rate of 28 per cent and beyond (including the cesses). Within services, health and education and most others that are exempted now will remain so. India Inc. can finally gear up for the transition to what is being called the biggest tax reform since Independence.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

A significant takeaway from the back to back moisture failures of 2014 and 2015 was that the impact was felt mostly by farmers and rural producers.The India Meteorological Department has been fairly accurate in forecasting the monsoon in recent times. Its prognosis of below-normal rainfall in both 2014 and 2015, and a return to normalcy in 2016, turned out directionally correct, even if not so much in magnitude. So, theres something to cheer about the official weather agency predicting a normal southwest monsoon this year too, though the expected rainfall, at 96 per cent of the countrys long period average, isnt the best one could ask for. The biggest source of uncertainty right now is the prospect of a fresh El Nino event, after the last one from February 2015 to May 2016 that caused Indias worst drought since 1986-87. Most global models are, however, pointing to only weak El Nino conditions, that too developing only during the latter part of the monsoon season. Together with the summers early onset this time  the monsoon is ultimately about moisture-laden winds blowing in from a high-pressure area (the Arabian Sea) to one of low pressure (over land) created by intense heating  it could be inferred that we are in for good rains in June-July.That being the case, the Centre should draw up plans, in coordination with the states, to ensure adequate supply of seeds, fertiliser and credit to enable early kharif plantings by farmers. There is also a need to announce minimum support prices early enough to induce both timely sowing and also send the right signals of what crops to grow. A special campaign to push the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana  explaining the benefits of insuring ones crop by paying a premium of just 2 per cent and assuring immediate claim payments through the use of technology  can further boost farmers confidence ahead of the sowing season. Farmers should, in general, be encouraged to grow more pulses and oilseeds  as they did last year  and cultivate rice, sugarcane or hybrid cotton only in areas where there is enough water.A significant takeaway from the back to back moisture failures of 2014 and 2015 was that the impact was felt mostly by farmers and rural producers. This is unlike past droughts, in which consumers in cities and urban centres also bore the brunt. Given the fundamental reality today of the terms of trade shifting against Bharat as opposed to India, this is also the time for the government to dispense with controls on agri-commodities, be it the imposition of stock-holding limits or export and domestic movement restrictions. With well-functioning crop insurance, efficient markets with the freedom to sell or stock agri-produce, and targeted direct benefit transfers, there will be no need for loan waivers, free power and other such sops that farmers can well do without.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

However, the government is unsuccessfully conducting surveys and every time there is a change in action, failed attempts to find out the number and there is no solution, activist Heramb Kulkarni said.The NGOs have said that the government should have drafted an action plan by now for students remaining out of school.After the two surveys conducted by the state government failed, activists and NGO representatives have been consistently following up with the government.Vivek Pandit, another activist, said, The government said last year that a new survey will start after the monsoon, but there is nothing happening. In the wake of this lethargic attitude of the government, the high court decision is appropriate.The NGOs have been demanding that they be involved in this exercise of spotting out-of-school children for years.Kulkarni said, We are well networked with the migrants, children of sugarcane and brick kiln workers and others who are vulnerable to the situation of remaining out of school. Hence, it has been our demand to survey the children.A list of close to 862 NGOs working in this field in Maharashtra has already been submitted to the state education department.When contacted, state education secretary Nand Kumar said, The government has been doing work to enrol out-of-school students in schools. Various measures have been implemented from time to time and the biggest responsibility to ensure all children in age group of 6-14 are educated is on teachers.He added that a set of new measures were recently announced which included a stroll by teachers near sugarcane factories, brick kilns and construction sites. Teachers must find migrant children from these sites and a list should be prepared. These students should be enrolled in the nearest schools."

Interestingly, Ramala falls in Chhaprauli, the lone assembly constituency in Baghpat that was won by RLD's Sahender Singh Ramala Since Jats are deeply associated with cane farming in West UP, Yogi government has been focusing on sugar mills ever since it came to power. BJP appointed controversial leader, Suresh Rana, who is known as a Hindu hardliner from west UP, as sugarcane development minister and the ministry has since been in an active mode to keep cane farmers in good humour.In West UP, the CM has also made concerted effort to ensure that private mills, which impact masses in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Saharanpur, Sambhal and Amroha, begin crushing this time. Some of these mills had closed six to nine years ago.Similarly, the CM has sanctioned Rs 325 crore to increase the capacity of Snehroad Najibabad Sugar Mills which would affect masses in Bijnore and Najibabad Lok Sabha constituencies and Rs 78 crore for Moinuddinpur Sugar Mills, which would impact voters in Meerut and Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituencies.Baghpat MP and Union minister of state for human resources Satya Pal Singh, a Jat, would play host to CM Yogi on December 23. Singh told TOI that Ramala Sugar Mills' capacity would increase two-fold after expansion.Yogi's efforts are being seen as a bid to stake claim to the legacy of Charan Singh and keeping his son Ajit Singh and his party Rashtriya Lok Dal at bay."

The tertiary care centre, will now further intensify its existing efforts to not just create awareness about diabetes but also initiate broad-based efforts for early diagnosis and intervention.Sharing more details, Dr Mayur Patel, chairman & chief diabetologist, SDC, said, India has 72.9 million diabetics and stands second in the world in terms of high number of diabetics in here and the number is likely to cross 134.3 million in 2045 if concentrated efforts are not made for curbing the incidence of diabetes. While we have been working towards screening patients for prevalence of diabetes, the same will be done in a more focused manner going forward, to ensure early intervention.Our aim is early diagnosis, early intervention and treatment and in turn, controlled blood sugar. At the same time, we are also trying to create awareness among the younger population to inculcate a healthy lifestyle which includes eating a balanced diet, regular exercise and stress management, among others. This is because an unhealthy lifestyle is the primary cause of diabetes, added Dr Mayur.Apart from this, the diabetes care centre is aiming to emerge as a centre of excellence in clinical care, education, research, community health and help poor patients.In fact, medical experts have been long emphasizing on early interventions primarily because diabetes is a leading cause of various other life-threatening disorders. Diabetic patients are 2-4 times more likely to get heart disease or stroke. Diabetic patients are 20 times more likely to get amputation of leg and 17 times more likely to get kidney failure compare to non-diabetics, said Dr Yash Patel, director and consultant diabetologist, SDC."

We are impressed by Indias infrastructural growth and the services the country can offer us, Samuel Baasil said. He had a meeting with NEXT Techno solutions at Tidel Park on Friday. The company supplies IT and solar and energy solutions, and medical equipment to Papua New Guinea. Its director G Karthikeyan told TOI that they were looking to increase their exports to Papua New Guinea, besides looking at more business options.We are looking at machinery for cement mixtures, vehicles, toilet rolls, envelopes, bulb making, sugarcane juice machines and other agricultural machinery. Presently, we import them from Australia and New Zealand and it is very expensive. We can buy these products from India and even Coimbatore, Samuel Basil said.He said Papua New Guinea already enjoys several ties with the city.

Last year, the cost of a normal plum cake was around Rs 340 per kg but this time it has reached Rs350. Even if the price has gone up, around 15% increase in cake sale has been reported in the last one week itself, said Kerala bakers association President Vijesh Viswanathan However, cake lovers in the city are not worried about the price hike or GST. Most of them are willing to spend on their favourite cakes, no matter how expensive it is.Despite the presence of customized cakes  like sugar-free, trans-fat free, glutenfree, preservatives-free and eggless cakes  the formidable and traditional plum cake rules has a special place in the minds of Kochiites.A Christmas without rich, dark and toothsome plum cakes filled with raisins, candied fruits and spices will be incomplete. Trends may come and go. Similarly, prices shall also go up and down, but nothing can replace the happiness of having a slice of plum cake with red wine, said Sherly Mathews , a retired economics professor.Plum cakes have grabbed around 40-50% of cake sale in Kochi alone over the past few years. We are expecting around Rs 5-6 crore turnover from cake sales in Ernakulam alone during Christmas, Viswanathan added.The price of rich plum cake is Rs 600 for 900g. Irish plum cakes will cost around Rs 320 for 800g, fruit 'n' nut will cost Rs 580 for 900g, while nut cake will cost Rs 360 for 800g. Christmas hampers can cost between Rs 1,000 & 3,000.

Twenty-nine more FPOs will be added in the ongoing financial year.The report makes out a case for integration of FPOs into the agriculture policy of the state by providing them agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) licenses.In the case of wheat, out of 74 sampled farmers, 73 continued to sell their produce directly even after FPOs were formed.

It is home to Christian institutions, churches of different denominations and of course, a considerable Christian population, the influence of which can best be felt during the Yuletide season. With just 10 days to Christmas, we decided to go on a festive walk down Camps quaint bylanes and alleys, through the eyes of people whove grown up there. While they talk about how the locality vies with changing times to retain its old-world charm, especially during this season, they add that it continues to welcome those who come looking to partake in the celebrations...For chartered accountant Suresh Castellino, the sixth-generation member of the family that grew up in their 125-year-old iconic Therese Building off MG Road, Christmases past were synonymous with family time. As kids, wed wait for school to close; the last day was invariably a half day with a Christmas party. The first thing wed do after coming home was assemble our crib, which is over a hundred years old. It would be a challenge tying the moss around the wooden frame for Jesus manger, but thats something we enjoyed doing together as a family, Suresh reminisces. His mother, Audrey, tells us that Christmas in Camp was a lot quieter back then. Celebrations werent so large in scale. It was mainly defined by house parties. Friends and relatives would visit to wish us all the way up till Epiphany (which marks the end of Christmas), says Audrey. The tradition of house visits still holds, but it has gone down for sure, she adds. Christmas in Camp has become brighter and more inclusive today. It is celebrated by everybody, not just the Christians. This is especially evident by how crowded MG Road gets two weeks before Christmas, adds Suresh.57-year-old Carl Martyres, who lives with his family in Pudumjee Park in a rustic family home that his grandmother built in 1935, recalls, We were about 40 families in the area, and Christmas visits would go on till a week after Christmas Day. Back then, there were no time restrictions. I remember visiting friends as late as 11.30 pm, and wed be warmly welcomed. Today, one has to seek an appointment before going over to someones place! I guess thats a change were seeing globally.Sixty-nine-year-old Nicky Picardo, who grew up in Pudumjee Compound, remembers how his non-Christian neighbours would come over to help with making the Christmas sweets. Everyone would get involved, whether it was rolling the kulkuls out on forks, or frying the neurios (better known as karanji). Theyd then taste the sweets, and shower my mother with khoop chaan among other praises, says Nicky. Homes were smaller, but hearts were large. After the cake was mixed, it would be taken to the local bakery (when people didn't have the space for ovens in their small homes, these bakeries were a saving grace with enough room to bake personal cakes as well), says Nicky. We didnt even have baking trays back then, so wed get our cakes baked in large handis. Once ready, wed bring them back home from the bakery, cut them into slices and distribute them, says Nicky. He says that the quantities shared back then were substantial. Visits would entail talking about Christmas while tasting the goodies people shared. I remember us having fights at home with regards to who would go to which home with the sweets. Plates sent to neighbours would also come back home with a return gift  a piece of barfi or jaggery, or just sugar, if not anything else, adds Nicky. Today, his wife Tessy and he are among the several popular home bakers in Camp, known for their rum-soaked, fruit-laden cakes among other festive goodies. While star hotels and local bakeries continue to draw crowds, these bakers serve a dedicated clientele.Carl remembers how each household in Pudumjee Park specialised in some sweet preparation or the other. One house made the best nankatahis, while another was known for its rose cookies... Wed get to sample all these, thanks to the sharing of sweets and its reciprocation. Today, sweets are still sent home, albeit in disposable boxes. Most of these are ordered from out. Today, families struggle to find time to make sweets at home. Sitting around the table and making sweets is indeed a luxury now! he says.I grew up close to Sachapir and Convent streets, where celebrations were grand, so Christmas holds special place in my heart. I remember driving by cribs on pavements that would depict Jesus birth, and enjoying sweetmeats from the local bakeries. Of course, wed also have our own Parsi version of Santa Claus at Mody Colony! Today, during these trying times, we can all do with a little bit of Christmas cheer, especially the one you find in Camp. Viraf Phiroz Patel , actor. He grew up in Camps Mody ColonyA December walk down the Dastur Meher Road and Taboot Streets quaint alleys wont just leave you with visuals of homespun architecture, but the sounds of festive tunes too. They magically waft out of households into your heart, getting you into the Christmas mood. According to Trevor Martin, who grew up in the lane behind Fatima General Store, carols adorned with Jim Reeves warm baritone, or the more retro-style Boney M ones were commonly heard in the neighbourhood even back in the day. Besides homes (that would play them on cassettes and LP records), wed also get to hear Christmas music being played at cribs installed on the pavements. The residents of Taboot Street would also put up big stars fashioned out of wood and paper, with smaller ones being strung across the inner bylanes. The decoration and fanfare has definitely reduced, but you can still catch sight of some cribs and stars in the area, says Trevor, who taught at St Vincents School for many years.Another much looked-forward-to feature of the area was that of carol singers travelling across Camps neighbourhoods. Carl tells us that they would receive 10 to 15 caroller groups, including those from various parishes before. Most of them knew the Christian households in the area, and they walk through the lanes with their accordions and guitars. Youll be surprised to know that just one group came singing in our area last year. The culture of going carol singing might have become difficult to follow because of todays lifestyles, but it is something thats still looked forward to, says Carl. Besides this, Camp still hosts various carol singing concerts. While school carol festivals continue to take place, there is a dearth of adult choir performances, says Trevor, who is gearing up for his 19th concert with his choir, The Silver Bells, this Sunday.Back in the day, our society was the most happening place during Christmas. The elders and children would chalk out activities for the entire week, which included decorating the place and organising fancy dress and singing competitions. Though we celebrate today, the scale of it isn't the same. It's probably because many people have moved out and work has taken priority.- Priyanka Ganraj, a resident of Nirmala Nivas, Dastur Meher RoadThough times have changed, theres much that Camp has to offer to those who come looking for some Christmas cheer. I dont think Christmas in Camp has changed, especially for those who truly come looking for it. Even today, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day (December 24-26) witness the same liveliness, joy and peace of the festival.Though a non-Christian, 27-year-old Ria Nadkarni has always felt at home with the celebrations. She opines, Growing up in Camp, I always felt welcome to celebrate Christmas with my friends and family. It was never about religion. Now that I am working with different people, I realise how inclusive Camp has always been. When I hear about the reservations people often have when it comes to celebrating different festivals, I say to myself, No, this is not how it is in Camp. Irrespective of the festival, people forget their differences and get together here.Carls daughters, Pearl and Cheryl, are examples of how the youth are looking for new ways to keep the spirit of Christmas alive. Theyll be visiting those who are ailing in the neighbourhood, to sing carols for them and lift their spirits. Perhaps, you could join them too!Pictures by Santosh Mishra"

One of the private mill owners is Punjab power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh The decision was conveyed by the private mill owners during their meeting on Tuesday afternoon with a committee of senior state functionaries headed by chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh. Rana also attended the meeting.Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association president and Akali leader Jarnail Singh Wahid told TOI, Every sugar mill had been facing around Rs 40-50 crore loss every year since 2013-14. We have clarified; we are not in a situation to return Rs 115 crore.He said since the government had deposited Rs 50 per quintal subsidy in the farmers account as per the cabinet decision taken in November 2015, the authorities could recover the amount from them. When the cabinet decision was taken, we had already clarified that we can give Rs 245 per quintal cane price on the Uttar Pradesh pattern, said Wahid, who is the former chairman of Markfedapex cooperative body of the state.Wahid said the mill owners have conveyed to the committee that they were ready to shut down their factories because of losses and the government should ask farmers to adopt some other crop as a diversification measure. Recently, the state government increased the state assured price (SAP) of sugarcane by Rs 10 without consulting us, he said.For the 2015-16 crushing season, the SAD-BJP government had fixed crushing rate at Rs 295 per quintal to be paid to the farmers. The sugar mills were to pay Rs 245 per quintal and Rs 50 per quintal was to be paid as subsidy by the government. But the authorities say the decision to pay subsidy was taken only if the market sugar price remained Rs 2,600 per quintal or less. In case sugar prices reached Rs 3,000 per quintal or more, the mill owners were to pay the total Rs 295 per quintal to the farmers.A senior officer of the committee said, After the cabinet decision, sugar prices crossed Rs 3,000 per quintal and mill owners should pay Rs 115 crore back to the state. But when the mill owners put their foot down on their decision on the pretext of losses incurred over the years, the committee directed them to submit their contentions in writing.These seven private sugar mills crush around 70% of sugarcane produced in the state. Rana Sugar Mills, owned by power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh, is located in Amritsar district, Wahid Sandhar Sugars Limited in Phagwara owned by SAD leader and former Markfed chairman Jarnail Singh Wahid, Nahar Industrial Enterprises Limited in Amloh owned by former industrial adviser to SAD-BJP government Kamal Oswal, Chadha Sugars and Industries Limited in Gurdaspur owned by late liquor baron Ponty Chadhas family members, AB Sugars Limited in Dasuya is also owned by Chadhas family members, Bhagwanpura Sugar Mills in Dhuri and Indian Sucrose Limited in Hoshiarpur are owned by jailed Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav."

5b509cd99855b708a7cccd85,Gujarat Election Insights: BJP’s Social Engineering 2.0 in north and central Gujarat,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-election-insights-bjps-social-engineering-2-0-in-north-and-central-gujarat/articleshow/62034094.cms,2017-12-12,"north Gujarat (53 seats) followed by central Gujarat +On December 14, 2017, a total of 93 seats (40 seats) go to the polls in Phase 2 of the assembly elections. Lets take a look back at how the BJP has fared in these areas in the past to understand what to expect this time.Two historic milestones characterize this region. Mehsana, in north Gujarat , was the only Lok Sabha seat that the BJP won on its own in the 1984 Lok Sabha polls. Central Gujarat, had delivered one of the most stunning verdicts, post polarization in 2002, 37 on 41 for the BJP. The Gujarat riots actually had their hinterland spreading far and wide deep into pockets of north and central Gujarat  pre delimitation these regions had 95 seats put together. Of these 95, the BJP won 73 in 2002, a strike rate of 75%, where barring a few tribal pockets in North Gujarat, the entire populace voted BJP with their feet.In 2007, the BJP continued its sweep of north Gujarat with almost a similar vote share as in 2002 (52.4%), however its sway over central Gujarat reduced substantially with the tempers cooling down. The fact, that the son of the north Gujarat Modi was seeking re-election after a complete five year term, led to the non-tribal and rural areas of north Gujarat giving a thumbs up to Modi  26 seats then. The BJP won 24 out of 26 such seats. North and central Gujarat put together gave the BJP 56 seats that time, almost explaining most of the loss that the BJP suffered in terms of seats between 2002 and 2007.A heightened GPP campaign in 2012, along with the consolidation of Bharat Sinh Solanki and Shankarsinh Vaghela, led to the BJP plateauing in 2012, winning 52 seats here out of the 93 at stake post delimitation. However the devil lay in the details. If you bar the urban seats of Phase 2, there were 54 rural seats (including tribal) at stake In 2012, the BJP won less than half, only 23, while the Congress with its then ally the NCP, won 31. That explains why a little anti-incumbency could spell doom for the BJP in this election. In terms of vote share in rural areas of Phase 2, the BJP was just 0.2 % ahead of the Congress party, polling 43.1% of votes vs 42.9% of the Congress.Of the 17 assembly segments that the Congress led in Gujarat in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, 12 were in the phase two districts. Many of these districts are home territory to Hardik Patel (Mhesana being the epicentre) , besides Alpesh and Jignesh contesting from their respective seats in north Gujarat.Clearly the turn of events challenges the BJP to come up with that many more innovative strategies to halt the Congress in its tracks. It must be remembered that the cradle districts of brand Amul  Kheda and Anand have always been Congress strongholds. Much like the Sugar barons of Maharashtra the BJP has come up with Milk barons to contest seats. There are a total of 21 assembly seats here that can be influenced by presidents of milk cooperatives. Of the 21 such key contests, only three of them are contesting on Congress tickets, most others on BJP tickets. Since 2012, no less than 15 non BJP leaders have moved over to the BJP and obtained BJP tickets to contest elections, of these 9 are in Phase 2 seats. In the remote north eastern tribal swaths of the state, the BJP is experimenting with say an IPS officer PC Baranda to contest in his native assembly seat to wrest a long held Congress stronghold. In many ways, this is a new socio-economic segment that the BJP is trying to appropriate--old entrenched Kshatriya Congressmen, Dairy Barons, and new tribal leaders.Key contests in this phase will determine whether the BJP retains its tally of 115 or threatens to slip into the grey zone around 100. If it does it will be one more milestone in the BJPs journey of social engineering, albeit of a new kind, and not the one based on religious identity alone.Jai Mrug is director VotersMood Research (VMR)."

We now need to have more MLAs in the assembly and need your support for that to happen.

Pauskar pointed out that while 430 jeeps owned by locals were registered with the tourism and forest department for ferrying tourists to the Dudhsagar waterfalls, the restriction of only 225 vehicles per day has been causing losses to owners, many of who have been unable to repay loans. He said the restrictions must be relaxed. Dhavalikar said that he will try to resolve the matter.Dhavalikar also pointed out to the sorry state of affairs at the Sanjivani sugar factory owing to which, he said, sugarcane cultivators in the constituency have been facing losses."

Undoubtedly one of the most handsome men around in the industry, actor Ayaz Khan of Dill Mill Gayye fame was in Kolkata on Sunday to shoot for a car campaign and also attend the screening of his short film, Casting Ouch. In a short chat with CT, he spoke about his passion, career, marriage and moreIts been a pleasure coming back to Kolkata. I have been here for a play before. But that was about eight years ago. I can see Kolkata has changed for the better. Yesterday, when we were travelling via the EM Bypass , I was surprised to see many new buildings and flyovers. There are so many food joints that have cropped up. I would definitely like to try some Bengali dishes before I leave and take home some rosogollas for my mom.Oh, it has a funny title  Casting Ouch. The plot revolves around a semi-established actress, who is torn between her ambition and moralities. Its a light take on one particular experience where she meets a filmmaker, after which she is stuck in a situation where she cant choose between the right and the wrong. I play her boyfriend in the film. I hope people like it here in Kolkata.As an actor, I need to work with talented people. Quality is important. That makes the work process more interesting. I dont want to cringe and think twice before going to work every day. I enjoy what I do. By the grace of God, I have other works to take care of my finances. I am technically a farmer. We have mango and sugarcane plantations in Lucknow and I am also into construction business. So fortunately, I can afford to be a bit choosy when it comes to taking up an acting project.Yes, #LoveBytes-Season 2 just got over. We shot 10 episodes from start-to-finish. The best part about a web series is its content, which is fresh and original. I think its more exciting to be part of a web series these days. And its not that actors are paid any less. A few months back when I visited my village in Lucknow, I was pleasantly surprised to see every other person hooked to the internet. I think the web is the order of the day.I have recently launched my YouTube channel, where I will be posting videos. Viewers can find me giving advice on various aspects of life. Once people start liking and subscribing to the videos, I can make it a bit more interactive. People can suggest ideas and I can speak on those topics.( Smiles) Id love to get married  for sure! I am sure youll get to know at the right time."

Each group, consisting of 25 labourers, was paid an advance amount of Rs 5 lakh, totaling Rs 5 crore. An additional Rs 10 lakh was spent on purchasing harvesting equipment. Sanvordem MLA Deepak Pauskar said that the government has also replaced Umeshchandra Joshi , the administrator responsible for the lapse in starting the crushing season at the factory, with Ponda additional collector Damodar Morajkar In a meeting between chief minister Manohar Parrikar , Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar, Morajkar and myself, the chief minister has taken cognizance of the affairs of the factory, Pauskar said.Goas lone cooperative sugar factory, Sanjivani Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana at Dayanandnagar, Dharbandora, was supposed to commence cane crushing from the first week of November. But, crushing did not start till December 2 and was normalized only from December 6 onwards.The contractor supplied only about 18 groups who have been sent to the Karnataka plantations for harvesting. The shortage of groups has, however, led to a decrease in the supply of canes from Karnataka. Instead of the expected 22 truckloads of canes per day, the factory receives only about nine truckloads per day.Morajkar met key factory officials and some farmers on Friday and suggested that they arrange for some more groups for harvesting. He also said that he has asked local sugarcane cultivators to supply canes to the factory. As they are local farmers, we will give them priority. The additional groups hired will be engaged in the harvesting of local canes first and will then be used to harvest the canes procured from Karnataka, Morajkar told TOI."

The leopard till December 6 had killed seven people in the area.Shafath Ali Khan told TOI, Before turning into a man-eater the leopard injured several people in Jalgaon district. It started killing people in the last two months. The chief conservator of forests of Maharashtra invited me and asked for my help in putting an end to the menace. They gave orders for either tranquillising or shooting down the cat. Tranquillising was ruled out as the area is an agricultural area spread with cotton and sugar cane crops and the animal visibility is less. Finally, we opted to gun it down as it became dangerous and started entering human habitations. I reached the area on December 4 along with my son Asghar Ali Khan. We identified the daytime resting area of a leopard while tracking it. On December 9 it entered the village and was circling the houses. We alerted the villagers. We already formed village committee, members of whom were armed with sticks. At 10pm I saw the animal crawling towards a group of men who were on a vigil. Unaware of the lurching danger they were talking to each other. It was almost within 30 metres of its target. Depending on its body language it was confirmed that it was the man-eater and was about to strike. I had to take a quick decision, and fired at it.One shot from my .375 Magnum rifle brought the leopard down. It was a female aged four years, and it fitted the description provided by the forest department. She was the one that killed many people. A 70-year-old woman fell prey to the animal just 100 metres away recently. The leopard separated the head from the body of the victim. Leopards are territorial, so it was the same one. In the past five days, I noticed a female leopard was also moving in the area with the cubs. She also injured people. There may be chances of this leopard turning man-eater too in the area, Shafath Ali Khan added.Explaining why the leopard turned a man-eater, he said, The leopard strayed out of the forest. As it is an agriculture area, it lurked near the villages and preyed on goats and dogs. As it moved close to human habitations, it slowly lost the fear of the humans. Kids and old women became its target. It became bold and started injuring first and then turned into a man-eater.The big cat killed seven persons in the village of Malegaon tehsil of Nashik and Chalisgaon in Jalgaon district. Forest officials formed 10 teams, put up 13 cages and camera traps.Shafath Ali Khan is the secretary of Wildlife Tranquil Force , an NGO. The leopard was on the prowl in the Upkhed beat of Chalisgaon range.The latest victim was seven-year-old Kunal Prakash Ahire of Sakur village in Malegaon. While Kunal was sleeping near his mother the leopard snatched him away and killed him, said Shafath Ali Khan."

Several corporates adopted a wait and watch approach and the negative hiring sentiments lasted until at least September this year.Leading consultancy Manpower Group's India Economic Outlook showed a dip in the employers' hiring intentions in the first three quarters of 2017, before rising again in the October-December period.Its surveys showed the percentage of employers planning to hire dipping to 22 per cent in January-March, further down to 19 per cent in April-June and to 16 per cent in July- September, but rebounded to 24 per cent in October-December.Experts hope that the recruitment landscape recovery will continue and companies in mobile manufacturing, fintech and start-ups, among others, may hire the most in 2018.Even the better good news is expected on pay hikes, which experts are pegging at 10-15 per cent across most sectors -- up from 8-10 per cent mostly in 2017.""2018 is set to swing the pendulum further into the job growth zone. Businesses in almost all sectors -- notably, financial services, retail and e-commerce and media and entertainment -- are looking to hire talent at an even faster pace,"" said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder of employment services provider Teamlease Services.The year 2017 saw growing adoption of new business models and newer technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotic process automation that significantly reduces the manpower requirements especially at the bottom of the pyramid. But this has also created a huge demand for specialists in these emerging technologies.""Change in business environment is leading to obsoleteness of existing skills and have created demands for new skills as must-haves. IT skills are out now, while data science and digital skills are in demand,"" said Zairus Master, CEO of Shine.com a leading online job portal.The labour landscape in India is changing significantly, and some of the emerging trends include rise temp staffing (employee is recruited on a temporary basis) and flexi-workforce and this has led to companies adopting various models in addition to their full-time employees, like freelancers as well as alternate sources of workers like retirees, alumni, and online talent communities.""India's flexi-workforce is currently 13 lakh and is expected to grow to 90 lakh by 2025. Importantly, 82 per cent of total flexi-workforce in India is under the age of 30. Companies will naturally evolve to use contract services for all skill sets that are not needed on a constant basis,"" said Thammaiah BN, Managing Director, Kelly Services India, a human resources and workforce solutions firm.Sector-wise, HR experts believe infrastructure, telecom, manufacturing and IT will be among the industry verticals that will grow substantially in the coming year.""These segments have the focus of government, besides these industries are going to work as a framework for the growth of economy and development which in turn creates job opportunities for everyone,"" said Sunil Goel, MD GlobalHunt an executive search firm.In terms of increments, 2017 saw the median rate of pay hike dip to sub-10 per cent level at around 9.2 per cent. This varied by sector, and most importantly, by job role, while specialised talent and key performers still got well rewarded.In the new year, the median increment is expected to improve to above 12 per cent across sectors and profiles.According to GlobalHunt's Goel, the average hike was 8-10 per cent in 2017 across the sectors, which should grow to 10- 12 per cent in 2018. TeamLease Services' Chakraborty said the figure should breach 11 per cent in the new year.Kelly Services' Thammaiah said employees in IT sector can expect average appraisal of 8 per cent; e-commerce and start- ups of 15 per cent; pharma and life sciences as also FMCG and consumer goods of 8-15 per cent; and ITES at 10-15 per cent.Some of the recruitment trends that corporates are likely to adopt in the coming year include hiring through social media, online assessment, and focus on delivering an unparalleled experience to candidates, experts say.""With 243.2 million internet users and 106 million active social media users among a total population of over 1200 million, the social media wave is yet to get into the heart of India,"" Thammaiah said.Corporates will increasingly adapt innovative tools like video interviewing, asynchronous interviewing and online assessments that not only will increase the efficiency of the hiring process by 50-60 per cent, but at the same time help in increasing the quality of hire, he added.GlobalHunt's Goel observed that overall in 2017 the job market has gone well wherein a lot of global organisations went on expanding their base in India and many new companies also came to set up their base in the country. This led to the creation of a decent number of job opportunities in sectors like BFSI, technology, e-commerce and also in manufacturing.Moreover, skill development initiatives have boosted the capacity of unorganised sector and small industries which used to struggle for trained resources, he added."

In a throwback to those days, people celebrated the birth of the latest royal scion by distributing sugar and sweets and offering puja at temples on Thursday.There was jubilation in the city as they woke up to the news that Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar had fathered a boy. Within 12 hours of maharani Trishikha Kumari delivering the boy, Urs community members began celebrations to the mark the birth. The baby is in line for the title of maharaja.When Krishnaraja Wadiyar was born on June 4 in Old Mysore Palace, apart from distributing sweets, maharaja Chamaraja Wadiyar freed prisoners with good conduct, recalled heritage expert Echanur Kumar. There is documentary evidence tracking the celebration of birth of a baby in the royal family, he told TOI. It was not restricted to the birth of a baby boy either, he added, pointing out that the birth of a baby girl was also celebrated with distribution of sweets.The royal family is witnessing the birth of a successor after six decades. Former MP Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar was born to maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar in 1953.On Thursday, nearly 5 quintals of sugar was distributed by the fan club of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar to people at Krishnaraja Circle. Special pujas were held for the baby at Sringeri Math and Parakala Math. Special pujas were also offered at temples located in the Mysuru Palace premises and to Goddess Chamundeshwari atop Chamundi Hills.The royal family was in shock in the aftermath of the sudden demise of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar on December 10, 2013. The family placed the royal sword on the fabled golden throne during the Khas durbar and continued the tradition. Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar died without issue.It took over a year for Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, senior member of the royal family, to adopt a successor to the Wadiyar dynasty which has a history of more than 400 years. She adopted Yaduveer Gopal Raje Urs, grandnephew of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, in 2015. He was rechristened Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar after his symbolic coronation and became the 27 titular head of the dynasty.

Many organisations shared their happiness by distributing sweets to tourists who had come to the palace.For 65-year-old Subramanya Raje Urs, who is related to Pramoda Devi, the birth of a royal baby is like rebirth of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar.

Except the fact that these two assembly constituencies have never ever electedin a general assembly election since the inception of Gujarat. The BJP is throwing in all its might this time to ensure lotus blooms in Jasdan and Vyara. Prime Ministerand national party president Amit Shah organised public meetings in Jasdan and Vyara respectively.Jasdan is a big bet for BJP. The Muslims are not even 2.5 per cent here compared to the State average of 12 per cent. And the much respected current Darbar of the erstwhile royal family, Satyajit Kumar Khachar, is with the BJP. He was present when PM Modi addressed a public rally in this sleepy town on November 27.Khachar says the reason Jasdan has yet not embraced BJP and continues to blindly support theis because of illiteracy. He says now that literacy is a reality, change is imminent. In 2009, BJP received a small consolation when its Patidar candidate Bharat Boghra won the by-polls in Jasdan. The by-elections were necessitated after incumbent Congress MLA Kunvarji Bavalia was elected the MP from Rajkot.After he vacated the seat, Congress fielded his daughter Bhavna, much to the chagrin of its cadres who opposed the dynasty politics of the party. They felt she was a novice and would not be able to solve the problems of the constituency. As a result, campaigning at grassroots level remained lackluster, giving advantage to Boghra who eventually won by a margin of over 14,000 votes. However, in the 2012 general assembly polls, BJP tasted defeat by Congress Bholabhai Gohel, who continued the partys winning streak. This year, Boghra, an ayurveda practitioner, is pitted against Congresss Kunvarji Bavalia.Bavaliya has done nothing for the past 30 years. The development work you see is done out of the Rs 700 crore MLA grant. Earlier, BJP lost because it kept changing its candidates. But now the people here love me because despite losing 2012 polls I continued to work for them. I am sure I will win. At present, Patidars and Kolis here are in equal numbers  80,000 each. The rest of the 60,000 voters are from other communities including 4,000 Muslims. Explaining why Jasdan favours the Congress, Dr Sanjay Sakhiya, a high school teacher, said, Illiteracy, superstitions and caste factors kept Congress in power here. Also, Koli votes hold a major sway and the community always follows what its leaders say.The Congress has won here eight times in the general assembly elections while the independents have won four times. Bhikhalal, the father of Dinesh Bambhaniya, a close aide of PAAS Hardik Patel, had contested as an independent and won against Congs Kunvarji Bavalia in 1990. Vyara has an interesting history. When Narendra Modi was the CM, he accepted the demand of the region and a special district was carved out. Vyara became the district headquarters of Tapi instead of being a sleepy town of Surat district.However, since the inception of Gujarat as a state in 1960, Vyara has never elected a right-leaning political party. It has been a Congress bastion for 50 years  Amarsinh Chaudhri, the states first tribal CM, won from Vyara four times. Cong won Vyara 10 times out of the 12 general assembly elections held in Gujarat so far, Vyara has electedThe other two times they elected an independent on this seat, reserved for scheduled tribes. Besides tribals, the seat has also elected Christians. Christians constitute 0.62 per cent of the states population as per 2011 Census. Tapi district, under Vyara assembly seat falls, accounts for 6.56 per cent Christian population. So, why has Vyara not been in the favour of saffron party? Prof Vasant Gamit of Arts andin Vyara reasons: Vyara has been a Congress bastion due to the legacy of Amarsinh Chaudhari and Congress leader Jhinabhai Darji.But it is not that Congress cannot be defeated. In the past, independents have twice defeated Congress candidates including Chaudari who was then the sitting CM. He added, To defeat Congress, the BJP needs to focus on the right candidate. The party is giving Congress a tough fight as they are banking on construction of new canal, land rights for tribals and depositing the instalments for sugarcane farmers in their accounts.This time, the BJP has fielded a fresh face from Vyara  Arvind Chaudhari, who is campaigning hard to break the partys jinx. Vyara wants change now and we are getting a great response. Irrigation and unemployment are issues unsolved by local MLAs. BJP wants to restart the Vyara Sugar factory and also establish a GIDC here for unemployment. I want to gift BJP a win this time. He is pitted against three-time Congress MLA Punabhai Gamit, a Christian. The seat has traditionally seen a political battle between the Chaudharis and the Gamits.Also, there are 81,000 Gamit voters and 75,000 Chaudhari voters here. Former CM Amarsinh Chaudharis son Dr Tushar Chaudhari said: Vyaras people do not backstab a party that has given them so much. Congress has given them Ukai and Kakrapar dams, irrigation facility, ashrams and shalas. He said despite BJP boasting about the partys organisation skills it has little presence in Tapi. It usually lures a Congressman to win the seat and the BJP workers get demoralized. This time too, Arvind Chaudhari is a Congress turncoat. In the last taluka panchayat election, he lost his deposit as BJP candidate. This year national BJP chief Amit Shah held a rally in Vyara and asked the people to uproot kukda-bakra wali Congress and bring in BJP. We will give you cows and buffaloes and 24-hour power supply."
