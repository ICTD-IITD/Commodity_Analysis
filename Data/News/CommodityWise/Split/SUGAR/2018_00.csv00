Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint$500 millionWhat is it? The size of the deal that India had placed with Israels state-owned defence contractor Rafael to buy Spike anti-tank guided missiles. It has now cancelled the order.Why is it important? This is reportedly due to reservations on the part of the Israeli firm to fully transfer the technology as per the Make in India provisions and the Indian defence ministry reportedly deciding to back state-owned Defence Research and Development Organisation, which has said it will develop a world-class missile within four years. Till then, Pakistani foot soldiers are likely to have an advantage over Indias as they possess portable anti-tank missiles that can strike Indian bunkers and tanks at a distance of 3-4 km, while Indias equivalent missile tanks have a range of 2 km.Tell me more: The order cancellation could be taken up for discussion during Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahus visit to India in a couple of weeks.100What is it? The number of people who were detained across Mumbai on Wednesday due to a bandh called by Dalit groups in Maharashtra.Why is it important? Normal life was disrupted in Indias financial capital: schools and colleges remained shut, Internet services were down, and attendance was poor in offices. With protestors squatting on railway tracks, rail services were stalled, roads were blocked and shops shut. Although Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar called off the bandh on Wednesday evening, tension simmered in the state. A 16-year-old student was killed in a road-block agitation in Nanded.Tell me more: The protests began on Monday after a 28-year-old man was killed when the Dalit community was celebrating the 200th anniversary of a battle won by a backward community called Mahars (who fought alongside the Britishers) to overthrow upper caste Peshwas.$0.9 billionWhat is it? The expected consolidated free cash flow of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 2017-18, according to international brokerage firm CLSA.Why is it important? If RIL meets the forecast, it would mean the end of a four-year run of negative cash flows, which is a measure of a companys overall financial health and performance. This is likely to put Indias biggest firm by market capitalisation on a strong footing as projects worth $40 billion would begin to deliver as capital expenditure declines. Recently, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said the firm aims to be among the top 20 companies in the world.Tell me more: The brokerage said the monetisation of refinery off-gas cracker and petcoke gasification plant would boost the operating income of RIL. In telecom, it expects the firm to monetise Reliance Jio Infocomms customers in addition to its industry-leading capacities.2,700What is it? The number of locomotives in India that will be installed with a GPS tracking device under the first phase of the Real-Time Train Information System (RTIS), a move that will enable passengers to track trains on a real-time basis.Why is it important? This Indian Railways initiative, in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), comes in the backdrop of piling complaints of train delays and accidents. The new GPS-enabled trains would replace the existing national train enquiry system (NTES), which has a train controller who updates the train status manually.Tell me more: So far, trials on GPS-enabled locomotives have been done on six electric locomotives on the New Delhi-Guwahati and New Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani routes. The first phase is scheduled to be completed by December 2018.26%What is it? The year-on-year growth in Indias sugar production during the three-month period from October to December, according to industry association Indian Sugar Manufacturers Association (ISMA).Why is it important? In these three months of 2017, production stood at 103.3 lakh tonnes, against 81.9 lakh tonnes in the corresponding period of 2016, mainly due to improved outputs from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. This augurs well for the 2017-18 sugar year (October to September), which could register its highest production since 2014-15, when India produced 283 lakh tonnes. ISMA has estimated 2017-18 production at 251 lakh tonnes.Tell me more: Earlier, the government had been considering removing stock limits on sugar to curb the fall in prices resulting from a bumper harvest.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data"
5a53b5039855b770e0382890,We customize every cup of tea as per our customer’s liking: Raghav Verma,http://www.livemint.com/Companies/ruAk0YuVAdtzrI8CwfiBoK/We-customize-every-cup-of-tea-as-per-out-customers-liking.html,2018-01-03,"Raghav Verma, co-founder of Chaayos, talks about what goes behind creating a perfect cup of tea, the innovations to reach the customer, the challenges facing the company and future plans.What have been some of the biggest challenges in scaling up operations?At Chaayos, our USP (unique selling proposition) has always been serving our customers their meri wali chai (my own tea)we customize every cup as per our customers likingbe it the kadak patti, no sugar or less sugar, or the flavours that go in the chai like adrak, tulsi, cinnamon, mint, ajwain, kali mirch, etc.This customization ends up creating 12,000 possible permutations of chaiwhich becomes an operational nightmare when scaling up.With so many add-ons and customization option of every consumer, maintaining consistency was one of our biggest challenges as we scaled up. We have been able to successfully tackle this through very strong training and certification programmes, and maintaining centralized quality through sourcing the best ingredients from all over India (for example, we source our cinnamon from Kerala and our tulsi from Uttarakhand, the two best sources for these ingredients). So the chai you get at Noida DLF Mall of India Chaayos is the same as what you would get in Bandra Chapel Road Chaayos, Mumbai. In spite of being an offline retail cafe chain, we always believed in solution technology. We have developed in-house technology for all the processes at Chaayos. We invest a lot into training our teams who go through a three-month certification programme, which is also powered by our technology solutions and it tracks the effectiveness of what has been taught. The next level of consistence and standardization will come through our chai machine, Chai Monk, which is already being deployed across all our cafes.Today, Chaayos is not only about drinking tea. What are the product innovations that you have done over the years and why?At Chaayos, our vision is to cater to each and every chai drinking occasion of our customers. To achieve this, we have worked extensively on product development and come up with many innovations, many of which have been suggestions given by our customers.Having the right chai for summer months was an important objectivethis helped us develop aam panna iced tea and kalakhatta iced tea as unique flavours in our summer menu. These are very Indian flavours but given a fusion twist when blended with iced tea, were blockbuster products during our summer months in 2016.Our customers requested more food options that go well with chai, especially on the slightly more filling meals side we came up with thepla tacos, a Mexican-Gujarati fusion dish, a loaded open paratha (a paratha loaded with filling and topped with cheese) and palak pasta crisps (palak pasta chaat with jalapeos and a tamarind mayo). These innovations have given us a distinct differentiated edge, and helped us maintain high repeat, as our customers always have something new to look forward to.We serve 25 varieties of hot chai that can be customized in 12,000 ways, says Verma.Our customers in business parks would often ask us for delivery to offices. So, we developed a disposable kettle packaging that keeps chai hot for an hour, which helped us deliver to offices and residential areas.We wanted to offer our customers a portable way to have their chai when they travelso we developed our RTM (ready to mix) chai, which just needs to be mixed with hot water to create your perfect masala chai. We have since partnered with SpiceJet and IRCTC to serve on board flights and trains.What goes into making that perfect cuppa?...we make sure to offer the exact tea, just the way you like it. We have multiple add-ons and flavours from across the country to ensure a great chai experience. So basically, a perfect cup of tea is all about using the best quality ingredients, a chai blend that is concocted at our base kitchen and served with lots of love.How many varieties of tea do you serve? Which ones are favourites with customers?We serve 25 varieties of hot chai that can be customized in 12,000 ways. Our most popular hot chais are kulhad chai, honey ginger lemon tea and gur wali chai. We also have a shahi chai which is like Indias answer to the hot chocolate.In cold, we have over 15 varieties that include iced teas, thandi chais (our masala chai frappe), fruit shakes and lemonades (Modinagar shikanji being a favourite). Our most popular cold beverages are aam panna iced tea, kalakhatta iced tea, Modinagar shikanji and thandi chai in saunf flavour.What are your future plans?Currently, Chaayos operates 53 cafes across Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Chandigarh, and we plan to be 70 cafe-strong by the end of this financial year. We are planning to expand to other metros and important tier-II cities in the coming year. We will continue to innovate in many other ways to reach our customers and create lots of memorable chai moments for everyone."

Chidambaram says fears of imminent economic slowdown have come true,http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fEO2JEX2FTNE7EDoMUKqlN/P-Chidambaram-says-fears-of-imminent-economic-slowdown-have.html,2018-01-06,"There is a decline in new projects and fresh investment, Congress leader P. Chidambaram claimed in a statement. Photo: Raj K. Raj/HTNew Delhi: Senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram on Saturday hit out at the government over lower growth estimates for the current fiscal, saying the worst fears of an imminent economic slowdown have come true.There is a decline in new projects and fresh investment, Chidambaram claimed in a statement. The informal sector is reeling under the ill effects of demonetisation. Job creation is abysmal, exports are plunging, and manufacturing sector growth has slowed down. The agriculture sector has been hit hard and rural despair is abundant, he claimed.Job creation remained the single biggest failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. The bank credit growth was extremely sluggish and it did not bode well for the economy, he said. The worst fears of an imminent economic slowdown have come true. The Modi governments tall claims of India growing at a robust growth rate have evaporated in thin air.No amount of sugar coating, false bravado and rhetoric along with headlines management can conceal the stark reality. Our fears and warnings have proved true, the Congress leader said. He said the recent social discontent could be a direct manifestation of this economic slowdown, which the government was conveniently hiding. It was time the government stopped making tall claims and did some solid work, he said.Citing government data, the former finance minister said the GDP growth rate was 8% in 2015-16, 7.1% in 2016-17. It is estimated at 6.5% in 2017-18, which proves there is a slowdown. A decline in economic activity and growth meant loss of millions of jobs, he said. While the GDP growth is estimated at 6.5% during 2017-18 as compared to 7.1% in 2016-17, the anticipated growth of real GVA at basic prices in 2017-18 is 6.1% as against 6.6% in 2016-17, he said.Retail inflation soared to a 15-month high of 4.88% in November and industrial output hit a three-month low of 2.2% in October, he pointed out. The investment picture remains bleak... The manufacturing sector has seen the sharpest fall and fiscal deficit is likely to overshoot the budget estimates of 3.2 per cent of GDP, the Congress leader said."
5a58206c9855b770e03833d3,Coming soon: Tamil Nadu’s own health drink,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2018/jan/07/coming-soon-tamil-nadus-own-health-drink-1746706.html,2018-01-07,"CHENNAI: The fortunes of coconut farmers in the State is likely to change as Neera, a delicious, nutritious, non-alcoholic health drink extracted from the the sap of coconut palm, is likely to hit the market in the middle of next month from Coimbatore and surrounding districts.Coconut growers in the State, who were earning a measly `1,000 per coconut tree, are likely see a sudden reversal in their fortunes. Their earnings are expected to rise 15 times, up to `15,000 per tree, by extracting Neera.At present, in Tamil Nadu, there are eight crore coconut trees across 10.74 lakh acres. Around 1.5 lakh growers are spread over 13 major coconut growing districts in Tamil Nadu- Coimbatore, Thanjavur, Tirupur, Kanniyakumari, Krishnagiri, Theni, Vellore, Dindigul, Tirunelveli, Erode, Salem, Pudukottai and Virudhunagar.Interestingly, the State is trying to promote the brand by introducing value-added products like coconut sugar made from Neera and market it in stalls at bus stands, railway stations, airports and collectorate complexes. While Neera-based products are expected to hit the market this month itself, Neera drink is likely to be available for consumption in the middle of February, an official said. In due course, other Neera-based products like honey, cookies, etc., would be produced.Change in legislationNeera extraction became a reality after Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami made an announcement on April 19 last year that he would remove legal hurdles for this project to take off. The State government amended the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act in July and later, on December 21, framed the rules for extraction of Neera. Many restrictions have been placed to avoid illegal activities like extraction of toddy.During the last one month, we have held many training sessions for Neera producers in Coimbatore district. Now, we have directed deputy directors of agribusiness to ask the coconut growers to apply for Neera extraction licence. The government will be very selective and only those part of the cooperative producer societies will be asked to go ahead with Neera extraction, a senior official told Express. By the end of January, we are expecting a good number of people getting licences for processing Neera, the official added. Some of them, on an experimental basis, have been producing Neera sugar in Anaimalai in Coimbatore district.A senior official in the Coconut Development Board told Express, Around 2.40 lakh Neera technicians would be required for extraction of this health drink and this would ensure green collar jobs for them 365 days a year. Besides, it is an eco-friendly initiative which does not pollute the environment in any way.Dos and dontsDhanapal Muthusamy, a coconut grower from Kaliyapuram village near Pollachi, who had done research and development work on Neera, is almost ready to supply the health drink as well as coconut sugar.Explaining that only five per cent of available coconut trees in each garden is allowed for Neera extraction, he said, First of all, not all coconut trees are suitable for Neera extraction. Trees of normal height alone are chosen for this due to practical purposes  the extract collected in chiller boxes kept atop the trees have to be brought down for transportation to the Neera processing unit. The Neera extract is collected twice a day  6 am and 6 pm, and tall trees will be difficult for extraction. Further, extraction of Neera should not affect the overall production of coconut for public consumption and hence these restriction.Since a Neera processing unit needs sizeable investment, individual farmers cannot afford to spend that much. But when we approach as a society, getting funds will be easier. Farm producers or companies cant stop at tapping Neera. They also have to package and bottle it and a lot of investment is needed. Besides, marketing Neera will be a bigger task. Equipment and advanced machinery is required. Since this cannot be done by individual coconut growers, the government is setting up a common facility centre at Thippampatti near Pollachi, Dhanapal said.He also said the government has promised coconut growers that separate spaces would be made available to them in venues where people gather in large numbers. The government is also plannning to encourage sale of the drink through coconut producers federations to avoid middlemen. If middlemen are allowed to purchase and sell the products, in due course, it will end up in hands of a corporate entity, Dhanapal pointed out."

Bhatt (Ahmedabad Joint Commissioner, Crime Branch) has begun hatching a conspiracy against me and harassing our nationalist workers at the behest of political bosses in Delhi. In the last 15 days, how many times has Bhatt spoken with the PM? Their call details must be made public,"" Togadia, Acting President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, told reporters after his discharge from a private hospital in the evening.Togadia, who was once known to be close to Modi, was referring to Bhatt's press conference on Tuesday where he presented police investigation details to show that the VHP leader's story - that he had fallen unconscious and was admitted to a private hospital -- was all made-up.The firebrand Hindu leader had gone ""missing"" on Monday and emerged from a private hospital some 10 hours later in a reportedly unconscious state as his sugar levels fell drastically.Togadia had claimed that a team of the Rajasthan Police had come for him in a shut 10-year-old case, though there was no instruction from Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje or state Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria for this.He had claimed there was a conspiracy to kill him and this was hatched jointly by the Crime Branch and the Rajasthan Police. ""I have received communication from Rajasthan that the case in which I was supposed to be arrested was withdrawn in 2015. Then under whose instructions and who had come to arrest me? It appears Bhatt is acting under influence of political bosses in Delhi,"" he said.Togadia, who went on to call Modi his ""old friend"", urged him not to take steps that would lead to killing of democracy. ""Is this a crime branch or conspiracy branch? I have called my lawyer and shall initiate legal action against Crime Branch,"" he said.""This Crime Branch is also releasing selective videos to television channels to sully my image. I want to tell the country that similar video of Sanjay Joshi in 2005 was made here. I shall reveal the names at an appropriate time."" He was referring to the leak of a video of his whereabouts on Monday showing him in fine fettle.Bhatt of the Crime Branch has stated that Togadia was hale and hearty when he called in an ambulance van to admit him in the private hospital and was not missing at all. Bhatt on Tuesday presented to the media a blow-by-blow account of where the VHP leader went during the day and how he managed to get himself admitted in a private hospital though nothing had happened to him."

While the previous two editions of the series focused on entrepreneurship, social responsibility, creativity, and unconventional successes, the third edition brings together path-breaking women in business. We wanted to bring together women who have beaten the norm and succeeded in their business to share their stories. The conversation might inspire audience and encourage not just women looking to start or run businesses, but anybody who wishes to learn about thriving in the Indian business environment, shared the co-organiser of the event.The speakers included Archana Kalpathi, director and CEO, AGS Cinemas; Sangeetha Sumesh, executive director and CFO, Dun and Bradstreet Technologies; Raji Raju, director, Medall Healthcare; Anupama Shivaraman, director, Shriram Leadership Academy and Chairperson FICCI FlO, and Kiran Rao founder Amethyst, and executive director, KCP Sugar and Industries Corporation. The whole discussion was moderated by Sujith Kumar, founder and managing trustee, Maatram Foundation.Archana said, In any workforce, women have to put in double the effort to be recognised. People have a lot of preconceived notions on what to expect especially when a girl achieves. Next is work life balance. You need to make time for your family, and for a girl it is all the more important. She started her journey in business 10 years back after finishing her post graduation.Motivated and inspired by her first generation father and uncle in business, she decided to take up the business and the first multiplex was opened in 2008. I am the eldest child in my family. They never discriminated me based on my gender and that helped me look at things differently. Work really hard and dont expect immediate results. Anything with consequence takes time to build and not give up during the process, she said while stressing that every industry has its own challenges, she shared.Anupama was also optimistic about the future of women in any workforce. I am happy that there is a programme that focuses on women in business when there are very few in the industry. But the positives in business should include flexibility for a woman to design her own working hours. I am a charted accountant but I have been in the business for 20 years. And when I first started, they said Its the mans world! But now things are slowly changing, she said."

One of the demands was that the State government should pay compensation to farmers for loss of crops and disburse the compensation due to coconut growers who had lost their trees to drought. Absence of water in the Cauvery had affected the yield considerably. Besides, the State government should continue to put pressure on the Centre to form the Cauvery Management Board.The office-bearers also urged the Chief Minister to do the needful for disbursing the dues for sugarcane growers from sugar mills. The dues had not been paid for many years, they said.The council thanked the government for waiving the loans availed of by small and marginal farmers. The State government should not allow projects to extract hydrocarbon and methane as these would affect the fertile lands of farmers.Similarly, the project to lay pipeline for the GAIL project too should not be allowed, the memorandum said and added that the State government should declare that it would not allow genetically-modified crops."

He was accompanied by district BJP president Nauri Naik and former chairman of Burla NAC, Bishnu Prasad Rakhit.After contemplating over his case, doctors decided to shift him to SCB instead of AIIMS in Bhubaneswar. Mishra's blood pressure, sugar and creatinine levels remained on the higher side at VIMSAR. He was shifted to SCB as VIMSAR lacked a Nephrologist. A team of doctors comprising cardiologist Suresh Sahu, surgeon Debananda Tudu and medicine specialists Laxmikanta Dash and Malati Murmu are keeping a close watch on his health.Mishra was sent to Sohela Sub Jail on March 15 after being arrested on charges of murder durung Bijepur bypollviolence on February 22. He was hospitalised last Saturday after he complained of uneasiness. Earlier, a clash broke out near Banabira Ashram between BJD and BJP workers on February 22. While BJP alleged that Mishra and his cohorts who had taken shelter at the Ashram attacked them, the BJD, led by Subrat Singh, younger brother of Minister Sushant Singh, put the blame on BJP workers. In the attack, both Subrat Singh and a BJD worker Dileswar Sahu, who was driving the vehicle, sustained injures. However, Dileswar succumbed to his injuries after being shifted to SCB Medical at Cuttack."

People in this region express their utter disappointment on the lack of industrial development in the last five years and say with the same leaders being elected every term, nothing much can be expected.Ex-union leader Satish asserts that not even 10 per cent of industrial potential has been realised in the last few decades. To further decimate the industry, cotton mills are being converted into residential complexes.With the Centre selecting Davangere for the Smart City project, people expected a lot in terms of sanitation, waste management, SME hubs and so on. But the district authorities have not even spent 10 per cent of the Smart allocation to make this city livable, economically vibrant and environmentally sustainable.Once a famous trading and manufacturing centre for cotton textiles, today it is a ghost city, as one can only see remnants of the past glory, be it in KT Jambanna Colony or the shut doors of the innumerable cotton mills. Once this colony housed hundreds of mill workers and their families but today, most of them are either dead or have left for greener pastures.Only a few remain to tell the story of the citys rich past. Like 77-year-old Haleshappa, who worked in Davangere Cotton Mills Ltd, and fondly recalls those good old days to say, For 25 years, I worked tirelessly but they shut shop without a second thought. I was on a salary of Rs 3,500 per month during those days.Difficult times fell upon the family after the closure of the mill, and to fend for his loved ones, Haleshappa took to being a coolie. The industrial heritage is lost forever as nobody is interested in reviving it, he says.Education hubToday, the city is known more as a hub of higher education. It is estimated that there are more than 36 institutions of learning at the graduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels. So one can see how the cotton mills of yesterday have been replaced by engineering and medical colleges, and again, most of them are run by the Shamanur family. Here the writ of father and sons is all-pervasive, leaving the electorate hesitant to even talk about them.Children playing at Jambanna Nagar; (above) Ganesh Textiles, one of the closed mills | Shimoga nandanFurther, there is a seething resentment against the prevailing scenario where industries have not come up after the 1990 industrial shutdown. So no jobs or employment opportunities have been created in the last decade, according to Kumar, a former Chandroday Mills employee. He adds, The present political system in Davangere has not allowed any development in the industrial sector  textiles, garments or engineering products.Lack of quality educationIn this educational, and health hub, in fact, nearly 10% of the population is dependent on the Shamanur family for livelihood as 10,000 people are employed in various colleges  medical, engineering, dental, hospital, sugar and liquor industries owned by the family. So if some are grateful, others, though full of resentment, say, Its a foregone conclusion that the two contestants will win this time too.An academician from the city concludes that despite having so many educational institutions, none of them are providing quality education. Numbers cannot give quality education or skilled workers or for that matter, quality healthcare. Davangere has added so many hospitals but what is the use? Patients from the district still flock to Manipal or Mangaluru; it is only poor people who avail the dismal healthcare here. The family has neither allowed any industry to come up nor encouraged young political blood to contest or compete. The district and the city suffers, and its people bemoan their fate, he adds."

Activists are concerned that even as the trees are being felled across the State for many reasons, many of the existing ones are not in good health. They have called for urgent measures to save the tree for future generations.Tamil Nadu has the highest number of palmyra trees  out of the estimated 8.59 crore of Palmyra in India, about 5.10 crore are in Tamil Nadu, according to the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. However, activists say that the number has dropped, drastically, to three crore.The palmyra tree has been hailed as karpaga vruksham (divine trees which offers everything one asks for) in Tamil literature as no part of it goes waste. There is even a Tamil classical poem (Tala Vilasam) entirely dedicated to the glory of this tree, enumerating 801 ways in which the tree and its parts can be used. In fact, the Tamil language and literature has been transmitted over generations for thousands of years only through palm leaf manuscripts.However, the number of palmyra trees has fallen, over the years due to a variety of socio-economic changes in the state. In fact, over the past decade, environmentalists have sounded the alarm to preserve the ancient tree several times. Though the state government has taken some efforts to protect the tree, activists say more needs to be done.Nungu, the kernel of the palmyra tree, is a tasty summertreat | V KARTHIK ALAGUS Nallusamy, coordinator of Toddy movement, a crusader for protecting palmyra trees, gets to the heart of the problem  changes that have reduced Tamil societys dependence on the tree and its products. Modern scientific advances came as a curse to palm products. Firstly, use of palm leaves for roofing of houses stopped. People of Tamil Nadu used to drink padhaneer and toddy as these are known as the soft drinks of the State. But after the advent of foreign liquor, which is harmful to health, demand for padhaneer and toddy took a beating,  Nallusamy said.Pointing out that palm trees were the main source for sugar and jaggery till just seven or eight decades ago, Nallusamy said, After the introduction of white sugar which used to be called aska sarkarai, the deterioration started. Now, modern science has found that white sugar is harmful to the health.In the 1950s, white sugar was seen as a status symbol. During feasts hosted by rich people, aska sarkarai would be served on the plate or on banana leaves in a very small quantity and country sugar would be served in large quantities. In 1962, a tea shop was started in our village wherein ordinary tea using country sugar was priced at three paise per cup while aska tea was priced at five paise.So, slowly, the image of white sugar went up while country sugar lost its sheen, Nallusamy said, recalling how white sugar made inroads into the lives of Tamils who were using panankaruppati (palm sugar candy).Now, the trend has come a full circle. At present, white sugar is available at Rs 40 per kg while karuppatti is priced at Rs 200 per kg, he said.Depleting groundwaterAccording to Nallusamy, Tamil Nadu alone had around 50 crore palmyra trees before Independence. While every day, palmyra trees are cut  mostly for firewood  neighbouring Sri Lanka has made the cutting a palmyra tree a non-bailable offence. A sizeable number of existing palmyra trees are fighting for survival. The main reason for this is depleting groundwater level. Palm trees survived because of rainwater and groundwater. By Natures law of water sharing, groundwater is there for vegetation like trees, while water in rivers, ponds, and other sources are for human beings and animals. But we have exploited groundwater to the maximum extent and this has led to the withering of palmyra trees,  Nallusamy said.S Ilavenil, founder Panaiyerigal (palm climbers) movement in Ramanathapuram district, offers a different dimension. He is of the view that the number of palmyra trees will be proportionate to the number of climbers. Now, the general notion is that palm climbing is a lowly profession. There is a general view that palm climbers hail only from Nadar community. It is not so. In Ramanathapuram district alone, there are 12 communities engaged in that work, he said, adding that he is training interested persons as palm climbers.Even now, palm trees are being felled every day. There is no manpower to climb palm trees to manage operations regarding extraction of palm juice to make padhaneer. There is no special effort needed for growing palm trees. For example, a few decades ago, palm trees were in abundance in Tamil Nadu and no one took any extra effort to grow those palm trees. This was because there were sufficient people to climb the trees and the palm products had a value, he said.The road aheadThe way forward, according to activists, is to promote palm products and create awareneness about the benefits of using such products. In Andhra Pradesh, even now in many villages, toddy is given to babies as well as pregnant and new mothers. There are liquor varieties for every country. Like vodka for Russia and wine for France, toddy is our indigenous liquor. If prepared properly, toddy will not affect the health of individuals, Ilavenil said, arguing for the lifting of ban on toddy.Nallusamy suggests that the government should stop providing white sugar through ration shops and instead sell karuppatti. Further, palm seeds should be sown on the banks of water bodies such as ponds and lakes, as well as along highways and waterways, he said, adding that palm trees take years to bear fruit, and those growing palm trees should be encouraged with incentives and long term loans.However, some activists note that demand for palm products has been slowly rising. Awareness about the health benefits of palm products have gone up in the past few years. People have started demanding palm products. Once the use of palm products increases, the number of palm trees would also automatically increase, said B Kalanidhi, of Semmai Vazhviyal Naduvam (SVN), an organisation working for the revival of traditional way of Tamil life.SVN is engaged in training people on making karuppatti in their homes. When we organise this training, even in villages, people turn up in sizeable numbers since they want to produce genuine palm products on their own and avoid spurious ones in the market, he pointed out, adding that increasing the number of palm climbers was one of their objectives.Noting that efforts of the government in protecting the palmyra tree were insufficient, Kalanidhi acknowledged that the government had done some good by introducing palm products such as padhaneer in all districts.Raghunatha Bhoopathy, founder, Panaikal Kodi (meaning one crore palymra trees), a movement devoted to increasing the number of palmyra trees in the State, said the organisation was planting trees and tracking their growth. Our volunteers group is creating a database of the palm seeds we have sown, whether they are in good condition, and how many seeds failed to sprout, he explained. Depending upon the areas and soil content, the yield given by the palmyra trees differ. In Thoothukudi and Tiruchendur areas, high-yielding palmyra trees are seen even now. Panaikal Kodi works in tandem with other groups engaged in this work across the State.One tree, many usesThe palmyra is the official tree of TN. It is called karpaga vruksham (celestial tree which offers everything one asks for), and is highly respected because all its parts can be usedNewly germinated seeds form fleshy sprouts below the surface which can be boiled and eaten as a fibrous, nutritious foodThe ripe fibrous outer layer of the fruits is edible after boiling or roasting. When the fruit is tender, the kernel inside the hard shell is an edible jelly (nungu) that is refreshing and rich in mineralsLeaves were widely used in roofingIn ancient times, dried palm leaves were used to write manuscriptsNon-bailable offenceAccording to Nallusamy, coordinator of Toddy movement, while every day palmyra trees are cut in Tamil Nadu, mostly for firewood, neighbouring Sri Lanka has made cutting a palmyra tree non-bailable offencegovt initiativesFor its part, the State government had sanctioned a scheme for Safeguarding and planting of Palmyra at a cost of Rs 1.38 crore to be implemented from 2016-17 to 2020-21. However, the efforts to know the latest position on this scheme failed since Forest Department Secretary Mohammed Nasimuddin could not be reached"

Well, it is something that our cities and even rural areas are not known for. Hence, as part of observing 'No Horn Day' on April 26, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), in association with the National Initiative for Safe Sound (NISS), has come up with a series of programmes to turn Kochi into a honk-free city.One of the initiatives was to record the sound level in various places in the city. As part of the initiative, IMA-NISS teamed up with SCMS Group of Institutions and IOA. The team of 20, which conducted the study, was led by Radha Thavanoor. According to V P Pradeep, convener of 'No Horn Day' programme and an ENT surgeon, the study revealed a dismal picture on the noise pollution in the city.Of the nine places in the city where the study was conducted, High Court Junction breached the sound limits at 105.3 decibels. ""The volunteers armed with the state-of-the-art equipment measured the noise level at the High Court Junction, Vyttila, Kaloor, Pallimukku, Palarivattom, Edappally, Kundanoor, Maharaja's College and Seematti. It was found the noise on the road was the highest during the peak hours from 9 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 6 pm,"" he said.As per the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control)(Amendment) Rules, 2000, the permissible sound levels are: 75 dB in industrial area, 65 dB in commercial area, 55 dB in residential area and 50 dB in the silence zone.""But the study shows that the noise levels in the city are beyond the permissible levels. At 103 dB, Palarivattom emerged the second noisiest place in the city and Pallimukku (102 dB) came third. The remaining places were not far behind and measured between the 94-98 dB range,"" he said. The entire road noise was measured during the study.Pradeep said the sound levels were measured with help of a mobile application developed by Bosch. ""The volunteers downloaded the app on their smartphones. The app uses inbuilt microphone and accelerometer in the smartphones to measure noise and vibration. The data was then calibrated and compiled by the team at SCMS. The team will be presenting it as a study report backed by charts and graphs,"" he said.According to him, the high noise levels are a cause for worry. ""Constant exposure to high decibels can lead to permanent hearing loss,"" he said. Normal conversation is about 60 dB, a lawn mower lets out about 90 dB, and a rock concert 120 dB. In general, sounds above 85 dB are harmful, depending on how long and how often you are exposed to them and whether you wear earplugs or earmuffs. ""Besides causing hearing loss, loud noise affects general health too. Hypertension, increase in the blood sugar level, anxiety and palpitation are some of the ailments linked with noise pollution,"" he said, adding the IMA-NISS will be testing the hearing capacity of the private bus crew and autorickshaw drivers on Monday and Tuesday. ""We are concentrating in on those operating at the Kaloor private bus stand,"" he said.Decibel-level sounds that one may encounter in modern life are as follows:Quiet library or soft whisper30 dBNormal conversation50-60 dBBusy traffic or noisy restaurant70 dBSubways, heavy city traffic, alarm clock at 2 ft (61 cm), or Factory noise80 dBNoise in industrial plants, or call centres90 dBTrain travelling 45 mi (28 km) per hour93 dBChain saw, stereo headphones, night club or pneumatic drill100 dBLoudest sound that can be tolerated by the human earabout 120 dBSound at a rock concert in front of speakers, sandblasting, or thunderclap120 dBGunshot blast or jet plane140 dBAutomobile drag race171 dBSound at a rocket launching pad180 dB* Prolonged exposure to sound level at or above 85 dB will damage hearing"

(Representational) Yoga and laughter therapy is seen as a common exercise among senior citizen clubs these days. (Representational)Written by FATIMA ALAMIt is 6.45 am. Gathered in a close circle on the Girgaum Chowpatty are over a dozen senior citizens. For the next two hours every morning, they do what the texting generation has limited to three letters  LOL. They laugh out loud. Started in 2008, their informal laughter club has become a popular morning visual for locals, who pass by in the South Mumbai neighbourhood.My day doesnt go well unless I come here, smiles Shakun Gabadia Karai, aged 68, who began yoga and laughter therapy five years ago. Karai lost her husband when she was 38, and struggled with depression and diabetes. My sugar levels were restored to normalcy, depression got cured after I started laughter yoga, she claims. The Sion resident works in a vegetable farm house in Panvel, where she handles the business. Former bank employee Kishore H Kuvavala, now chairman of Priyadarshini Laughter Club, explains, Laughter provides an alternative medicine to the mind, body and soul, in an age where stress is the root of 95 per cent of all diseases that have plagued the world. He conducts laughter therapy sessions free of cost for anyone who joins the group on Chowpatty beach every morning.Starting with the basic breathing exercises, the real laughter begins only after 7.30 am, when all the members are, as they like to call it, charged up and open. The first laughing exercise, called the mirror laughter, requires the members to hold a mirror in front of them to which they laugh and chant positive affirmations to themselves. In the second exercise, the bird laughter, they all enact a bird, by trailing both hands in mid-air like flapping of wings, or acting like a bird would feed.In another exercise, they distribute chocolates and feed each other to encourage interpersonal love and harmony among the community members.I work on the computer for eight hours a day. The shoulder exercises help in relieving stress in my joints. I remain cheerful the entire day after laughter yoga, said Sheetal Mehra, a Grant Road resident, who has been attending the club for three years. With the yoga routine consisting of multiple breathing and stretching exercises that focus on the acupressure points and relieving any joint pain, the members in the club claim their personal lives have improved.Manjula Ben Madhwani, 78, is one of the oldest members of the group. She joined the club on her doctors recommendation, following a bypass surgery. After my angiography, water intake had to be reduced. My health became challenging, she said. Seven years ago she started laughter yoga, and has continued ever since. Varsha Chopra, 64, has been doing laughter yoga for 10 years. She claims that the exercises incorporated in the laughter club are similar to the ones she was made to do in the hospital after a knee replacement surgery.Another 70-year-old member, Jayanthibai Harsova, came across the laughter yoga club while walking to Godrej Garden.

5aea86559855b73f522c0367,That Acne Could Be a Sign of Pre-Diabetes,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/that-acne-could-be-a-sign-of-pre-diabetes/story-xAGbGLuF7Mw2JZdFOc50PM.html,2018-04-22,"Stubborn acne in young adults could be an early sign of insulin intolerance, a pre-diabetes condition where the cells in the body cannot use insulin efficiently to absorb and convert glucose to energy. If insulin sensitivity is not improved by adopting a healthier lifestyle that includes being active, reducing abdominal obesity and eating a diet high in fibre and low in sugar and refined carbs, it can progress to Type 2 diabetes.Diabetes-related acne is fairly common in India, found a cross-sectional study of 20- to 32-year-old men published online in the international journal, JAMA Dermatology. The study demonstrated that young adult men with acne were more likely to have insulin resistance and higher fasting plasma glucose levels than men of the same age without acne.Insulin resistance may be a stage of prediabetes and the patients may develop hyperinsulinemia or Type 2 diabetes in the future. These patients should be followed up to determine whether they develop conditions associated with insulin resistance, wrote study author Dr Mohit Nagpal, of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.For the study, the researchers compared 100 men with acne with 100 age-matched men who did not have acne and were being treated for non-acne dermatoses in the institutes outpatient department. Insulin resistance, as defined by a Homeostasis Model AssessmentInsulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) value greater than 2.5, was present in 22% of those with acne, vs 11% of those without acne.Blood pressure readings were higher among those with acne, compared with controls, as were mean fasting plasma glucose levels. Metabolic syndrome, defined as a group of conditions  increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal blood fats (cholesterol or triglyceride) levels  and measured using the modified National Cholesterol Education Programs Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III), was also slightly more common among those with acne, but the difference was not significant.Metabolic syndrome, including higher blood pressure and plasma glucose levels, are risk factors for heart disease and stroke. While insulin resistance and metabolism syndrome had no effect on the severity of acne (mild, moderate, severe or very severe), those with very severe acne tended to be more overweight than those with mild acne, the study found.There are 70 million adults in India with diabetes, which affects 422 million people worldwide. Adult-onset Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body cannot use insulin produced efficiently because of metabolic reasons, forcing the pancreas to overwork and finally stop insulin production. This forces people with diabetes to take medicines and then insulin injections every day for the rest of their lives.Unhealthy, inactive lifestyles have led to people developing Type 2 diabetes at a very young age. Recent data from the Indian Council of Medical Researchs (ICMR) youth diabetes registry shows that 25.3% of people under 25 with diabetes in India have adult-onset Type 2 diabetes, which, by definition, should strike only older adults with a family history of diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diets and inactivity.Family history is strong risk factor, with most young Type 2 diabetes patients also being obese and very often having metabolic syndrome and acanthosis nigricans (dark, velvety patches on the skin).Type 2 diabetes in young people needs very close monitoring and treatment because complications are two to three times higher than for young people with Type 1 diabetes, showed the ICMR registry data, which found that 56.1% of the registered young diabetics have been hospitalised at least once for acute diabetes-related complications. One in seven (14.1 %) had at least one complication or co-morbid condition, such as hypothyroidism, dyslipidaemia (unhealthy blood fats such as cholesterol and triglycerides), hypertension tuberculosis or sepsis.Acne in young adults, especially when accompanied by acanthosis nigricans and benign hyperplasia (over-growth of sebaceous oil glands in the skin, usually on the forehead and cheeks) should be treated as an early sign of insulin resistance and endocrinologists should work closely with dermatologist to identify patients with common skin disorders who may be at risk for metabolic and androgen-mediated diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome in women.A diagnosis of insulin resistance can not only help delay the onset of diabetes by adopting a healthier lifestyle, but can also help keep blood glucose levels within a healthy range after diagnosis to lower risk of complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, stroke and foot amputation.Given that close to half (47.3%) of Indias 70 million diabetics are undiagnosed, visible signs such as acne could help diagnose thousands of young people at risk of diabetes in the future."

(REUTERS/File) At Wuhan, the two leaders will exchange views on overarching long term strategic issues as well as the latest trends of the world so that the world will develop in a more stable way, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said here. (REUTERS/File)China on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping will discuss globalisation and the threat of rising protectionism at their informal summit at Wuhan this week and the world will hear very positive voices. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Sunday announced that Modi and Xi will meet in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on April 27-28 to improve bilateral relations.At Wuhan, the two leaders will exchange views on overarching long term strategic issues as well as the latest trends of the world so that the world will develop in a more stable way, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said here. As to the background against which this meeting is held, I believe you are clear that the world is faced with rampant unilateralism as well as the rising protectionism in the process of globalisation, Lu said.All these new trends in the world have been closely followed and debated, Lu said in apparent reference to a host of measures initiated by US President Donald Trump in his America First policy leading to a lot of protectionist measures including the current trade spate between the China and US. He was responding to question whether there will be a joint message related to trade and protectionism specially against US unilateral protectionism after the meeting between Modi and Xi. So against such a backdrop China and India have a lot to discuss. We are all newly-emerging markets as well as developing countries with big populations, Lu said.So we believe that the two countries will continue to uphold the globalisation so that it will be more inclusive. So we have lot of shared interests, concerns and propositions, he said. To a specific question whether there would be a joint message related to trade and protectionism especially against US unilateral protectionism, he said while he cannot make any prejudgement ahead of the meeting, it is sure that the two leaders will exchange views on these issues but I believe you will see and hear very positive voices. At the recently-held Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) India and China displayed wider convergence on threats to globalisation and rising protectionism.NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar had said in his address to the fifth India-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) here on April 14 that the world economy is staging a synchronised recovery after a long time. But the recovery is marred and disrupted by unseemingly protectionist noises that are coming out from the Atlantic basin from north and America and Europe, he said in a thinly veiled attack on US and Western countries protectionist policies.He also made a strong case for China to open its import market for India for soybean and sugar after Beijing imposed 25 per cent tariff on a host of products, including the two, following the trade spat with US. I was noticing that there are some tariffs you imposed on farmers from Iowa and Ohio (in US). May be India can be a substitute for soybean and sugar, if we could access those exports with all the due quality considerations to our farmers. That is very useful, he told chairman of Chinas National Development Reforms Commission (NDRC) He Lifeng at the meeting.Kumars pitch for soybean and sugar exports to China came amid the ongoing trade spat between the US and China following which Beijing had slapped 25 per cent tariffs on American soybean imports in a tit-for-tat retaliation to US President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on a range of Chinese products. Trump is pressuring China to reduce Americas whopping USD 375 billion trade deficit with China to USD 100 billion. China had hit back with tariffs on a wide variety of agricultural products such as soybean, corn, beef, orange juice and tobacco which are expected to hit American farmers.Soybean is regarded as most important for US farmers as China is their largest importer.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Of the seven constituencies in Mandya, the only two constituencies where the party could win in the previous assembly polls were Mandya and Malavalli (SC reserve) seats.Ambareesh had won by a record margin of 42,937 votes by securing 90,329 votes against JD(S) candidateM Srinivas who had got only 47,392 votes.Now, the time is ripe to improve the fortunes of the party with Ramesh Babu Bandisidde Gowda and Cheluvaraya Swamy seeking re-election on Congress ticket. If the duo win, it would help in reviving the lost dominance of the party in Cauvery basin.Besides, it will also be the beginning of the downfall of the Deve Gowda-led party that is banking on Vokkaliga community votes in the district. For Congress, which has been sitting pretty on Ahinda votes, no doubt the party stands a good chance to counter the regional outfit.When all seems to be going in its favour, the party wants Ambareesh, a Vokkaliga, to play the role of a formidable leader in further enriching prospects of the party that once enjoyed when S M Krishna had won seven seats for the party in the elections held in 1999. The party had won seven against eight total seats then.Though Ambareesh came out with ripostes, sometimes caring a hoot for who is who in the party, the party ignored and announced ticket to him in the first list of 218 candidates.However, what has added to their woes is Ambareesh still remaining oblivious, without collecting B form with just a day left to file nomination papers. The last day to file nominations is Tuesday."

In a sport that is famous for its lack of patience with managers, Wengers longevity may never be surpassed. Just one other manager in the top four levels of English football has held his job for more than a decade; most are lucky to make it through three seasons. In a statement posted, with little warning or fanfare, on the clubs website, Wenger said that he felt this was the right time to leave the job.Few fans of the North London club will disagree with this assessment. There had been rising clamour for the Frenchmans exit over the last two seasons. As the other top teams in English football powered ahead in their efforts to win trophies at, quite literally, any cost, Wengers Arsenal faced accusations of a somewhat splendid stagnation -- putting in an exhilarating performance one weekend, followed by bewildering capitulation the next. Increasingly the term Wengerball, which once meant mesmeric, expressive, fluid football, had turned into a synonym for a certain naivete -- art without the artifice.READ | Arsene Wenger one of the greatest managers, says Alex FergusonThe teams position in the league table confirms this scepticism. After 20 straight years of qualification for the Champions League, last season Arsenal finished outside the top four for the first time in Wengers reign. This season, again, they could finish as low as seventh place, behind tiny Burnley. Nothing to scoff at in the larger scheme of the Premier League.But under Wengers expert tutelage, Arsenal turned into one of the wealthiest clubs in world, let alone English, football. The team was 6th in the 2018 edition of the Deloitte Football Money League, with annual revenues of 487.6 million euros, ahead of clubs such as Paris St. Germain, Chelsea and Liverpool. It has the resources to compete with any club in any league, and indeed in recent years Wenger has broken the club transfer record several times. However even as it built formidable reserves and infrastructure, the club developed a reputation for being excessively cautious with recruitment -- in many ways, Arsenal seemed to become the least successful super-club in the world. Wenger no doubt craved trophies, but not at the cost of his beautiful, sustainable football.Thus many fans will welcome his departure.But few will celebrate it.READ | Arsenal FC manager Arsene Wengers departure sees tributes flow in from football worldBecause if football could be art, then Wenger was the supreme artist.For the first decade or so of his reign at Arsenal, Wenger transformed everything about the way Arsenal and England played football. Arsenal players, especially of an older vintage, frequently testify to the transformative effect Wengers arrival had on their approach to the game. Out went the fish and chips, aimless training sessions, and cigarettes in the shower. In came the grilled fish, meticulous drills, and strict lifestyle regimen. Wenger even taught his players how to stir sugar into a cup of tea to ensure optimal dissolution. Players, including those critical of the latter half of Wengers reign marked by little success and simmering disquiet in the stands, vouch for the mans passion for bringing the best out of his players.The results of this new approach introduced in October 1996 were instantaneous. Arsenal played scintillating football, bringing together some of the worlds great footballers -- Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira. It culminated in the Invincibles season of 2003-04, when Arsenal were crowned league champions without losing a single match.READ | Arsene Wenger: The Arsenal FC managers best momentsSince 2006, however, when Arsenal lost a Champions League final to Barcelona in heartbreaking circumstances, Wenger has had little silverware to show for all his consistent principles and optimistic football. The 2014 FA Cup triumph was Wengers first trophy in nine years. Many at the time hoped Wenger would leave after that victory, head held high, leaving behind a club wholly equipped for the future.But Wenger stayed, hoping, perhaps, for a final shot at league glory. It was not to be (though a Europa League triumph this season is well within reach).Wenger leaves Arsenal a club with enviable resources. It has a state-of-the-art stadium, world-class training facilities, excellent financial heft, and a global base of fans who care deeply. But this is not unique to Arsenal, nor are these things difficult to acquire at the right price.No, Arsene Wengers greatest legacy at the club is his approach to how football should be played, how footballers should be nurtured, and how a football club should serve its fans, its community, and the world at large. His successors, for there will be many, will have to find a way not just to win, but to win without jeopardising this remarkable legacy."

This mango season treat yourself to the ongoing mango festival 'Aamlicious' at Khandani Rajdhani chain of restaurants spread over 27 cities in India and one in the Middle East. Rajdhani is known for its king size thali of Guajarati cuisine that they serve to their customers. This mango season, be ready to witness the riot of flavours, spices and celebration of senses that lingers for days. The Aamlicious festival will end on May 31, across the country.I was lucky enough to witness and enjoy their Aamlicious thali at Indiranagar branch. As welcome drinks, they served us with two refreshing drinks, one being the kairi panna, a raw mango based tangy drink. It was sweet, savour and salty and had a touch of Jeera, which was very well balanced. The other one being the mango thandai, a concoction of riped mango, a handful of rich Pista and badam. This drink was more on a heavier side and truly rich in flavours. Next up, they started with serving four varieties of chutney - kairi onion chutney, kairi coconut chutney, green chutney and chunda mango chutney. The chutney had a sour yet tangy taste to it.The waiters then quickly kept filling the thali with a number of items. The mango corn bhel and kacchi kairi khichiya chat were a relish to eat and the crispy bhel and tangy mango syrup was also a delight. After this, they started to serve the main dishes, which consisted of 20 varieties of items. One of their speciality is the aam dal dhokli, which was prepared with normal dal, with a touch of raw mango and the special Gujarat dhokli. It had the correct amount of spice with a touch of tanginess from the raw mango. The special roti they had prepared was the kairi maithi thelpa. It wasnt the regular thepla which is usually prepared, but it had a taste of raw mango in it, with dollops of butter and pure ghee. Fajito khadi was another dish that grabbed my attention instantly, khadi as we eat is the normal khadi with pakoda, but this particular one had riped mango flavour which made it a sweet khadi.The thali consisted of not only mango based dishes but were accompanied with their regular dishes like, parwal ki subji, paneer ki subji and the Gujarati dal. Their aim was not to make the whole platter mango-based, as that would stop the customer from eating more. Hence, they stayed with the idea of keeping regular dishes. The dhoklas werent as exciting as the other items, as it did not stand up to the mango flavour.No meal can be complete without desserts. One more brilliant surprise was waiting to be tasted which was the hapus jalebi. This was nothing like the regular round jalebi. It was prepared by dipping small pieces of mango into the jalebi batter and deep fried until golden brown. As you take your first bite, the concoction of mango and sugar syrup takes you to another world of satisfaction. Indeed a good way to finish a meal.Recommended dishes: aam dal dhokli, kairi panna, hapus jalebi, aam ki subji aur pyaz, kacchi kairi khichiya chaat. Overall rating -4/5."

Incidentally, most these deaths took place during the monsoon season.Pilgrims died because they suffered from hypothermia as they were caught in the rains. Later, they died of cardiac arrests, She clarified.This year elaborate arrangements had been made to ensure that not a single pilgrim dies owing to such reasons.As part of the arrangement several teams of doctors, specialists, paramedic staff are being deployed on the 16 km trek to Kedarnath, Naithani said.Besides, members of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) would be available on the yatra route so that they could immediately shift the patients suffering from cardiac arrests to low altitude areas for an immediate relief.Some 17 Medical Relief Posts (MRPs) had been set up on the steep trek to the Chardham. Each of these MRPs would be manned by physicians, paramedic staff besides being equipped with medical gadgets like electrocardiograms, glucometers (to check sugar levels in diabetics), blood pressure checking machines and oxygen cylinders etc.Besides, a list of dos and donts had been put up in all 15 helipads in the Kedarnath area.The system is meant for high-end pilgrims who air dash to a high altitude area like Kedarnath without getting time to acclimatise to the rarefied air, she said.For the pilgrims trudging up to Kedarnath, the Public Address System (PAS) would be set up so, they could be communicated the dos and donts.Similar arrangements are being made on a six km trek to the shrine of Yamnotri. We are not permitting the pilgrims who are obese or suffer from health problems like high blood pressure to trek to the shrine without a proper screening, Uttarakashi District Magistrate Ashutosh Chauhan said.Stocks of life saving medicines and facilities like oxygen cylinders are available with physicians deployed on the trekking route to Yamnotri, so that a prompt medical aid is available to pilgrims in case of emergency, the official said.Besides, teams of SDRF and home guards had also been deployed on the yatra route.In case of an emergency like pilgrims feeling discomfort or suffering a heart attack those Jawans will rush them to low altitude areas for an immediate relief, Chauhan said.Besides, JCB machines have also been parked on the yatra route so that in case of landslides it could be cleared of debris, Chauhan added.ATMs to be filled with cash soonAll cashless ATMs in the fabled religious circuit would be replenished soon to ensure that pilgrims face no cash crunch during the ongoing Chardham yatra, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj said.There are reports that most ATMs in the Chardham (four shrines) and also on the routes connecting them are cashless So, cash will be supplied to all the ATMs by helicopters, which will be pressed into service soon, he said, adding that officials had been issued directions.A request would soon be put in to the Reserve Bank of India to ensure an early supply of cash to the ATMs in the Chardham.Resolving the issue of cashless ATMs is our top priority because pilgrims while travelling by road to the Chardham will have to use cash for payments instead of digital mode of payments like paytms, said the minister."

Its programme co-convener Dr M Narayanan said the bigger aim was to make Kochi free of noise pollution.""At present Gangtok is the only city in India which has been declared a no-horn area. The rules are so stringent that if a person uses horn without cause he/she is finedRs 1,000,"" he said adding even though the Union Government had passed the Noise Pollution Control and Regulation Rules in 2000, nothing concrete has been done to make use of it to stifle the increasing decibel levels.NHD programme convener Dr V D Pradeep said the plan was to make Kochi free of noise pollution by 2020.As a part of the endeavour, the IMA, in association with the National Initiative for Safe Sound (NISS), has decided to launch a few projects.""All these initiatives have the backing of the state government, Association of Otolaryngologists, Motor Vehicles Department and Police Department,"" he said adding the success of the campaigns held during the NHD in 2016 and 2017 has prompted the association to go ahead with the conduct of the day this year as well.However, the target people are to be different this year.""We've seen a considerable decrease in the usage of horns among those who drive cars and two-wheelers. But the same can't be said about private buses. They continue to defy decibel levels,"" Dr Pradeep said. Hence, this year the campaign has been drawn up keeping them in mind. ""We've decided to conduct a study at three major junctions --- High Court Junction, Kaloor and Vyttila --- in the city. The sound levels at these places will be measured in the morning and evening using advanced equipment. The initiative will be undertaken on Friday and Saturday,"" he added.He said since private bus drivers are the major contributors to sound pollution, it becomes imperative that they are made aware of the consequences.""We've decided to conduct an audio testing camp at Kaloor bus stand on April 23 and 24 to gauge the hearing levels of the drivers there. Even the autorickshaw drivers will be tested,"" he said.He blamed the air horns and electric horns for an increase in noise pollution. ""The permissible decibels are 75 in industrial, 65 in commercial and 50 in residential areas. But in Kochi, the sound levels have blasted way past the limits, thanks to altered vehicles and irresponsible use of horns. The increased decibels cause harmful health problems like hypertension, increase in sugar levels and hearing loss,"" he said."

Not all weddings and party gatherings might offer sugar-free food, but now cakes, smoothies, and Indian sweets are just a call or online order away. Services like Lotsa Lavender, Awesome Chefs DIY kits, and Smoothie Bar have customised products that are diabetic-friendly. And taking it a step further are shops like Dezire that have a whole range of sweets, jams, squashes, and more, catering only to diabetics.Lavanya Ramu, director, Dezire, says the idea popped up when she noticed diabetic feeling deprived at functions and dinner tables. Since the Indian appetite is used to sweets with ghee and sugar, its only natural to have these cravings. We have about 25 varieties of low-glycemic foods where weve replaced sugar with natural substitutes. We hold a patent for the process too, she shares.(Sources: latest figures from WHO, ICMR, NCBI)Diabetes is a lifestyle disease that is reversible with healthy food habits. Most services that cater to diabetics recognise this and call it a health-friendly switch instead of a diabetic-friendly one. Krishna Pratap, MD, Smoothie Bar, says one of the misconceptions that they try to break is that juices are risky for a diabetic. We have juices and 320 ml drinks which can replace a meal. We work with a dietician, so people can individually chart out a subscription plan according to their tastes and health, he says.To help follow the Low Carb High Fat (LCHF) diet plan strictly, DIY kits by Awesome Chef, cater to anyone who wants to eat healthy while having a variety. Their kits include paneer/chicken jambori with three-four vegetables, balsamic vinegar, herbs and olive oil; butter chicken/paneer/tofu with cauliflower rice, where rice is replaced with granulated and pan-fried cauliflower.Talking about the science that goes into their kits, Anjali Anand, co-founder, Awesome Chef, explains, The body requires additional source of energy, apart from a bowl of vegetables. A diabetic person, can get this by consuming good fats like coconut oil, olive oil, ghee, butter, nuts, seeds, cheese and fresh creams. Nandini Sivakumar, a home-baker who runs Lotsa Lavender, shares that sugar-free alternatives in cakes and pastries are a healthy choice anyone can make. Diabetics, or people with allergies, can customise their cakes. I use palm sugar, jaggery, dates, raisins, and fruits like bananas as sweeteners. Additionally, my cakes are wheat-based, she shares.Going with the saying that anything white is bad for a diabetic, these services find natural substitutes for unhealthy foods. Diabetics can consume a whole range of low-glycemic foods without guilt, and with minimal lifestyle changes. I follow the LCHF diet plan, and today, its absolutely easy for anyone, however busy schedule their schedule is, to reverse diabetes while satisfying their cravings, shares Anjali.Diabetic friendly food outlets Dezire : No. 25, Burkit Road, T Nagar, Chennai, and AC Block, 5th Avenue, Shanti Colony Anna Nagar.For details call: 42121415 / 42172083 Lotsa Lavender food joints: For details, visit: www.facebook.com/lotsalavender Awesome Chef: 46, 4th Cross Street, Thirumalai Priya Nagar, Pudur, Ambattur,For details, write to: cs@awesomechef.in Smoothie Bar: 292, Z Block, 2nd Avenue, Next to Hi Style, Blue Star Bus Stop, Anna Nagar Tower Metro Station, Anna Nagar, For details call: 30257946Myths People with diabetes must completely avoid sweets and chocolates Eating too much sugar causes diabetes Fruits and juices cannot be consumed If youre overweight or obese, you will develop diabetes"

Vijay Barse and his wife, Rachana, have helped shape the lives of countless slum children through football. Related News Down in Jungleland: Circle of LifeDown in Jungleland: Circle of Life Families in Food: Sugar Highs and LowsFamilies in Food: Sugar Highs and Lows Summer Sojourns: Offbeat destinations for a week-long trip Vijay Barse still remembers that Saturday afternoon, in 2001. He had left work early, when it started to rain. Barse took shelter under a tree, when he saw something that was to change his life, and those of thousands of children: a few children from a nearby slum were kicking around a broken bucket, trying to play football. Barse often saw the same set of boys on the grounds of Nagpurs Hislop College, where he was a sports teacher. These same boys would split the spoils of the day after picking someones pocket or share a bidi. I saw their earnestness for the game and realised that, at least for the time they were playing, these boys will not pick a pocket or smoke, says Barse. Barse wanted to set up a match for them but none of the college boys wanted to play with them. The social divide was a problem. Thats when I asked a journalist friend of mine to put an article in the newspaper that I was starting a district Zopadpatti Football tournament, where teams would comprise only slum dwellers. Thats how the idea of Zopadpatti Football or Slum Soccer as it is now known, for underprivileged children, was born. The man is now the inspiration behind National Award-winning director Nagraj Manjules next film  a biopic on Barse. His role will be essayed by Amitabh Bachchan. At his home in Bhokara village, Nagpur, Barse says, I am a sports teacher. But I am not promoting the development of football. I am promoting development through football. As Barse urges his boys, who are sharing a meal with him, to gobble down a dozen boiled eggs, he recounts his story. Vijay Barse and his wife, Rachana. Vijay Barse and his wife, Rachana.I was still a physical education teacher at Nagpurs Hislop College in 2001. I organised cycle rallies and sports ground bachao andolans. I always had that streak of social work and leadership. Maybe it came from my father who was a police constable, and who I had seen fight even his senior officers for justice, says Barse.Originally, the plan was to enroll 32 teams from the entire district for the first ever tournament  128 teams finally registered. But there were many hurdles. The teams had never played professionally and knew no rules. We kept only one rule: if the football goes out of the field or physical assault happens, the player has to sit out the game. The players had no uniforms. So Barse asked one set of players to take off their t-shirts. The bare-chested ones became one team and the ones with t-shirts, their opponents. The winning team was felicitated by local politicians and their pictures appeared in newspapers  the losing team was gifted a football by Barse. His logic? At least until it tore off, I was certain they would keep playing. The winning team was anyway going to keep playing.Thus started Slum Soccer tournaments, now held across all states of the country. Two teams  one mens and one womens  are selected from these tournaments. They represent India at the Homeless World Cup, an international soccer competition for the similarly underprivileged, held across different countries since 2001.In 2006, Barse retired from college and got a huge chunk of money as a retirement fund. I used to think I work only for a few hours and get so many holidays, yet I get full payment. I felt I was getting paid more than I should and wanted to give back to society, he says. With that money, he bought a piece of land where his organisation, Slum Soccer, now stands. Two years later, his wife Rachana also retired as a sports teacher, and handed over her money to develop the centre. What came up was a football ground, a small single-storey building which serves as a church for the community on weekends and an activity centre on weekdays, the headquarters of Slum Soccer, and his own house.However, while his wife offered her unconditional support, it wasnt so easy to get his son, Dr Abhijit  now the CEO of Slum Soccer  on board. In 2007, Abhijit fell out with his father, and took up a job as a research fellow in USA. I am a pragmatic person. I question everything around me, even myself. I didnt understand his ideals then, he admits.The same year, in 2007, Slum Soccers national tournament got covered by the BBC. The then director of the Homeless World Cup, Andy Hooks, invited Barse to South Africa, where Barse met Nelson Mandela. I received the biggest recognition for my work that day when he put a hand on me and said, My son, youre doing a great job, says Barse, as he brushes off a tear.In 2008, an article on Barse appeared in a New York publication, which was seen by his son. Abhijit then decided to head back home to the man whom the world was celebrating. Today, Slum Soccer runs several programmes from gender awareness to menstrual hygiene in mostly government schools, across several states, with main offices in Nagpur, Chennai and Kolkata.Much Like Barse, his students havent looked back. Homkant Sundarase, the son of a marginal farmer, ran away from his village Ner in Yavatmal district, and ended up in a Slum Soccer tournament. The boy represented India at the 2008 Homeless World Cup and is now a coach. His fellow coach, Shrutika Amle, comes from a neighbourhood which frowns on girls in knickers playing ball. The daughter of a driver, she represented India at the Homeless Soccer tournament in Amsterdam (2015) and has since travelled to France, Germany and other countries for tournaments and workshops. I never had a passport, and had never flown in an airplane. Today I dream of representing India, of starting my own academy. Had it not been for Slum Soccer, my fate would have been otherwise, she says.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

China matched the US tariffs with plans to levy duties on $50 billion of US products.Maybe India can substitute for some of the items like soybean and sugar, Kumar said, adding China could offer favourable terms to farmers.Kumar also urged China to liberalise its movie quote system to allow the screening of more Indian films, and sought Chinese investment in affordable housing projects in India.Indian movies have done very well at the Chinese box office since last year, raking in millions of dollars.Kumar also asked China to increase the number of working groups under the dialogue mechanism  currently five groups focus on infrastructure, hi-tech, energy, resource conservation andpolicy coordination - to include pharmaceuticals and culture. The working group on infrastructure discussed various areas of cooperation, including setting up of manufacturing units by Chinese companies in India instead of just selling products.He Lifeng said India and China have more shared interests than frictions and that Beijing wants to carry on our traditional friendly relations with India (and) create a new future.He said the economic dialogue is important to implement the consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the BRICS Summit at Xiamen last September.The working groups discussed the possibility of aligning the Make in India Initiative and Made in China 2025.The Indian side took this opportunity to express concerns regarding growing trade imbalance with China andhuge untapped potential of Indias exports to China by addressing market access issues, an Indian embassy statement said."

(File)A DAY after Indrani Mukherjea was discharged from JJ Hospital, she was produced in the special CBI court conducting the Sheena Bora murder trial through a video-conferencing link from the Byculla womens jail. On Thursday, a key prosecution witness, Kajal Sharma, who was Indranis secretary, was expected to depose. Indranis advocates, Gunjan Mangla and Ayaz Khan, submitted before the court that Indrani should remain present in court for the recording of evidence and sought an adjournment.A medical officer from Byculla womens jail told the court that Indrani was inspected at 10.30 am on Thursday morning and that she is unable to walk. The officer added that Indrani was complaining of weakness and will need four-five days to recover completely.The court asked her advocates to ask Indrani, through the video-conferencing link, if she would want to be present during the deposition of the third witness, Sharma. Indrani responded saying: Yes, please. Indrani said she was not in a position to attend the court. Her advocates submitted an earlier order of the Bombay High Court on the required presence of an accused during recording of evidence. The court then directed that the trial be adjourned till she recovers and can come to court.CBI prosecutor Bharat Badami requested the court that since the witness had come to court twice, heavy cost should be imposed on Indrani to pay the witness expenses. Indranis advocate countered the CBI stating that since Indrani had taken ill while in custody, it is the states responsibility and, therefore, the cost cannot be incurred. No cost was imposed on Indrani by the court.Peters foodAfter the courts direction on Wednesday for Indranis co-accused, ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and husband, Peter Mukerjea, regarding not eating outside food in the court, Peter, Thursday, entered the witness box to seek permission from Special Judge JC Jagdale to eat before leaving for jail. The judge inquired about who had brought the food. On being told that it was brought by a friend, the court asked the person about his identity and the food he had brought. The man named JP Swami told the court that he had brought a burger and coffee. Peter told the court that if he did not eat at regular intervals, his sugar level drops.The judge said eating was a basic necessity and on humanitarian grounds, he would allow Peter to eat. The judge told Peter that since he and Indrani are witnesses in another case (one against Karti Chidambaram in the INX Media deal), there is apprehension about their safety and care should be taken. Peter then proceeded to eat. Constables from his police escort team, however, directed Peters friend to eat the food before Peter did to ensure it was safe for consumption.

(Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational) Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. (Express photo by Prashant Nadkar/Representational)Farmers in Maharashtra are gearing up for a fresh round of protests, with a number of groups giving a call for strike in June. Exactly a year ago, farmers across the state had gone on a similar strike that had crippled essential supplies. Vegetables and fruits were stopped from reaching the urban centres while dairies complained of dip in collection as farmers refused to supply milk.After several rounds of discussions with the protesting farmers, the state government had finally agreed to some of their demands, following which the strike was called off. One of the immediate impacts of last years strike was the announcement of Rs 34,000-crore loan waiver in the form of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana. The procurement price of milk was increased to Rs 27 per litre, while, in response to the demand for implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commission report that had recommended that farmers receive at least 1.5 times their production costs, a special commission was announced to ensure that farmers get decent returns for their produce.ALSO READ | Farmer suicides in BJP-ruled states very low, mostly over personal issues: Amit Shah in KarnatakaBut within a year, farmers are ready to start an agitation once again. A group claiming to have the support of more than 30 organisations has called for a farmers strike from June 1. Here are some of the issues that have led to the farmers agitation.Loan waiverThe loan waiver announced by the state government was supposed to wipe off outstanding loans of farmers since 2009. This was the second loan waiver in the state, the previous one having been implemented by the Congress-NCP government in 2007-08. The scheme has been facing teething problems right from the start, mainly on account of over-reliance on technology.To submit their claims for loan waiver, farmers had been asked to fill up online forms, which was to be authenticated by cooperative department using similar data entered by the banks. Technical glitches, and the dependence of many farmers on local officials to fill up these forms, have led to delays in the process. The government had announced that loans worth Rs 23102.19 crore in 46.34 lakh farm loan accounts would be waived. Till March 6 this year, banks have been able to complete this process only for 35.68 lakh accounts, worth a total of Rs 13,782 crore.The delays in completion of loan waiver scheme has impacted disbursement of fresh farm loans for the current season. A number of ineligible farmers had defaulted on their loans, hoping their loans would also be waived off. Because of their defaults, they are finding it difficult to obtain fresh loans.There has been an almost 40 per cent drop in crop loan disbursement for this season, and a 28 per cent rise in lending by money lenders. What is likely to further delay the loan waiver scheme is the state governments acceptance of the demand of tribal farmers who had marched to Mumbai last month to extend the cut-off date of loans to 2001.PricesThe biggest worry of the farmers right now is the low prices their produce is fetching in the market. Barring soyabean, whose season is long over, not a single commodity is trading at government-specified Minimum Support Price (MSP). In the case of perishables like fruits and vegetables, the situation is worse. Rabi tomato, which sells at the rate of Rs 10 a kg, is now trading at Rs 1-2 per kg at the markets of Narayangaon and Junnar. Onions, which till recently were fetching Rs 20 a kg at wholesale markets, are now priced at Rs 6 a kg. Farmer leader and Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti says the present price slump is the worst he has seen in the last 20 years.ALSO READ | MSP Satyagrah: No mandi where farmers can sell their produce at MSP, says Yogendra YadavThe reasons for low prices are several. In case of important rabi crop like chana, the held over stock of the last two years, and a lack of market confidence, has brought about the slide. A crop like tur, which has reported lower sowing than last year, is also trading over Rs 1,200 per quintal below its MSP as the state tries to deal with the held-over stock. In fact, it is estimated that that farmers in the state have lost over Rs 1,067 crore by selling tur below MSP this season.Government procurement, often the panacea for low prices, has not helped much.Milk and sugarcaneLast year, the government had increased the procurement price of milk from Rs 24 to Rs 27 per litre. Dairies are, however, barely able to pay Rs 20 per litre to farmers owing to a glut of milk powder in the market. Sugar prices are on a steady fall which has made mills default in their payment. There are over Rs 2,200 crore in dues by the mills to cane farmers.The result has been that farmers are staring at another debt trap. With no immediate relief expected from the market, and government interventions inadequate, the farmers find themselves with no option but to start a fresh agitation. Their demands are no different from the last time  assured returns on their produce and a full loan waiver. So close to an election year, they hope to force the government to listen to their demands.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Shortly after midnight the house guards were gone.Protesting what they alleged a conspiracy to endanger their lives, Rabri Devi and her son, Tejashwi who is also the leader of the opposition, on Wednesday surrendered the entire familys security guards including those provided to RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devis elder son, Tej Pratap Yadav .Besides withdrawing guards from Lalus house, which was allocated to the RJDs first couple as ex-CMs, authorities also served a notice to Tejashwi asking him to vacate his 5 Deshtratan bungalow. A furious Tejashwi described the decision an act of political vendetta.Just now at the stroke of midnight Nitish Kumar has called back 18 house guards deployed in the security of two ex CMs. Surrendering our security to Nitish Ji so that he can increase his own security as he is the most namby-pamby CM of the country, Tejashwi tweeted minutes after the development.Though NDA leaders are tight-lipped on the issue, inspector general of police (IGP) (security) Bachhu Singh Meena said security of former chief minister Rabri Devi and opposition leader Tejashwi had not been curtailed.But a senior police official refusing to be named said only those house guards deputed for Lalu as ex-chief minister had been withdrawn.It is a conspiracy by Nitish, Sushil Modi and their government to get me and my family killed. I dont have any fear. I go out among the public and the public will protect us, an angry Rabri told reporters at her residence.Laluji is in jail and dying every day. We dont know if hes dying due to disease or being killed using medicines. His sugar level is rising. How do I trust the government? If the government asks us to vacate our house were ready to follow.Lalu Prasad who was serving his sentence in the Birsa Munda Jail in Jharkhand after being convicted in fodder scam cases, was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi on March 29 after he complained of discomfort and uneasiness. He is still undergoing treatment.Rabri also shot off a letter to chief minister Nitish Kumar stating that all house guards provided to Lalu as ex-chief minister were withdrawn after he went to jail on December 23, 2017 and only few were left to man posts inside the 10 Circular road residence.The way BMP-2 house guards were withdrawn by a sweeping order at midnight on Tuesday has totally paralysed my security and my family. I do not want to keep guards or any other facility at my disposal just for the sake of showpiece. This is why, I am taking a conscious decision to surrender all my security and cars to the government. If anything happens to me and my family, the entire responsibility would be on the home department and home minister, said Rabri Devi.Her decision has put the entire onus of her and her familys security on Nitish Kumar who holds the home portfolio.A close aide of the opposition leader, Sanjay Yadav said all the security guards of Tejashwi, Rabri and Tej Pratap had been sent back to the state police headquarters. The 10, Circular road residence of Rabri and Tejashwis 5 Deshratan Marg residence allotted as deputy chief minister in the previous grand alliance government wore a deserted look on Wednesday.It is an irony that state government has curtailed Tejashwi and Rabri Devis security when there was a demand for enhancing Tejashwis security for last one month. Now, RJD workers would protect their leaders, said Manish Yadav, another aide of the opposition leader.It is not the first time curtailment of security cover to RJDs first family has triggered a political row. Last November, the central governments decision to downgrade Lalus security cover from Z plus category had seen angry reactions with Tej Pratap threatening to skin the Prime Minister."

He further declared that under the state governments policy of relief to farmers, farm labourers will also be covered and will get a relief of Rs 50,000 from bank loans.A government medical college and hospital was a long-pending demand of Gurdaspur residents because people from here have to travel to Amritsar in case of serious diseases. It is also part of the state budget this time. The announcement came when Punjab Congress chief and local MP Sunil Jakhar made a request during the function; at this, the CM asked Jakhar to find land for it.Nearly three decades ago, the local civil hospital was upgraded from 50 beds to 100 hoping that eventually it would be upgraded to a medical college. Former Gurdaspur Lok Sabha member and now Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa too made efforts to bring a government or even as private medical college to Gurdaspur, but to no avail. Gurdaspur has a government engineering college and an institute for hotel management.As for the sugar mill, the state government had set up a committee for improving the existing Batala cooperative sugar mill as it has dilapidated machinery. The CM said the committee has submitted its report that it will be of no use to renovate the existing mill as it will cost a lot, whereas setting up of a new sugar mill will be cheaper and more beneficial.As for the main agenda of the function, the loan waiver beneficiaries were 26,918 marginal farmers (owning up to 2.5 acres) from Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr who got cheques against loans of Rs 156.12 crore taken from co-operative societies and co-operative banks. The CM said that by now 1.02 lakh farmers have been covered under the waiver scheme that is meant for marginal and small farmers (owning up to 5) acres, at a cost of Rs 455 crore to the state. He underlined that this function was the third of its kind; the earlier ones were held at Mansa and Nakodar. He also reiterated that his government leads by offering farmers a waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh while Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra offered Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000, respectively.He noted that it is unfortunate that 10.25 lakh of Punjabs 17.5 lakh farmers are in debt. He promised a complete solution to the problem of farm loan in a phased manner as and when the state exchequer allows. He expressed concern over suicides being committed by the debt-ridden farmers. He held the 10-year misrule of SAD-BJP alliance  before Congress took power in March last year  responsible for the financial crisis in the farming sector. To make the assertion that he stands by the people in crises, he also mentioned the promise of a government job and financial help of Rs 5 lakh each to families of the men killed by terrorists in Mosul (Iraq).Later, he also took a dig at the opposition AAP and SAD MLAs boycotting parts of the recent Vidhan Sabha session over minor differences of opinion, and underlined that functioning of the state assembly costs Rs 70 lakh a day. Commenting on 23 days of non-functioning of the Lok Sabha, he said the functioning of the Lower House of Parliament costs Rs 9 crore a day and the MPs must discuss everything, instead of avoiding discussions. It mus here be underlined that Amarinder had particularly low attendance when he was most recently a member of the Lok Sabha (2014-16) before he quit and later became the CM.None of the six speakers made a mention of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who was conspicuous by his absence even as he is a local. Bajwas younger brother Fateh Jang was among the speakers. Amarinder centred his speech around farmers and did not talk at all about the problems of drug abuse and unemployment. He arrived by a chopper for which a helipad was made near the function ground.Six speakers, including the CM, addressed the gathering at the function that lasted an hour and a half, from 12.30 pm to 2 pm. Cabinet ministers Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Aruna Chaudhary, state Congress president and Gurdaspur MP Sunil Jakhar, and MLAs Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Fateh Jang Bajwa were the other speakers. Singer Pammi Bai and his troupe held the audiences attention from 10 am to 12.30 pm before the chief minister arrived.Others present on the occasion included MLAs Balwinder Singh Laadi, Arun Dogra, Sunder Sham Arora, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Rajnish Kumar Babbi, former ministers Ashwani Sekhri and Gurchet Singh Bhullar, and the district Congress unit presidents of Gurdaspur and Amritsar, Ashok Chaudhary and Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar."

On day two, I feasted on curried kali masi with maize chapatis and was thereafter invited into several homes and yards to admire the iridescent black plumage, beak, comb, wattles, legs and tongue (yes!) of this one-of-a-kind species in India.Kadaknath is one of only three varieties of chicken in the world to have black meat, Silkie in China and Ayam Cemani in Indonesia being the other two. These chickens get the dark staining from melanin and are high in protein and low in fats, including cholesterol.It is not just the flavourful meats lean, gamey texture that makes it popular, but also its supposed medicinal properties. Urban legend has it that it raises haemoglobin levels, keeps asthma and other respiratory disorders in check, helps heal childbirth-related complications and acts as an aphrodisiac for men and men. It is these legendary medicinal properties that make it popular in the region and beyond  the fowl costs between Rs 900 and Rs 1,200 per kg.While the claims that it can increase vigour and cure respiratory illness remain questionable, the high protein and low cholesterol in the black meat are enough turn it into a superfood for health-conscious people with discerning palates.While the claims that it can increase vigour and cure respiratory illness remain questionable, the high protein and low cholesterol in the black meat are enough turn it into a superfood for health-conscious people with discerning palates.New research shows that a diet high in fat and cholesterol depletes artery-protecting immune cells, turning them into promoters of inflammation, which raises plaque (fatty deposits) buildup inside the walls of arteries. These thicken the arterial walls, both hardening and narrowing them, which makes the heart pump harder to keep the blood flowing. Plaque sometimes breaks, fully or partially, and clogs the arteries, stopping blood flow to trigger a heart attack or stroke.Inflammation is also a major contributor to the hardening and narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), according to the study, published in the journal, Nature Communications. Arterial blockage can occur when the immune system reacts to excess cholesterol and lipids in the walls of blood vessels.The damage can be countered by taking in more high density lipoproteins (HDL) or good cholesterol, the kind found in nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, peanuts etc), seeds (flaxeed, pumpkin seeds etc), beans, legumes, whole grains, olive oil and fish. High HDL levels in the blood help the immune cells to keep the arteries clear.Meat low in cholesterol bears the double benefit of weight loss and reducing cholesterol  food from plants sources has zero cholesterol, which is found only in animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs.Being overweight is a risk factor for several diseases, including in persons who are fat and fit, with normal blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Underscoring the importance of a healthy weight even in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors, a large multi-country study from Europe found that overweight people who are otherwise healthy are more likely to develop heart disease than people who are not overweight.Compared with people at a healthy weight, those who were overweight or obese had up to a 28% higher risk of developing heart disease, found the study, which compared data from more than 7,600 cases of heart disease collected over 12 years. The findings are true even for overweight people with no metabolic markers such as high blood pressure, diabetes, elevated triglycerides (a type of blood fat) and high cholesterol, said the study, which was published in August last year in the European Heart Journal.Being overweight or obese are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease, so it makes sense to cut back on saturated fats found in red meats, poultry with skin, butter and saturated oils that solidify at room temperature, such as ghee, coconut oil, palm oil and hydrogenated vegetable oils such as vanaspati."

This is the fourth highest in the country. The top three states are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, that are also major producers of sugarcane.States like Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, all of which have a much higher sugarcane production than Uttarakhand this year, have lower pending arrears.According to a written reply submitted by the central government in Parliament on Tuesday, Uttarakhand produced 2.72 lakh metric tonnes (MT) sugarcane in 2017-18, against 7.38 lakh MT in Gujarat, 4.82 lakh MT in Punjab, 4.38 lakh MT in Bihar and 4.24 lakh MT in Haryana.However, these states fare better in terms of paying their farmers. For instance, Andhra Pradesh which produced 26% more sugarcane has arrears worth 293 crore pending (80% less than Uttarakhand); Gujarat produced 7.38 lakh MT (171% more than Uttarakhand) but has arrears of 475 pending (11% less than Uttarakhand).The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, states that the payment of cane price should be made within 14 days of supply to the mill, failing which the amount will attract a 15% interest per annum on the amount due after 14 days.When asked about the high pendency, finance minister Prakash Pant said it was largely due to the delay by private mills.All arrears for 2016-17 have been cleared. Last year too, the government mills made the payments. In this season, most of the mills are still operating. Only the sugar mill in Bajpur has stopped processing. The payments have started. Let the mills first finish processing and make whatever payments they can. We will make necessary interventions if government mills are unable to pay farmers.He however made it clear that the government will not extend any financial aid to private mills. Our responsibility is to put pressure on them to make timely payments. We will allow them to operate only if they have cleared previous dues, he said.Anand Shrivastav, commissioner, sugarcane and sugar, said the department was regularly sending notices to defaulting private mills.There are three private mills in the state and two of them are very regular in their payments. Only the Iqbalpur sugar mill is in a poor financial condition. It wont be surprising if it defaults this year too. They somehow managed to make their full payment for last year only by the crushing season of this year.Meanwhile, owing to high production and low demand for sugar, mills across the country are expected to incur losses this year as the price of sugar is falling. The central government recently said in Parliament that it has enhanced the import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% to help mills in making payments to the farmers.In this background, clearing pending arrears is likely to be an uphill task for sugar mills in Uttarakhand.Agreeing on this, Pant said, The mills are likely to incur loss this year because the price of sugar is falling due to high production. We will make arrangements for the remaining amount.He however added that since the government has replaced around 60% sugarcane with a high-yielding variety, the recovery (quantity of sugar produced from raw cane) this year has been very good.Expressing hopes for a positive result, he said, Whenever the recovery is more than 10%, it is seen that mills are in profit. On an average, this year the recovery has been 10.7%. Our estimate is that private mills will be in a better position this year. The loss due incurred due to falling prices of sugar should be balanced out with the high recovery.Meanwhile, despite the governments assurance that it will help government mills in paying their dues, farmers are sceptical. They say that in absence of strict actions, sugar mills in the state have become habitual in making delayed payments.The crushing season started in November but farmers have received payments only till January 15. The condition of sugarcane farmers in the state is very bad, said Jagdish Thakur, vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Uttarakhand chapter.Asked about last seasons payments, he said that many mills made the payments only in the first month of this crushing season.Farmers cant rely on mills. The payments are untimely and uncertain. We are forced to avail loans from banks by mortgaging our property. The Sitarganj sugar mill would have benefited many farmers in the Terrai belt. But since it has been closed, farmers have been hard hit as they now have to transport their produce to far off mills, he said.BLURB: Despite being 10th in terms of sugarcane production, Uttarakhand ranks fourth when it comes to pending arrears for 2017-18"

After close to seven months of rigorous training, the dogs were brought for practical examination. It is the final stage before the canines are inducted into the police force. The 92 dog handlers are from four different police departments: Arunachal Pradesh, Central Industrial Security Force, Telangana and Tripura, facilitated the practical tests for the canines.Of them, 58 dogs are from the Telangana police. The canines are trained at Intelligence Integrated Training Academy (IITA), located at Moinabad before a passing out parade is held. The dogs are trained in two major tests: obedience test and professional test, after which they are allocated to five different wings based on their skills. The dogs are mostly trained for tracking of criminals and to detect explosives as those are the common needs that the force requires, said Prabhakar, ISW head constable who is also a dog trainer. He went on to add that the canines are also trained in tracking narcotics, red sandal and even assault in hostile situations. In total there are six breeds of dogs that are in the training: Belgian Malinois, Beagle, Cocker Spaniel, Dobermann and German Shepherd.Their service span can range from 1-8 years after which they retire from the services and are mostly looked after by its handlers. We provide them with special kennels and sweater to beat the winter chill. There are two handlers for every three dogs at IITA, said Dr Madhu, Veterinary doctor. The Thursdays skill demonstration is a result of a sevenmonth long rigorous training regime. The training starts when the dog is about 4-5 months and goes on for close to a year at the special facility operated at Intelligence Integrated Training Academy (IITA) in Moinabad.Mostly male, the canines, based on obedience, are then chosen for training. After an initial four-month of obedience training, they are categorised into five different wings which the state police usually deal with. Tracking presence of narcotics, red sandalwood, explosives, tracing and assaulting criminals in hostile situations are the five broad areas in which the dogs continue their professional life. Ganja, brown sugar and other hard drugs are the most common samples which we source from NCB to train the dogs, said Ravindra, Reserve Inspector, Intelligence Security Wing (ISW).Gunpowder, TNT, ammonia, nitrogen, and safety fuse are few explosive samples included, he added. Rewards, in the form of biscuits, are given to the canines on successful detections. The choice of dog to be deputed in the specific professional wing is made by the department based on the breed of the dog. German Shepherds are mostly for tracing and sniffing while Belgian Malinois would be a common pick for assault training, informed Prabhakar, Head Constable, ISW."
5aeaa8449855b73f522c1c00,The Other Side of Steve,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-other-side-of-steve/story-R9kTy1eyWf38dDhuurj8uO.html,2018-03-30,"In the California of the 80s, two men in a rundown club struck a deal by the dance floor. The owner of the club was Steve (Somen) Banerjee, a Bombay boy who had landed in the US a decade earlier and after failing to run a gas station, was now hoping to hit gold with a nightclub. He was a dreamer, he had initiative, and he was willing to put his money into an idea that makes most music halls sing: Place some half-naked girls on a revolving stage. And then play the organ.Steve just wanted to do it the other way around. He wanted to put men on stage, oiled, dancing, and cuffed, nearly in the buff, and see women outside the ring screaming. Nick De Noia, a choreographer, said he could make that happen. When Steve got into business with Nick, the agreement was Steve would sign the cheques. And Nick would show the boys how to move.Steves club, Chippendales, and the Chippendales troupe, were soon booming. The concept of men dancing for women at a nightclub was novel for that time. It made Steve nearly a pioneer in Americas adult entertainment industry. By the late 1980s, writes Anirvan Chatterjee, a writer-activist of California, in his blog, diasporic.com: The Chippendales were almost a household name. Over a million copies of their calendars were sold every year. Touring profits exceeded $25,000 per week, and at its height, Steve controlled an $8-million-a-year business.At a performance at the Chippendale's disco. At first, Steve Banerjee couldn't get any male dancers because ""all the guys were worried about their images."" (Bettmann Archive/Getty Images)An Indian in AmericaSteves success, even though it went unacknowledged by the Indian or the Bengali community, was reported in the media of that time and that is how Pablo Bartholomew, one of the front-ranking photographers of India, then in his thirties, who had arrived in America on an Asian Cultural Council grant, heard about him.Bartholomew used the grant money to document the lives of the Indian community for his project Indian Emigres. He was familiar with America as he had already worked for a French American photo news agency. From 1983, Bartholomew began researching for subjects to photograph; he scanned Indian community newspapers like India Abroad, India West, and various archives and local Indian associations with the US. He found that Steve was one of the many Indians who had been finding a foothold in the US as economic migrants.Chitresh Das with his all-blonde Kathak dance troupe, Marin Headlands, California, USA, 1987.

Indians in Leicester is a project done between August of 2010 and June 2011. It looks at the various Indian communities especially people who were displaced from Uganda and other East African countries. (Pablo Bartholomew/Netphotograph)Houston BiennaleBartholomew brings to the current edition of Fotofest 2018 Biennale in Houston, Texas, 35 photographs from his five- country migr documentation  US, France, Mauritius, UK, Portugal (this has been arranged chronologically at the fest). With India being the theme of the 33-year-old Fotofest , there are over 35 participating photographers from India and of Indian origin. Bartholomews display of photographs is one of the largest and most geographically diverse.When I worked on the American part, my one big regret though was not getting to photograph a big hero of mine - Amar Bose, the academic at MIT, an acoustic engineer, innovator and founder of the Bose Corporation, says Bartholomew of his documentation of Indians in America. We had long chats and he invited me to visit him in Boston but somehow I couldnt make it. I never met him in person and at that time his was a niche acoustic system in the 80s before Bose became a global brand.If Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, was one of the pinnacles of Indian-American success in the 80s; Steve Banerjee with a mini empire of road shows, satellite clubs and merchandise such as the Chippendales Calendar, and an annual turnover of several million dollars, was no less than a stalwart of the Los Angeles club scene. Bartholomew did portraits of both.This month, Steves photo is hanging  along with 34 other photos from the Indian migr series  at the FotoFest 2018 Biennale in Houston, organised around contemporary photography within India and the global Indian diaspora. And Steves is the photograph that perhaps messes the most with the neat narrative of the American dream, or the story of the Indians as a model community, a homogeneous collective as it were, where all its members land equally on their feet.Meeting SteveSo lets meet Steve. Bathed in cherry-pink club-lights, dressed in sharp suit and tie atop a bar stool with a blonde hunk in the background, he has a cigarette in hand and a Screwdriver to his side. Steve may not have had an all-American bone structure, but youd think this was what an all-American success looked like. Running establishments in New York, Dallas and Denver, he could steer California if need be! Youd think this was a guy at the top of things.Women workers of Savannah Sugar Estate cleaning and clearing up fields of sugar cane. (Courtesy/ Pablo Bartholomew)Nothing could be further from the truth. Bartholomew met Steve at his flagship club, Chippendales in Los Angeles, in 1987, a year before the unravelling of his business and three years before the FBI would begin to build the evidence to make a case against him.In 1986, a year ago, he had allegedly got his creative partner Nick De Noia murdered, who, according to the The Chippendales Murder, the USA Networks telefilm based on Steves life, was trying to palm off the Chippendales concept to other clubs. (Nick was the ex-husband of Jennifer O Neill, the lead actress of the Summer of 42 whose smouldering appearance on the screen had helped American boys come of age.) This side of Steve, Bartholomew says, he was unaware of. It certainly explains his hesitance to be part of Bartholomews project.Steve initially did not want to be photographed, says Bartholomew. I told him Im doing a project and it could take multiple forms, it could be a book, it could become a National Geographic story  basically, I gave him a basket of reasons. He was evasive and said he didnt have the time. But I pursued him stating that I only need 15 minutes of his time. And for good measure threw in I like what you are doing. Steve, softened and came around, asking Bartholomew to visit his New York venture to experience, what he did.On 60th Street and 3rd Avenue, under a bridge near the Trawney Plaza, New York, stood Steves theatre. On a bright afternoon, I knocked at the box-office window where the guy manning it signalled me to go the main entrance door. To my utter surprise I was met by a demure woman in her mid-thirties dressed in a traditional green-coloured saree who introduced herself as Steves sister, says Bartholomew. She escorted him to the well-positioned box, a large private area at the centre of the arena. It was three in the afternoon and a group of white American guys with naked torsos and dressed in bow ties and cuffs were doing a bump and grind routine. As they came close to the audience of wild purring women, the women lunged at the men to stuff dollar bills in their underwear. And I thought sure, this is just what I am looking for! recalls Bartholomew with a grin.Steve, says the photographer, was, however, not a difficult subject. The slight smile playing around his mouth as seen in the photograph, could even be self-deprecatory. He had been doing well, but perhaps he had an inkling that the law would catch up with him.Doing portraitsBartholomews photograph of Steve Banerjee is thus an important document of the many sides to the Indian migrant story  the hunger to make it, the fragility of financial success begun with modest means [Steves father had been in the printing business], the anonymity that comes when an immigrants life becomes tainted with failure, and the need to acknowledge all of them. Did the photographer think Steve was a success or a failure? Or was he both?All photographers who do portraits do it for different reasons. When doing photos the story needs to be told in that one photograph, Im not interested in stripping people to their truth, or in adding anything. They are as I find them, says the photographer. I am a secret admirer of people with great enterprise, maybe Steve messed up, but if he had astute business sense, he would have been thriving today.In the photograph there is one detail that inadvertently humanises an Indian immigrant undeniably gone rogue. On the ring finger of his right hand Steve wears his wedding band. From all accounts, he was a family man. In the film, actor Naveen Andrews playing Steve, says in right earnest as he courts his soon-to-be wife Irene, an American: I see Chippendales as a place anyone can come in, even children. Who knows, perhaps he meant it!For a man who planned the murder of four of his associates  besides Nick De Noia  and tried to sabotage three of his competitors businesses, his suicide at a detention centre in 1994 was an act of generosity and love towards his family. As his death occurred before the formal sentencing by court, it put the ownership of Chippendales in his wifes hands as Steve had intended it. The photograph freezes that moment in his life, when, from the height of financial success, he could see, even if no one else did, how close he was to slowly losing it."

The wildlife act is silent on non-native species even if the animals are on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species list, according to Louies. At best you can just confiscate the animals and book the person under customs act, he said.Singh was booked under section 55 of the Wildlife Protection Act. There is a reticulated python which is a schedule 1 species under the act, Baruah said.The schedule 1 lists animals and birds that are endangered and provides them protection by listing stiff penalties for any harm coming to them."

The resolution came up during Zero Hour after Congress MLA Sushil Kumar Rinku drew attention of the members towards the apex courts order.Rinku said there is resentment in the SC community over it, and accused the Centre of not presenting the case well in the apex court. He was supported by three prominent Dalit leaders: technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi, welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, and Congress MLA Raj Kumar Verka.The apex court had on March 20 taken note of misuse of provisions of the Act against government servants and held that there shall be no immediate arrest on complaint filed under the law. Channi said it is a sensitive matter and the Dalit community is feeling hurt. This has happened because of the anti-Dalit government at the Centre, he said, referring to the BJP-led regime. However, BJP MLA Som Prakash said that even as this is an apex court order, the Congress remain in the habit of blaming the BJP for everything.As Congress members pressed for the resolution, it was passed. It will be now sent to the central government for filing a review against the court order, said Rinku.Earlier, among other issues taken up, leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira talked of protests by thousands of teachers associated with different unions in Ludhiana on Sunday and the police lathicharge on them. There is resentment among the unemployed. Teachers also gathered in large numbers in Ludhiana to press for their demands, but the government used force against them. Over 52,000 anganwadi workers are also working at Rs 5,600 per month. What are you (government) doing about it? he asked. However, speaker Rana KP Singh said the minister could raise issues during Zero Hour but not insist on reply from the government.Another AAP MLA, Kanwar Sandhu, raised the issue of sugarcane dues to farmers from cooperative sugar mills to the tune of Rs 300 crore, and cane price in Punjab being lower than that in Haryana and Bihar. In response, finance minister Manpreet Badal said Rs 46 crore was due which was also cleared earlier in the day. Sandhu was not satisfied and later gave a notice of privilege against the minister for misleading the House."

(Source: AP File) Qantas, whose logo is prominent on the Australian teams jerseys, said they were disappointed by the ball-tampering controversy. (Source: AP File)The ball tampering crisis couldnt have come at a worse time for Cricket Australia, which is renegotiating a lucrative TV deal, with the existing Aus$600 million five-year agreement expiring at the end of the year. There are concerns that the broadcasters could use the controversy as a bargaining chip. This is deeply disappointing and certainly not what anyone expects from our national cricket team, airline Qantas, whose logo is on the team shirts in South Africa, told AFP. Financial giant Commonwealth Bank, which sponsors the national womens team, said it has sought a detailed explanation. The teams biggest sponsor, fund manager Magellan, told the Australian Financial Review: Were deeply concerned about it, it involves cheating, in no way would we condone it in what we do.Broadcasting rightsCricket Australia earned A$338.4 million ($261 million) in media, sponsorship and spectator fees in the financial year ended June 30, 2017, according to its recent annual report. The value of individual sponsorship were not disclosed. This controversy comes at the climax of talks about a five-year broadcast rights deal with Australian television networks. Long-term cricket broadcaster Nine Entertainment declined to comment. Cricket players and the governing body have also recently come out of a bruising pay dispute.How the aussies were nailedBefore the ongoing ball-tampering scandal broke out, South African broadcasters got a whiff that the Australians were up to something untoward in the first two Tests. Former South African fast bowler Fannie De Villiers told RSN Radio that he directed his cameramen to have a look at the Australians during the Cape Town Test match.I said that if they could get reverse swing in the 26th, 27th, 28th over then theyre doing something different from what everyone else does, de Villiers told News Corp.We actually said to our cameramen go out have a look boys. Theyre using something. They searched for an hour and a half until they saw something and then they started following Bancroft and they actually caught him out at the end. Its impossible for the ball to get altered like that on cricket wickets where we knew there was grass on, not a Pakistani wicket where theres cracks every centimetre. Surprisingly enough, the Aussies too had their own suspicions about South Africas tactics. One Australian player is believed to have told a commentator during the Durban Test: How the **** could they get the ball to reverse swing after 18 overs yesterday? That seems to have heightened Australias desperation to stay on pace with South Africa in the quest for reverse swing.Ball tampering scandal: Steve Smith shouldnt have involved the youngster, thats upsetting Australian fansBancroft, the repeat offenderEngland fast bowler Stuart Broad has expressed reservations when Steve Smith said the ball-tampering controversy was a one-off incident. I heard Steve Smith say it was the first time they have tried it, he said. Broad questioned Australias tactics in the recently concluded Ashes series from where footage has emerged of Bancroft pouring sugar into his pocket, before taking the field in the fifth Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The sugar, many believe, is used to rough up one side of the ball, which would aid reverse swing. Broad questioned Australias motives and said: If you look at the Ashes series weve just played, they reverse swung the ball in nearly all of those Test matches, sometimes in conditions where you wouldnt expect the ball to reverse, Broad said.MUST WATCH | Australians laugh at themselves in We cheat at cricket videoStarc, Hazlewood approach cricketers associationApart from Steve Smith and David Warner, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood form the leadership group, which took the decision to get Cameron Bancroft to tamper the ball in the Cape Town Test. However, its believed that both Starc and Hazlewood are livid at being linked to the ongoing scandal. They have got in touch with the Australian Cricketers Association hoping that they will help Cricket Australia clarify their lack of involvement.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"
5aeaab789855b7179ad6d486,Bitter news for 2.5 million BPL families in Rajasthan: No more PDS sugar for th...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/no-pds-sugar-for-2-5-bpl-families-in-rajasthan/story-1gWavSaKhwWRmPKz7sLHdJ.html,2018-01-04,"This is one decision that has left a bitter taste in the mouth of 25 lakh below poverty line (BPL) families in Rajasthan. The Vasundhara Raje government has decided to stop distributing sugar to the BPL families under the pubic distribution system (PDS).Deputy Commissioner in state food and civil supplies department, Anju Rajpal, issued a directive to all the district supply officers on December 22, 2017 asking them to stop providing subsidized sugar to the BPL families.The decision has affected 25 lakh families  more than 1.26 lakh in Barmer district alone.As per the officials, the move is in line with the Union governments decision of not providing 18.50 per kg subsidy on sugar to states for selling it via ration shops from next fiscal. Under the existing scheme, states used to purchase sugar from open market at wholesale rate to be distributed through PDS shops at a subsidised rate of  13.50 per kg.The Centre used to give a subsidy of  18.50 per kg to the states. While presenting the Union Budget 2017-18, the government had allocated only  200 crore to clear pending claims under the PDS sugar subsidy scheme.The sugar subsidy, the Centre had said, was discontinued in view of all states rolling out the Food Law, under which there is no distinction of categories of beneficiaries as BPL.Till March 2017, the Rajasthan was providing 500gm sugar to each member of BPL family under PDS. No subsidised sugar was sold from the PDS shops in the ongoing fiscal. The state government had earlier decided to clear the pending distribution of PDS sugar from April till December  on quarterly basis. However, even before the same could be started, the new directive has been issued.As per the new directive, only Antyodaya families  the poorest among the poor would get subsidized sugar. The directive also clarifies that nearly 6.76 lakh Antyodaya families in state can now procure sugar at  24.50 per kg from PDS shops.Incidentally, before the Union Budget was presented last year, Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan had written to finance minister Arun Jaitley urging him not to discontinue the subsidy scheme entirely and had proposed continuance of it for at least Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families.Earlier, Centre had sounded out states that it would withdraw subsidy on sugar from next fiscal and they would have to bear the entire cost for selling the sweetener at a cheaper rates.Criticizing the move, Opposition Congress alleged that it was a suit-boot wali sarkar in the state and it always takes anti-poor decisions and betrays them. Congress district vice-president Yagyadutt Joshi said the decision will put an additional financial burden on the poor. The government should withdraw such anti-poor decisions, he demanded."

(Express Photo by Praveen Khanna) The decision has come at a time of sharp increase in sugarcane cultivation and decline in cereals, pulses and oilseeds. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)The Maharashtra government has decided to push a crop diversification model to create a better mechanism for demand and supply and higher renumeration for small and marginal farmers across state. The decision has come at a time of sharp increase in sugarcane cultivation and decline in cereals, pulses and oilseeds.Highly-placed sources in the state government said, The crop diversification model is region- wise taking into account the soil health and climate conditions that will evolve in a time-bound manner. This has become necessary along with the larger plans of providing minimum support price and better water management for sustainable agriculture.The increasing trend among farmers to revert to sugarcane cultivation with water availability, following the success of the Jalyukta Shivar, has the administration worried as it is likely to lead to a slump in sugar prices in the domestic market at a time when the international market is sugar sector is not upbeat.The Maharashtra Economic Survey, 2017, says that sugarcane production is expected to increase by 25 per cent over the previous year while the production of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cotton is expected to decrease by four per cent, 46 per cent, 15 percent and 44 per cent, respectively. Kharif sowing was on 150.45 lakh hectares.An official in the department of the agriculture ministry said: Ideally, it is our effort to ensure that sugarcane production in the state should not exceed 9 lakh hectares. It is essentially a western Maharashtra crop where water is surplus. But its growth in Marathwada and parts of North Maharashtra is a reality. Government data says that in the last three years, 4.25 lakh water conservation works completed led to additional water storage of 16.82 lakh TMC.Sugar Federation Association president Dilip Walse Patil, while expressing concern over a possible slump in sugar prices, said: Farmers are drawn to sugarcane as it brings an assured price to the farmers. While seeking government intervention, including subsides, he warned: The mismatch between increased sugarcane production and decline in finished sugar product will make the sector economically unviable.An official in the government said: While there is a rising demand across sectors for higher subsidies in the agriculture sector, experts believe farmers cannot be left to volatile market conditions that is worsened by erratic climate changes. The crop diversification model is an attempt to bring credible alternative farming and assured production and income.Maharashtra Agriculture Price Committee chairman Pasha Patel said: In drought-hit Marathwada, if we have to tackle the small and marginal farmers, we have to push the cultivation of jowar and bajra (cereals). Now, low cost cereals with less water can become financially viable for farmers if we have industrial support.A secretary in agriculture department said: The farmers determine the crops based on the base price of the previous year. There is no stability market index in the agriculture sector. State Farmers Task Force chairman Kishore Tiwari said: The government will have to fix a financial model to ensure higher returns. Whether it relates to sugarcane cultivators or cotton, the government will have to step in to tackle the problems.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The move may boost private developers confidence.In a landmark judgment, the UPERC on Friday set aside the UPPCLs decision to exit from the power purchase agreements with regard to the BEPLs five thermal plants.The commission, however, ordered reduction of the tariff by around 50 paise per unit. The UPPCL will now purchase electricity from these five plants at this reduced rate of around Rs 7.13 per unit.However, the regulator has not allowed it the fixed and variable cost as well as the return of equity during the period when the plants were closed.The commission observed if bilateral contracts were allowed to be terminated at the sweet will of the government or the purchaser or seller, the entire trade and industry structure would collapse. If such an uncertainty is allowed to prevail, nobody will come for investment in industry, UPERC chairman SK Agrawal said in the order.The commission directed BEPL to resume the operation of all the five plants within seven days of receipt of the order.The BEPL had signed five PPAs with UPPCL to set up as many thermal power plants of 90 megawatt each at its five sugar mills in Barkhera, Khambarkhera, Utraula, Kundarkhi and Maqsoodpur to supply power to the state-owned distribution companies for 25 years.The plants became operational in March-April 2012 with the UPPCL, on behalf of the discoms, having purchased 11,414 million units of electricity worth over Rs 8,000 crore till termination of the PPAs.In a sudden move on August 8 last year, the UPPCL issued an exit notice to the BEPL stating that the average rate of power available from the latters plants was Rs 7.63 per unit which, it said, was among the highest. The corporation said this rate went against the governments policy of making affordable power available to consumers under the power for all vision.The BEPL moved the high court against the unilateral exit notice. On the courts advice, the company filed a petition in the UPERC for relief.Having heard a series of arguments and counter arguments from both the sides, the commission in its final order held that the PPAs signed on December 10, 2010 between the two parties had no provision allowing a unilateral exit from the contract. The regulators final order was supported by several Supreme Court rulings.The respondents (UPPCL) decision for exiting from the contract without giving the petitioner the opportunity of being heard cannot be legally justified and hence the five purchase agreements related to five different plants will be treated to have existed in continuity, the commission said in its judgment.The commission ruled that petitioner (Bajaj) will not be entitled to return of equity for the period from the date of exit notice and to the date of commissions order. It said the UPPCL will be entitled to deduct the fixed charges for the intervening period.Terming the order as a win-win situation for both the parties, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma demanded that the commission pass a supplementary order to ensure that the benefit of the tariff reduction must pass on to consumers.The tariff reduction should also come into effective retrospectively since the date of signing of the PPAs, he demanded."

Photo: MintMumbai: Ahead of the start of earnings season, domestic rating agency Crisil on Wednesday said it expects India companiess revenue growth to hit a five-year high of 9% for the October-December 2017 period.However, profits will continue to contract, primarily due to the rising commodity prices, the note by its research wing said. The aggregate topline of companies in key sectors will grow 9% over same period last year on higher realisations in steel, aluminium, cement and crude oil-linked sectors, and a pick-up in consumption-driven sectors such as auto and aviation, its research wing said.The revenue growth, which comes after a broadbased improvement in the preceding second quarter that was taken as a prelude to a cyclical upturn, is ahead of inflation by a meaningful margin now, Crisil Ratings senior director Prasad Koparkar said. He added for FY18, it expects a revenue increase of 8-9% for the listed companies.The research wing disclosed that its estimate is for companies across key sectors, representing 70% of the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies. Export linked sectors such as information technology and pharmaceuticals will disappoint, along with telecom where the incumbents are forced to slash tariffs due to aggressive play by the newcomer Reliance Jio.With the goods and services tax (GST)-related worries abating and trade channels reverting to normalcy, the consumption linked sectors are expected to be the primary drivers of revenue growth for the second half of the fiscal. The consumption-linked sectors excluding telecom had reported a 15% revenue growth in the second quarter.For the first two quarters, companies have reported a revenue growth of 6% despite the impact of GST implementation, it said, adding that if not for the reverses in telecom, the revenue growth would have come at 10%.From a profitability perspective, there can be a contraction of up to 1.30% in the pre-tax profits. EBIDTA margin fell for 8 of 21 sectors in the second quarter of this fiscal, and we expect this trend to continue. A contraction of 1-1.30 per cent in aggregate EBIDTA margin in the third quarter would intensify pressures because theres little latitude to control cost amid rising commodity prices, its director Hetal Gandhi said.Telecom services, pharma, sugar and housing will see the sharpest fall in margins, it said, adding that had it not been for these, the overall pre-tax margins for key sectors would have declined by only 0.40% in the third quarter of the fiscal."

The industries emit PM2.5 above the prescribed limit of 150 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/Nm3) from the smoke stacks. Most of the 29 industries belong to chemical and pharmaceutical sectors.Under the Maharashtra Star Rating Programme for industrial PM emissions, 19 industries scored one star, while 10 got two stars. Industries that emit less than 150mg/Nm3 are given four and five stars.Exposure to high levels of PM fine harmful solid and liquid particles floating in the air with a diameter of 10 or 2.5 microns  leads to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and premature death.The initiative to rate industries in Maharahtra began last year and makes it possible to access data from approximately 20,000 industrial stack samples over multiple years based on which ratings will be accorded.The 50 industries in MMR were added to the programme on Thursday, which is a joint collaboration between the state pollution control board and researchers from Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard University, and the Tata Centre for Development.Read more: 55 of 77 coal plants in Maharashtra flouting pollution normsThe programme has been running successfully in several areas of the state and so far, both the industries and the public have shown keen and active interest, said P Anbalagan, honorary member secretary, MPCB.

The Centre will provide Rajasthan a mobile food-testing lab costing 30 lakh; this will have state-of-the-art facilities.Union health minister JP Nadda addressed health ministers on Tuesday during the conference that was also attended by health secretaries of all states and union territories.The mobile laboratory will be used for surveillance and creating awareness among people about adulteration in edible items. The lab can be taken to a place where there is a complaint about food items, so that testing can be done on the spot, Mathur said.The state has six food labs at Jaipur, Ajmer, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Alwar, and five more will be opened at Jalore, Churu, Bikaner, Banswara and Bharatpur, he said. The chief minister had announced the five new food labs in the 2015-16 budget.He said, Civil works of the new labs are almost complete, and the process of procurement of equipment and recruitment of manpower is under way.In October last year, the facility of testing heavy metals and pesticides in fruits, vegetables and food products has been added to the central food lab in Jaipur.Mathur said seven charters were announced at the conference. They include improving food standards, bringing food businesses under licensing and registration, popularising simple tests by consumers, reducing salt by 30% and sugar by 10% by 2022, participation in nutritious food campaigns, and training of regulatory and lab staff.He said 47,492 samples were collected from August 5, 2011 to November 30, 2017, of which 23362 were in high-risk category and 5598 were substandard and unsafe."

Edited excerpts:You have been talking a lot about the emergence of challenger brands in India to take on big entities in packaged consumer goods sector. How do you see this space in 2018? At what stage are the challenger brands right now, and how challenging will it be for them to scale and take on the big companies going forward?We are at the very start of the new brand movement in India. I classify new brands as, first, challenger brands; second, niche brands, and third, follower brands. Challenger brands compete with existing incumbents. Niche brands launch offerings in white spaces in the market. Follower brands follow the path of a leader or a successful challenger or niche brands. Sometimes, niche or challenger brands can become market leaders just like Sula (a wine maker) did over a 10-year period. There is a confluence of factorssome global and some localthat is driving the trend favouring new brands. Foremost is their ability to directly meet consumers new and ever-evolving demands.Consumer-inspired trends remain the driving force for the products and services offered by FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) start-ups. The new consumer is more individualistic, cares about provenance, wants to be engaged with the brand experience, likes better for-me products, demands personalization and wants to make a social impact. The Indian millennial consumer wants to support the new brand with a more relevant social message that communicates directly with him. Entrepreneurial agility and the ability to take risks, learn fast and maintain a steady flow of innovative product releases is essential and this cycle needs to be continuous.We have seen many new brands over the past decade. Some great examples doing this are Paper Boat, Chai Point, Raw Pressery, Epigamia, Spotted Cow Fromagerie, Veeba, Sleepy Owl, The Moms Co, Eazydiner, Fogg, Green Snack Co. and TGL Teas. We are at the beginning of the consumption S-Curve, as Indias per capita discretionary spending accelerates. The Indian consumer today is proudly Indian and wants to indulge in Ayurveda and Yoga, for example.Many trends are global and what works in the US and Europe may work in India. I expect to see more new brands launch in 2018 and beyond as they look to either address white spaces where there was no current offeringfor example, Epigamia launching Indias first Greek yogurt, or where they are offering a new value proposition, like Raw Presserys fresh cold press HPP (high pressure processing) juice challenging long-life UHT (ultra-high temperature processing) juices.We will also see a lot more focus on locally manufactured and sourced products. There is no need to buy imported Brie after you try Spotted Cows cheeses.Scaling will be a challenge. The product and manufacturing are usually the easiest part. The most difficult is distribution and marketing, especially if you enter a category where you are fighting against large MNCs (multinational companies) such as Unilever, P&G (Procter & Gamble Co.), Kelloggs, ITC and others. What is interesting in developed markets is that the FMCG majors have seen the impact of new brands.These new brands have taken material market share and have been unable to innovate in the manner the consumer expects. There has been a narrative that speaks about how MNCs have lost their way and struggle to connect with the next generation consumer. I think this has been overplayed and many of them have re-engineered their portfolios to target new growth areas. However, there is still a very strong trend among millennials to support the new underdog brands against the incumbent MNCs. Consumers want to support the new local start-ups.MNCs have started acquiring challenger brands and investing in programs alongside challenger brands. I have met senior executives at many of the large FMCG majors and they will be the first to admit it is difficult for them to create an environment that allows new brands to emerge. Their solution was to work with start-ups, whose growth rates were far better. Initiatives are very broad, from incubating new brands, investing in challenger brands and working with brands and allowing them to leverage the majors platform. Some have even started venture funds to invest in challenger brands or adjacencies. Examples include Unilever Ventures, Kelloggs new initiative Eighteen94 Capital, General Millss 301 Capital, and there are many more. However, corporate venturing is tough to do as it forces majors to do exactly what they have been conditioned not to.Indias food services sector is seeing the return of private equity (PE). What is your reading, considering that this space has seen a slew of deals in 2017? Was it because PE firms flush with capital were looking at increased avenues to deploy, leading to more deals?There has been an unprecedented interest in food services over the past six months. We have seen deals at Riyaaz Amlanis Impresario, Zorawar Kalras Massive Restaurants, Wow Momos, JSM, AD Singhs Olive, Theobrama and more. The food services market is very large and as GDP (gross domestic product) grows, we can expect per capita consumption on food services to grow more quickly. However, very few VCs have made money in food services in the last cycle. The industry is burdened with cumbersome regulation from food safety to licensing to ongoing harassment by local authorities that make operating and scaling food services businesses very difficult. I have backed Social, Burger King India, Suzette and Kitchen Garden and continue to believe in the long-term opportunity, but we need to see more done at the ground level to make it easier to operate.Investment side apart, what are the trends that will be shaping Indias food industry in 2018?India will follow most of the global trends. Some of these include traceability, clean label, provenance, better for me, plant-based foods and beverages, dairy alternatives, functional products, e.g. protein, calcium, probiotics, organic, natural, convenience, less or no sugar and the list goes on. Households no longer make one meal or share the same product for the whole family. For example, in the same household, some are vegetarian, some are focused on proteins and others want to eat organic. Same for personal care as they buy multiple types of toothpastes, creams and shampoos. The grocery basket needs to cater for all of them. This provides a large opportunity for new brands to create specific products for each consumer demand.Suddenly, there seems to be a lot of interest in consumer brands, compared with earlier when just a handful of investors were active in this space. But as more investors pile in, and as valuations increase, will it face same challenges as that of other sectors?Despite the FMCG sector being a very large and obvious sector for disruption, it has been generally ignored over the past decade by the investors, particularly at the venture stage. So I tend to ignore the macro data as the base is still very small. We have seen the success of new consumer brands over the past 5-10 years including Paper Boat, Bira, Sula, Veeba, Raw, Epigamia, ID Fresh, Patanjali and Vini. Many of them have created Rs100 crore businesses in a relatively short time and have seen real value creation. The early investors have seen very good exits and returns, which has made the sector more closely tracked by the others in the market. But it is a very tough sector to crack.Five years ago, there were a handful of early-stage venture capital funds looking at the non-tech consumer stage, including Saama, Sequoia, SAIF and DSG Consumer Partners. However, this is changing. Most investors are trend-followers and not trend-setters. They follow the herd. Today, most funds have a consumer strategy including many of the Indian and Silicon Valley funds. It is good to see recognition for the sector, but the consequence is valuation inflation where many seed and Series A deals are priced to perfection and do not appropriately price in the risk of such start-ups.We are now being ultra-cautious with new investments and being disciplined about what we pay. Fortunately, there are enough entrepreneurs who see the value funds like us bring and look beyond the highest valuation. The last two deals we announced and the next one, which we will announce in a few weeks, had multiple term-sheets and the entrepreneur elected to work with us despite competing offers at a significant premium. While I expect to see many more consumer start-ups, I also expect to see many more failures as too many competing, me-too firms emerge, fight for the same shelf space and often compete on price. It is Darwins evolution. At DSG Consumer Partners, we expect 30% of our seed stage investments to fail and not raise Series A. This must be priced into the seed round. This is where we are seeing unrealistic expectations. Our seed rounds have been priced at $1-2 million pre-money over the past 5 years, but we are seeing this get towards $5 million, which is dangerous.For challenger brands, who have one or a few successful products, how tough will it be to move up the value chain and expand their product offering and get customers attracted to a slew of products from that brand? How tough and costly will innovation become as they look towards the next stage of growth?India is very early in the cycle. Most challenger or niche brands are in their first inningsso have one or a few successful products. Think about Paper Boat, Bira, Veeba, Raw and even Sula. You create, you launch and you establish yourself. This is very difficult. If you succeed, you make it to the second innings. Now is when you evolve from a niche play to a real challenger brand. You need to think about your assets, your strengths and how to leverage them. How do you maintain that challenger or niche position and grow your portfolio? This may mean new products, new geographies, new brands or a combination of the three. Let us take Sula wines. It launched in the market in 2000 as a niche brand. By 2004, it was a challenger brand against Indage, Grover and Four Seasons. Today, Sula is the market leader. What next? It has decided to leverage its strength in grape spirit to enter the spirits market with brandy and whisky under the Janus and Eclipse brands. Expect to see more of this from the top decile of successful next-generation brands... Innovation is not only about costs. There are many levels of innovationproduct, business model, packaging and more. Each of them will innovate at their own level and it will be a function of what is happening in their sector and their competitors. It is not as costly as you may think. As these companies scale, their ambitions will become bigger and so will the cost of entering and playing in each market. The upside is huge and there is a lot to play for. You will see many of these next-generation companies get sold for over Rs1,000-4,000 crore."

Venkatesh Kulkarni came from India to the United States where he met Sri's mother Margaret. The family moved to Houston in 1980, where Margaret worked for oil company Exxon and Venkatesh taught at Rice University.Sri graduated from the University of Texas Plan II Honors program. After completion of his college, Sri was commissioned as a Foreign Service Officer by Secretary of State Colin Powell and served his country for 14 years during which he toured Iraq, Israel, Russia, Taiwan, and Jamaica.In 2015, Sri accepted a Pearson Fellowship to serve as a foreign policy and defence adviser on Capitol Hill, assisting Senator Kirsten Gillibrand with her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee.In 2017, Sri completed a mid-career Master's Degree in Public Administration from Harvard's Kennedy School. Sri and a Republican colleague founded a bipartisan initiative called ""Breaking Bread,"" which aims to ""reduce the partisan hostility in our society"", that has been repeated in several states.""The greatest danger to our country right now is not a foreign power, but the internal divisions in our society,"" Sri said.""That is why I am coming home to Texas to serve. I know firsthand that to push back the tide of fear, we must recognise the sources which are fanning the flames of resentment and defuse them, by offering a positive vision for the future that all groups can believe in,"" he said.Sri exuded confidence that with people's support he could be a strong voice in Congress for returning to real Texas values, such as truth, fairness, generosity towards others, and respect for the dignity of the individual.""With your help, we can make America decent again,"" he said.Nine candidates have filed for the US Representative District 22 seat that Olson has held since 2008. Olson will face Danny Nguyen-R, Eric Zmrhal-R and James Green-R in the March 2018 Republican primary.Other than Sri, Democrats who filed for the position include Letitia Plummer, Margarita Ruiz Johnson, Steve Brown and Mark Gibson.The 2018 primary election will be held on March 6, with the general election following on November 6."

I called up Rajasthan chief minister (Vasundhara Raje) and home minister (Gulabchand Kataria) but they denied their police had come to Gujarat to arrest me. This raised more suspicion and I switched off my mobile phones,"" he said.Togadia, a 'Z plus' category protectee, and one of the most vocal Muslim baiters in organisations linked to the RSS, said he then contacted his lawyers in Rajasthan to get the warrant against him issued in an old case cancelled.On being told that it cannot be done, Togadia said he decided to take a flight to Jaipur and appear before the court in Gangapur. He claimed when he was on way to the airport on an auto-rickshaw, he felt dizzy, and asked the driver to take him to a hospital. Togadia claimed he then fell unsconscious, and on regaining consciousness, found himself in a hospital.A team of Rajasthan Police had approached their Gujarat counterparts for help to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC, but could not find him at his residence.""I do not fear death, I do not fear encounter. But I had to protect myself while following the law of the land,"" he said.""I have been raising my voice for Hindus. I am raising issues like Ram temple, national law to ban cow slaughter, resettlement of Kashmiri Hindus in that state, giving farmers fair price for their crops. But an attempt is being made to silence my voice,"" he said.Speaking to reporters, Joint Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, J K Bhatt said investigation revealed that Togadia was conscious -- contrary to his account that he became uunconscious -- on his way to airport. He reached a spot near the airport in a car owned by his aide Ghanshyam Charandas, who then called a '108' ambulance.""Z-plus is one of the best security cover, as you get a pilot vehicle, a bulletproof vehicle and inspector-level armed personnel having AK-47 rifles. So it is nearly impossible to get killed in an encounter. It (Togadia's apprehension) is just a figment of imagination,"" Bhatt said.The Congress, a known ideological foe of the BJP-RSS, and its Gujarat ally Hardik Patel rushed to the Chandramani Hospital to inquire after Togadia's condition.""The ruling dispensations in Rajasthan and Gujarat have engaged in fake encounters even earlier. Togadia's apprehension is not without a reason,"" senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said.""An internal wrestling is going on in the BJP where attempts are being made to finish off the opponents,""Modhwadia said, and sought an ""independent and courtmonitored"" probe into the allegations levelled by Togadia, who was marginalised in Gujarat's Hindutva politics after Narendra Modi became the chief minister in 2002.Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel also met Togadia separately. Patel, who backed the Congress in the recent Assembly elections in Gujarat, pointed fingers at Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah over claims made by Togadia.""Rights of common people are being snatched away. We (he and Togadia) can have different 'mat' (ideology) but our 'mann' (heart) is one. We all know what kind of conspiracies are being hatched by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. I don't know about Hindus, but a leader of a Hindu organisation is definitely in danger now,"" he said.Though the BJP did not react to Togadia's claims, veteran RSS leader M G Vaidya said only the VHP leader can reveal who was behind the alletged plot to eliminate him.""Togadia has said he will provide evidence (to show who was behind the conspiracy). We should wait till then,"" Vaidya said in Nagpur.""Only Togadia can reveal who was behind the conspiracy to kill him,"" Vaidya said, wondering how someone with Z-plus security can be eliminated in an encounter."

(Source: Wikimedia Commons) Flower markets see large crowds ahead of the festival. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)AHEAD of Gudi Padwa on Sunday, which marks the beginning of the Hindu new year in Maharashtra, consumers thronged the markets in Dadar and Girgaum to purchase festive items including organic jaggery and the decorative Gudi, a silver or copper kalash propped up on a wooden stick and adorned with a new piece of cloth or a saree. Neem leaves and garlands of batashe (a hard, white sweet made of sugar syrup) also flew off the shelves across central Mumbai and the suburbs.Employee of a small jaggery shop in Dadar, Jagdish Singh (25), says there is greater demand for organic jaggery, even though its costly. Its not refined, and comes fresh from Kolhapur. People have newly developed a liking towards it, he said. While regular, refined jaggery is sold at roughly Rs 64-68 per kilo, the organic jaggery is sold at Rs 104 per kilo. Dnyaneshwar Shinde (50), owner of the store in Dadar, said the demand for jaggery went up dramatically during Holi, and before Gudi Padwa. The flower market in Dadar also saw large crowds as sale of marigold flowers spiked, the sign of a festival just around the corner.During this time around Gudi Padwa, we get a high demand for yellow and orange marigold flowers, said Ramesh Nawde (49), a flower vendor at Dadar market. I sold about 500 kg of orange or yellow marigold just today. Many buy them for temples or making torans (garlands) with mango leaves. On an average, the yellow and orange marigold varieties are priced about Rs. 20-40 per kilo. Some much larger marigold were going for Rs 60.Mangala Jantarwagh (50), a regular neem leaves seller, said she hiked prices ahead of Gudi Pada. As there is always a steady demand for neem, I sell it for Rs. 5-7, but during days before Gudi Padwa I sell it for Rs 10 per bundle to capitalise on the high demand. People use neem in their prasad, and add flowers too. The other items popular among regular buyers are chafa flowers (Rs 20 per pack) and dauna leaves (Rs 10 per bundle). Sunita and Bharti Manve, are a mother-daughter duo who travel to Ratnagiri to celebrate Gudi Padwa with their extended family.We make gudi using a red cloth, and even tie a string of neem leaves. We also make a sweet using grated coconut and tulsi leaves. After the pooja of the gudi, we feed the sweet and neem to each other. We visit Dadar market before the festival to purchase the material.Shrikhand and Basundi are traditional Gudi Padwa favourites. Neem leaves or their various forms like chutneys or juices are also part of the celebration. The new year is also the harbinger of spring. Neem is traditionally known to have medicinal properties like blood purification and protection against skin ailments. Sapna Gandhe (35) bought roughly 5-6 kg of yellow and orange marigolds. Its our New Year, so we as a family sit and collectively make torans to hang at our entrances. We also use them in pooja as offerings.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

However, this year, Goods and Service Tax (GST) has impacted the cost of sweets with a 7 per cent increase in prices, say sweet sellers. But this has not impacted the sales, which have gone up when compared to last year. Most of the sweet shops in the city are dealing mainly in Til ka ladoo, pheni, plain and malai Ghewar.The sweet shops come under the 5 per cent GST slab whereas the raw materials used for making sweets fall under different tax brackets, which results in an increase in the price of a particular sweet, say sweet makers. The cost has gone up by 7 to 8 per cent for some Sankranti sweets but the sale is going on as usual since its a festive occasion and people dont bother about the costs of sweet. We had very low sales last year due to demonetisation but this year the sales have gone up, said Ram Sankhla, owner, Sri Balaji Mithai Bhandar, Raj Bhawan Road.Raw milk is a zero per cent GST rated product, but milk and cream, concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetener, including skimmed milk powder, attract 5 per cent GST. The sales are normal so far and there are no huge crowds as this is just a two-day festival and is celebrated locally and people buy sweets only to gift others, said Suresh Sankhla, owner, Bandhan sweets, Raj Bhavan Road. The costs have gone up slightly but that has not affected the sales. We have decided to bear the increased costs as its not much. We have had bulk orders coming in so we have to give discounts, these are regular customers and we cant push up the price as they may lose out to a competitor, said Ravi Sharma, manager at Tiwari Brothers sweet shop, Khairatabad."

Yet, nothing much is being done to improve its condition.A visit to the emergency of GMCH-32  citys tertiary care hospital  reveals that it is one of the most disorganised, unhygienic and chaotic hospital when compared to other government hospitals.Since its inception in 1996-97, the number of beds have remained the same. 12 in medicine, 7 in surgery, 6 in orthopaedics, 21 in gynaecology, 14 in paediatrics means mere 60 beds.With only 60 beds in the Emergency, GMCH-32 caters to patients from Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and other states. At any given point, there are at least 350 patients admitted in the emergency, yet the administration has not improved the infrastructure.20 resident doctors for more than 300 patientsFurther, there are hardly four resident doctors. One senior resident and two-three junior resident doctors in each department. It means, there are roughly 20 resident doctors to look after over 300 patients in the emergency.Consultants are on call during the night and during the day time, they only pay visits.On Thursday, 350 patients were examined at the emergency, out of which 50 were medico-legal cases. During epidemic, the number increases to 500 also, said Dr Harish Dasari, chairperson, Emergency services, GMCH-32.In 2017, over 1.33 lakh patients were examined at the Emergency, out of which over 99,000 were new, over 36,000 were revisits and over 18,000 were medico-legal cases.The hospitals emergency does not have a triage system. There is only one emergency medical officer at the entrance whose main focus is to deal with medico-legal cases and she refers all other patients to different departments after a quick examination.Ideally, there should be a triage system, wherein a doctor assess patients severity of injury or illness within a short time, assign priorities, and transfer each patient to the appropriate place for treatment.The triage system has not come up yet. We set up triage during disaster situations like at the time of Ram Rahim verdict and other such incidents, said Dr Dasari.Inside ward number 21, there is an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) just next to gents toilet and the area stinks. Not only this, critically sick patients can be seen lying outside the toilets in stinking conditions. (Keshav Singh/HT)All at sea hereEnter the Emergency and you will find patients lying everywhere on trolleys, not neatly organised, though. There is no place for attendants to sit, they are either sitting on the floor or spend the day by standing next to a trolley.Enter ward number 21, medicine emergency and its all chaotic here. Trolleys are placed in a haphazard manner, one patient is lying in one corner and another one is on the other side. There is no symmetry, when compared with Hall A of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), which has less space, more trolleys but is far better organised.Inside ward number 21, there is an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) just next to gents toilet and the area stinks. Not only this, critically sick patients can be seen lying outside the toilets in stinking conditions.Similar is the situation in other wards. The hygiene is quite poor in the emergency; you can see rats running around and the floors are filthy.The Emergency was constructed for a particular number of patients but the patient load has increased manifold. This is leading to delay in treatment, sub-optimal treatment and chances of error increases.Harrowing time for patients, kinSher Singh, husband of Karamjeet from Hallomajra, said, My wife is diabetic and after she developed some complication in her foot. We rushed her to GMCH-32. The doctors cut her thumb on February 21. Then after five to six days, they cut her foot. This week they said there is a need to cut her leg.Afraid, he took her wife to PGIMER emergency. I brought her to PGIMER. There doctors said that so far there is no need to cut her leg. They will conduct ultrasound and decide the course of treatment. There they conducted no tests, said Sher Singh. The condition is quite bad in GMCH-32 Emergency. They could not even control my wifes rising blood sugar levels, which PGI doctors controlled in a day. I will never visit that hospital, he said.Deshraj Saini, a labourer in a steel factory from Jagadhri, is having a tough time at the Emergency. He brought his 23-year-old son, a TB patient, here on Thursday evening but no one is looking after him. Last evening, doctors saw his X-ray and prescribed medicine but there is no relief from pain. Since morning, no doctor has examined him and he is writhing in pain. I do not know what to do.Being a TB patient, he wasnt kept in a separate ward but with other critically ill patients.Karan, son of Shammi Devi, shares, I have to make 10-15 rounds and then a nurse or doctor examines my mother. The patient care is quite bad here.But there are some who are satisfied with the treatment. Jaswinder Kaur, wife of Sapinder Singh, said, I brought my husband to the Emergency three days ago and he is being looked after by the doctors. Since morning, one doctor and nurse has seen him.Two other attendants voiced satisfaction with the treatment provided inside the Emergency.May give session to docs, nurses on how to behave with patientsDr Ravi Gupta, medical superitendent, GMCH-32, said, At any given point of time one or two complaints are registered with the hospital administration by the patients or their attendants against the staff. Last week, three complaints were registered. The common complaint is that either the treatment is delayed or improper treatment was given. We investigate every complaint and majority of times they are incorrect.We may start orientation session for doctors and nurses wherein they are informed how to behave with patients and their attendants. Ideally, Medical Council of India (MCI) should introduce some non-medical subjects to improve communication skills of the doctors, he said.Medical superintendent on:Overcrowding is a major problem. The Emergency was constructed for a particular number of patients but the patient load has increased manifold. This is leading to delay in treatment, sub-optimal treatment and chances of error increases. The solution is that the other state governments should have same level of health care so that at least routine cases are not send to city hospitals.Emergency medical officer is a generalist, who sends all the patients to different departments  surgery, medicine, orthopaedics, where the residents of respective specialities are managing patients. Many a times, a patient referred by EMO can be treated by EMO itself, in this way there would be less pressure on the departments. The solution is the development of department of emergency medicine, with round-the-clock availability of residents of emergency medical officer who will stabilise or treat many patients and send them back from entrance itself."

5aeab80b9855b73f522c27bc,"Insomnia, a Symptom and a Disease Risk",https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/insomnia-a-symptom-and-a-disease-risk/story-89SAd9I7Tr6kNaAjti4XHJ.html,2018-03-18,"Theres a genetic link between insomnia and psychiatric disorders and metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. Expanding on previous twin and genome-wide association research showing sleep disorders may be inherited, US researchers have identified specific genes that cause sleep problems and concluded that depression is partially heritable. The study was published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry this week.Sleeplessness is often a symptom caused by several unrelated and diverse conditions, ranging from psychological triggers like anxiety and depression, to physical ailments like asthma, Parkinsons and chronic pain. This makes it imperative for people with insomnia to be screened for the underlying medical cause so it can be treated.If the cause for disrupted sleep is simply poor sleep hygiene, not using bright lighting in the bedroom, choosing a quiet room to sleep in, and shunning back-lit screens -- such as smartphones, ipads, TVs and laptops -- at bedtime can improve sleep.The lack of sleep initially causes irritability, impairs working memory, lowers attention and causes poor motor function. Chronic deprivation not only aggravates the existing condition that is causing the sleeplessness, but also causes new health problems, such as weight gain, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, visceral fat deposition, and dyslipidemia (high blood facts such as bad LDL cholesterol and trigycerides).Among the common problems causing chronic sleep loss are:Weight gainSleeplessness lowers growth hormone secretion that is linked to weight gain, according to the US National Sleep Foundation. Studies have shown a link between short sleep duration and increased body weight, suggesting that sleep duration may be an important regulator of body weight and metabolic and endocrine function.Sleep deprivation affects the hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism. A study at the University of Chicago some years ago found that people who slept four hours a night for two nights had an 18 percent decrease in levels of appetite-suppressing hormone leptin, and a 28 percent increase in the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. This fall and rise led to a 24 percent increase in appetite, along with higher cravings for sweets, salty foods, and starchy foods, such as breads and pasta, found the study.DiabetesSleep deprivation causes eta-cell dysfunction and increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which leads to worsening glycaemic control in people with diabetes, according to the International Textbook of Diabetes Mellitus, 4th edition.It works both ways. People with diabetes have poor sleep quality measured as trouble falling asleep and sleeping for a shorter duration, especially if theu have poorly controlled sugar levels, according to a study published in January in the journal PLOS One . The study found that obstructive sleep apnea, a major cause of disrupted sleep, also leads to poorer glycaemic control (both HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose) and glycaemic variability in people with diabetes after adjustments for several confounders, such as age, sex, race, weight, number of diabetes medications, level of exercise, years of diabetes and total sleep time.Heart DiseaseWith mounting evidence linking insomnia to hypertension, heart attacks and death, some experts have argued that sleep disturbances be included as the tenth potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, according to the American College of Cardiology.Sleeplessness was linked with higher risk of developing heart disease over 10 years among 86,329 postmenopausal women, revealed the US National Institutes of Health Womens Health Initiative. Another study of 44,080 men and women diagnosed with insomnia in Taiwan had higher incidence of stroke and heart attacks compared to controls a decade later.Blood pressure usually falls during the sleep cycle and interrupted sleep adversely affects this normal decline, leading to hypertension and heart disease. Sleeping for less than six hours is a risk for high blood pressure.Chronic sleeplessness leads to a systemic inflammatory state, measured by a rise in inflammation markers, such as cytokines, C-reactive proteins and Interleukin-6, both of which raise risk of heart disease.DepressionDisturbed sleep is a key symptom of depression, with roughly three in four people with diagnosed depression having insomnia, according to a study published in the journal Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience. Over time, it worsens symptoms of depression, aggravating feelings of low energy, social withdrawal and isolation, feelings of sadness or hopelessness.Like all other disorders, nipping the problem in the bud can prevent acute episodes  say, triggered by anxiety or emotional distressinto turning chronic. People with insomnia are fatigued and less to exercise and more likely to choose unhealthy foods, which feeds the cycle of depression."

The President is in excellent health and I look forward to briefing some of the details on Tuesday."" Trump spent about three hours at the medical facility in Bethesda, Maryland, outside Washington, for the Friday afternoon checkup, his first as president, before departing for Florida for the weekend.The fairly routine exam for previous presidents has taken on outsized importance in the age of Trump, given the tone of some of his tweets, comments attributed to some of his close advisers and Trump's recent slurring of words on national TV.Some of the comments were published in a new book about Trump's first year, ""Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House"" by Michael Wolff, which White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has denounced as ""complete fantasy"" for portraying her 71-year-old boss as undisciplined and in over his head as president.Trump himself has pushed back hard against any suggestion that he's mentally unfit, declaring himself ""a very stable genius."" He told reporters on Thursday that he expected the exam ""to go very well. I'll be very surprised if it doesn't.""The examination lasted several hours and measured things like Trump's blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, heart rate and weight. The White House did not provide specific results of those tests. Jackson, who also provided care for President Barack Obama and became a White House physician in 2006, is expected to provide a detailed readout of the exam on Tuesday and answer questions from reporters.But conclusions about Trump's mental acuity were not expected. The White House said Trump would not undergo a psychiatric exam. Officials did not address a different type of screening: assessments of cognitive status that examine neurologic functions including memory. Cognitive assessments aren't routine in standard physicals, though they recently became covered in Medicare's annual wellness visits for seniors.While the exams are not mandatory, modern presidents typically undergo them regularly and release a doctor's report declaring they are ""fit for duty.""Two months before the November 2016 election, Trump released a five-paragraph letter from his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, who concluded that Trump ""is in excellent physical health."" A year earlier, Bornstein said in a December 2015 letter: ""If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.""The 2016 letter put Trump's blood pressure and cholesterol measurements in the healthy range, though he uses a cholesterol-lowering statin medication. His EKG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and blood sugar were normal.The 6-foot-3 Trump weighed 236 pounds (107 kilograms), and his body mass index, or BMI, of 29.5 put him in the category of being overweight for his height.Trump takes Crestor for his cholesterol, a low-dose aspirin for heart attack prevention, Propecia to treat male-pattern baldness and antibiotics for rosacea. The doctor's 2016 letter stated that Trump's testosterone level, 441.6, was in the normal range, as were his PSA reading for prostate abnormalities and tests of his liver and thyroid.Trump was 70 when he took office on Jan. 20, 2017, making him the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office.How much of Trump's health information is released to the public is up to the president, but Sanders said she expects the White House to release the same kind of details past presidents have made public.Obama's three medical reports included sections on vital statistics; physical exam by system, such as eyes, pulmonary and gastrointestinal; lab results; his past medical and surgical history; his social history; and medications, among others.Trump has said he gets most of his exercise playing golf. The American Heart Association has said the best types of exercise increase the heart rate and make a person breathe heavily, but that activities like golf don't provide as much cardiovascular benefit since they don't require much extra effort. The association suggests players walk the golf course instead of renting a golf cart. Trump drives a cart from hole to hole.Obama played basketball, lifted weights, worked out on an elliptical machine or treadmill and played golf. George W. Bush traded running for mountain biking to preserve his knees. Bill Clinton was a runner who installed a jogging track at the White House. He also played golf and indulged in Big Macs.Trump likes fast food, too, along with well-done steaks, chocolate cake and double scoops of vanilla ice cream. He reportedly downs 12 Diet Cokes a day. In their recent book, ""Let Trump Be Trump,"" former top campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie described the four major food groups on Trump's campaign plane as ""McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza and Diet Coke."""

As with all Indian festivals, celebrations of Sankranti is never complete without lip-smacking snacks and sweets served in the family homes.While the list of delicacies prepared in different regions of the Telugu states during this festival is quite long, a few of them are popular across quite a few districts. Flour of freshly harvested rice, jaggery and sesame or til seeds are important ingredients which go into the preparation of most of these. One of the most sought after snacks prepared during the festival is ariselu, a flattened roti-shaped sweet made of soaked rice flour and jaggery which is crusted with sesame seeds and fried in ghee or oil.Then there is sakinalu, a traditional snack of Telangana region, a concentric circular savoury made of rice flour and fried in oil. Sesame seeds and carom are also added to the dough to provide taste to the crunchy snack.Appalu and murukulu are some other snacks for the festival, which are also made from rice flour. Nuvvula laddu, a popular sweet prepared with sesame seeds, nuts and jaggery is popular in Telangana as well as neighbouring Maharashtra.A speciality of the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh is pootharekulu, a sweet which resembles folded paper. The sweet is made from a special rice batter, ghee and sugar or jaggery. Other regions have their favourites too. Bandar laddu, a sweet made from besan and ghee originates from Machlipatnam while the layered madatha kaja hails from Kakinada and Tapeswaram.One place in Hyderabad that can be visited for the entire range of Sankranti delicacies is Vellanki Foods, which is around for 30 years and has four branches in different parts of the city.According to Vijitha Vellanki, one of the owners, ariselu, nuvvula laddu and sakinalu make for bumper sale during the festival. Apart from these they also make some special dishes like poornalu and chakra pongali only for this special period. One of their signature sweets is kajjikayulu or garijalu, a fried sweet similar to gujiya of North India. It has a crunchy top but as you bite inside the sweet filling of rawa, cashewnut and jaggery is overwhelming. Vellanki Foods also has an online portal through which you can order their Sankranti delicacies from the comfort of your home.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"
5aeab8f19855b73f522c2855,Diabetes Debate: Do I Need Tight Glycemic Control?,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/diabetes-debate-do-i-need-tight-glycemic-control/story-USOzs6KGs3hIod6Cw2JU2H.html,2018-03-10,"A storm is brewing within the global medical community, over new recommendations by the American College of Physicians. The ACP is asking clinicians to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes less aggressively, recommending that they personalise goals for glucose control based on the patients preferences, general health and life expectancy, the benefits and harms of drug therapy, the treatment burden, and the costs of care.The ACP targets a Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c is a test that represents blood glucose control over the preceding three months) of 7% to 8%, against the current recommendation of below 6.5%. It asks clinicians to deintensify drug therapy in patients with HbA1c levels of less than 6.5%.The new guidelines also advise clinicians to avoid targeting an HbA1c level in people with a life expectancy of less than 10 years due to advanced age (80 or older), residence in a nursing home, or chronic conditions such as dementia, cancer, end-stage kidney disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure, because in such cases the harms of aggressive treatment outweigh the benefits.The ACPs recommendations are drawing flak from other international medical associations. While all existing guidelines stress the need for individualised care, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (ACE) recommend an HbA1c level of less than 6.5% for non-pregnant adults, while the UKs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence sets a target of less than 6.5% for people whose blood glucose levels can be managed with diet and lifestyle and a single drug. The US Department of Veterans Affairs sets a target of 6% to 7% for those with a life expectancy between 10 and 15 years.Hitting out at the ACPs new norms, the American Diabetes Association in a statement said individualization of targets is the key factor, and by lumping most people with type 2 diabetes into a 7-8% target range, ACPs new guidance may cause potential harm to those who may safely benefit from lower evidence-based targets. The ACE went a step ahead, calling the ACP recommendations absolutely wrong and regressive and a gross neglect of data and an overabundance of evidence to show that lover HbA1C is better.BACK HOMEClinicians in India are in favour of tighter targets for glycemic control because Indians develop Type 2 diabetes at a younger age and the disease is often diagnosed late, sometimes after complications have set in.India is home to 69.2 million people with diabetes, of whom 47.3% are undiagnosed. About 10.2% of adults have glucose intolerance, a precursor to diabetes if lifestyle changes  nutritious low-sugar and low-carb diet, weight loss, high activity etc  are not made. Diabetes is twice as common in urban areas (11.2%) than rural (5.2%,), with advancing age, obesity, hypertension and family history of diabetes being independent risk factors in both urban and rural areas, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research India Diabetes study reported in The Lancet.Markedly elevated blood glucose levels initially cause mild symptoms such as thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), weight loss and dehydration. Over time, untreated diabetes leads to vision loss, painful neuropathy (sensory loss), foot ulcers, amputations, silent heart attacks, stroke, and end-stage renal disease.It has created quite a buzz, emails are flying thick and fast, says Dr Nikhil Tandon, head of the department of endocrinology, metabolism and diabetes at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, referring to the new ACP norms. I would believe that there is clearly a subset of patients in whom an HbA1c of around 7% would be a reasonable target. But with T2DM starting earlier, in the second and early third decade of life, among Indians, I would be a votary for tighter control in these populations, since we are looking at a longer lifetime exposure to high blood glucose levels.All associations are unanimous on 7% and below being the criterion of good control, which has proven benefits for nerve, eye and kidney problems resulting from diabetes over the years, adds Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol in New Delhi.In India, theres the added danger of blood glucose estimation not being accurate, depending on the quality of the labs where testing is done.For people under 40, the target is and must remain less than 6.5% as relaxing the upper limit of blood sugar control may put more people in danger of complications, says Dr Misra. Its only in older people and those with an HbA1c of 6.5% or less that therapy should be de-intensified."

Post-Christmas, the demand goes down,"" said one miller, who wished not to be named.The cap restricted traders from storing over 500 tonnes, Similarly, there was a cap on the mills -- not over eight per cent of total production in October and 21 per cent in November.According to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF), sugar production this year has been better as about 501 mills across the country have produced 125.20 lakh tonnes of sugar till January 10, as against 97.40 lakh tonnes during the same period last year.The demand from the market has slowed down, causing lower returns to the sugar mills.At present, the ex-mill sugar realisation ranges between Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,350 per quintal at the national level, while the production cost is about Rs 3,400 Rs 3,500, millers said.Notably, the ex-mill price was above Rs 3,500 per quintal till the cap on the stock limit was in force.The government is expecting the sugar industry would recover as demand increases in due course of time, but the millers are saying otherwise.According to the people from the industry, the demand was likely to increase in the Indian peninsular region in March and in the northern parts of the country in June as sugar consumption goes up during summer.However, it would not have much impact on the prices owing to the prediction of higher production in 2017-18, they said.""The prices will range between Rs 38-40 at least till October. Even if there is a surge, it will not go over Rs 42 in major cities. The government is comfortable with it,"" one miller said.In 2016-17, the government was seen taking several steps such as the cap on stock limit and higher duties to arrest the price rise in the domestic markets in the wake of low production."

My father was the karta. A couple of months ago he passed away. All of us want to make my mother the karta. Please advise how to do it.Pratik K. ParekhFor the purpose of my response, I have assumed that you are Hindu and your Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) is governed by Mitakshara law.I understand that your present HUF comprises: you, your sister, your two brothers, and your mother.Please note that prior to the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005, only male members descended from a common ancestorsuch as sons, grandsons and great-grandsonscould be coparceners and had an interest by birth in coparcenary property.However now, by virtue of the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act 2005, daughters are also coparceners in their own right in the same manner as sons. Accordingly, in your HUFyou, your sister, your two brothers would be the present coparceners and your mother would be a member. According to Mitakshara law, only a coparcener can be a karta or manager of an HUF. Therefore, since a Hindu widow is a member of the HUF but not a coparcener, she cannot be a karta of in her husbands HUF. [See Shreya Vidyarthi vs Ashok Vidyarthi & Ors AIR2016SC139 and Commissioner of Income Tax v. Seth Govindram Sugar Mills Ltd. AIR 1966 SC 24]. It is pertinent to note that in some cases, where the adult coparcener had died and there was no coparcener surviving or where the sole coparcener was a minor, courts have held that the HUF does not come to an end and the mother of the minor coparcener could act as the legal guardian of the minor and look after the role of karta, on behalf of the minor, in her capacity as legal guardian of the minor.In view of the above, since there are other adult coparceners in your HUF and your mother is not a coparcener, she cannot be the karta, even though all of you desire and agree to make your mother the karta. It is usually the senior-most coparcener of the HUF, that is the karta. However, if the senior most coparcener relinquishes his right, then by consent, you could consider any other coparcener (even though junior to the senior coparcener so relinquishing his/her right) to be the karta of the HUF.Marylou Bilawala is partner, Wadia Ghandy & Co.

The law and order situation in Gujarat has completely deteriorated and it reflects in what Togadia claimed today. We demand an inquiry into Togadias allegations to bring out the truth, state Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki said.On Monday around 10.30am, the firebrand Hindutva leader was reported missing from the VHPs office in Ahmedabad Paldi area. He was found at night around 9.20pm when he was brought in unconscious at a private hospital roughly eight kilometers away. Rupkumar Agrawal, a doctor at the Chandramani Private Hospital where he was found, said on Monday night that Togadias sugar level was very down but that he was stable.Narrating the sequence of events, Togadia said he was tipped off by a person on Monday morning that police was on their way to arrest him. I took my purse, left the security cover at office and got in an auto rickshaw. Togadia has Z-category security but left his guard at the VHP office.Rajasthan police said the arrest warrant was issued by a sessions court in Gangapur under the Indian Penal Codes Section 188, which pertains to disobedience of a public servants order. Togadia had allegedly violated prohibitory orders under Section 144  which limits the assembly of people  in the Rajasthan town 16 years ago.Sola police station officials said a team of Rajasthan Police visited them on Monday to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia but could not find him at his residence. Both Gujarat and Rajasthan Police had said they had not detained or arrested him.Togadia claimed that he called Rajasthans home minister Gulab Chand Kataria and chief minister Vasundhara Raje once he got into his auto on Monday but that both allegedly denied any knowledge of police action.That got me suspicious. While I wanted to save myself, I also wanted to follow the law. So I switched off my two cell phones. I reached a workers home and from someones phone number got in touch with lawyers in Rajasthan, who advised me to produce myself in the court.Togadia claimed he left for Ahmedabad airport to catch a flight for Jaipur around 3pm on Monday. Something happened to my health after I took an auto-rickshaw for airport. It was around 3 pm. And, next I know I was woken up in a hospital, he said.Togadia claimed old cases were being opened without the knowledge of senior leaders in an attempt to frame him. He cited the example of a 1996 attempt-to-murder case in Gujarat, in which a warrant was issued against him by an Ahmedabad court earlier this month. Togadia appeared in court on January 6 but claimed neither chief minister Vijay Rupani nor state home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja knew about it.Old cases are being reopened, so that I can be arrested. An attempt is being made to stifle my voice by arresting me in different states, Togadia added.(with agency inputs)"

Cane growers are forced to sell their produce to neighbouring states, Dalal said seeking a ruling from the assembly speaker to his proposed calling attention motion on cane prices.Speaker, Kanwar Pal said he has only accepted the calling attention motion proposed by the Congress MLAs on the issue of intoxication and drugs.CONGRESS NEEDS TO HIRE AN EXPERTTaking a swipe at Congress, agriculture minister OP Dhankar said the cane stalks brought by the protesting Congress MLAs were certainly not from Haryana. The grass lacked the quality of Haryana sugarcane. We do not know from where did the Congress MLAs got the cane stalks, he said sarcastically.The cane stalks were certainly not from Meham or Sonepat or Kalanaur. The Congress MLAs should be administered an oath to declare the antecedents of the cane they held in their hands, the minister said.Dhankar said there was no issue at all regarding the pricing and purchase of sugarcane from the growers. We are giving the best price...There is no outcry from the growers. The Congress MLAs are merely doing a nautanki to seek attention, Dhankar said.Yamunanagar BJP MLA Ghanshyam Dass too joined Dhankar in ridiculing the Congress MLAs: This cannot be the Yamunanagar cane as being claimed by Congress MLA Anand Singh Dangi. Cane grown in our area is very succulent, Dass remarked.Even as Dalal, Dangi and others continued pressing their argument, Dhankar advised them to hire an expert to help them make right moves. The Congress MLAs got themselves entangled in pakoda politics on Tuesday and lost face. Today, the cane issue has come as a cropper for them, he said.A Sugarfed spokesperson later said the co-operative sugar mills in Haryana have crushed 274 lakh quintals of sugarcane and produced over 26.80 lakh quintals of sugar so far during the ongoing crushing season.The spokesperson said Shahbad cooperative sugar mill has crushed 48.96 lakh quintals of cane and produced over 4.99 lakh quintals of sugar, followed by Rohtak cooperative sugar mill, which rushed 41.24 lakh quintals of sugarcane, producing over 3.93 lakh quintals of sugar."

Haryanas cabinet has okayed such a change in section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, but it needs further ratification.I will propose death penalty to drug traders in the next cabinet meeting, Sidhu said.On other issues, such as encroachment of government land, Sidhu said he had asked chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to set up a reinforcement wing to tackle the menace. To keep a check on illegal construction and loss of revenue, satellite mapping will prove very effective, he added, citing that, in Ludhiana alone, earlier property tax was collected from 90,000 properties; but after satellite mapping the number increased to more than 3 lakh.Meanwhile, in a political developement, Sidhu proposed the name of Inderjit Singh Zira, a former minister and the father of local MLA Kulbir Zira, as party nominee from Khadoor Sahib seat in the Lok Sabha poll due next year. On poll promises, he said, The Congress government is trying hard within 10 months of its formation to give jobs to the youth, while, on the contrary, the Akalis and their goons snatched businesses, be it contracts, transport or liquor.In response to a demand by locals to restart the sugar mill, Sidhu said he would take up the matter.

A nexus of contractors, officials and politicians had milked thousands of crores meant for irrigation projects, revealed sources. NCP leaders who had controlled the department came under the scanner.Sources said the ED was looking into irrigation contracts that had been given to a Pune-based firm, Raj Group, during Pawars tenure as water resources minister.

Jagdish Kadam and Ram Nimbalkar are directors of the Pune-based Raj group. Kadam is Ajits cousin, while Nimbalkar is one of his close associates. The firm bagged irrigation contracts for at least 11 projects, collectively worth Rs1,000 crore. Two of these projects are in Vidarbha, one in Marathwada and ten in western Maharashtra. These contracts were allotted when Pawar was water resources minister.2. Kadam and Nimbalkar were also directors in a few of the 60 companies associated with Pawar that had interests in infrastructure, realty, wind and hydro power, sugar factories, distilleries and automobiles.The two were the joint directors of 15 such companies. Pawar was the director of five such companies until 2009. His wife, Sunetra, was the director of 20 of these companies until 2014. She and Kadam were joint directors in seven such firms. Nimbalkar and she were joint directors in one firm.3. Raj group bagged projects by floating different entities, including Raj Infrastructure Development Corporation, Raj Promoters and Civil Engineers Private Limited, Raj Construction. The firm violated the norm that a single company cannot win more than three contracts in any region. In the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC), the group got five projects under different names, including one joint venture.4. The costs of a majority of projects bagged by the group rose by 4.83% to 41%. All the cost escalations were cleared by Pawar as the then minister. These controversial projects include Kuntephal, Dhom Balkawadi canals, Umraodi and Karanjao project5. The Kuntephal lift irrigation project worth Rs209 crore, part of the larger Krishna-Marathwada project was seriously flawed. A special investigation team that probed the project had sought action against the officials who cleared it. Documents show that the work order for the project was given without getting an administrative order, violating the governors directives. Project officials did not seek the mandated green nod from the Union environment ministry either."

Officials of the labour department said the office space in Grahak Bhandar building in Parli, Beed, has been identified for the welfare board. The process of taking over the office space is in final stage and will be completed by next week. It will be taken on rent according to market rates. The boards headquarters will be in Parli, added an official. The Sugarcane Welfare Board has been named after late BJP leader Gopinath Munde.An official said there were close to four lakh cane labourers in Beed and its adjoining districts. Once the board is formed, we will begin the process of registering the labourers, he said. He added that the board would provide financial security and improve the standard of living of sugarcane labourers. Sources in the labour department said, however, there was still no clarity on the financial provision for the welfare schemes for sugarcane labourers.We are of the view that, like construction workers, some cess should be collected from all sugar factories that can be used for the welfare schemes meant for cane labourers. This will not put a burden on the state governments finances. The move of collecting cess is likely to be opposed by the sugar factories, said a senior official from the labour department.The state government plans to provide some funding in the initial years. In December, the regional office of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in Solapur had told 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur districts to extend EPF benefits to labourers engaged in sugarcane cutting and transportation. Officials had said, since sugar factories pay the labourers through contractors, an EPF should be deducted. However, opposing the move, factory owners said they would take up the issue with the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

In the current season, 94,000 hectares are under cane, and the target is to increase it to 1.08 lakh hectares. We need at least 900 lakh quintals of sugarcane every year to run each mill for 180 days, said agriculture director JS Bains.Must read | Punjab pollution board gets strict with jaggery unitsThe meeting is being seen as an effort to divert farmers from the wheat-paddy cycle particularly after last weeks rap by the Niti Aayog, the countrys top think tank, that the state should care for its peasantry by looking beyond the countrys food needs alone. That rap came after the state sought a relief package saying that farmers were under stress in their effort to meet the countrys food needs.The directorate also asked the minister to make pending payments of Rs 45 crore to farmer for the previous year. Timely payments will encourage farmers to shift to sugarcane, said Bains, adding that, this year, of the total cane costing Rs 1,634 crore that arrived in the mills, payment of Rs 1,078 crore has already been made. Cane crushing for the current season began in November.The directorate was also asked to take the per-acre production to 400 quintals against the existing 320. The officials suggested to increase the state advised price (SAP) from the existing Rs 310 per quintal, and bring it on a par with what Haryana government offers (Rs 330)."

The agency also conducted searches at eight locations, including one in Hapur in Uttar Pradesh, one in Noida, and six locations in Delhi.According to the FIR, the bank filed the complaint on November 17, 2017.It was alleged that the Oriental Bank of Commerce sanctioned a loan amounting to Rs 148.60 crore in the year 2011 to the company (Simbhaoli Sugars). The loan was sanctioned for financing individual, joint liability groups, self help groups (SLG) and sugarcane farmers under the tie-up arrangement under the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Scheme to 5,762 sugarcane farmers supplying sugar produce to the company which was dishonestly and fraudulently diverted by said company for its own needs. The account was later declared as alleged fraud by the bank to RBI on May 13, 2015 for an amount of Rs 97.85 crore, stated the FIR, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint.The FIR added that the bank then sanctioned another corporate loan of Rs 110 crore to Simbhaoli Sugars on January 28, 2015, to pay its outstanding loan of Rs 97.85 crore.They adjusted the total liability of Rs 112.94 crore on June 30, 2016, by way of deposit of this new corporate loan. The corporate loan, too, turned NPA on November 29, 2016, thus resulting in its first outstanding loan of Rs 97.85 crore (as alleged fraud) and the fresh corporate loan of Rs 109.08 crore (as fresh outstanding), the FIR added.A spokesperson for OBC did not respond to a request for comment.Over the last 10 days, the CBI has filed more than seven cases on complaints filed by banks, including Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Bank of Maharashtra and Telangana Grameena Bank. Most of them relate to conspiracy and cheating, and some involve employees of the bank.Apart from the complaint filed against the group firms of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi for the Rs 11,400 crore fraud at PNB and the complaint against Rotomac Global, complaints have been filed by banks against companies including Kalimata Krishipanya Bipanan Pvt.

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat Friday launched the Prasadam scheme under which only locally prepared offerings will be sold to pilgrims visiting the religious places.The scheme aims to transform the hill states rural economy, the CM said.We have some 625 shrines where a large number of pilgrims visit annually. At all such shrines, devotees will now get locally prepared prasadam, he said. The government supported scheme, under which devotional offering will be prepared by women-run self-help groups (SHGs) using local produce, aims to transform the states rural economy.Launching the scheme at a press conference, Rawat said the scheme was part of Prime Minister Narendra Modis vision to boost the farmers income by 2022. The scheme is inspired by an experiment successfully carried out at the Badrinath shrine. Introducing the man behind the successful experiment, Rawat said Govind Singhji made substantial profits by selling prasad from a small shop on the precincts of the shrine. Singh sold prasad worth 19 lakh in a year earning a net profit of  9 lakh, CM said adding that the government had provided him the shop at the shrine.The experiment would now act as a model to transform the states pilgrim-centric rural economy. That model getting replicated in all 625 shrines across the state means a SHG (comprising 10 women and four artisans) each will prepare prasad and sell it to pilgrims, Rawat said. This would help resolve the livelihood issues facing some nine thousand individuals besides leading to the economic empowerment of women associated with the scheme.It would also fetch those associated with the scheme an estimated annual income of  80 crore if they sell the prasad for  100 per packet. That is the minimum total income the scheme will fetch the SHGs considering that at least 80 lakh of the total 485,000 pilgrims visit those (625) shrines annually. Of these pilgrims, some 1.17 lakh are foreigners, Rawat added.The CM said that the state government would provide the SHGs all possible help. For instance, we will ensure that they get a space to sell the prasad and are also properly trained to prepare it. The sacred offerings prepared by them would have local farm produce as its ingredients, Rawat said.He said that the prasad would also be attractively packaged. Besides, I have also asked the entrepreneurs to use stevia (a locally found shrub which is a calorie-free sweetener and sugar substitute) in preparing prasad so that even diabetics could relish it."

He said UP was a rich state with poor people because of the lack of vision for development and hoped the state would achieve heights of development under the leadership of its chief minister, Yogi Adtyanath.Gadkari said his ministry was ready to help UP in all possible ways, provided land was made available for the road projects. You provide us land and we will not let you down, he said pointing to minister for industrial development, Satish Mahana on the dais.The minister said Lucknow-Kanpur travel time would be reduced to just 40 minutes on the completion of the expressway connecting the two cities. Work on the proposed expressway, he said, would begin with bhoomi poojan in April. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would inaugurate the Delhi-Meerut expressway next month.However, Gadkaris emphasis was more on the development of waterways which, he claimed, could be a game-changer for UP. The ongoing Rs 54,000-crore Varanasi-Haldia waterways project will transform UPs economy, he claimed.He said the under-construction multi-modal terminal at Varanasi would emerge as a major logistics gateway connecting north India to eastern and north-eastern states.By the 2019 Kumbh, people will be able to travel between Varanasi-and Allahabad by the Ganga waterway, he said, adding that a new law would be made within the next three months to facilitate the plying of sea planes in the country.Gadkari said this sector had immense potential in UP and called on the state government to work on the promotion of second generation ethanol (made from bagasse, rice straw etc) and use of the same as a cheaper fuel for vehicles. With 125 sugar factories, UP has a lot of potential of producing ethanol fuel, he said, adding This will create a lot of employment as well in rural areas.He said the ambitious Ken-Betwa river interlinking project will project UP in a big way by irrigating 4.50 lakh hectare land in Bundelkhand region. The minister said Rs 28,000 crore would be spent on the project in UP alone.Earlier, potential investors gave presentations on the possibilities of development in UP. Minister of industrial development Satish Mahana assured entrepreneurs of all government help, if they invested in the state. With long-term planning, we will make UP as one of the most preferred states, he said.Gadkari said 4,000-km new roads will be made in UP under the Bharatmala project, the Centres flagship scheme for highway construction. He said detailed projects reports (DPRs) for Rs 900 crore had also been cleared."

The UP state Warehouse Corporation, she said, had been nominated as the nodal agency for the execution of the scheme.Under the scheme, according to sources, the government will make land available on a 30-year lease to an entrepreneur who sets up a silo at an appointed place.The Food Corporation of India (FCI) will give such silos a guarantee for business for 10 years. The company will charge a rent to be determined by the FCI for allowing the silos to be used for storing the food grain like wheat and paddy.The governments move comes in view of its policy of increasing the food procurement target.Currently, the states existing total storage capacity is only around 56 lakh MT against the peak demand of 70 lakh MT.There is a critical gap of around 15 lakh MT due to which wheat procured from farmers has to be often kept in open, which often ends up getting drenched.The state had fixed the wheat procurement target at 80 lakh MT last year. Though the target achievement was only half-way through, the procurement was one of the highest in recent years. And this had sent the government on a hunt desperately looking for additional storage on air strip, in closed sugar mills, in flour mills, cold storages, mandi yards or any other suitable place to meet the challenge.The government is expected to keep the target around the same next month for the current year, sources said."

The short-term solutions will be implemented in six months after the report is submitted. These include intensifying enforcement against unruly autorickshaws, prohibition of commercial vehicles in the daytime, penalty against wrong parking and fining motorists for traffic violations.Midterm solutions are small changes in existing U-turns, closing of unnecessary exits and redesigning of faulty traffic intersections. Midterm solutions will take six months to two years to implement.Long-term solutions are the construction of additional elevated roads over Shahdara drain, DSC Road and Master Plan-1 Road.Expanding the Metro to new areas and increasing in public transport facilities such as a city bus service have also been suggested. The long-term solutions will take two to six years to implement.After discussions with all members of the committee the authority will finalise the report and send the same to the UP government, Chandra said."

Defence counsel SS Basra pleaded for another date for framing the charges but the court rejected the same.

While the normal body mass index (BMI)an indicator of healthy body mass - ranges from 18.5 to 24.9, Atul and Nitesh had a BMI of 46 and 43.I had high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes and my sugar was controlled with 50 units of insulin and oral medicines. Similarly, my younger brother Nitesh was miserable because of the medical conditions. Our family doctor told us that due to diabetes and high blood pressure, we were steps away from kidney failure and being dependent on dialysis, said Atul.The siblings were diagnosed with metabolic syndromea cluster of medical conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The siblings had quit going to work and due to their inability to walk. The physician then referred them to obesity surgeon Dr Manish Motwani in August 2017.Primary diagnostic tests showed that Atuls creatinine level was 4ml/dl which showed that his kidney functions were extremely poor since the normal range is about 0.6-1.2ml/dl. After informing him about the possible risks in future, we performed a successful Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, in which we permanently reduce the size of the stomach, said Dr Motwani.By October 2017two months after the surgery, Atul lost over 40Kg, his creatinine levels were back to normal and he was able to walk without falling five times a day. Looking at the response of the surgery, Nitesh too opted for the same.Due to high diabetes and renal complications, Nitesh needed multi-disciplinary treatment which involved medication to control his conditions and a bariatric surgery. But within two months, he too lost over 40kg and resumed work by travelling in train between Kurla to Mulund, Dr Motwani added.There was a time when we couldnt get up from a low chair, walk or work even though we were the breadwinners of the family. The surgery has helped us travel in trains like normal people, Atul said."
