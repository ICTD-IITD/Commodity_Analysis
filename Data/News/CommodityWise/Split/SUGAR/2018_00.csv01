Congress and NCP are in touch with Raju Shetti and seem to be making all-out efforts to woo him.FARMER leader Raju Shetti, whose party Swabhimani Paksh has fought a bitter battle with the Congress and NCP in Western Maharashtra, the sugar bowl of the state, appears set to join hands with the Congress-led front in Maharashtra, which could set the alarm bells ringing in the BJP ahead of the 2019 Assembly elections. Both the Congress and NCP are in touch with him and seem to be making all-out efforts to woo him.Come what may I am not going to rejoin the BJP-led NDA, Shetti told The Indian Express on Monday. On speculations that he would join the Congress-led front in Maharashtra before the 2019 elections, Shetti said a final decision would be taken at the partys national executive committee meeting slated in the coming days. We have had offers from the Congress to join their front. But we have not taken a decision so far, said Shetti, indicating that personally he was in favour of joining the Congress-led front but not the BJP-led front under any circumstances.Slamming the BJP, Shetti said the saffron party had cheated farmers. It promised to waive loans of debt-ridden farmers but farmers have so far got nothing, he said.In August last year, Shetti quit the BJP-led NDA alleging the Modi government had failed to keep its word on the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations on MSP to farmers. Shetti, who heads the Swabhimani Paksh, the political wing of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, has had two crucial meetings  one with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, the other with state Congress chief Ashok Chavan.While Chavan had personally met Shetti last month, Pawar met him after a function in Kolhapur two days ago. In Kolhapur, Shetti and Pawar shared the stage for the first time in 14 years. There was no bitterness when we met after so many years. In fact, Pawar justified my criticism of the Congress-NCP government when it was in power saying such opposition kept the government on toes, he said.Shetti, who represents the Hatkanangle Lok Sabha seat, said those words were music to his ears as the NCP had targeted him viciously during the elections. His party had faced similar opposition in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, the cash-rich sugarcane belt of Maharashtra.Shetti said though Pawar did not directly suggest his party join hands with the Congress-NCP, he had received feelers from top NCP leaders. In fact, Pawar showered praise on me, saying I have dedicated my life for the upliftment of farmers. Pawar also credited me and himself for the Centres decision on export of sugar and prohibiting import of sugar, he said. On his meeting with Ashok Chavan, Shetti said, Chavan personally met me at his residence and urged me to join the Congress-led front. Initially, they urged us to join the Hullabol agitation in Nagpur but for some reason we couldnt make it, he said.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said efforts were under way to get all like-minded parties together to take on the BJP. Shettis party is one of them. Preliminary talks have been held but nothing has been finalised as yet, he said.Sawant said if the Swabhimani Paksh joins the Congress-led front, it will surely give the BJP camp the jitters. Another Congress leader said Shetti could be a major game-changer as farmers across the state hold a grudge against the present government. Shetti said though his party had only one MLA, it secured 12 per cent of the votes in Western Maharashtra. Besides, I have been regularly visiting Marathwada where I have held several meetings with farmers. The response has been huge. Farmers are upset with the BJP-led government, he said.The BJP, however, played it down, saying Shetti was leaning towards those who tried to finish him politically. All his political life Shetti has fought bitterly with the Congress-NCP. Now, if he joins hands with them, it will certainly send out confusing signals among voters in Western Maharashtra. As it is, Shettis appeal is limited to certain areas only, said BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Another BJP leader said if Shetti joins the Congress-led front, it wont affect them much as his one-time close lieutenant, Sadabhau Khot, is a minister in the Devendra Fadnavis government and popular among farmers. Khot may not be equally popular but has good support among farmers, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

A case has been registered against total eight people in the scam.The accused who were authorized to use E-FPS application provided by the government for issuing subsidised items to beneficiaries by matching their stored biometric details with barcoded ration card and UID (Aadhar), used illegal software and somehow accessed the data built by the government. This way they diverted the quantum in name of unsuspecting beneficiaries, who were not utilising their allotted quota, said the Crime Branch of Surat police in a press statement.The police said that a probe was on to find out how the government data was accessed and how the unauthorised software worked.The beneficiary had to provide his finger print, details of his ration card and UID (Aadhaar) numbers to match the data fed into the computerThe police investigation is also seeking to find out the exact quantum of wheat, sugar and rice which were supposed to go to beneficiaries of Annupurna Yojna was withdrawn and where it was diverted.The matter came to light when some of beneficiaries found that items in their name was issued though they had not utilized their allotted quotas. They made representation to the Surat district collectorate which asked the police to investigate the matter.In April 2016, the state government had launched the Annapurna Yojana under the National Food Security Act -2013. Fair price shops, which have been renamed as Pandit Deendayal grahak bhandar, were computerised so that subsidised food items reached the actual beneficiaries.While Gujarat has barcoded ration card and issue of subsidised item works by using UID and customers end, the fair price shop owners have been given a username and password to access the biometric data bank of beneficiaries to create an electronic record of beneficiaries availing subsidised grains from their shops.The customer provides finger print, details of his ration card and UID (Aadhaar) numbers to match the data fed into the computer. This generates a slip on the basis of which subsidised items are given every month.Police said that the two men have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including section 406, 409 (criminal breach of trust), 467, 468, 471 (forgery), as well as sections of the Information Technology Act and the Essential Commodities Act."

But the accused and his girlfriend told her that they had added sugar to it and asked her to finish her drink. Within minutes the complainant felt dizzy and fell asleep. When she woke up at 2am the next day, she saw that both the accused were sleeping next to her. The complaint left the house immediately.On January 4, she came to know that the accused had filmed an obscene video of hers after she fell asleep.

He was produced in the court on Monday and remanded in police custody for two days. Seeking his police custody, prosecutor Priti Jagtap said, Cases of crime against women are increasing by day. The mobile used in the crime is yet to be recovered and hence his custody is required."

I have continuously beaten these players who are performing now. Credit to them that they are playing well at big stage but knowing that I can beat them but not getting result is strange, Kashyap says.Asked why was he not playing in the challengers to improve his ranking, Kashyap replied: Since I am able to beat almost everyone at the academy during training, Gopi Sir told me to keep playing at Super Series. There are players like Kento Momota who came and won lower ranked tournaments and gained in confidence but then it is not my decision, it is coachs decision and I trust him.Also I have never played challenger tournament, so he made me play only Super Series.

However, officials said fresh searches indicate his value could be several crores more. Two ACB teams are probing in Satara, while three teams are investigating the case in the city.The ACB is also going through the records of his flats in Bandra, Navi Mumbai, Andheri, Dadar, and a spa in Borivli. A few vehicles of the engineer, including a JCB, are being probed. There are also a few shops in Satara and Mumbai which the ACB is probing. Apart from the property, bank details of several accounts, sugar mill shares are also being studied by the ACB.Officials have registered a case under Prevention of Corruption Act, after an enquiry was completed. When the probe is complete, a report would be sent to the state government for further action and a case would be heard in small cause courts.The engineer was posted with MHADA between 2001 and 2012."

While the state leadership has repeatedly asked all the MLAs and MPs, both former and present, to contribute one months salary or pension towards party fund, the result has been a naught. Though fund shortage isnt something the state unit is facing for the first time, one reason could be the differences between party president Ashok Tanwar and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Most MLAs belong to the Hooda camp. The party had about Rs 7 crore during the Congress rule under the leadership of Hooda, till 2014. Where has it gone, we would like to know first? one of them said in response to a query, leaving the scribes in splits.Badals barbs at SidhuPunjab local government minister Navjot Sidhus boycott of the mayoral election in Amritsar not only indicated he was feeling marginalised but also gave an opportunity to his political opponents to target him. Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who visited the Golden Temple on Saturday, said Sidhu cannot be loyal to any party. He is now gearing up to join the Aam Aadmi Party, she said of the cricketer-turned-politician who was in the BJP earlier and switched sides to the Congress just days before the state elections. However, the response of her husband, SAD president Sukhbir Badal, who has been competing with Sidhu in name-calling, was predictable. O Sidhu ta mental aa mai us bare hun ki kahan (Sidhu is insane, what can I say about him), he said.A hurried job and a quick correctionAfter the Punjab police killed dreaded gangster Harjinder Singh Bhullar alias Vicky Gounder and his two aides in an encounter, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was among the first to laud the state cops on their success. Congratulations to Punjab Police for killing most wanted gangster Vicky Gounder and his aide Prema Lahoria. Excellent work by DGP Suresh Arora and OCCU (the Organised Crime Control Unit), including AIG Gurmeet Singh and Inspector Vikram Brar. Proud of you boys, he posted in a congratulatory tweet. However, it was removed quickly due to an oversight. A tweaked tweet was posted within minutes, adding director general (intelligence) Dinkar Guptas name. Gupta, who addressed a joint press conference with director general of police (DGP) Suresh Arora on Saturday on the encounter, was among those given credit by the latter. It was an intelligence-led operation. DG (intelligence) was the overall in-charge, said the DGP before naming other police officials who carried out the successful operation.SAD readies new force against Amarinder govtWhen not in power Shiromani Akali Dal likes to rake up religion. Whats new this time is that they are planning to set up a volunteers force and have named it marjivrrey (ready for sacrifice). Party MP from Anandpur Sahib Prem Singh Chandumajra, while opposing government move to transfer power subsidy directly into farmers account, had last week said the party would name 11-member volunteer force from each village that would mobilise people against governments move. When a journalist asked what it will be called, a SAD leader accompanying Chandumajra said: Marjivrrey.Khandelwals VRS plea acceptedAfter a gap of about two months, the Haryana government has accepted the request of voluntary retirement from service (VRS) of 1985-batch IAS officer KK Khandelwal. The officer who was picked to head the Gurgaon bench of Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA) had sought premature retirement from the service in November to join the regulatory body. Though there is a three-month notice period required to be served for voluntary retirement, the state government has the discretion to relieve an official early. The delay in acceptance of his premature retirement request was triggering speculations on whether his VRS request would be accepted or not. Khandelwal would now relinquish charge on February 4.Insensitive netas and copsThe recent incidents of rapes in Haryana brought some weird and insensitive reactions out of states police and politicians. While an ADGP-rank police officer was caught on camera saying rapes have always been part of our society, BJP MP Raj Kumar Saini blamed social activism and increasing population for the increasing incidents of rapes. Saini, who is not new to controversies, said incidents of rapes do not happen with the consent of government and have been going on from ages. CM Manohar Lal Khattar, on the other hand, advised the media not to sensationalise rape incidents.An OSD who doubles as crowd-pullerHe is an officer on special duty (OSD) to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, but Amarendra Singhs duty seems to have been reduced to arranging crowd at his programmes. Recently, a video of Singh, who is posted in the chief ministers Karnal assembly constituency, went viral on social media. The video showed him holding a meeting of village panchayats and asking the sarpanches one by one to bring people to the CMs programme for the inauguration of a cooperative sugar mill. Not just that, he noted down the number of people each village head promised to bring to the event, asking them to come in tractor-trolley so that it looks like a famers rally.Nadda likes to be at centrestageUnion health minister Jagat Parkash Nadda does not miss any opportunity to hog the limelight. He may have lost to his friend Jai Ram Thakur in the chief ministerial race in Himachal Pradesh but Nadda is still trying to call the shots. Two days ago, the minister hosted a luncheon meeting at his official residence for all HP-cadre officers currently posted in Delhi. Thakur also attended the meeting in which Nadda stressed the need for good coordination between officers working in the state and the central governments. He praised the officers for their efficient and hoped that they would continue to serve the state as well as the centre in the same way.After lying low, Virbhadra Singh is back in actionAfter lying low for a while following the Congress defeat in the state elections, former chief ministerVirbhadra Singh is back in action. The octogenarian leader first addressed a public meeting in his Arki assembly constituency and then attended the At Home function held by Himachal Pradesh governor Acharya Devvrat on the occasion of Republic Day. He not only exchanged pleasantries with chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, but also inquired about his governments functioning.The goddess worshipperThe ministers in the Jai Ram Thakur-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government have stuck to convention in displaying photographs of the President and the Prime Minister in their offices.

However, the District Central Cooperative (DCC) Bank, Osmanabad, has got a stay against the EPF offices move, saying the sugar factory owes it Rs 227 crore in dues.Officials from the EPF office in Solapur said that the sugar factory was seized in 2015 after it failed to pay the EPF from 2008 to 2011. As per the norms, an inquiry was conducted to fix the EPF dues, including the fine and interest. The EPF dues are approximately Rs 12 crore of around 1,200 employees, said an official. The official further said that the e-auction process was initiated by the office and the Metal Scrap Trading Corporation was given the task for the auction. If any company or factory is closed or is in liquidation, then the EPF dues of the employees should be given first by selling its property, as per the EP Act, said an official from the regional EPF commissioner in Solapur.However, the DCC Bank, Osmanabad, had moved the Bombay High Court against the EPF offices move of auctioning the factory, seeking a stay on it. After the factory failed to pay the loan taken from us, we had seized the factory in 2012. Now, our total dues from the sugar factory is around Rs 227 crore.

We have communicated to them. If there are any EPF dues, then they should write to us and will consider them at the time of auction, he added. Officials from the DCC Bank, Osmanabad, said the auction has been pending as the sugar factory management has challenged the DCC Banks seizure action in the Debt Recovery Tribunal, which ruled in favour of the sugar factory. The tribunals order has been challenged by the DCC Bank in the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal and the case is still pending, said an official from the bank.However, officials from the EPF office said that it has now deferred the auction process and would move the High Court against the stay. We will move the High Court to ensure that the EPF dues are given on priority at the time of auction and will request the court to direct the DCC Bank to give an undertaking for it, said an official.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Her grandson Kirti, 60, said it was the seventh time she had fallen since July 2016. She was hospitalised  the family claims for the first time in her life  and doctors took the decision to go ahead with surgery because all her health parameters were normal.Before July 2016, she didnt need help to walk or do her daily activities. She even washed her own clothes and utensils. But after the last fall, she became immobile. It was too painful for her to even sleep, said Kirti.The family decided to take her to a hospital, but Ganga was adamant she did not need to go. She hated going to a hospital because she has never been hospitalised. Even our family physician suggested against it, Kriti said.However, the family decided to get her admitted because they couldnt bear to see her in pain and approached Dr Tejas Upasani, orthopaedic and computer-assisted joint replacement surgeon from Upasani Hospital, Mulund. Upasani had also operated on Gangas son, Hirji, two years ago, at the age of 85, successfully.After a battery of tests, Upasani decided to do the surgery. Apart from her fracture and partial hearing loss, the patient didnt have any other medical complication such as blood sugar or cardiac anomalies, which is why we decided to operate, said Upasani, who says he has operated on a 100-year-old patient in the past.Ganga had suffered an intertrochanteric (upper part of the thigh bone) fracture, on the right side of hip. Doctors said avoiding the surgery could result in other complications like bed sores, chest infection and urine infection.Since her bone structure was slightly weak due to the age, we used special implants meant for osteoporosis (condition in which bones become weak and brittle) patients. It was teamwork. Our anaesthetists took extreme precaution with the dosage, physicians and intensivists, who handled the Intensive Care Units (ICU) worked in line to provide a new lease of life to the patient, Upasani said.After the surgery, Ganga was able to sit and sleep on the bed without assistance. Doctors said the implants will help hold her bone structure and the fracture will heal within two months.Gangas PAN card says she was born in January 1915. She is the matriarch of a 80-member family. We are really happy she is getting better and not in pain now, Kirti said."

Lets banish old ways and keep our minds open to previous possibilities taht may ahve seemed uniamginable.Safe for you, unsafe for your dogsFeed the freshest meat-based food that you can. Avoid fillers such as most grains and potatoes. Nutrition is the pre-requisite for your dog's health. Educate yourself about complete and balanced meal supplemented by fruits and vegetables. Also do not let your own lifestyle beliefs affect the dog. Curd rice is not a food for dogs, just like milk/ rice or dal /rice. Also keep in mind that what's safe for humans is not always safe for dogs.For example, dogs cant have onions, raisins, grapes, dry fruits or chocolate or anything with sugar or salt. Table scraps and human foods are a big No. Rawhide bones or treats bought from stores are harmful. Switch over to real bones and make healthy snacks and treats yourself. If time does not permit, there are many ventures providing homemade snacks and treats and even meals for dogs in Bengaluru and all other major cities.Dont get your dogs addicted to drugsMinimise drug use, like anti-biotic and steroid based medications. Explore alternative medicines like homeopathic treatment to safely and gently stimulate natural healing. Keep an open mind in order to find the best ways to care for your pet. Learn to recognise the early warning signs of disease. Never neglect symptoms. Prevent parasites such as ticks and fleas. Its best to prevent these parasites if you can, rather than trying to treat them after your dog gets affected.Regular or daily grooming or putting a tick collar on your dog will help prevent ticks and fleas. Some people use essential oils to help repel parasites. Lemon eucalyptus can help repel mosquitoes. Lavender can have a calming effect on dogs. Aloe Vera gel, for instance, can be used on dogs to help with minor cuts or burns. However, it shouldn't be ingested by dogs.Homeopathic Bach flower remedy does wonders for soothing and calming a dog. Tea tree oil can help in keeping fleas away so does a mix of coconut oil and camphor. For skin problems, fish oil may be beneficial, and vitamins C and E may help reduce inflammations. Massage can be another option in place of or as a supplement to conventional treatment. It can help with mobility issues if your dog has swelling or suffers from arthritis. It can also help reduce anxiety in overly anxious dogs. But conventional medicine be ignored. Not all issues can be treated by alternative medicines and everything should be undertaken under proper medical guidance.Mark you calendar for vet visitsRegular vet visits are necessary. Dont ignore any symptoms however minor. Especially for your older dogs, its necessary that you do annual check-up as a preventive action. Also, if your dog is in obvious distress, such as having non-stop vomiting or breathing problems, a vet needs to see it. Constant whimpering or whining is also an indication your dog may need to see a vet. Add supplements if your dog is unhealthy but only under vets supervision and when necessary.Detergents can irritate dogs skinTry to avoid environmental toxins. Use safer (and green) cleaning products. Actively try to move over to natural or herbal cleaning agents like bio enzymes for cleaning your house. Sometimes a minor thing like a cleaning detergent or air-spray can cause harm to your pet leading to allergies and skin rashes.Socialising is important for pets tooMinimise emotional and environmental stress. Never scream at or leave your pet alone for long periods. Interact and mentally stimulate your pet as often as possible. Enrich his environment by providing stimulating toys. Make him a part of your family because pets, especially dogs, crave for human attention and company. Take him to pet events or day board him so that he socialises with other dogs and humans.Dogs need to work out every dayJust like you, your dog also needs plenty of exercise to stay healthy with say daily walks. Swimming is great way of keeping your pet healthy and happy. Every pet needs enough physical and mental stimulation, lack of which will result in an unhappy pet with behavioural issues. When you walk your pets, devote that time to him. If we want a holistic care for your pets, we should start by making sure that they have a healthy lifestyle."

In this regard, electronic distribution system, e-PDS, has been introduced in the state, Ali said.He said various components of this system include online allocation of food grains, installations of ploint of sale (POS) machines, geographic information system (GIS), ration cards seeding with Aadhaar and GPS trackers.For all the latest Jammu News, download Indian Express App"

Hence, Hg here doesnt mean mercury but Himalaya Gold.Its a very Leafy cafe on the Highway. There cant be a more apt description, or direction, to Johannesburgs latest and almost famous hotspot.[Note to editor: Retain the uppercase L and H in Leafy and Highway. You get wiser as the story rolls on.]The search for this unusual place started after a morning of absolute random reading. The 0-2 scoreline of a three-Test series makes you avoid sports pages. Not out of depression, but plain boredom.It was an online write-up under the trending section of City Press, a hyper-local paper. It was about a restaurant, but it wasnt exactly a food review. The headline was enticing or, as millennials say, click-baitish.We tried out the marijuana cafe at Sandton. Of course, you want to know more.Its the kind of good news that gets shared even before it is read. Though, caution is advised. The proximity of Friends, Family and Front page groups on the chat window has its pitfalls. Those sorry-wrong-window situations can be embarrassing.As you read on, you know you have stumbled upon a goldmine. Even for a non-smoker and someone barely active on social media, this was precious information.Besides, the serious stoners, the I didnt inhale types too will consider this as the find of the tour. You had stumbled upon a place that was a dream destination for every Facebook flaunter, instagram show-off and wannabe cool. Who would want to miss the pleasure of making your school friends and college mates envious! While you sit in your cubicle, here I am at this Leafy cafe on the Highway. In your face, you frontbencher!So you call a friend, and proceed to the place. Its in Sandton, but it is more like Sandsterdam. (Thats picked from the heavily scribbled walls of the Cafe).But for the very tall bouncer outside  not exaggerating he could have touched the over-head electric wires by stretching his hand  the Cafe looks inviting. The porch has thick natural foliage. There is a sprawling backyard with comfortable huts with tables and more trees. Maybe, this happens to be the only place in the neighbourhood that doesnt even have an electric fence or tall walls.Just above the front door you are reminded about marijuanas medicinal values. That very recognised doctors logo  an ancient Greek staff getting kissed by with two entwined slick serpents  has a ribbon of a yellow leaf.A few steps inside and staring at you from the walls of the caf are the house rules. The most noticeable being No drugs. The Rule No.1 is Please take a seat and wait to be served.You follow the rule and wait. But for the whiff, it looks like just another Saturday afternoon at a Johannesburg caf, or anywhere in the world. Theres a pool table, Arsenal is playing on television and Wenger Out is hand-written on the adjacent wall.The crowd hasnt started building. Theres a not-so-young couple, probably from the flower power decade. There are a couple of white boys with thick brown beards. The showstoppers, without doubt, are a group of elegant, heavily jewelled and lightly dressed black youngsters. Some are wearing bandanas, some have head bands. All they needed was tall models and they could have easily stepped inside the television thats playing MTV.The smooth-as-velvet table is both functional and informative. It reminds you of your chemistry books. Its a period table with different elements. On it is written the Marijuana Table, with symbols and names of the different weeds. So Ni isnt Nickel, here its Nirvana Special. Au and Ag remain neighbours but Gold and Silver on this planet are called Acapulco Gold and Afghan. Cu is not for Copper, its Couchlock. Zn equals Zen not Zinc. Cn: Cinderalla 99 aka Copernicium. Pb: Purple Buddha aka Lead. Si: Silver Haze aka Silicon. Pd: Purple Diesel aka Palladium. Pt: Purple Trainwreck aka Platinum. Ds  Durban Poison (Darmstadtium). And finally, the Indian contribution. Hg is not Mercury, here it stands for Himalaya Gold.Soon, you are being served. The man at the table wears a chunky neck piece, holds a lighted cigarette and is fanning a photocopied menu card. He has a question that gets regularly asked at most Indian restaurants here. Strong, medium or light, he says. There are suggestions too: This will make you think. My friend wants to think. In a record of sorts for most cafes, the order arrives, neatly packed in a tiny polythene bag, the kind in which homeopaths give tiny sugar balls. You can have it there, or prefer takeaway.We leave after a while not keen to eat the tasty looking pizzas and muffins. The locals arent too clear about the law. Some say its legal, others arent so sure. After a wave to the eight-foot-something guard and a failed high five, you are out. The Leafy Caf is behind, what lies ahead is the Highway.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

With this, the State Police has also notched up a record for destroying cannabis cultivation in the State. In 2016-17, illicit hemp cultivation over 3,599 acres was destroyed by different district administration and the year before, the number stood at 2,457 acres.According to Director General of Police (DGP) Dr RP Sharma, the State Police had planned to destroy hemp cultivation over 3,050 acres this year but has far exceeded the target. In many districts, the drive is underway and will continue till January 31, he said.Of the seven districts where hemp plantations were destroyed by joint teams of police and forest, the most was achieved in Kandhamal. At least, 2,227 acres of cannabis were destroyed by the enforcement squads in the central district. In Gajapati and Boudh, illegal hemp crops over 842 acres and 789 acres were destroyed during 2017-18.In November, the DGP had convened a meeting of Crime Branch with Special Task Force, Economic Offences Wing, SPs of nine districts, Excise and Forest Departments, Narcotics Control Bureau and Odisha Space Application Centre to devise the plan of action against trafficking of ganja and destruction of the cultivation.The DGP said the success against cannabis cultivation was facilitated by direct transfer of funds from STF to District Police which avoided delay. A multi-disciplinary approach and use of satellite imagery helped the operations in interior and Maoist-affected districts such as Kandhaml, Boudh, Rayagada, Malkangiri and Koraput.We have made use of remote sensing in identification of the crops in different districts but we would like to make extensive utilisation of its in the future, Dr Sharma said.A major challenge for the enforcement, as usual, was the Left Wing Extremis-affected districts where the squads were faced with security issues besides the inhospitable terrains.In Malkangiri, this year, hemp cultivation over 199 acres could be destroyed though much more plantation remains in the cut-off areas. There has been a decline in cultivation of hemp in Sambalpur, Deogarh, Angul and Nayagarh districts.Apart from cultivation, the State Police and Excise sleuths went after trafficking of ganja, brown sugar and cough syrup. At least 700 persons were arrested in 2017 for trafficking 476 quintal ganja. Over 1.861 kg brown sugar was also seized.Fresh measuresDGP Dr RP Sharma on Sunday said the State Government has revised the reward enforcement personnel as well as informers are entitled to for action against illegal trafficking of ganja as well as its cultivationEarlier, the enforcement squads and informer were entitled to a reward of `80 each per 1 kg ganja apprehended. This rate was set about 25 years back. Now, it has been revised to `300. This would help the fight against trafficking of the contraband"

We value each persons life equally. Under the ease of doing business initiative, we have eased processes including allowing shops and establishments to remain open for 24 hours, we have freed them from the inspector raj, introducing self-certification among other moves. So, it becomes their responsibility to ensure safety of workers in their establishment. There should be no negligence. We will now come out with an industrial safety policy for establishments and factories including a chapter on stringent norms for shops, eateries, etc. This will be a state safety policy, and we will fix the responsibility on the owners for such incidents.Is self-certification, under the garb of ease of doing business, has led to non-compliance with required norms?There are two sides to it. Those who are honestly doing their businesses will be troubled by some peoples action of not complying with norms while self-certifying. Our attempt is to protect such honest businessmen and to ensure that they are not troubled. And those who are not complying with norms will be punished for their acts.What is the biggest challenge in implementation of the 247 policy for shops and establishment?Womens safety will remain the most important aspect. The number of working women is not very high. By ensuring their safety, we hope to increase their numbers, and that will help to contribute to the nations growth.The labour department has proposed easing norms for factory closure without mandating permissions from the government. But labour unions have strongly objected. Whats your stand on it? I personally agree with the labour unions view completely. The amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act are just a proposal that came from the Union government. Some of the states have implemented it. We will discuss the matter extensively with labour unions to find a middle path to ensure that laborers rights are protected and also that industries do not migrate away from the state due to certain provisions in law.There is around Rs 6,000 crore in funds with the Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board. Non-utilisation has been criticised repeatedly. Do you have plans for welfare of construction labourers?I admit that we have not been able to register the majority of construction workers with us. But we have increased the registration of construction workers substantially from last year. Now, we aim to register around 15 lakh construction workers, out of approximately 27 lakh, over the next one year. With construction workers registered, we will now introduce various schemes worth Rs 3,000 crore. These include the Maha Kamgar Awas Yojana for residences, training programmes for them, an essential kit and also midday meals.Despite having a large number of construction workers in the state, only around 3 lakh are registered. how will you make sure benefits of the proposed schemes reach larger numbers of workers?Earlier, there was a procedure to renew registrations every year. Now, we have changed the provision to renew it after five years. So, once a construction worker is registered with, he will be eligible to avail all the benefits and schemes for five years. One of the major reasons behind the low registration of construction workers is that the units where the construction laborers work are not interested in registering workers with us. It was due to a fact that the liability for any accidents will be on these owners. Now, we have made a provision that it is mandatory for all such units to register the workers with us. We have also decided that if a worker who is not registered is killed on site in an accident, he will be treated as a registered worker and will be given all benefits.The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) office in Solapur has issued notices to 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur, asking them to start extending EPF benefits to sugarcane laborers, but factories have refused to do so.The cane laborers are in the unorganised sector. The sugar factories have created this process so that the liabilities related to cane harvesting laborers is not on them. This system was prepared by the then government and all the factory owners. I feel that sugar factories must give EPF to the cane laborers. As the factories have so much money, they should not have any problem in extending EPF benefits to them.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Photo: MintNew Delhi: India is likely to produce 96.1 million tonnes (mt) of wheat in 2017-18, about 2% lower than the year before, while prices of major crops will continue to be flat or in their lower ranges in the months ahead, National Collateral Management Services Ltd said (NCML) on Tuesday.A lower wheat crop will be against the governments expectations of production crossing 100 million tonnes, NCML said, adding the dip is due to lower area planted by farmers. NCML is a private company providing post-harvest management services like warehousing for agricultural commodities.In its crop estimates and price outlook for 2018, NCML forecasts that prices of key commodities are likely to remain flat or around the lower ranges... due to higher stock to use ratios of most commodities.While wheat prices are likely between Rs1,630 and Rs1,705 per quintal for most of the year, prices for chana, a major winter crop, could touch lows of Rs3,300 per quintal following harvest, the report said. Chana is usually harvested starting March.This implies while wheat prices will hover around the government announced minimum support price (MSP) of Rs1,735 per quintal, prices for chana could be significantly lower than the MSP of Rs4,400.NCML said significantly higher planting of chana, and wheat farmers switching to the pulse crop means that lows of around Rs3,300 (per quintal) is quite a possibility with highs in the slack season being anticipated not above Rs4,600 in 2018.On mustard, a winter oilseed, the company said farmers disillusionment with last years low prices will result in a likely 4.2% dip in production in 2017-18. However, prices could dip towards Rs3,800 per quintal levels by March (during harvest) and move higher towards Rs4,300 per quintal by August.Since India imports most of its edible oil requirements, a shortfall in domestic production does not lead to a rise in prices.Due to significantly higher production of sugar in 2017-18, prices of the sweetener will be under pressure, NCML said, adding, Rs2,780-Rs3,250 will be the band which will witness most of the trading in sugar during the year.A poor winter crop coupled with low crop prices means the spectre of farm distress will continue. Since June last year, farmers across several states have been protesting with demands of better prices and loan waivers.Lower crop prices will also pose a challenge for the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, which go to polls this year."

What does HLF mean to him when compared to the big ones in its league? The author of Democracys XI: The Great Indian Cricket Story, says, When it comes to literature festivals, I think small is beautiful. as the author gets a chance to interact with the audience directly. What can his fans expect from him in this session? I am going to be speaking on media in the age of breaking news, says Rajdeep, adding that the session will include a talk related to credibility in television media.He would also be speaking on his book, Democracys XI as well. One of my 11 cricketers are from Hyderabad  Mohammad Azharuddin. I want to explain why hes in the team. I would be happy to read some excerpts as well, he says. When it comes to literature festivals, there is often a criticism that such things are a preoccupation of the elite.Sardesai does not seem to think that is the case. I have travelled throughout the country and I can assure you that reading habits of the people will surprise you. So no, I dont think only the elites read and the masses dont! However, he adds that including literature in regional languages and breaking the language barrier would make literature fests more accessible, which is indeed something that HLF is known for. Paulami SenRochelle PotkarRochelle Potkar is the author of The Arithmetic of Breasts and Other Stories, Four Degrees of Separation, and Paper Asylum, and is alumna of Iowas International Writing Program and Charles Wallace Writers fellowship, Stirling. Her The leaves of the deodar won the Open Road Review story contest (2016), and Chit Mahal appeared in The Best of Asian Short Stories.What does HLF mean to you?Hyderabad is like a second home. The first time I was at HLF was unforgettable in terms of the palette of stimuli, the wide-ranging texture of panel discussions and artistic display. I was on a fiction discussion and poetry reading panel that year. This year, it will be poetry with music. Three of us poets Saima Afreen, Mrinalini Harchandrai and myself will read poems on water to the resonance of violin strings by Surjo Sengupta and table taals by Supratik Chatterjee.How do you see HLF vis-a-vis other lit fests in the country?I see it as THE representative artistic and cultural feast of its state. At HLF, there seems to be a unique interweave of the old city and the new city that Hyderabad is metamorphosising from. You can feel its grainy rebirth in the way the festival not only chronicles it through various arts, but also in the way it includes voices and forms from across the country also keeping a different country of the world in focus, every year.How much of literature do you think has trickled down to the common mans lives?A literature festival is like a pot of honey to flies. Sugar to ants. Gold to magpie. With the right buzz and mix of presentations, something for all: for the very young to the mature of interests, I do think a lot has seeped subconsciously. In any case, mindsets shift subtly through hypnoses of story, poetry, art, and interactions. Before you know it, it has percolated into the deep recesses of the psyche, from where the next action emerges.What are you going to read/perform at HLF?Read poems on the global devastation of water bodies (about a lake undiscovered for 15 million years Lake Vostok likening it to humanitys courage and preserve) of rivers and how they displace, and water-harvesting.Saima AfreenChandan GowdaChandan Gowda teaches at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. He has edited The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader (Navayana and DC Books, 2017) and Theatres of Democracy: Selected Essays of Shiv Visvanathan (HarperCollins, 2016). He is presently completing a book on the cultural politics of development in old Mysore.How do you look forward to being at HLF?I spent two years in Hyderabad during my MA days in sociology at the University of Hyderabad. It feels a bit nostalgic to visit here now for a literary festival.What do you like most in Indian Literature?Our classics: The two great epics, the great Sanskrit plays, Panchatantra, Hitopadesa, Bhakti and Sufi poetry translations have helped me read non-Kannada writers like Basheer, OV Vijayan, Salma, for example.How much of literature do you think has trickled down to the common public in terms of perception, reach and distribution?Popular literature  thrillers, romance, etc sells much more, while serious literature usually doesnt find as many readers in the country. In recent years, publicity and media hype have come to play a big role in making books widely visible and accessible. Smaller publishers often find it difficult as a result to function amidst such realitiesWhere does contemporary literature stand today?There is plenty of very good writing at present. One cannot keep up with it, in fact. And there is lots of mediocre writing too! But to know that growing numbers of people make the effort to write and publish is always a heartening fact.What are you going to read/perform/discuss at HLF?Ill participate in a conversation around The Way I See It, an anthology of Gauri Lankeshs writings that Ive put together. Im also participating in a panel on translation. Saima AfreenToral ShahToral Shah, an educator, childrens author and storyteller will make her debut at HLF this year with her stage talk and workshop. I will hold a stage talk on the first day about creating books with underprivileged children  writing stories, childrens illustrations and enactment of a play written by these children. Also about providing quality education to children from underprivileged communities where learning happens out of the text books and into a world of stories; where they are stimulated to think, get inspired and then create. I would be discussing different ways by which creativity, originality and bringing about Why not? and So what?scenarios are reinforced. I will be explaining the role of AES in executing the initiative, Lets read, write and imagine more, she informs. On the day two, she will be conducting a workshop on giving children the opportunity to explore their ideas and to express them. On whether literature has seeped into people at large, she says, The success of HLF and Hyderabad Childrens Festival is a testament to the permeation of literature into public life. About where childrens literature stands in todays era, she says, Childrens books in India are increasing manifold by numbers and quality promoting Indian culture, mythology and art. Indian Literature for children has graduated from the famous Panchatantra and Aesops Fables having moral-based stories, Amar Chitra Kathas to now simple, exciting and fun stories by myriad Indian authors. - Purnima Sriram."

At around 6.30 a.m., the STF officials, acting on information, intercepted a private bus coming from Bengaluru at Aaramgarh on the outskirts of the city and caught a person, Abhilash Gupta, and seized 17 LSD sugar cubes and ecstasy pills. Based on the information given by Gupta, the officials nabbed two more persons, and another is absconding.Assistant excise superintendent K Pavan Kumar, who led the STF team, said Abhilash, an Intermediate dropout, worked in Bengaluru. During his stint in Bengaluru, he reportedly developed contact with one Melford and obtained drugs. The cost of the seized drugs in the market would be around `2.5 lakh, he said. This LSD mixed in the cubes has alarmed officials as it can be shared among many people, unlike the LSD blots which will be of a postal stamp size.The LSD blots can be cut into four pieces and can be consumed by a similar number of people but LSD in sugar cube format can be made into powder and used by more number of people, officials said.One LSD blot is sold anywhere between `3,500 to `5,000, and one LSD sugar cube is sold at `7,000 to `8,000. Abhilash bought the LSD sugar cubes form a person in Bengaluru and was bringing it to Hyderabad to sell, Pavan Kumar said. Officials said that Abhilash supplied the drugs earlier too. They learnt that people in Hyderabad were placing orders through darknet and got them delivered to their homes through couriers.Techies create ruckus at bar, heldHyderabad: Two drunk software professionals who created ruckus at a bar and stopped the police from closing the bar in Madhapur on Friday night have been arrested and remanded, said Madhapur police on Saturday.

It is only about 10 percent of the countrys total children who are receiving adequate diet.Furthermore, about 55 percent of non-pregnant women and 58 percent of pregnant women aged between aged 15-49 years are anemic.A large part of India continues to consume non-nutritious, non-balanced food either in the form of under-nutrition, over-nutrition or micronutrient deficiencies. It is important to understand that mal-nutrition derives not just from lack of food but from a diverse set of inter-linked processes linking health care, education, sanitation, hygiene, access to resources and women empowerment, the paper said.ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said the government needs to pursue policies which focus on removing health and social inequities. Programmes and policies that aim to address the nutrition burden present a double  win situation.The adverse, irreversible and inter-generational impacts of malnutrition make optimal nutrition critical to the development of the country as a whole and all its citizens.The paper said in order to cater to the large unmet needs of micro-nutrients, it is imperative to focus on production diversity as well as food fortification at a macro level.For instance, millets are three to five times more nutritious than rice and wheat in terms of proteins, minerals, and vitamins. They are cost effective crops as well; yet considered as poor peoples crop while rice and wheat are preferred over them. Millets are rich in Vitamin B, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, zinc and are gluten-free. They are suitable for people with gluten allergies or those with high blood sugar levels."

The Sabarmati ashram is sited between a jail and a crematorium, and Gandhi believed that a Satyagraha invariably had to go to either place. He is believed to have said, This is the right place for our activities to carry on the search for Truth and develop fearlessness, for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts of Mother Nature.It was also from here that he launched the famous Dandi March or Salt Satyagraha in 1930, in protest against the increased taxes on Indian salt in an effort to promote sales of British salt in India.Adalaj VavGujarat has some beautiful step wells and this is certainly one of them. This intricately carved five storeys deep step well was started in the 15th century by Rana Veer Singh to alleviate the misery of his subjects who had to face severe water shortage and completed by a Muslim king, Mehmud Begda in the Indo-Islamic architectural style.Built in sandstone it is octagonal at the top, and stands on a large number of gorgeously carved pillars. Spacious, each floor can accommodate sizeable congregations. The floral motifs and Islamic graphics blend rather well with the Hindu symbols carved at various levels of the well. The carvings depict women in daily chores like churning of buttermilk, adorning themselves, dancers and musicians performing, and the King overlooking all these activities. Dont be surprised if you find hordes of tourists filling every possible space in the huge stepwell, most of them in the serious pursuit of either posing for pictures or indulging in taking selfies.Sidi Saiyyed MosqueThis mosque is famous for beautifully carved ten stone latticework windows on the side and rear arches. This intricately carved lattice stone window is the Sidi Saiyyed Jali, the unofficial symbol of city of Ahmedabad and the inspiration for the design of the logo of the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Our visit coincided with the Maghrib prayers: in the midst of a chaotic traffic, the mosque lent serenity and the soft light from the ambience further enhanced its beauty.Teen DarwazaKing Ahmed Shah built this historical gate in the 15 century. This is where we found the most chaotic and undisciplined traffic. The roads were overflowing with people, hawkers, small time shopkeepers with mountains of goods, and ruthless two wheeler drivers with intimidating horns.Manek ChowkHere the street food stalls at night are a big attraction. It is a vegetable market in the morning, a jewellery market (supposed to be the second biggest in India) in the noon and a street food market at night. The food stalls start to emerge around 9:30 in the evening and continue till late night. The mouth-watering snacks make you ignore the not so clean surroundings. Besides many delicacies, Manek Chowk is best known for its kulfi but we had fafda (that came with a chutney setting the tongue on fire) and hot jalebis: an unusual combination.PolsIt is worth seeing a Pol in the old Ahmedabad. They contain old beautiful houses with internal courts having intricate wooden carved facades with columns and fresco work done around court walls or ceilings. Pol architecture is an interesting evolution in urban living space.The word pol is derived from the Sanskrit word pratoli meaning entrance to an enclosed area. Pols were originally made as a protection measure when communal riots necessitated greater security probably dating from 1738 during Mughal-Maratha rule (1738-1753) in Ahmedabad. A typical pol would have only one or two entrances and also some secret entrances known only to people residing in a pol.Sasu Ji for lunchOne of the best places to taste an authentic Gujarati thaali as the warm and hospitable staff pampers you. We started with many bowls of baasundi, tiny Malpuas dripping with sugar syrup; Cheese Wonton (?? Chinese?? Yes!!), Shahi Dhokla, Patra for starters (Farsan), for the main course it was Paneer Pasanda, Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable dish with muthia-dumplings made with fenugreek leaves and spiced besan), Batata Tameta (tomato?), methi papad, poories, rice, rotisof course, you cant finish all this, however generous Sasu ji is!Mirch Masala for dinnerA themed restaurant, based on old Hindi films, here you have paintings of Kaka (Rajesh Khanna) and other film stars staring at you from every wall. We polished platefuls of kebabs as Hrithik Roshan watched us lovingly.Law GardenShopping cant get any better. The goods are attractive, prices quite reasonable. Your Indian genes will not resist from bargaining and the vendors are OK with it.

Even after a decade of commercial cooking I keep going back to my moms kitchen to discover those secret ingredients that enhance food in taste and shelf life, yet keep them honest and organic.While practices such as adding oil to preserve pickles is well known and practised world over, natural emulsifiers from traditional Indian kitchens is still lesser-known.Emulsifiers are substance added to food to keep the oils and fats well mixed with the water base, preventing their separation. Chemically speaking emulsifiers are molecules that have two different ends: a hydrophilic end (water-loving) that forms chemical bonds with water and a hydrophobic end (water-hating) that forms chemical bonds with oils.Imagine a simple drink like buttermilk (chaas), when stored for too long, the yoghurt solids of the drink separate from the water base. This separation destroys the form and hence the taste of the food. What if a simple ingredient could help buttermilk retain its form and taste like it was when freshly made?Emulsifiers are rampantly used in packaged food industry and restaurants to increase shelf life.Most of these are artificial lab-made chemicals and they are generally tasteless and have undesired side effects, like allergic and intolerance reactions in consumers. Therefore, such additives in packaged foods must be strictly regulated. On the other hand, natural emulsifiers are safe to eat and contribute to the foods taste, retain form factor while making it last longer.The natural emulsifiers traditionally used for the Indian curry is cashew nut (Anacardium Occidentale), sesame (Sesamum Indicum), watermelon seeds (Citrullus Vulgaris) and poppy seeds (Papaver Somniferum). Gravy made with cashew nut can be frozen without any significant change in the quality.How can you use this at home? While making rice kheer, we add milk to boiled rice. Before adding milk to rice, add some cashew paste to the milk.The cashew paste will enhance the taste of the kheer and also increase the life of the kheer as it will bind the water of the boiled rice with the fat of the milk. Another similar example is adding khoa to gajar ka halwa. Khoa not only enhances the taste and makes the food look richer, but also increases the life of the halwa. For salad dressing, instead of using packaged sauce with high saturated fat, sugar and salt content, try a healthier option. Use cashew-garlic paste, which is a natural ingredient that will enhance the taste and also keep the salad fresh for long.(The writer is co-founder & Head of Culinary at Yumlok Bangalore)"

And they chased down Zimbabwes total of 155 runs with ease.READ | ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup: Prithvi Shaw confident of Indias chances in quartersShubman had prepared for the U-19 World Cup for the last one-and-half years. The camps at National Cricket Academy, exposure tours and Dravids inputs have helped him become a focused cricketer. He has not taken sugar in the last one-and- half years. He follows a strict diet and fitness regime. He takes boiled veggies, oats, proteins and vitamins. Being Punjabis, we gorge on sarson ka saag, rajmah rice, desi ghee and white butter, but he has not touched them for a long time. Cricket is his life. He feels he should not cheat as he wants to make his dream come true, said Lakhwinder, a Mohali-based agriculturalist.Shubman idolises Indian captain Virat Kohli for his skill and fitness.The Gills shifted from a remote place called Jalalabad in Punjabs Ferozepur district to Mohali a decade ago for his son to pursue cricket.Shubman had a brilliant outing against Australia too in the opening World Cup game, hitting a 54-ball 63. The Punjab batsman was top-scorer in last years Youth ODI series in England, averaging 92.66. This prompted Punjab selectors include him in the Ranji Trophy team.However, he suffered a side strain and could play just two Ranji matches. The stylish batsman scored his maiden Ranji century against Services. He is aware of the road ahead. He loves playing the rising deliveries. I knew Shubman would make use of the chance and shine. He needs to do this consistently in the tournament and help India win the trophy, said his father.Shubman grabbed headlines first when he was involved in a world-record opening stand of 587 runs in the U-16 Punjab inter-district tournament with Nirmal Singh a few years back. He has been spoken of highly in cricket circles since then. I had to face the ire of my relatives in the village when we decided to move to Mohali for Shubman. I hope all efforts yield results in the end. He is best friends with his Punjab teammate Abhishek Sharma. They are each others best critics. Both can be crucial for India in the later stages of the tournament, added Gill."

He said the existing laws were also in conflict with Food Safety and Standard Act 2006.Singh said the existing provisions that provide for civic bodies to construct, operate and regulate slaughter houses would be changed. Singh said amendments to the two acts will take away from the civic bodies the role to construct and operate slaughter houses. He said amended law will make the civic bodies as regulator for the slaughter houses. He said slaughtering of animals outside slaughterhouses would be banned and a separate policy would be brought to set up the new slaughterhouses.The cabinet also approved amendment to section 24 (a) of United Provinces Excise Act 1910 to allow consumption of liquor in model shops. The governments rules provided for consumption for liquor in model shops but a Public Interest Litigation had challenged this provision and the Allahabad High Court had found sale of liquor for consumption in model shops against provisions of section 24 (a) of United Provinces Excise Act 1910. UP has 385 model shops and government expects to earn a revenue of Rs 1221.72 crore from them.An umbrella support agreement to be signed with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for transfer of state highways to the NHAI was also approved.The cabinet approved a proposal to set up permanent Lok Adalat in 24 districts in third phase.A proposal to expand crushing capacity of cooperative sector sugar mill of UP Cooperative Sugar Mills Federation Ltd situated at Ramala (Baghpat) from 2750 TCD to 5000 TCD and set up 27 MW co-generation plant there was approved. The cabinet approved a proposal to close down unit No 8 of Obra Thermal Power project that exceeded 36 years against its life of 25 years. The state cabinet decided to cancel the contract to the BHEL for repair and maintenance of the plant."

Photo: MintNew Delhi: Sugar production in India is likely to be 26.1 million tonnes in 2017-18, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said on Thursday, raising its production forecast for the year by 4%. In early January ISMA had estimated production at 25.1 million tonnes.The latest estimate implies a 29% increase in sugar output year-on-year, from 20.3 million tonnes in 2016-17. Surplus production could lead to a decline in wholesale prices and pending payments to cane farmers.As of 15 December, Rs7,500 crores was due to cane farmers across India, according to ISMA. The current dues are lower than the dues of over Rs21,000 crore seen in 2015 following years of surplus production.Higher production in the 2017-18 sugar season (October to September) is due to better rains in growing areas and new varieties cultivated in Uttar Pradesh. Indias annual consumption of the sweetener is estimated at 25 million tonnes, leaving room for exports.Several sugar mills were unable to pay cane price to the farmers because of the recent fall in sugar prices which have started falling below the cost of production, ISMA said in a statement. It added that there was concern about sugarcane farmers getting affected due to their cane price arrears accumulating.Increasing dues to cane growers will worsen farm distress in states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka where falling prices of crops like pulses and oilseeds have led to a dip in farm incomes.To deal with the problem ISMA said it met the government twice this week. According to the association the government could initiate steps like mandating sugar exports for every mill. According to its statement, ISMA also requested the government to raise import duties to 100% (from the current 50%) to stop imports from Pakistan.ISMA said it is exploring possibilities of preferential import duties for Indian sugar for exports to neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. If this happens early, it will ensure that all the extra stocks from India can get disposed of very fast, ISMA said."

I called up Rajasthan chief minister (Vasundhara Raje) and home minister (Gulabchand Kataria) but they denied their police had come to Gujarat to arrest me. This raised more suspicion and I switched off my mobile phones,"" he said.Togadia, a 'Z plus' category protectee, and one of the most vocal Muslim baiters in organisations linked to the RSS, said he then contacted his lawyers in Rajasthan to get the warrant against him issued in an old case cancelled.On being told that it cannot be done, Togadia said he decided to take a flight to Jaipur and appear before the court in Gangapur. He claimed when he was on way to the airport on an auto-rickshaw, he felt dizzy, and asked the driver to take him to a hospital. Togadia claimed he then fell unsconscious, and on regaining consciousness, found himself in a hospital.A team of Rajasthan Police had approached their Gujarat counterparts for help to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC, but could not find him at his residence.""I do not fear death, I do not fear encounter. But I had to protect myself while following the law of the land,"" he said.""I have been raising my voice for Hindus. I am raising issues like Ram temple, national law to ban cow slaughter, resettlement of Kashmiri Hindus in that state, giving farmers fair price for their crops. But an attempt is being made to silence my voice,"" he said.Speaking to reporters, Joint Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, J K Bhatt said investigation revealed that Togadia was conscious -- contrary to his account that he became uunconscious -- on his way to airport. He reached a spot near the airport in a car owned by his aide Ghanshyam Charandas, who then called a '108' ambulance.""Z-plus is one of the best security cover, as you get a pilot vehicle, a bulletproof vehicle and inspector-level armed personnel having AK-47 rifles. So it is nearly impossible to get killed in an encounter. It (Togadia's apprehension) is just a figment of imagination,"" Bhatt said.The Congress, a known ideological foe of the BJP-RSS, and its Gujarat ally Hardik Patel rushed to the Chandramani Hospital to inquire after Togadia's condition.""The ruling dispensations in Rajasthan and Gujarat have engaged in fake encounters even earlier. Togadia's apprehension is not without a reason,"" senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said.""An internal wrestling is going on in the BJP where attempts are being made to finish off the opponents,""Modhwadia said, and sought an ""independent and courtmonitored"" probe into the allegations levelled by Togadia, who was marginalised in Gujarat's Hindutva politics after Narendra Modi became the chief minister in 2002.Patidar quota agitation leader Hardik Patel also met Togadia separately. Patel, who backed the Congress in the recent Assembly elections in Gujarat, pointed fingers at Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah over claims made by Togadia.""Rights of common people are being snatched away. We (he and Togadia) can have different 'mat' (ideology) but our 'mann' (heart) is one. We all know what kind of conspiracies are being hatched by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. I don't know about Hindus, but a leader of a Hindu organisation is definitely in danger now,"" he said.Though the BJP did not react to Togadia's claims, veteran RSS leader M G Vaidya said only the VHP leader can reveal who was behind the alletged plot to eliminate him.""Togadia has said he will provide evidence (to show who was behind the conspiracy). We should wait till then,"" Vaidya said in Nagpur.""Only Togadia can reveal who was behind the conspiracy to kill him,"" Vaidya said, wondering how someone with Z-plus security can be eliminated in an encounter."

Owner of distilleries and sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, he was the richest candidate in the fray.Within days of the Congress forming the government, he faced allegations of impropriety for using frontmen to bid for sand mines in the state, but he brazened it out. Questions were raised over his familys power business.The latest controversy is about the enforcement directorates (ED) summons to his son, Rana Inder Partap Singh, in connection with raising funds abroad allegedly without the mandatory approval. HT spoke to Rana Gurjit about his resignation, his bte noire and the rumblings within the Congress.Excerpts:You kept saying that the Justice JS Narang Commission has given you a clean chit in the sand mine controversy. What made you resign?The reason is simple. I am in politics because of (chief minister) Capt Amarinder Singh. And I am a true Congressman. There was a smear campaign being run against me. Daily (AAP leader) Sukhpal Khaira was giving a statement against the government. Though I have been given a clean chit, it did not end. I, therefore, offered my resignation on moral grounds about a week ago.What was the final trigger?After sand mines, they have now started raising the issue of the ED summons. It was a public issue. The ED has the right to question anyone. When we are questioned, we have the right to give our reply to them. The public issue (through which funds were raised abroad) was in 2006. This case was being dealt by the ED office in Chandigarh for quite some time. Now, it has issued summons and the managing director of the company (Rana Gurjits son) will go and reply. There is no allegation. The ED wants some answers. Jheda gaddi leuga, challan odha hi houga. Who issues challan to those loitering on roads? Whatever we have earned is through our hard work.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira was demanding your resignation from the time when the sand mine controversy broke out.Sand mining is not an issue. Nothing was proved against me. The Narang commission has given its report, but they question everyone. I have resigned due to relentless tirade. It is for my party to decide now. Why doesnt Khaira also show some moral standard and resign from his position? He was issued summons in a drug case.When you gave the resignation, what was the CMs response?I cannot tell you that. This was between me and him.There is talk of rumblings within the party and there was not much support for you. What do you say?This is not true. I dont believe such talk. I believe in one thing that you should never suspect your party and your partner."

Photo: BloombergMumbai: Indian sugar processors have undermined their own margins in order to meet government mandates on when to pay cane farmers, which required them to sell supply onto the market at the same time they agreed to pay more for sugar cane.India, the worlds second-biggest sugar producer, requires the processors to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. The mills agreed in May to pay the farmers 11% more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year, which started on 1 October.Many mills struggled to raise funds from local banks to make the payments, said a senior official at the Sahyadri co-operative sugar factory based in Maharashtra.This has caused some mills to have fallen behind on the payments by an estimated 20 billion rupees ($312 million), said a government official who declined to be named.To meet the funding shortfall, mills boosted sugar sales which has caused the refined sugar market to drop by 13.1% to 3,189.50 rupees ($49.77) per 100 kg.The liquidity crunch forced a few mills to make distress sales. Sensing mills problems, traders also tried to bring down prices, said B.B. Thombre, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).The rapid decline in sugar prices means margins in the current year are likely to be lower than the previous year, said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugars , the countrys biggest refiner.The mills agreed to pay the higher cane prices expecting stable refined sugar prices, but have been caught out by the slump.The fall could slash profits for companies like Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Shree Renuka, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars by at least 15% from a year ago, said a Mumbai-based sector analyst with a brokerage.Mills raw material cost has gone up, but prices of the finished product, sugar, are falling, said the analyst, who was not authorised to speak to media.Simbhaoli Sugars said it is difficult to comment on margins now, while Dwarikesh and Balrampur declined to comment, citing regulations that limit communications before quarterly results, due in the next few weeks.Sugar prices may remain under pressure as the countrys sugar output in the next season could rise above the record 28.3 million tonnes produced in 2014/15, said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.It is now difficult to pay the assured price to farmers unless government intervenes to support prices, said WISMAs Thombre.The central government fixes the price that mills must pay growers annually, but some cane growing areas, especially the state of Uttar Pradesh, raise the price further to satisfy the demands of cane growers, a key voting bloc.

""Dignitaries like Bishop K A William, ex-mayor Ayub Khan, JD(S) leader Azezullah (Ajju) and priests from other shrines were felicitated.

""A section of the people also consider Pongal as the beginning of the New Year. The festival is being celebrated by various lingual ethnic groups with different names. Pongal is Tamil culture. It has not much related to the religion. It is related to nature. In this part of India, it signifies the end of winter as the Sun changes its path. Earlier, Keralites, irrespective of their religious faith, used to celebrate Onam. Nowadays, that unity is disappearing among the Malayalam-speaking communities. Institutions like religion, language, culture, organisations are there to unite people. Pongal is another excuse to bind people together in a culture,"" he said.'Positive change'Arokiyadas, another devotee said that only recently, we celebrated Christmas and the New Year in the shrine and, hence this has become a festival season.""The shrine premises is decked up traditionally with earthen pots and sugar cane. The faithfuls are in full attendance. It is nice to see them attend the festival mass in traditional dress. Some youth have come in white shirts and white dothis. The younger generation is respecting all cultures. They have a better understanding of culture and values due to their exposure to the information on the internet. This is a positive change,"" he said.Annai Mary, a faithful, said that religion, language, and culture are three different things.""Religion is related to faith in God. It is spirituality. A language is a tool for communication. Nowadays, we converse in multiple languages. However, we have a special attachment to our mother tongue as it was spoken by our forefathers. Culture is related to lifestyle. Our lifestyle depends on the climatic changes and the environment in which we live. Thus, Pongal is a part of our culture.

The Presidents physical exam today went exceptionally well, Dr. Ronnie Jackson said in a brief statement. The President is in excellent health, said Jackson after he conducted the first physical exam of the 45th President of the United States.Dr. Jackson has been a physician to the President for three consecutive administrations. He is scheduled to brief the media on January 16 when he is expected to provide a detailed readout of the exam. A routine annual affair for every US president, Trumps medical checkup is being widely reported and has drawn media attention in view of his political opponents raising questions about his health.Trump, 71, himself dismissed any question about his health. I think its going to go very well. Ill be very surprised if it doesnt, Trump told reporters on Thursday. It (had) better go well, otherwise the stock market will not be happy, he joked in response to a question on his health.Two months before the November 2016 election, Trump released a five-paragraph letter from his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, who concluded that Trump is in excellent physical health. The 2016 letter put Trumps blood pressure and cholesterol measurements in the healthy range, though he uses a cholesterol-lowering statin medication. His EKG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and blood sugar were normal.The 6-foot-3 Trump weighed 107 kilograms, and his body mass index, or BMI, of 29.5 put him in the category of being overweight for his height.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Speaking at the 4th National Update on Clinical Diabetes (NUCD-2018) organised by KIDS Diabetes and Multi-specialty Hospital and Cuttack Diabetes Research Foundation (CDRF), here on Saturday, Prof CB Sanjeevi of Karolinska University said the number of diabetes patients in India is rising at an alarming pace.The number has crossed 7.3 crore and the figure is expected to double by 2040. The disease, which is marked by increase in blood sugar level, affects all vital organs. If people adopt healthier lifestyle, Type-II diabetes cases can be reduced by at least 70 per cent, he said.CMD of KIDS Hospital Dr Alok Kanungo said diabetes has taken an epidemic form globally as almost every family is suffering from the long-term disease. If the disease is diagnosed at the primary stage, many complications can be checked, he added.Diabetes is a leading cause of blindness, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and lower limb amputation in many countries. Early screening of diabetes complication is an important part of effective management of the disease, Dr Kanungo said.There are around 40 lakh diabetes cases in the State which is an enormous burden. Screening reports reveal that six to seven per cent population has been detected with diabetes in rural areas and nine to 12 per cent in urban areas.The conference, attended by around 600 delegates from across the country, aims at educating treating physicians serving in rural and remote areas where health care facilities and infrastructure are either deficient or not available.Among others, Vice Chairman of KIDS Dr Mamata Tripathi, Prof Ashok Ku Das and Dr Abhaya Ku Sahu addressed the conference.

(Reuters/Carlos Barria)The Trump administrations anti-marijuana move has some members of the presidents voting base fuming. Fans of President Donald Trump who use marijuana say Attorney General Jeff Sessions move to tighten federal oversight of the drug is the first time theyve felt let down by the man they helped elect. The move feels especially punitive to Trump voters who work in the growing industry around legalized marijuana that has taken root in states of all political stripes.It remains to be seen whether Trumps pot-loving voters will take their anger to the ballot box in 2018 and 2020. But pro-legalization conservatives are also chiding the administrations anti-pot move as an affront to personal liberties and states rights.Trump needs to realize that a lot of his supporters are pro-cannabis and it would be extremely hurtful to them if he allowed Sessions to move forward with this, said Damara Kelso, a Trump voter who runs Sugar Shack Farms, a marijuana grower in Eugene, Oregon. Its not lazy pothead stoners smoking weed all day in their parents basement.Sessions move allows federal prosecutors to decide what to do when state rules conflict with federal. It comes as legalization of marijuana is at an all-time high in popularity with Republicans.A Gallup poll from last year found 51 percent of Republicans expressed support for legalization of the drug. It was the first time a majority of GOP supporters supported the idea and represented a jump of 9 percentage points from the previous year. In the early 2000s, only about one in five Republicans agreed with legalization.Legalization has also flourished at the state level. Maine, Nevada, Massachusetts and California all voted to make recreational marijuana use legal for adults in 2016. It is also legal in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Alaska and Washington, DC Alaska and Maine gave Trump electoral votes in 2016.Marijuana legalization is typically most popular with the libertarian-leaning wing of the Republican Party. But any such Republicans who felt Trump would be a pro-marijuana president were misguided, said Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard University economist who studies the economics of libertarianism with a focus on illegal drugs.Weed-loving Trump fans might be experiencing buyers remorse, but its too early to say whether that could make a difference at the voting polls, Miron said. Libertarians certainly knew when he appointed Jeff Sessions that there was a serious risk in an escalation of the war on drugs, he said. I think you get what you pay for.Still, some of Trumps high-profile supporters are criticizing the move.Roger Stone, a former Trump campaign adviser with whom the president has a long and rocky history, shared a video on Facebook on Jan. 7 urging Trump to support legalization and block Sessions move. And some Republicans in Congress have also slammed the decision.We have a Constitution to protect people from the federal government, Republican Rep. Jason Lewis, R-Minnesota, a Trump voter, said in an interview. This is a longstanding limited-government principle.Trump fans who use medical marijuana are also concerned they could lose access to treatment. In rural Fryeburg, Maine, college student Zac Mercauto drives two hours roundtrip, he said, to buy marijuana to manage chronic pain and other health problems. He said he would hate to lose that ability to federal politics.Mercauto is also one of thousands of Mainers who helped give Trump his sole New England electoral vote. Unlike most states, Maine splits its electoral votes by congressional district, and Trump won the vast 2nd District, home to both New England conservatism and a marijuana culture.Mercauto, who had his picture taken with Trump in 2016, said he is still a big fan of the president. But he believes the anti-pot move is bad for his states economy and health. I believe its going to take a hit at medical marijuana and the industry as a whole here in Maine, he said. Its disappointing to see him take that stab at the industry. And I guarantee you all the tax money the state of Maine from medical marijuana really helps people all around.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The micro details from states enable a better comprehension of the distance between what is and what can be in the political economy. This week the government of Maharashtra, arguably among the better-managed states, released its annual economic survey. Entrenched in the details are possibilities and predicaments that political India is faced with. Over 30,000 farmers from across Maharashtra are marching from Nashik to Mumbai. They plan to encircle Mantralaya, the seat of government, to corral political attention. The headline is about fall in overall growth, from 10 per cent to 7.3 per cent. The distress is located in the dip in agriculture and allied activitiesfrom 22.5 per cent to minus (-) 8.3 per cent.Credit to farmers is stymied by affordability and accessMaharashtras 40,959 villages have 2,979 banking offices. Of the net sown area of 17-plus million hectares, irrigation reaches barely 17.8 per cent. In the water-scarce state, the area under water guzzler sugarcane has nearly doubled since 2001. Yes, sugar pays more, but must it be cane, and why not tropical sugar beet, which consumes less water and delivers more? Given the impact of climate change, states need to adopt the paradigm of drip irrigation funded by incentives.Agriculture accounts for 11 per cent of GSDP but rural Maharashtra hosts 55 per cent of the 11 crore populace. Landholdings have shrunk to an average of 1.44 hectares, reducing viability. But naturally, the marching farmers are demanding a complete loan waiverand similar agitations are surfacing across India. The problem in Maharashtra represents the larger issue Bharat faces. Farming needs a new viability model with backward and forward linkages. All that talk about contract/group/collective farming must walk, and now!The consensus view is growth needs investments. State after state is holding investor summits (http://bit.ly/2ItemSongs7) announcing MoUs in lakhs of crores. But what is the conversion rate of intent into investment? The Maharashtra Survey reveals that between August 1991 and December 2017, the state received investment proposals worth `11.89 lakh crore, of which projects worth `2.92 lakh crore were commissioned.Mind you, Maharashtra is among the better performing statesone can imagine the gap in other states. Indeed, Maharashtra has claimed a better strike rate in the past years. The Survey says that of the `8 lakh crore worth of MoUs signed in 2016 in Maharashtra, investments worth `4.91 lakh crore are in various stages of implementation. Milton Friedman once said, The greatest advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science and literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized government. Ceteris paribus, or other things being equal, investment growth demands dismantling of the Centre-state permission raj.Development also depends on how the finances of the state are managed. On the face of it, Maharashtra is among the better-managed states. Yet it spends 12 rupees of every hundred to pay interest on its debt of `4.13 lakh croreand at an average of 8.4 per cent per annum. It begs a question: is the state government less sovereign than the Centre to pay a higher rate?Public finance ratios depend on how governments price services and manage subsidies. Take a look at the power sector. Agriculture accounts for 26 per cent of power consumption and Maharashtra is aggressively electrifying agricultural pumps. The question: must it be grid power why not promote solar-plus-hybrid pumps or inverters? Why not push metering and prepaid power through DBT for farmers?The Survey reveals: The aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of MAHADISCOM were 22.1 per cent, Tata Power 0.93 per cent and Reliance Infrastructure 3.63 per cent during 2017-18 up to October. AT&C is really a euphemism for inefficiency and theft  and it shows in the variation in losses between the state electricity board and private entities.An interesting factoid in the survey is about use of kerosene. The subsidised quota is about four litres per month and kerosene retails at around `25 per litre. The Survey reveals: Proportion of households using kerosene as fuel for cooking was highest in Mumbai Suburban (17.6 per cent) followed by Mumbai city (17.4 per cent) and Thane (14.7 per cent) districts. The reason, perhaps, is the high level of slum population. Why not bring these homes into the ambit of DBT-enabled LPG or piped gasbringing down subsidies, adulteration and pollution? The Centre has pushed for a kerosene-free regime in Puducherry and Chandigarh. Why not major metros?Reorganisation of expenditure will enable better spend on critical sectors like education and health. The Survey reveals the percentage of private unaided schools has shot up from 12.4 per cent to 21.1 per cent in just two years. Clearly, poor learning outcomes in government schools are a factorand the trend is national.This years Union Budget announced the big-bang National Health Protection Scheme. Maharashtra is an early subscriber of the idea of insured health care. The challenge is in the delivery. The infrastructure on the ground, with 6,981 government allopathic doctors and 108 beds per lakh population, is far from adequate. Rural Maharashtras 40,959 villages are served by 10,580 sub-centres, 1,814 primary health centres, 360 rural hospitals, 193 PHUs, 40 mobile units and 86 sub-district hospitals. At the national level, the inadequacy of capacity is worse. The issues embedded in Maharashtras Economic Survey have a national resonance. It is verily a WhatsApp message for India.shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"

The green manifesto talked specifically about formation of a separate Punjab State Commission for Environment and Congress had claimed that this commission would work solely on environmental issues in the state and deal with incidents like Beas molasses spillage with a tough hand. However, a year after, the commission is yet to be established.The manifesto had also promised a project to cleanse rivers of Punjab which had to commence with cleaning of Sutlej and Beas rivers. The other promises made by Congress in green manifesto included improving tree cover, water resources management, making rainwater harvesting mandatory, reviving water bodies, making Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) fully accountable.The manifesto read that a separate state commission will be established by Congress government.

(Express photo/File)The manifesto had also promised that Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) will be made accountable to take strict action against industries disposing industrial toxic waste into water bodies, rivers, canals, sewers and groundwater.It had also promised rivers cleaning project and the formation of a committee including environmentalists and social reformers to spearhead the project. The work of this project will start with the cleaning of Sutlej and Beas rivers, the document had promised.Finance minister Manpreet Badal had said that party has prepared a green agenda for Punjab as degrading environment is one of the biggest concerns.For Congress, degrading environment, depleting groundwater and reducing forest cover of Punjab is one the biggest concerns. We have come out with a concrete plan for environment issues in Punjab which no other party has ever done, Badal had said back then.Speaking to The Indian Express, a source from the PPCB said, Not a single point mentioned in green manifesto of Congress has been worked upon yet. The project to clean Beas river should have been a priority seeing it has endangered Indus river dolphins which are freshwater species and also the ghariyals. The separate commission for environment too should have been a priority but nothing has been done yet.Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira from AAP said that he is saddened by causal approach of Captain Amarinder Singh on environmental issues.While Beas tragedy has happened now, we also fear extinction of several other species in rivers of Punjab due to pollution and failure of government to check it. Human lives as well as aquatic life is in danger in Punjab due to toxic materials being released in our rivers and just by sealing a sugar mill, CM cannot wash his hands of the matter, said Khaira. He added that government has especially failed to check industries in Ludhiana releasing toxins in polluted Buddha Nullah stream which meets river Sutlej at village Walipur.Punjab Environment Minister O P Soni said, We have already taken action against the sugar mill responsible for this disaster in Beas. Promises made in green manifesto will also be fulfilled soon.For all the latest Ludhiana News, download Indian Express App"

(Picture used for representational purpose) Sugar prices are hovering at Rs 25-26 per kg with mills running up to Rs 1,999 crore as arrears. (Picture used for representational purpose)Staring at a bumper crushing season next year, sugar mills plan to sign export contracts with neighbouring countries before the start of the next season. Mills are targeting 3-3.5 million tonnes (mt) exports of raw sugar to Bangladesh and China and another 2-2.5 mt of white sugar to Sri Lanka. Maharashtras current sugar season officially ended on Wednesday. The state has produced 10.7 mt of sugar, the highest in the last 10 years. Maharashtra produced just 4.2 mt of sugar last year and the more than doubling of sugar production has literally thrown the economics of the mills to the winds. Sugar prices are hovering at Rs 25-26 per kg with mills running up to Rs 1,999 crore as arrears. With a bumper crop expected next year, mills have expressed reservations about their ability to pay the growers as sugar prices remain subdued.In order to ensure economics of operations, mills have hinted at an early start to the crushing season. Instead of the customary post-Diwali start in November, mills are thinking of beginning crushing operations in October and producing just raw sugar for the first two months. Also, to avoid a glut in domestic markets, mills are in the process of signing contracts with Bangladesh and China for export of raw sugar and with Sri Lanka for export of white sugar.The total export of raw sugar is expected to be 5-6 mt, which mills hope will keep sugar prices under reasonable limits in the domestic market and enable them to pay growers. Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the apex body of private mills, said they have written to the government seeking help in terms of credit to enable exports.Earlier, the central government had fixed an export quota of 2 mt of sugar for each mill in the country. Mills meeting the quota would be eligible for a subsidy of Rs 55 per tonne of cane crushed. The scheme failed to enthuse millers, who had pointed to the low international prices of sugar prevailing then. However, with Brazils production figures being revised due to diversion of ethanol as well as the ongoing moisture stress, international prices of white sugar have firmed up to Rs 20-20.5 per kg, making exports viable if taken with the subsidy component.As mills get ready for exports, they are seeking a relaxation in one of the clauses they feel might hamper their move to claim subsidy. The clause mandates mills to have followed all necessary government orders for the 2017-18 season and many mills say they have not been able to follow the order for maintenance of minimum stock. Most mills had already sold their sugar to raise money for paying the fair and remunerative price to growers and have failed to maintain stock, said a miller from Pune. This clause should be reviewed, say most millers.Sugar analyst Vijay Autade said mills should proactively export sugar to reduce the glut in the domestic market. The quota was decided on the recommendations of the industry and mills should adhere to it, he saidFor all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

It questioned the Centre over the need for such imports when sugar production in the country was in excess.Speaking to reporters, former state Cooperation Minister and senior Congress leader Harshvardhan Patil said, A Delhi-based company called Sakuma Exports Limited has exported chocolates to Pakistan and imported some 20 lakh tonnes of sugar from Pakistan. Why is this being done at the cost of our farmers?Patil claimed that the import policy of the Centre would affect domestic sugarcane producers to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore. The losses for sugarcane cultivators in Maharashtra itself would be around Rs 3,000 crore. With low prices domestically, how will sugar mills pay farmers from whom they have procured sugarcane, Patil asked.State Congress chief Ashok Chavan asked the Union government for an explanation and alleged that these imports had resulted in sugar prices per tonne falling from Rs 36,000 to Rs 24,000.He ridiculed Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that while the latter claimed that he would get fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim from Pakistan, all his government was managing to do was bring in sugar from the neighbouring country.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The quantum of the short margin problem is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore in the state.Sugar mills in Maharashtra are facing a financial crisis, which has stopped many of them from undertaking the necessary overhauling and maintenance work before the start of the next season. Almost all the mills have run into the problem of short margin, which has made them ineligible for preseasonal loan necessary for undertaking such work. This comes just months before the start of the next season, which has reported a bumper cane crop on an estimated over 11 lakh hectares.Short margin is a condition when sugar prices fail to cover the advances given to mills by banks. In such a scenario, mills are required to pay the shortfall to banks before sugar sale starts. Defaulting mills risk their accounts being termed NPA after 90 days following which they become ineligible for loans. At present, the quantum of the short margin problem is estimated to be around Rs 1,000 crore in the state.Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar, vice-president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, said mills had failed to pay labour contractors necessary to book labour for next year. Normally such contracts are finalised by the end of May but this year we have not been able to do so, he said. Similarly overhauling of the mills have stalled due to lack of capital. Many mills, Dandegaonkar added, had not paid their employees for several months. Mills in Maharashtra have run up cane dues over Rs 1,900 crore as of May 15.Last week, Union minister Nitin Gadkari, along with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Rural Development, Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde, met a delegation of mill owners. The millers urged the government to intervene to create a buffer stock of 50 lakh tonne, fix a minimum selling price for sugar, introduce a release mechanism for a year to regulate the sale of sugar and convert short margin into working capital loan. It has been done twice in the past and should be allowed again, he said.While mills have finalised export contracts, Dandegaonkar said because of the short margin problem they are not able to send out their shipments. Banks should be instructed to let the sugar for overseas markets leave without payment of margin money. Liquidity is a major problem for us now, he said. Over the past few days, sugar prices have seen a slight jump with ex-mill prices in Maharashtra being Rs 2,700 per tonne. Prices in UP are around Rs 3,000 per tonne.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo By Pavan Khengre,11.12.17,Pune.The sugar industry has come out strongly in favour of a release mechanism to stop the freefall in sugar prices. Under a release mechanism, the central government imposes a certain quota on the amount of a commodity that can be sold in the open market, in an effort to keep a balance between its supply and demand. Low prices have affected the economics of the sector, with sugar mills unable to pay farmers and running into cane arrears of over Rs 20,000 crore.The demand for a release mechanism was among those put forward by a delegation of the industry that met Prime Minister Narendra Modis principal secretary Nripendra Misra in Delhi on Tuesday.Recently, representatives of mills across the country had met under the leadership of former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to find a way out of the crisis. It was decided that Pawar would lead a delegation of millers to meet the Prime Minister and seek government intervention.During the meeting on Tuesday, millers discussed various issues pertaining to the sector and put forward some other demands that included deferment of loan installments and compulsory formation of a buffer stock. Meanwhile, as rumours circulated about the arrival of sugar from Pakistan at the Mumbai port, state Minister for Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh ordered a thorough investigation into the issue. Reports about stacks of sugar from Pakistan landing in Mumbai godowns had spread panic among the sector, which is already struggling with the onslaught of low prices.Speaking to The Indian Express, Deshmukh said the 100 per cent import duty on sugar had made any import non-feasible since the last few months. Back in February, the central government had hiked the import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, in a bid to stop the entry of imported sugar, as India had seen a bumper production. The final sugar production is estimated to be more than 300 lakh tonnes, while Maharashtra will end up producing 107 lakh tonnes of sugar.Meanwhile, sources said the sugar in question was imported long before the import duty was hiked to 100 per cent. The quantity of the sugar is not much, said a senior miller on the condition of anonymity.For all the latest Thiruvananthapuram News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo By Pavan Khengre)Maharashtras sugar season is nearing its end and only four sugar mills are continuing their crushing operations. With production crossing 107 lakh tonnes, the 2017-18 season has seen the highest production of sugar in the state. Of the 187 mills functional this season, 183 have ceased crushing operations. Two mills in Ahmednagar and one each in Pune and Satara districts are continuing operations. They are expected to close by the end of this month. Till Tuesday, the state has seen crushing of 951.95 lt of cane. This years sugar production has crossed the earlier record, made in the 2014-15 season, when the state had seen production of 105.14 lt of sugar.But the record production has failed to cheer the sugar sector, which is reeling under severe financial crisis. The fall in sugar prices has affected the millers, who have failed to pay the minimal fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers. Till April 30, millers in Maharashtra were facing cane arrears worth a whopping Rs 2210.63 crore. While 57 mills have paid 100 per cent of their dues, the rest have only been able to pay parts of it.Sambhaji Kadu Patil, the state sugar commissioner, had even issued notices against 10 mills, under the Revenue Recovery Code, to confiscate their sugar stock. The international prices of sugar are also not conducive for exports, say millers. Millers are also waiting for the Rs 5.5 per quintal subsidy, announced by the central government to clear cane arrears.Meanwhile, mills are considering whether to start the next season in October, as the state is likely to see a bumper cane crop over 10.7 lakh hectares of land. For a few months, mills are planning to produce only raw sugar, which has better export potential than refined white sugar. Unless we are able to reduce production, the price of white sugar will not go up and the vicious cycle of cane arrears will start again, said a miller from Ahmednagar.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

According to the Ministry of Water Resources, The irrigation potential in Maharashtra is 49.4 lakh hectares, whereas irrigated area was 24.47 lakh hectares. The irrigation potential created by local sectors (minor projects) is 17.32 lakh hectares and utilisation was only 2.07 lakh hectares.Maharashtra government is planning to pump more money into micro-irrigation projects to double agricultural income by 2022. The governments More Crop Per Drop programme aims to increase efficiency of water use through various measures, like diversification of crops and a phased shift in agricultural practices. In 2018-19, the state plans to optimise water efficiency by 20 per cent. The National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), in its annual report 2018-19, states, Currently, gross area under mirco-irrigation is around one million hectares with average area expansed by about 100,000 hectares in five years.While conceding the challenges ahead, the report adds, Considering that Maharashtras total area under agriculture is more than 20 million hectares and only 20 per cent of it is covered under the formal irrigation system, at present rate it would take decades before micro-irrigation systems can be installed in every farmers field.The government needs to ramp up coverage of the micro-irrigation systems by channelising more investments to bridge the gap.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed the Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Finance to revise the schemes to give more priority to micro-irrigation projects to achieve More Crop Per Drop. The states budget for irrigation projects and water conservation schemes is Rs 12,000 crore. According to estimates, the states overall expenditure after accounting for micro-irrigation will be Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 20,000 crore.In the last three-and-a-half years, the states priority was to make 25,000 villages drought-free. The state has made 11,247 villages drought-free (water neutral) and plans to make the rest drought-free by 2019 through jalyukt shivar projects. Micro-irrigation is a step initiated to bridge the gap between irrigation potential created and utilised.According to the Ministry of Water Resources, The irrigation potential in Maharashtra is 49.4 lakh hectares, whereas irrigated area was 24.47 lakh hectares. The irrigation potential created by local sectors (minor projects) is 17.32 lakh hectares and utilisation was only 2.07 lakh hectares.Among the two critical measures being undertaken to realise higher agriculture growth and income are increase in cropping intensity and diversification to higher value crops. A senior secretary in the water resources ministry said, Micro-irrigation is our priority. But we have to gradually make inroads and provide greater incentives to farmers to adopt changes. Among the incentives is urging financial institutions to provide agriculture loan to eligible farmers for micro-irrigation projects. Public-private partnership in the agriculture sector and contract farming are also high on the governments agenda.The state has also decided to bring all the land under sugar cultivation under drip irrigation. The kharif production for 2017 showed an increase in sugarcane crop from 6.33 lakh hectares in 2016 to 9.43 lakh hectares.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The solution to the sugar mess is simple: The Centre and states should stop fixing cane prices, besides reserving areas for mills.With cane payment dues to farmers by sugar mills touching Rs 20,000 crore, and hardly a year to go for the general election, the Narendra Modi government is understandably in a bind. Not for nothing, the last week saw the Union cabinet approve financial assistance of Rs 5.50 for every quintal of cane crushed during the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September), to enable mills discharge arrears to growers against the fair and remunerative price (FRP) payable to them. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, too, meet to discuss the levy of a special Rs 3-per-kg cess on sugar (whose proceeds would go to pay cane farmers) and lowering the 18 per cent rate on ethanol (produced by distilleries attached to mills).These moves dont address the root of the problem, which has to do with the political fixation of cane prices. It leads to farmers planting more area and mills producing excess sugar, causing its prices to crash  as they have, from Rs 36-37 to Rs 26.27 a kg, in the last six months. The resultant build-up of cane arrears, then, induces farmers to plant less. When that happens and sugar prices soar, governments intervene, this time in so-called consumer interest  by banning exports, allowing duty-free imports, imposing stock controls on traders and taking away the freedom of mills to decide when and how much quantity to sell at what rate. We have, indeed, seen all these measures  from pro-consumer to pro-producer  within the last two years. They are ineffective, at best, and market-distortive, at worst. The latest Rs 5.50-per-quintal assistance will barely cover the gap between the all-India average FRP of around Rs 287 and the Rs 215-220/quintal cane price that mills can afford to pay at current sugar realisations. The gap will be even more vis--vis the Rs 315-325/quintal price advised by states such as Uttar Pradesh. The proposed Rs 3/kg cess on sugar, over and above the GST rate, is a terrible idea. It will spur similar demands  on cloth for supporting cotton farmers, on tyres for rubber growers, and so on  while defeating GSTs goal of abolishing cascading of taxes.The solution to the sugar mess is simple: The Centre and states should stop fixing cane prices, besides reserving areas for mills. Once farmers have freedom to sell to mills of their choice, the latter would be forced to enter into contract cultivation arrangements and pay well to ensure uninterrupted cane supplies. Simultaneously, all controls on movement of molasses must go and baggase-based power plants be given the same incentives as those for solar, wind and other renewable sources. This is also the right time to make 10 per cent ethanol blending of petrol mandatory.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

PM Modi has been to half the ASEAN countries and the biggest of them, Indonesia, finally gets its turn.Modis summit with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, is an important one. They have met annually since their first meeting at the East Asia Summit (EAS) in Myanmar in 2014, the year when both were elected. Both India and Indonesia have among the worlds largest Muslim populace, which are youthful, aspirational and have a commitment to development. Both are members of the G-20, NAM, EAS and the like. Despite these similarities and the rather short distance between the Andamans and the Western State of Aceh in Indonesia, the distance in the mind is rather long. India and Indonesia have a common heritage, cultural and trade linkages going back to antiquity. Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam, all came through these exchanges to Indonesia. The existence of Hindu and Buddhist temples in Yogayakarta and Borobudur and the influence there of the Ramayana and Mahabharata are astonishing to the modern visitor. India and Indonesia were allies in the fight against imperialism but in the 1970s, they started looking away from each other, till the return of multiparty democracy to Indonesia.Since 2011, India and Indonesia are strategic partners, and an ambitious agenda of cooperation has been on the table but has not been implemented in a fulsome manner. The engagement needs to recognise the positive factors and the contradictions which impede it, to create a new paradigm which I call the Masala Bumbu effect (masala means spice in Hindi as bumbu does in Bahasa). In order to enhance the strategic partnership, five major aspects need consideration.On the political front, there are signs of thaw in our engagement. Many stalled bilateral fora have successfully met in the last year. We must rationalise their calendar and implement decisions in a timely way. This will be more important after PM Modis visit. More consultation on regional and global issues  G-20, EAS and maritime security and sustainable development, for instance will give them greater cohesion in our regional and global outlook. We need to recognise that Indonesia has a view of China and the BRI which is at variance with ours. But it recognises Indias balancing role in maritime security, has cooperated on the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and is not supportive of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on its anti-Indian rhetoric. Our political need is to focus on commonalities, discuss issues frankly and establish political trust.India-Indonesia maritime cooperation, exercises and patrolling between the Andamans and the Malacca straits have developed well. The engagement between the Indian navy and coast guard with the Indonesian navy has improved. We can now focus on supplying defence equipment to Indonesia and to look at joint production and development of such equipment. Indonesia requires a recognition of its capabilities and exploration of possible joint ventures would be appreciated. We could invest in a strategic port in Sumatra, which could support exports like coal and palm oil and support to Indian naval assets which require deep draught ports. A cooperative effort against terrorism and radicalisation needs to be high on the agenda.On the trade and investment side, it is not advisable to curb trade for a balance since imports by India of coal and palm oil give Indonesia a surplus. This surplus will increase, as five lakh Indians now visit Indonesia. This can be compensated by Indonesian investment in India and allowing better access to Indian entrepreneurs to the growing Indonesian market for infrastructure, healthcare, mining and power. A special fast-track facility should be sought from Indonesia to support Indian business houses to secure and maintain business interest in Indonesia. Most Indian businesses feel that Indonesia is partial to China. Indonesia needs to be equitable in their engagements with India. If five flagship infrastructure projects like airport, port, hospital, power plant and mines are put on the fast track, it will create substantive economic impact. Similarly, Indonesia must present five investment proposals to join the Make in India programme. This could be in palm oil, food processing, roads and highways and the like. Indonesia, which has opened its market to Indian beef and found its positive economic impact needs to do the same for pharmaceuticals, rice, sugar and infrastructure machinery.Around human resource development and education, much can be done by the two countries to fulfil each others aspirations. Most Indonesian students coming to India pursue religious studies, hardly any Indian students go to Indonesia. There is a need to develop a system of twinning universities to have common projects, faculty and student exchanges. The glorious days when Nalanda twinned with Muara Jambi need imaginative recreation.Our common cultural heritage needs to be updated. Common archaeology projects can be undertaken. An Indonesia-India Ramayana festival held periodically should encourage development in the related dance forms over ASEAN countries and beyond. Moreover, the mainstream Muslim organisations, Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah need to be more closely engaged as they are the best bulwark against radicalisation. Greater space to such civil society cooperation efforts will give a long-term and popular base for the new thrust expected to the India Indonesia relationship through the PMs forthcoming visit.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

They also generate a feel-good-factor as the taste lingers long after consuming their delicacies . Little wonder, the duo brought the best of herbs, cheese, fish, white wine, olive oil and other veggies all the way from their homeland to conduct a special masterclass at Hotel Imperial.The two have contrasting cooking styles but share a common passion for creating magic with traditional Italian recipes. Both Chef Attilio and Executive Chef Roberto, working at Belmond Villa San Michele, Florence, and Belmond Hotel Cipriani respectively, unveiled their secrets of Italian cuisine at the masterclass as part of an ongoing two-week festival at San Gimignano restaurant of the hotel which culminates on February 11.The guests were treated to a traditional Italian lunch eaten by families and young couples during summers. It comprised parma ham aesthetically decorated with cut slices of water melon, fish cooked in white wine and risotto. I found the meal hearty and wholesome/ The flavours came in with every bite, and Tuscan fish, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, ensured that cholesterol level didnt shoot up.The flamboyant Robertosays he gets irritated when he sees fusion which has gone horribly wrong. Fusion is confusion. I become angry when I see this. In Europe, Indian cuisine is incorrectly represented. They try qorma but it is nothing like what is made here.Giving his take on Indian food, he says, I want to master Indian cuisine. One of the most popular dishes in my restaurant is a curry dish.  He has plans to explore the spice market in Old Delhi and try local delicacies.Offering a piece of advise for those who cook Italian at home, he says: People should use seasonal vegetables and not imported ones. Roberto pitched in for Make in India when it came to veggies like aubergine, which is available round the year even while supporting Italian cheese and ham.Meanwhile, Chef Attilio, who makes tasty Tuscan food, started off with elementary tips like how yolk can easily be separated from the egg white without spilling it on the table. It is necessary for binding it with flour, he said, while mixing it with his hands.Garlic was virtually worshipped by the chefs as it plays a significant role in almost every Italian dish. They ensured that it was roasted and looked brownish. They emphasised that a balance is essential between different ingredients.Chef Attilio says: The key to good cooking lies in the fact that our ingredients are fresh and healthy and are combined in such a way that the taste of chicken would not be overpowered by any other ingredient. If it is a seafood dish, its taste should not be overpowered by garlic or any other ingredient.Noting that ham with water melon is eaten during summers, Chef Attilio says: In Italy, we have different kinds of ham which are eaten with fresh melons. Tuscan people eat mostly meat but slowly we are substituting that with fish as it is lighter to digest, is healthy and keeps the constitution well balanced.Advocating wannabe chefs to focus on the main ingredient, he says: If Italians prepare a sea food dish, then fish has to be the protagonist. Italian food is all about balancing ingredients.For the duo, the trip is helpful as it is not just about cooking and interacting with foodies but also about sharing of knowledge with Imperials Executive Chef Prem Kumar Pogakula, who plans to take them to Khari Baoli for spices and trying Mughlai delicacies.Chef Pogakula, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, and is cooking along with the two chefs, says in Delhi, people get to eat only Indo-Italian. Like we put garam masala, they dont use spices at all. Even pepper is not used in Tuscan region. Technically, there are flavours of Parmeson, thyme, rosemary and parsley.He underlines the importance of white wine in Italian cooking. It is used in risotto for de-glazing. When you put butter in onion for saut, the sugar in onion gets caramelised. That is the base which sticks on the pan. So the wine elevates the flavour.Summing up, Chef Pogakula, who will travel to Italy this year to promote Indian cuisine as part of a cultural exchange programme between The Imperial and Belmond Hotels, says India lacks in quality of ingredients because of logistical issues. Italian hotels run their own farms. Freshness of ingredients is an aspect where we need to focus on."
5b138e699855b762463782aa,Agriculture needs more than just quick fixes,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/agriculture-needs-more-than-just-quick-fixes/article22653015.ece,2018-02-05,"Bad surprise:The Budget saw no mention of policies to help counter the effect of climate change on farmer incomes.The governments efforts to focus on the welfare of farmers in the Union Budget is admirable. However, in a zero-sum situation such as budget allocation, the government often finds itself trying to choose between short-term results and long-term benefits. Short term results might come with loan waivers and increase of Minimum Support Price (MSP), but care should be taken to address the sectors competitiveness in a global scenario.By taking a quick fix path, the government might be squandering its budget on suppressing symptoms instead of administering a cure. I believe the long-term cure will be in the form of policies that provide a boost to credit growth, crop insurance, drip irrigation, warehousing, mechanisation and availability of skilled farm labour. This will help the farmer more than double his income in the long run. Yet, there certainly are a few hits and a few misses:The target for agricultural credit has been increased to Rs. 11 lakh crore from Rs. 10 lakh crore last year. This will empower farmers with much-needed funds to procure agricultural inputs in a timely manner. The Finance Minister has announced Rs. 2,000 crore for development of agricultural market infrastructure to link 22,000 local rural markets to the electronic national agriculture market platform. This will definitely help prevent undue volatility that creates stress for farmers.Labour, a basic component of agriculture is becoming difficult. Last year, the Union Budget had an allocation of Rs. 48,000 crore for MNREGA. It is said that this years budget may increase it to Rs. 60,000 crore. This scheme would provide long-term benefit if the labour force is tied up to assist farmers overcome scarcity in farm labour, the absence of which is forcing many to give up on agriculture altogether.Dangers around MSPThe Budget announced that the minimum support price (MSP) is to be fixed at 1.5 times of all input costs to protect the farmer. Care should be taken not to give too drastic an increase, which will render the commodity uncompetitive in global markets and unaffordable to mill owners. This might affect the farmer adversely if prices have to be corrected in the futureThe Finance Minister has launched Operation Green, and allocated Rs. 500 Crore to promote farmer producer organisations and agri-logistics associations. While it is a good measure, the amount allocated is quite meagre for a country of our size.Enhancement of mechanisation, drip irrigation and crop insurance should be encouraged given that climate change and global warming will effect output negatively. But surprisingly, there has been no mention of it in the 2018 Budget.It is heartening to hear that 100% deduction will be allowed to farmer producer registered companies having Rs. 100 crore as turnover irrespective of profit. This, along with new policies that will be announced to address procurement, demand and forecast, will give the much-needed impetus to improve farmers incomes.The agriculture sector gives employment to 50% of the total workforce and contributes 17-18% of the countrys GDP. On announcement of the Union Budget 2018, agriculture sector stocks surged with the slew of initiatives for the rural sector, including liberalising exports of agri commodities.However, based on the line of thinking that long-term competitiveness is better than short-term relief, this Budget is definitely a mixed bag. While the impetus given to agricultural credit and rural infrastructure is laudable, I think the Budget could have been truly progressive had it not put so much focus on the regressive policy of MSP.In future Budgets, I hope the government shifts even more towards forward-looking policies that boost the competitiveness of the agro-industry, and secure long-term growth in farmers income and quality of life.(The writer is MD, Gayatri Sugars, and former president, Indian Sugar Mills Association)"

The accompanying caption read: True leaders know who they are and what they stand for.The image seemed to suggest that the two had put behind alleged misunderstandings of the past to herald a reinforced bond ahead of the 2019 general elections. The post was later retweeted from Prasads handle.Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha termed the meeting as a new beginning. Time demands likeminded people to come onto one platform. Lalujis deteriorating health condition is a matter of utmost concern not only for his family, but everybody who wants him to be fit and active for the 2019 elections. We believe Rahulji also shares the same concern, he said.Jha went on to term the decision to shift the former Bihar chief minister back to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) at Ranchi as an unprecedented low in politics.In a letter sent to the AIIMS director, Prasad had accused the medical institute of transferring him to RIMS under political pressure. This contention also found reflection in a tweet by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, his son and opposition leader in the Bihar assembly, who asked: Who is forcing the AIIMS director to send him back?Jha said the party leader was still in need of continuous care and attention. That is what he was at AIIMS for. Any decision that affects Lalujis health will only go to show that the present-day government is acting with a mischievous design, he added.Prasad reportedly wrote to the AIIMS director because he had an inkling of the decision to transfer him. I have been told that steps are afoot to discharge me from AIIMS. I was sent here for better treatment, and Im still not well. I suffer from heart disease, kidney problem, sugar and a host of other ailments. I suffer from back pain and I often feel giddy. I fell in the bathroom quite a few times. My blood pressure and sugar suddenly jumps. My treatment here is still on, he said in the letter.The former chief minister further claimed that RIMS was unequipped to treat kidney ailments. It is the fundamental right of every citizen to avail medical treatment that meets his satisfaction. I dont know under what political pressure this sudden decision to remove me is being taken. As you are well aware, I am under custody and it takes 16 hours by train to reach Ranchi. Doctors are next to God, and they should not take any such decision under pressure.Prasad ended the letter by stating that if he were to come under any danger due to the transfer from AIIMS to RIMS, the responsibility will rest on all of you.AIIMS had decided to transfer the 69-year-old politician to the Ranchi institute after a medical board confirmed a marked improvement in his condition. Lalu Prasad is being referred back to Ranchi for management of his chronic issues. He is currently stable and fit to travel, it said in a statement.=================================================BLURBIn a letter sent to the AIIMS director, Prasad accused the medical institute of transferring him to RIMS under political pressure"

We screened 1.20 lakh pregnant women in past three months and found 2% of them to be as diabetic. Thus, the programme is being extended to more districts, said Swapna Das, general manager (maternal health) National Health Mission, Uttar Pradesh.She said that UP was first state to have so many districts facilitating diabetes screening for pregnant women.The scheme is there in several states but just four of five districts are covered under it, she said while talking to media on the sidelines of a training programme for doctors held in Lucknow on Thursday.Dr Uma Singh, an expert in the programmme, said that ideally pregnant women should get blood sugar tested in the initial phase of the pregnancy itself.If the result is negative, the test may again be conducted during the 24-28 week of pregnancy. However, if the result is over positive i.e., over 140, diet advise is given to control blood sugar. And if the result is 200 or above, medication is provided.She added that the test was simple. The woman is made to drink 75-gms of glucose and then a blood test is conducted.We hope the programme reaches every pregnant woman in state as it will help reduce the complications for mother and child which is caused due to diabetes during pregnancy, said Dr Singh."

(Below) Aberdeen Blair was among the 1,500-plus recipients of the MDA programme in Sawai village.special arrangement/getty imagesA narrow road winds past dense vegetation, idyllic beaches and rain-soaked villages glistening in sunshine. Along the way, profusely blooming pinwheelflowers frame prefab homes built on stilts in a likeness of their lost predecessors, the prized patis, which were handwoven with palm leaves, rattan and lalang grass.Goats bleat, pigs grunt and hens squawk around the dwellings that were once closer to the shore but were flattened, like nearly everything else here, on December 26, 2004. Local memory divides Car Nicobars long and sometimes violent history more simply now: before and after the tsunami.Aberdeen Blair (89), chief of the Car Nicobar Tribal Council, remembers more. When I was small, we had no money, sugar or rice. We only had coconuts. My parents did not wear clothes like this, he says, pointing to his lungi and T-shirt. Blair smiles as easily and often as he shifts between Nicobari, Hindi and English, and goes on to add, I have jeans, too. Everything has changed. The laminated certificates and photographs on the wall behind him document the highlights of such a lifetime.Nicobar is Indias southernmost district. Car Nicobar is its northernmost island and headquarters. The Nicobarese are the largest (numbering 27,186 in the 2011 Census), most urbanised, and most influential among the six better-known tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Their indigenous peers survive tenuously in the hundreds (Jarawas and Shompen) and tens (Great Andamanese, Onge and Sentinelese).Preventable blindnessOther numbers appear in fading paint on the walls of the houses here. MDA, it says, followed by a date, for three consecutive years  2010, 2011 and 2012. Mass Drug Administration is the medical response to a public health concern that entails treating the entire population of a specified area with a prescribed dosage of pharmaceuticals.The first woman ophthalmologist in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dr. Anita Shah (55), led such a project in Car Nicobar following the discovery of a hyperendemic and active infection of trachoma on the island. Trachoma is a contagious and preventable cause of blindness, rarely seen in India since the 1950s and 1960s. Blair and his 21-member tu-het (extended matrilineal family units of up to 100 people) were among the over 1,500 recipients of the MDA programme in the village of Sawai ( t-ka-sip in Nicobarese), west of the island.When I held eye camps in 2008, I noticed a steady stream of trachomatous trichiasis [sight-threatening conjunctival scarring, for which Blair was later treated] cases in Car Nicobar. My generation of ophthalmologists has hardly ever seen trachoma, let alone treat it. Yet I kept meeting young people in their twenties who had their lashes growing inward and eyelids fused. They lived in great pain, in darkened homes because they couldnt bear sunlight. I am a surgeon, not a community medicine specialist, but I knew a survey had to be taken up immediately, says Dr. Shah, Joint Secretary in the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) since 2008. She is a diminutive woman in the habit of providing precise instructions to her team, essential given the problems her location poses.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands endure severe inadequacies in intra-island transport, telecom, electricity, potable water and garbage disposal. Healthcare infrastructure is far from perfect. Nevertheless, a measure of confidence is inspired by the bustling sprawl of the G.B. Pant Medical College and Hospital in Port Blair, the referral medical institution for all the islands. This is where Dr. Shah is Deputy Director-Ophthalmology. The airy and clean B.J.R. Hospital in Car Nicobar, which she visits regularly, is one of two such district-level facilities.Dr. Shah had to tenaciously follow up for over two years to mobilise support for the Trachoma Rapid Assessment (TRA) in Nicobar 2010 survey by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dr. R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (RPCOS), New Delhi, and the Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Port Blair, with backing from the NPCB, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Islands are easily forgotten, she says matter-of-factly.In a far cornerThe Nicobar archipelago is separated from the Andaman cluster by the Ten Degree Channel, a minor international shipping route named so for its latitude north of the equator. The Indian Ocean tsunami arrived here at 7 a.m., roughly 40 minutes after the earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, and two hours before it reached the subcontinents southeastern coast. Car Nicobar, part of the Nicobar and Andaman Tribal Reserve Area and ringed by 51 km of silvery beaches, is approximately 1,450 km from mainland India.In Car Nicobar, the disused iron bridge in Kimious stands as forlorn evidence of the devastation. As a percentage of the total population, in India, the Nicobar Islands lost the most lives in the tsunami. The villages of Malaka and Kakana had the highest casualties. Mus was cut off by a subsidence of land and the pooling of backwater in several places. Tribespeople from Sawai, Arong and Teatop were pushed into the forests at the centre of the island, where they survived for a week without food or water before evacuation. They were moved out of overcrowded relief camps in Port Blair and elsewhere in the islands and resettled in Car Nicobar nearly two years after the tsunami. Dr. Shahs surgical outreach began after their return.Two teams investigated Dr. Shahs concerns by examining 7,277 inhabitants of 10 clusters selected for the highest risk of developing trachoma. The TRA found a very active trachoma infection rate of 50.8% in children aged 1-9 years, with the proportion of infected children in the surveyed villages ranging from 37.5% to 73%.We were shocked and surprised by the magnitude of the trachoma burden in Car Nicobar, says Dr. Praveen Vashist, Professor and Head, Community Ophthalmology Department, RPCOS, AIIMS, who made four trips to the island over the course of the project. I did not realise that the location was so difficult to reach. An MDA covering an entire tribal population in a remote location was a first for India. It was a different experience for us. Active trachoma infections in children occur without any symptoms. If they are not treated, they lead to irreversible blindness in adulthood. We found that, due to the tsunami, there were no children under the age of six in Kimious village.Trachoma occurs upon repeated infections from the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It thrives in congested living conditions among populations that have limited access to water and healthcare. It is transmitted by flies, and aided by poor personal hygiene and fomites (shared objects such as towels, utensils and bedding, which are likely to carry the infection). The 2010 TRA also notes, Co-habitation of Nicobari people with animals like pigs, hens, goats, dogs, cats etc. could be a contributory risk factor.Going the distanceDoctors travelled for the MDA by helicopters with few seats. Services were often called off in uncertain weather. There is no scheduled ferry to Car Nicobar and administrative personnel posted here face frequent shortages in the supply of basic groceries, including vegetables, which come from Port Blair. Dosage had to be measured individually (20 mg per kilo of body weight). Dispersed neighbourhoods were covered simultaneously to prevent the recurrence of infections. It was tedious and tiring work.Dr. Vashist says: The local team led by Dr. Shah was exceptional. Our work was made easier by the friendly Nicobarese people. We only had to explain to the chiefs, and the villagers would follow the instructions. Each of the 15 villages in Car Nicobar, distributed over 127 sq. km, elects a Captain for a five-year term. Blair is the head of their council for his lifetime.The operation to treat trachoma is quick and is performed under local anaesthesia as a day-case procedure. Patients can get back to work very quickly (a point emphasised before surgery, since lost working time is a major concern for them). The risk of wound infection is relatively low because of the good blood supply of the eyelid and therefore surgery can be performed in patients own villages.The medical team set up slide shows on the World Health Organisations (WHO) SAFE (Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics for infections, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement) guidelines in schools and community halls, and at venues near churches, such as the rebuilt chapel in Mus, a pilgrimage site that has the grave of Bishop John Richardson, after whom the district hospital in Car Nicobar is named.The late Padma Bhushan awardee was the first Nicobarese to be ordained an Anglican priest. Hes credited with establishing the village councils and authoring a primer on the Car language, into which he also translated the Bible. Blair has Bishop Richardsons laminated photo in his living room.Public health initiatives cannot succeed without the support of local communities, says Dr. Promila Gupta, Deputy Director General, NPCB, adding that blindness comes with considerable economic costs in terms of livelihoods lost.Blind curveWell over half a century ago, from 1959 to 1963, trachoma was a major public health problem in three States  Punjab (79.1% occurrence), Rajasthan (74.2%) and Uttar Pradesh (68.1%)  show data from NPCB. The National Programme for Control of Blindness was launched in 1976. The flagship Central government initiative emanated from what was originally the Trachoma Control Programme of 1963. It no longer lists the disease as among the leading causes of blindness in India, which today are cataract (62.6%) and refractive error (19.70%). The trachoma outbreak in Car Nicobar has been the only recent exception.On the days we had asked everyone in a village to be present, we would sometimes work till 9 in the night, says Yashumeri, 34, a cheerful staff nurse at the B.J.R. Hospital. Team members recall being welcomed with sweet tender coconut water everywhere they went. The Nicobarese call themselves holchu (friend), although the term can be used pejoratively by the islands settlers.Yashumeris familiarity with the area came in handy when refrigerators had to be commandeered to maintain the tricky cold chain for liquid azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that had to be transported from mainland India to Car Nicobar. A tablet substitute was eventually found for the second round of the MDA programme in 2011.Meticulously maintained registers list absentee and sick residents (for follow-ups), pregnant women (who were not included), and deaths. If someone missed a dosage, we would return to make sure they took it, says John James, 44, the first Nicobarese ophthalmic assistant on the island.I was so nervous when a prevalence survey was conducted in 2013, after the third round of MDA, admits Dr. Shah, who was hugely relieved to find that the active trachoma infection in children was down to 6.8% from the 50.8% that it was in 2010. This was, however, still above the 5% allowed by the WHO. Meanwhile, patients who had got their vision back and were free from pain began asking for eye drops. They took delight in how big their eyes suddenly appeared. ICE (information, communication, education) outreach and eyelid correction surgeries continue even now.Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of 41 countries of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East, says the WHO, which has been pushing the GET 2020 (Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020) alliance since 1996. India is a partner. When Car Nicobar was again assessed in February 2017, trachoma prevalence was down to 1.6%.India moved to apply for trachoma-free status over a meeting with WHO officials on January 11, 2018, after the release of the National Trachoma Prevalence Survey 2014-17 by Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare J. P. Nadda in Delhi on December 8, 2017. The survey covered 10 districts from seven States and Union Territories, among them East Delhi, Bikaner, Banaskantha and Car Nicobar. It shows that the overall prevalence of active infection among children below nine years is only 0.7%. We expect to meet the 2020 target, Dr. Vashist says.Eye on the futureTime moves differently on Car Nicobar. The roar of the ocean is audible as a small group of men and women work silently. They are preparing the soil outside an (also prefabricated) elpanam or death house, next to a modest cemetery with a handful of crosses on cement platforms. The community gets involved in funerary tasks as it does with wedding festivities and shared parenting, the latter a custom known as haruk , which ensures that no child is orphaned. Access to Car Nicobar is highly restricted under the Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956, and provides some protection to indigenous ways of life.The 2004 tsunami was not the first to devastate the islands: patchy records exist for major earthquakes in 1847, 1881 and 1941, and another tsunami that originated in Sumatra in 1861. But the last one has altered life here.The Central government adopted a one-size-fits-all rehabilitation policy to build nearly 10,000 twin (instead of freestanding) homes across 11 islands. Reinforced cement concrete, aero-con blocks and corrugated galvanised iron sheets imported by large contractors from mainland India at an average cost of Rs. 10 lakh per unit replaced locally sourced, natural building materials. Not enough thought was given to subsistence-specific locations, gender-sensitive land rights, natural ventilation suited to the tropical weather, and the ability to effect repairs with local materials.On the white-sands Malaka beach, named for the strategic strait near Aceh in Indonesia, a lush jungle has already claimed what used to be, before the tsunami, beachfront residential quarters for Indian Air Force officers. The island is no longer a family station for them. Nicobarese leader Edward Kutchat, it is said, granted land for this airbase in exchange for the coat that Jawaharlal Nehru was wearing when they met sometime in the early 1960s.The sun rises as early as quarter past five even on a January morning, and lights up the pristine coastline. The scattered debris of plastic garbage washed up by the waves is not immediately obvious, quite like its environmental implications. Even the twinkle in Aberdeen Blairs eyes will only hint at them. Dr. Shah, who appreciates his gentle way of speaking, never fails to visit the elder on her trips to the island.Blairs Prototype twin unit designed and constructed by Central Public Works Department is one of the 3,941 permanent shelters allotted to Car Nicobar in 2006. Rendered frail by age, Blair is mostly confined indoors these days. He credits the doctors at B.J.R. Hospital with treating a fracture of the tibia and saving his life when he had a stroke, some years after his close call with trachoma and blindness. Oh, I am very lucky, he adds, his hand making a sweeping gesture that included his sofa, TV, Nicobarese Bible, and polite grandson serving tea in ceramic cups. At least I have a place to live, you see?Public health initiatives cannot succeed without the support of local communities.Promila Gupta,Deputy Director General, National Programme for Control of BlindnessWhen I held eye camps in 2008, I noticed a steady stream of trachomatous trichiasis cases in Car Nicobar.

The PPCB said all 33 units discharge effluents into nearby nullahs or water sources but the mill at Kiri Afgana is the closest to a river.We wont let mills flout pollution norms and we dont want them to shut operations either, Soni said after taking stock in Chandigarh.The state forest and wildlife department prepared a damage report against the mill under Sections 30, 32, 50, 51, 36-A of the Wildlife Protection Act. District forest officer Rajesh Mahajan said the damage report is an official document and is equivalent to the first information report (FIR) registered by the police.Mill denies wrongdoingThe mill is owned by Delhi-based Jasdeep Kaur Chadha, the wife of the late Hardeep Singh Chadha, said the mills unit head Munish Pal. Hardeep was liquor baron Ponty Chadhas brother. Ponty and Hardeep died in a crossfire in 2012.Pal said, It was an accident. Basically, it was spontaneous reaction. We could not control it. The release of the molasses was spontaneous. The government should understand our situation.He said the mill authorities had written to the National Sugar Institute in Kanpur to find the root cause of the incident and evolve preventive measures.The molasses did not contain any harmful element. The byproduct is used to prepare edible items. I dont know how the fish died, he said. We dont release any waste matter into the river, he added.(With inputs from Chandigarh)"

They have also been instructed to make up for the shortfall in area under paddy by encouraging farmers to raise pulses, millets or oilseeds.Issuing these instructions at a zonal level meeting which was held here on Friday to review the foodgrain production situation for the current year, Director of Agriculture V. Dakshinamoorthy reminded the officials that the State had a target to exceed 100 lakh tonnes of foodgrain production during 2017-18.RainfallSome districts of the State have received normal rainfall whereas some others showed deficit during the North East monsoon. Samba paddy crop has been affected due to deficit rainfall in some areas. Keeping this in mind, field officers should concentrate on bringing more area under navarai paddy cultivation wherever filter points are available, he said.The shortfall in area under paddy should be covered by pulses, millets or oilseeds and farmers should be encouraged to make use of schemes such as Mission on Sustainable Dry land Agriculture (MSDA), National Agriculture Development Programme (NADP) and National Food Security Mission (NFSM) to achieve the foodgrain production target. Farmers should also be advised to go in for high yielding and disease-resistant varieties and encouraged to take to inter-cropping and bund cropping, he said.Speaking to The Hindu after the meeting, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy expressed confidence that the shortfall would be bridged as there was still time.K. Rajamani, District Collector, Thangasamy and P. Sankaralingam, Additional Directors of Agriculture, Dhanasekaran, NFSM consultant, S. M. Uduman Mohideen, Joint Director of Agriculture, Tiruchi, and agriculture officials from Perambalur, Dindigul, Karur, Ariyalur and Pudukottai districts participated.Earlier, Mr. Dakshinamoorthy made field inspections for a first hand account of the implementation of various government schemes, including the field of a sugarcane farmer at Thuraikudi where a shade net has been installed to raise sugarcane seedlings under the Sustained Sugarcane Initiative being implemented in association with a private sugar mill."
