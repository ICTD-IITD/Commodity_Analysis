However, despite the dip in the wholesale prices, the retail prices of these commodities are still high. Taking cognisance of this, consumer activists demanded that the retail prices of milk and sugarcane also be slashed.We are closely watching the situation and are conducting a comparative study of the previous years market prices of milk and sugar. We will ask the government to intervene in bringing down the prices on the basis of the production cost, said Shirish Deshpande of Mumbai Grahak Panchayat.Milk producing farmers have been on a strike demanding that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government last year be implemented. Similarly, the per quintal ex-factory price of sugar dropped to 2,800 from 3,600, owing to unprecedented production of sugar in the state last season.This year, milk production has gone up to 132 lakh litre a day from 115 lakh litre a day last year. Sugar production in the state is expected to be 107 lakh tonnes as against 42.38 lakh tonnes in 2016-17, according to industry figures.Of 132 lakh litres, 94 lakh litres are sold in pouches by various brands. If the pouches are sold at the same MRP to the customers, why are farmers not getting the same procurement price as last year? This is exploitation of farmers and consumers, said Ajit Nawale, general secretary, Maharashtra State Kisan Sabha, who is leading the farmers strike. Milk cooperatives are sustaining huge losses owing to excessive production and rise in overhead expenses. Its not possible to reduce selling price, said Arun Narke, former president of Indian Dairy Association and director of the cooperative that sells milk with the brand Gokul."

Sailu, Gopi, Meera and Nagalaxmi participated in the hunger strike. A few days ago the committee after 100 days of agitation withdrew from the fast temporarily.The agitators said they would continue the fast till a clear assurance comes from the Government for taking over the eight-decade-old factory and running it under its administration for the benefit of workers and sugarcane farmers. Due to its closure two years ago about 250 workers were rendered unemployed and their families suffered financially.Many of them were dying of hunger and diseases due to unemployment and hunger said the NSFPC leaders and sought to remind the TRS leadership that its electoral promise to takeover the factory within 100 days of its coming to power.Congress, TDP and Siva Sena organised padayatras in the Bodhan constituency on the demand."
5b13a5d79855b7624637906f,"To Pressurise Haryana Govt, Private Sugar Mills Delay Payment of Sugarcane Farmers",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-pressurise-haryana-govt-private-sugar-mills-delay-payment-of-sugarcane-farmers/story-yI0JAgEfpnaPDEGPk4BiuM.html,2018-05-10,"In a bid to build pressure over the government for more financial assistance, private sugar mills have delayed the payments of sugarcane growers. The sugar mill owners allege that they are incurring losses due to the sudden fall in the prices of sugar. Sugar price has fallen to Rs 3,000 per qintal from Rs 4,100 per quintal in the past three months.The Saraswati Sugar Mill (SSM) of Yamunanagar, which is one of the largest sugarmills of the country and crushes about 30% of the total produce in Haryana, did not make any payment to the farmers since April 12 and the pending amount has reportedly increased to Rs 80 crore.Though the Union government has announced financial assistance of Rs 5.50 per quintal for cane crushed by sugar mills in the ongoing season, the private mills seeking more assistance from the government say that they are unable to make payments because the state government has announced the State Advisory Price for sugarcane at Rs 330, Rs 325 and Rs 320 for early, mid and lateral varieties respectively, which is the highest in the country.The Rs 5.50 per quintal support by the Centre is insufficient. At present, we are selling sugar at Rs 2,700 per quintal against the production cost of Rs 3,400, thus, it is impossible for the mill to clear the pending payments of farmers without more aid from the government, said SC Sachdeva, chief operating officer of the SSM Yamunanagar.As per the Sachdeva, the mill has already procured about 1.60 crore quintals of sugarcane this year against the target of 1.72 crore quintals.Similarly, the Piccadilly Sugar Mill of Bhadson has also slowed disbursement of payments and only payments for sugarcane purchase till March 20 have been made.On the other hand, farmers are demanding government help to get their payments from the mills. The mills claim that they are in loss now and targeting farmers, but they never shared their profit with farmers when the prices of sugar were above Rs 40 per kg, said a sugarcane grower Parveen kumar of Karnal.Meanwhile, Haryana Sugarfed chairman Chander Prakash Kathuria said, We are thankful to the Union government for the given financial support to the farmers but we will soon hold a meeting and discuss the financial condition of the mills.About the demand of more financial aid by the mills, he said, Though the private mills have other options to generate income, we will look into the delay in payments to farmers.The sugarcane acreage in the state has jumped to 1.25 lakh hectares against about 1 lakh hectare of last year and as per the governments projection, the sugar production in the state was likely to remain around 7.25 lakh tonnes against the 6.68 lakh tonnes of last year."

There are between five and 11 Indus river dolphins in the 185-km stretch of the Beas that flows through Punjab, according to the first organised survey by World Wildlife Federation-India and the state department whose report came out earlier this month. The health of the dolphin sighted was reported as normal by the team, the officer further said. Photographic evidence was not immediately available.Since the leak from Chadha Sugar Mill at Kiri Afgana village killed hundreds of fish, teams were fielded by the department in collaboration with WWF-India to check on dolphins and gharials. Some of the gharials  the river has 47 in all  were already sighted, but worries over the dolphins, among the rare species in the river, remained.Further, Geetanjali Kanwar, coordinator for the WWF team, said they found the movement of the dolphin was fine, and the survey will conducted further to ascertain the exact condition of the animals. Earlier in the day, Mahavir said, Had the dolphins died, the bodies would have been seen floating on the surface. It is a tough task to sight them anyway.He added that a final report of the survey and the autopsy of the dead fish would come on Monday. It should be able to suggest the fate of the species in the water, he added.Report filed in courtAlso, the forest department on Saturday directly submitted the damage report on details of habitat loss caused by the spill of molasses into the Beas river, at the local court of Batala in Gurdaspur district.The department prepared the report on Friday under the Wildlife Protection Act, and officials stayed in the court complex throughout the day but failed to file it in the court as the district attorney was busy. On Saturday too, they could not file it through the district attorney and submitted it directly instead. Confirming, district forest officer (Gurdaspur) Rajesh Mahajan said they have been told the report will be considered on Monday. The report is equivalent to a first information report (FIR) as is registered by the police. The mill management has said the leak was an accident.Mill used to release fluid in river earlier tooFurther, on Saturday, Sushil Kumar, a fish contractor, said he had lodged a complaint to the department of fisheries on April 6 this year against the Gurdaspur sugar mill as it used to spill acidic fluid into Beas river that caused me loss of lakhs of rupees. A resident of Qadian, Kumar said the complaint was addressed to assistant director of the department at Hoshiarpur, but no action was taken. He also sought compensation from the government.When contacted, Kulwinder Singh, the assistant director, said, After the complaint, our team visited the site of the mill in the presence of the contractor, but found no such practice there.This is a false allegations as our mill does not indulge any such activity, said Munish Pal, the mill unit head."

Unless there is transparency in electoral funding, we will have to live with some form of corruption, she said while delivering the K.S. Narayanan Oration 2018 on the topic Doing business in India today  Does it call for a compromise?Ms. Aga said that businesses which are most susceptible to constant government intervention are likely to be corrupt. In spite of liberalisation, there are certain sectors which need several government clearances, and this breeds corruption, she said.Citing examples, she said the politically sensitive Indian sugar industry with its roots in agriculture is one such industry wherein successive governments have routinely intervened in every aspect from the price of cane to the selling, marketing and distribution of sugar. It is accepted and well known that mill owners can survive only by bribing State-level politicians. This seems to be improving but still there is a long way to go, she said.Nothing can be achieved in the mining sector without greasing the palms of the bureaucrats and government officials. Until the entire system goes through a drastic clean-up, not much can be achieved, she added.Uday Kotak, founder and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, recalled his early life and how he started his career in a 200 sq ft space. He explained how being transparent with customers and business partners helped in the growth of his business. The K.S.

5b13abc39855b762ecebe4bb,A game of chicken: how India’s poultry farms are spawning global superbugs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/a-game-of-chicken-how-indias-poultry-farms-are-spawning-global-superbugs/article22599482.ece,2018-01-31,"On a farm in Ranga Reddy district near Hyderabad, a clutch of chicks has just been delivered. Some 5,000 birds peck at one another, loitering around a warehouse which will become cramped as they grow. Outside the shed, stacks of bags contain the feed they will eat during their five-week-long lives. Some of them gulp down a yellow liquid from plastic containers  a sugar water fed to the chicks from the moment they arrive, the farm caretaker explains. Now the supervisor will come, she adds, and we will have to start with whatever medicines he would ask us to give the chicks.The medicines are antibiotics, given to the birds to protect them against diseases or to make them gain weight faster so more can be grown each year at greater profit. One drug typically given this way is colistin. Doctors call it the last hope antibiotic because it is used to treat patients critically ill with infections which have become resistant to nearly all other drugs. The World Health Organisation has called for the use of such antibiotics, which it calls critically important to human medicines, to be restricted in animals and banned as growth promoters. Their continued use in farming increases the chance that bacteria will develop resistance to them, leaving them useless when treating patients.Growth promotersYet thousands of tonnes of veterinary colistin was shipped to countries including Vietnam, India, South Korea and Russia in 2016, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism can reveal. In India, at least five animal pharmaceutical companies are openly advertising products containing colistin as growth promoters.One of these companies, Venkys, is also a major poultry producer. Apart from selling animal medicines and creating its own chicken meals, it supplies meat directly and indirectly to fast food chains in India such as KFC, McDonalds, Pizza Hut and Dominos.In Britain, Venkys is best known for having bought the football club Blackburn Rovers in 2010. They made a TV advert showing the team eating a Venkys chicken dinner before playing a match, with the slogan Good for you. Since then Blackburn Rovers has dropped out of the Premiership, been relegated again, and is now in the third tier of English football  with fans protesting the clubs decline.Venkys sells colistin to farmers in India as a growth promoter. It comes in bags with pictures of happy-looking chickens on the packet. Instructions say the product improves weight gain and 50 grams should be added to each ton of chicken feed. The Bureau bought 200 g of Venkys-branded colistin  Colis V  over the counter from a poultry feed and medicines shop in Bangalore without a prescription. There is no legal requirement for one in the country. In Europe, colistin is available to farmers only if prescribed by a vet for the treatment of sick animals.Venkys is not breaking any laws in the country by selling colistin and it said it will comply with any future regulatory changes. The company told the Bureau: Our antibiotic products are for therapeutic use  although some of these in mild doses can be used at a preventive level, which in turn may act as growth promoters [...]We do not encourage indiscriminate use of antibiotics.Venkys also exported colistin to Nepal and Yemen last year, Customs data show. Other poultry companies are selling colistin products or importing it for use on farms, according to the data.Venkys also told the Bureau that on their own farms and those of their contractors, antibiotics are used only for therapeutic purpose.McDonalds, KFC, Pizza Hut and Dominos said the chicken they source from Venkys is not raised on growth-promoting antibiotics and their suppliers follow their policies controlling their use of antibiotics.McDonalds has pledged to phase out the use of critically important antibiotics by 2018 for markets including the EU and the U.S.  with an extra year for phasing out colistin in Europe. KFC has made a similar promise about its U.S. supply chains. They have promised to do the same in India, but without giving any timeframe. Jubilant FoodWorks (which owns Dominos) has set a date, of 2019, to start phasing out the drugs.Resistant genesTimothy Walsh, a global expert on antibiotic resistance, called the Bureaus findings about the ready availability of colistin in India deeply worrying, and described the use of colistin in poultry farming as complete and utter madness. Walsh, who is Professor of Medical Microbiology at Cardiff University, and his Chinese colleagues discovered a colistin-resistant gene in Chinese pigs in 2015. The gene, mcr-1, could be transferred within and between species of bacteria. That meant that microbes did not have to develop resistance themselves, they could become resistant just by acquiring the mcr-1 gene.The discovery was met with worldwide panic in the medical community as it meant the resistance could be passed to bugs which are already multi-drug resistant, leading to untreatable infections. Rampant use of the drug in livestock farming has been cited as the most likely way mcr-1 was spread. It has been detected in bacteria from animals and humans in more than 30 countries, spanning four continents. Another four colistin resistant genes (mcr-2 to mcr-5) have been discovered since. Colistin-resistant bacteria, once rare, are now widespread.Colistin is the last line of defence, said Professor Walsh, who is also an adviser to the UN on antimicrobial resistance. It is the only drug we have left to treat critically ill patients with a carbapenem-resistant infection. Giving it to chickens as feed is crazy.Colistin-resistant bacteria will spread on the chicken farms, in the air surrounding them, contaminate the meat, spread to the farm workers and, through their faeces, flies will spread it over large distances, he continued.Colistin should only be used on very sick patients. Under any other circumstances, it should be thought of and treated as an environmental toxin. It should be labelled as such. It should not be exported all over the world to be used in chicken feed.Professor Dame Sally Davies, Englands chief medical officer, also called for a worldwide ban on the use of not just colistin but all antibiotics as growth promoters. If we have not banned growth promotion within five years we will have failed the global community, she told the Bureau.Drug resistance has been called one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development by the World Health Organisation. If antimicrobials stop working, doctors wont have effective drugs to treat deadly infections. Currently the problem is thought to kill 700,000 people worldwide  one person a minute  though these figures have been disputed by some academics. The death toll is expected to rise to 10 million by 2050 if no action is taken, with 4.7 million of those deaths in Asia. Common procedures like joint replacements, Caesarean sections, organ transplants and chemotherapy could also become too risky to carry out.The Bureau has tracked more than 2,800 tonnes of colistin for use on animals shipped to India, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia, Nepal, Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Mexico and El Salvador in 2016. The total is likely to be higher as the product may be shipped under its brand name rather than being labelled as colistin. By comparison, the U.K. uses less than a tonne a year of colistin in agriculture.Colistin is manufactured by two companies in India but the country is also importing at least 150 tonnes of the drug a year.India has been called the epicentre of the global drug resistance crisis. A combination of factors described as a perfect storm have come together to hasten the spread of superbugs. Unregulated sale of the drugs for human or animal use  accessed without prescription or diagnosis  has led to unchecked consumption and misuse. India has a large population, some of whom defecate in the open, and waste is often poured untreated into rivers and lakes, creating the perfect conditions for bugs to share resistance.Poor sanitation means people often catch infections that require treatment with antibiotics. Overuse of the drugs in hospitals has created antibiotic resistant hotspots, and poor infection control means these bugs spread within the hospital and into the community. Some of the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing antibiotics have also failed to dispose of antibiotic-ridden waste properly, fuelling the spread of resistant bugs in the environment.All of these factors have led to high rates of resistance. In India, 57% of the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria  which commonly cause urine, lung and bloodstream infections  are resistant to last-line antibiotics known as carbapenems. In the U.K., by comparison, the figure is below 1%. Doctors in some areas of the country see patients with pan-resistant infections (immune to nearly all antibiotics) at least once a month. The Centre does not collect figures on how many people are dying of resistant infections, but one study estimates drug-resistant infections kill 58,000 newborn babies every year.Bugs bred in the country spread globally. One which particularly worried scientists is a gene called New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), which makes bugs resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. This has been dubbed the nightmare bacteria by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. because it kills half the patients who develop a bloodstream infection.NDM-1 was first found in a patient who acquired it in India in 2008 and has since spread all over the world, with over 1,100 laboratory-confirmed cases in the U.K. since 2003. It is far from the only one being spread from the country. The mcr-1 gene, which confers colistin resistance, spread round the world in three years. Some 11% of travellers to India between January and August 2015 came home colonised with mcr-1 bacteria, a recent study found.Fast-growing industryIn India, the poultry industry is booming. The amount of chicken produced doubled between 2003 and 2013. Chicken is popular because it can be eaten by people of all religions (pork is forbidden to Muslims and beef is generally not eaten by Hindus) and because it is versatile and affordable. The majority of poultry is now produced by commercial farms, contracted to major companies like Venkys. Researchers who tested meat from supermarkets in the country in 2014 found it contained residues of six antibiotics, suggesting they were being used liberally on farms. (The Union Agriculture Ministry said the residues were well within the range allowed by international agencies.)Experts predict the rising demand for protein will cause a surge in antibiotic use in livestock. Indias consumption of antibiotics in chickens is predicted to rise fivefold by 2030 compared to 2010, while globally the amount used in animals is expected to rise by 53%.The World Health Organisation released guidelines in November 2017 recommending reducing use of critically important antibiotics in food-producing animals and banning their use as growth promoters. It also recommended banning the mass medicating of livestock with antibiotics to prevent disease.Using antibiotics as growth promoters has been banned in the European Union since 2006, and was made illegal in the U.S. in 2017. In 2014 the Agriculture Ministry sent a HYPERLINK http://www.farmer.gov.in/dadf/Advisories/Advisory_on_use_of_antibiotics_in_food_producing_animals.pdf advisory letter to all State governments asking them to review the use of antibiotic growth promoters. However, the directive was non-binding, and none have introduced legislation to date.In its National Action Plan on AMR published in 2017, the Centre banned using antibiotics as growth promoters. The plan is not currently linked to any regulatory action.Substitute for hygieneIndian farmers use antimicrobials as a substitute for good farming practices, according to Professor Ramanan Laxminarayan, Director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, based in Delhi.If you go to the average poultry farm in Punjab, you see these are all lacking: the nutrition is not there, hygiene is awful. So they are using the antibiotics as a substitute to keep the animals alive, he said. The reason this is done is because antibiotics are cheap. If the true cost was factored in  the cost of resistance  it wouldnt seem like such a good option, he added.He believes consumer pressure, rather than regulation, is what will drive change. He points out that much of the poultry consumption in India is through direct sales to consumers rather than fast food chains.Consumers [in the West] were previously unaware their chicken was being raised on antibiotics, and once they found out they didnt want it, he said. In India, that level of awareness doesnt exist. I think it needs social change. It needs leaders, it needs stories, it needs organisation. Its the same for tobacco. Nobody smokes now indoors, nobody smokes around children. The level of awareness is further on than with antibiotics.Professor Walsh believes there is no time to waste for this change. These resistant bugs arent waiting around, they are rapidly spreading, he said.The antibiotic pipeline is modest at best, so we must act quickly to preserve our last-resort drugs. If we dont act now, by 2030 colistin will be dead as a drug. We will have serious drug resistant infections and nothing to use against them.Giving colistin to chicken is complete and utter madnessTimothy WalshProfessor of Medical MicrobiologyCardiff UniversityIndian farmers use antimicrobials as a substitute for good farming practicesRamanan LaxminarayanDirectorCentre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, New Delhi"

Now, it is up to the government to take final call on this, department of fisheries assistant director Raj Kumar said.Officials of the forest and wildlife department also supported the revival proposal of the department of fisheries.Kuldeep Kumar, principal chief conservator of forests, department of forest and wildlife, said, We are still assessing the loss caused by the disaster. We can only chalk out the revival plan for the next stage.Ban on fishing should be the top priority. Secondly, the river should not be subjected to any kind of disturbance or interference. All the departments, including the police, should cooperate in achieving this. Besides, proper and consistent flow of water from the dams is also necessary for the revival, said an official, who did not want to be quoted as he is not authorised to talk to the media.The rivers ecosystem was heavily damaged due to the spill as it not only endangered the varieties of fish, but also broke the food chain, thereby affecting other species in the river and migratory birds that visit the Harike wetland during winter season every year.Raj Kumar said they have sent the proposal to release seeds of now-extinct varieties to the department head office. He said they have proposed two ways out to revive the rivers ecology.Since the monsoon season, which is the breeding period for fish, is upcoming, we have proposed to bring the seeds of now-extinct varieties (in Beas) from other sources to release them at different points of the river, he said, adding, Some verities are available in Punjab and can easily be reintroduced in the river, while rest of the varieties will have to be brought from coastal states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa.The now-extinct fish varieties include the common carp, Indian rohu, catla, mrigal, catfish, singari, gosh, bam, chital, bata and sol.The Indian Rahu, catla and common corp among others are available in government-owned fish seed farms in Punjab. Such a farm is also there at Rajasansi village from where the fish seed can be brought to the river, he said.Dead fish disposed ofThe two departments have disposed of the fish that died in the wake of the sugar mill spill by burying them in pits near the banks of the river, it has been learnt.Kumar said they carried out the drive on May 17 and 18 to dispose of the dead fish as it was necessary to prevent further deterioration of the river ecology. We applied a chemical substance on the dead fish before dumping them, he said."

On this, five leading stakeholders agreed at a roundtable organised by Hindustan Times on Friday.Kahan Singh Pannu, chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB); Sachit Jain, chairman of CII (northern region); Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal, environmentalist; and IS Paul, chairman of Drish Shoes; and Birinderjit Singh, environment engineer who worked in the PPCB, participated in the 80-minute discussion moderated by Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak. They dissected the grave problem that has come under the spotlight after spill of tonnes of molasses from a sugar mill killed thousands of fish in the Beas.(To Pannu) As head of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), can you tell us how serious river water pollution is in Punjab?Pannu: As Ravis major part is not in Punjab, we mainly have three rivers  Beas, Sutlej and Ghaggar. Beas is by and large OK, except last weeks incident. In Sutlej, we get B-grade water at Nangal. When it crosses Kiratpur Sahib, water becomes C-grade. When it cross Ludhiana, it becomes E-grade, and thats the last grade. So is the case with Ghaggar. We get D-grade water from Haryana, and by the time it crosses Patiala, particularly Khanauri, it becomes E-grade. So the water in our water bodies is polluted. As there is no grade below E-grade, all the rivers are in a bad shape. We have to accept that, and work out methods to clean them.(To Seechewal) There are two reasons for pollution, one is industrial pollution, second is untreated sewage or urban waste that flows into rivers. You did a lot of work on it and cleaned the Kali Bein. You have played a big role in projecting environment issues on to the centre stage. When you started your efforts, President APJ Abdul Kalam also visited you in 2006. Do you think there are any positive changes?Seechewal: Abdul Kalam took river water pollution very seriously and raised the issue world over. Since 2008, we examined water in different rivers (water channels)  Kali Bein, Chitti Bein, Kala Sanghian drain and the Sutlej river. More than Kali Bein, the Chitti Bein and Sutlej are dangerously polluted. We raised a bundh on Kala Sanghain drain for not allowing polluted water to fall in it. Before the 2009 general elections, we took all candidates to the drain and I visited a cancer hospital in Rajasthan to know the causes. Through Budha Nullah and Kala Sanghian drain, toxic water of Ludhianas electroplating industry and of leather industry in Jalandhar, which uses cyanide, is flowing for decades. Then, through Chitti Bein, it falls into Sutlej and further flows through the bird sanctuary. Then this water mixes with Beas, and the quality of Beas being good it is used for drinking in Malwa belt of Punjab and Rajasthan. Because, subsoil water of Malwa belt has sulphur content, and in Rajasthan the water is saline and not fit for drinking. We are sitting for discussion today because molasses from Kiri Afgana mill have flown into Beas, large number of fish got killed; but what about industry dumping chemicals into the rivers? Have you ever heard of fish getting killed in Sutlej? No, because here they are extinct! There was a time when fish died in the Sutlej, people noticed too; but after that the fish never survived in the river. Now people are getting killed due to cancer. Imagine, people are drinking water that flows from Kala Sanghian drain and Budha Nullah, same water is used in gurdwaras and places of pilgrimage! People in Rajasthan dont know what is mixed in the water that they drink; we are sending them industrial waste. With the death of fish, the focus is again in the river water. There was a time when A-grade water used to flow into Sutlej and Beas from Himachal Pradesh, now both rivers receive B-grade water. Earlier (polluted) water of Sutlej used to get diluted when Beas water mixed with it. What now when water from Beas is also polluted? As a member of PPCB, I used to take samples of polluted water, but I was not heard. We raised the issue at all levels, even before the previous CM. We are fed up with political leaders. We now pray before God so that better sense prevails on the government.(To Jain) I have data from PPCB that about 13,000 industrial units have dysfunctional effluent treatment plants, or do not have any. Why can these anti-pollution measures not be implemented? What are the practical difficulties from the industrys point of view?Jain: There are three main sources of pollution  industry, municipal waste which is huge, and the third is excessive use of pesticides in the farms that reaches this water. It is a serious problem, and entire society is to be made aware. The problem happens when industry is attacked straightaway and then industry tries to put up a defensive mechanism. There are pollution norms here that are nowhere else in the world. At CII, we dont support any company violating the norms. Spill of molasses is a serious case of negligence and should be investigated.Can you please elaborate on norms which are not practical?Jain: Like, zero liquid discharge norm discussed here are nowhere in the world. You make these norms applicable, and large companies will close down and smaller companies, which are anyway not complying with the norms even today, will not comply. Better compliance needs to be enforced first. Move out industry from a location where installation of effluent treatment plants is not possible. Shift them to big industrial parks. For example, electroplating industry should be shifted to one place and an environment treatment plant should be installed.(To Paul) You belong to an industry (leather) seen as the villain of the piece. As Baba Seechewal also said, Kali Bein and Chitti Bein are polluted due to effluents from tanneries. What is your perspective?Paul: Contribution of pollution by leather industry is very small  in Kali Bein, 50-55 MLD water comes from 14 kilometers, and the leather complex is at the end, contributing 3.5. The model of leather industry followed everywhere else is that there is one outlet for effluents, after treatment by the CTP. I want to make 3-4 points  polluting industry should itself be made responsible for treatment; if solutions are imported they will not work; make industry accountable as its the biggest stakeholder. Make sure land allotted to industrial units has sufficient place to install treatment plants. Solid waste management is also a big problem to which we need to give attention.Water quality in Punjabs rivers: Status check Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) monitors four rivers  Sutlej, Beas, Ravi and Ghaggar  under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP) at 38 points on monthly basis. Based on analysis results for March, heres the status:Sutlej: Quality at upstream Nangal conforms to Class B, that is, the water can be used for outdoor bathing. It becomes Class C at Kiratpur Sahib; or drinking after conventional treatment. Hundred metres downstream of confluence of Buddha Nullah, it deteriorates to Class E, which can be used for irrigation, but not for drinking. Then East Bein brings along sewage and industrial effluent from Nawanshahr, Phagwara and Jalandhar. By the time it reaches Harike, quality improves a little, and downstream from Harike in the canals  after confluence of Sutlej with Beas  it conforms to Class C.Beas: Water quality at Talwara conforms to Class B, that is, the water can be used even for outdoor bathing. And this quality remains same throughout the stretch of the river until it reaches Harike and meets Sutlej.Ravi: The water in the river is comparatively clean along its entire length since there is little human activity around it and it remains Class B. There is only one sampling station on this river, at Madhopur headworks.Ghaggar: It has bad quality of water due to meagre flow; carries sewage from various drains and cities. Quality at all sampling points conforms to Class D or E.Seechewal: No doubt, 90% of pollutant in Kali Bein is municipal waste.Jain: Sewage if properly treated can be used for irrigation, hence less load on groundwater. Treated water can also be used in industry. We need to diversify away from paddy in Punjab so as to reduce water consumption. I think free power to agriculture sector though a political compulsion should also go, because it leads to misuse of power and groundwater.(To Birinderjit) What went wrong with CTPs and ETPs in Punjab?Birinderjit: Major issue is: Why is sewage entering water bodies? All sewage grids were laid with water bodies as final outlets; instead, sewage should have been collected at one place and used for irrigation. We should cut off all sewage systems from water bodies. Industry says sewage is also coming into drains. But sewage doesnt contain toxic material, we can easily treat it. No natural compound will treat chromium and nickel from electroplating and dying units! I had refused the NOC to Tajpur Road on the banks of Buddha Nullah, but now its an industrial zone.What is the present position of CTPs in Punjab?Birinderjit: The local bodies department is to be blamed. They dont have the expertise to operate these plants. Three plants were installed in Ludhiana by the water supply and sewage board and handed over to the local bodies department.So untreated water is still flowing beyond the treatment plants?Birinderjit: Yes, not all but some part of it. We have spent huge money on plants; they should work.(To Pannu) PPCB has an important role of enforcement. It is generally believed that it is reeking of corruption which is coming in way of strict compliance of water and air pollution norms. What are your views?Pannu: No, it is not that the PPCB is a big institution. We are a team of 100 engineers, with lakhs of industries. In the past four years, for four months the engineers are busy in checking stubble burning. Of 166 cities in Punjab, only 66 have effluent treatment plants; 100 engineers cant solve the entire problem. We have told the CM that we need sewage treatment plants in all our cities and towns. Dont talk of environment alone; talk of education, policing and governance  we need to spread awareness and should not shift the onus onto others.What about norms that are unrealistic?Jain: There are times when suggestions that are not realistic are given. PPCB officials are scientific people. They know what is possible and what is not. If someone who may not understand the issue but gives them directions anyway, they are forced to carry out orders. The idea of zero liquid discharge, for example, was considered in the US in the 1970s in the Congress, and they realised it was not practical. The consciousness of every citizen has to be raised. Just imagine Swachh Bharat; the impact it has started having on people. There is new awareness. If leaders through their communication start creating awareness, things will change. Where people are digressing, action has to be there. As an industry body, we will support it fully. If you want to close companies which are blatantly violating rules the norms, we dont support such companies.Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana is a test case of water pollution. Crores have been spent on the plans of cleaning, but nothing has changed.Pannu: I dont think crores have been spent. The kind of investment it needs was not made. If money had been spent, things would have been better. Ludhiana has a population of 30 lakh. As per norms, water discharge should be 400 MLD. We have STPs to treat 450 MLD, but total water discharge is 750 MLD. Both power and water are free, so people just use water as per their free will. We need to stop that. When we go to the World Bank or other agencies for funds for STPs, they say you have adequate capacity. We need to check water consumption as per norms. It is the same situation is Jalandhar and other cities.Paul: The political class also has to show conscientiousness. Wherever an STP is to be set up, they start opposing. There have been such instances in Amritsar, Jalandhar and other places.People say STPs lead to a stink in the area.Birinderjit: The state has been divided into 7 ones. A pilot city has been decided which also takes care of waste of adjoining cities. Biodegradable waste putrefies and produces a fetid smell if it lies there for two or more days. In some seasons, it putrefies faster. It depends on how efficiently the system is run.Pannu: We look for solutions abroad and try to get technologies that are expensive. There is talk of use of waste to generate electricity at, lets say, Rs 8 per unit. When you can get electricity at Rs 2 to 2.50 per unit, why go for power that costs Rs 8 a unit. Punjab has 166 municipal committees that generate huge amount of solid waste daily, posing a huge problem. We need local solutions to solve our problems. If we look for solutions from abroad that cost a lot, these problems cannot be solved. For instance, we are focusing on water conservation in industry and doing water audit. Five paper industries in Punjab are using 100 KLD water. When they told me that they reduced it to 50 KLD, I asked them to try and bring it to 30 or so. We are working on it. Similarly, Punjab has 3,100 brick kilns with a huge amount of smoke billowing out of them. They have been told to use new zigzag high-draft technology from next season. It will cost them about Rs 30 lakh per kiln, but will ensure substantial reduction in pollution. In leather industry complex also, we got a pre-settler tank and solved 50% of the problem. If we can import technology that suits us, it is okay. But it is our problem, and we have to find the solution.(To Seechewal) You have been running a campaign for clean environment for a long time. Do you notice any change in awareness or a proactive approach among people and governments? Also, why have we not been able to produce another Seechewal?Seechewal: When we started, bureaucrats and politician had their own different views. Politicians saw no harm in waste water from homes flowing into rivers. We said that we want to stop polluted water from polluting our rivers. Now, Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) speaks on the subject and addresses the nation. How the issue of dead fish in Beas became international headlines reflects more awareness among the people. As for another Seechewal, we all have to start from our homes, streets and towns. We need to work together for a better environment. Everyone should take responsibility and take the lead. Sewa Singh ji is working it. SGPC is distributing saplings. In 100 villages, NRIs spent their money to lay sewerage. Wherever STPs have been set up, they should be run efficiently. Crores spent on them from taxpayers money are being wasted. Municipal committees, PPCB and other departments have to have accountability.What is an overall solution for ensuring that our water bodies are not polluted?Jain: Its difficult to give an overall solution. Awareness is important, and this has to start from our leaders, because they are the ones whose voices are heard the most. Also, each person has to start from within. We need to focus on water conservation in our homes, industry and farms. Each company has to see to it that it has pollution control equipment and is operating them. It has to be understood as a crime if you are not treating your water. We have to have public ostracisation of people who are not treating their water. Just like black money has now become a bad word. Earlier, everybody said, Why should I pay tax?, and it was considered a norm. That has become (a reason for) ostracisation today. Not treating your water and air has to be seen as bad.Pannu: As a society, it seems we are on the verge of extinction. What we are doing with water is unpardonable. There are vested interests that say, Allow me, but stop others! We tried to get strict with the dyeing industry in Ludhiana. They downed their shutters and went to politicians to complain. When we stop farmers, they lock up our teams. The Captain government is serious and wants to take efforts to check water pollution to the next level. A committee has been set up under environment minister OP Soni plan for the cleaning of rivers. The Beas disaster was due to reaction in a tank storing molasses. PPCB has no control on that. Our role is with regard to effluents. But the department dealing with this (molasses) is not willing to take its responsibility. We cannot shirk our responsibility and have taken strictest action. Such action has not be taken anywhere in the country. Government has also said that enough is enough.Paul: Role of the press is also important in creating consciousness. Also, cropping pattern needs to change. Underground water is available at 22 metres, but we are still insistent on paddy and sugarcane, ignoring the associated problems.What about political interference?Birinderjit: When you are in the state services and an appointee of the government, it will have control over you. Like IAS and IPS, an environment service was also thought of, but was not allowed to be successful. Politicians intervene, but they often do not know the gravity of the issue.(To Pannu) You said awareness has increased, but the quality of river water has not seen any change.Pannu: Awareness has improved, but investment has not. This can be achieved with investment. We have been only talking about crores and not spending. Piecemeal efforts are not going to work. We need a comprehensive plan. In his meeting, the chief minister asked the departments not to make individual efforts but collaborate for a solution in a timebound manner. The chief secretary has been told to arrange funds. However, Buddha Nullah is the biggest challenge for bureaucrats of our generation. For 35 years, governments have been talking about cleaning it without any success, because what is required has not been done.(To Seechewal) You are in touch with NRIs. Are they willing to help as the government does not have funds?Seechewal: How can NRIs take care of the problem of solid waste in areas of municipal bodies? MCs are a huge problem. They take taxes, but dont do enough. Polluted water comes from industry, but PPCB gets blamed. Why not prosecute them (offenders)? Those responsible should be made accountable.(To Pannu) What deterring action is being taken?Pannu: There is provision for criminal prosecution under the law, and hundreds of prosecutions have been launched. But there is a problem. I have 100 engineers, and prosecution means they have to go for hearings in courts. Cases have been pending for 10 years without any decision, and hearing dates are given. There are 250 cases. I am not sure if anyone has been prosecuted so far. Conviction rate is negligible. It is time-consuming. We shut down factories and forfeit security.Birinderjit: The spill in Beas has posed a serious problem. Beas water has reached Harike wetland which also gets water from Buddha Nullah that has nitrogen and phosphorous. These two constituents will lead to algae bloom, and interfere with the drinking water system. There is a need to do something to oxidize the molasses and take precautionary steps on priority.Watch the discussion here:"

At SA, we pride ourselves on helping you find the ultimate generous Sugar Daddy. Bills paid, gifts galore, and top-shelf fun, the report quoted its US website as saying.Our Chinese product is exclusively developed for the local market and would definitely abide by the law here, an unnamed employee at SeekingArrangement told China Daily.He said that the Chinese website and applications are designed as a premium platform that functions like any other legal dating site in China. The only difference would be that it targets successful men of high quality and fine taste."

Currently, these arrears have increased to 20,000 crore.India is the worlds largest producer as well as consumer of the sweetener. Annual output will likely be 30.3 million tonnes in the 2017-18 sugar season that comes to a close on September 30. Production in the previous year was 20.3 million tonnes.Consultations have begun among food ministry, petroleum ministry and finance ministry to overhaul the sugar sector, an official in the food ministry said, requesting anonymity.Last month, former agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling for measures to support the sugar industry and cane farmers. Pawar said India could face a sugar glut in the coming year, too, urging steps to overhaul regulations.To improve profitability, the food ministry has moved a series of proposals for the interministerial consultations. The minimum selling price being considered is an ex-mill price, meaning all sugar sold by mills to traders will have to be bought at a pre-determined price, which will factor in the cost of production. It is in the range of 30-32 a kg, the official cited above said.The proposals moved for Cabinet approval also include a so-called controlled release mechanism, the official said. This refers to stock-holding limits for mills based on production capacity, meaning mills will have to adhere to pre-fixed limits on how much sugar they can stockpile. Another key proposal includes creating a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes at the governments expense.A second official in the food ministry said the proposals also include policy support to promote exports to four countries: China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. These countries depend on imports to meet domestic demand for sugar. The demand in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia together is about 2.5 million tonnes, the second official said, also on condition of anonymity.Sugar is treated as essential commodity under the law ; the government controls the sugar trade and heavily regulates the sector. To improve the margins for mills so that they get a better price and pay off the farmers, the government abolished a 20% duty on sugar exports in March. In April, the government ordered mills to export 2 million tonnes.There is also a proposal to impose a cess on sugar sales being decided by GST panel, said Rohit Aggarwal, director, Comtrade, a commodities trading firm."

The district administration should arrange a direct interaction with the representatives of the insurance companies. When agriculture department fixed a deadline for the farmers to insure their crop for a particular season, why there was no deadline fixed for disbursing compensation amount, they asked.Later, the officials said steps were being taken to expedite disbursal of compensation for crop loss.Reacting to the farmers complaints regarding 2C patta issues, Collector T.G. Vinay said many people who got 2C pattas to raise crop in waterbodies had destroyed waterbodies and encroached upon them completely. Hence, the administration would remove all illegal encroachments, including those under 2C pattas, from waterbodies.Sugarcane growers demanded minimum support price for cane. When the sale price of sugar had increased, cane procurement price did not match even the input cost, they said."

(CAMPCO) on the premises of its chocolate factory. He said the draft has aimed at boosting shipments of agricultural products by identifying niche products and new markets. It has focused on value addition and reduction of wastage through pre- and post-harvest interventions.According to the Minister, the proposed policy will help in promoting farm clusters like the ones for industry.Mr. Prabhu said that import of commodities has affected farmers, including rubber growers, and the government intends to bring out a policy to help the latter. We will see how to improve the condition of rubber growers through a policy, he said. He also said the government had begun working out a policy on spices.Lauding Campco for protecting the interests of farmers, the Minister said such cooperative institutions were needed in the country. He said the setting up of Campco-like bodies would help in doubling the income of farmers. Cooperative institutions should act as a medium to bring the benefits of global market and economy to farmers, he said.More cooperatives in the agro-processing sector are needed, he added.Jyotindra Bhai Mehta, president of Sahakara Bharati, said there was a need to set up a chamber of commerce for agriculture in the country. There is also a need to bring out a policy to provide price stability on farm produce, he said. T. Shakuntala Shetty, MLA for Puttur, launched a premium assorted gift box of Campco chocolate with four variants of pure chocolate  Dietier-Dark, which is a sugar free chocolate; Milk Marvel Milk Chocolate, a cocoa butter-based pure milk chocolate; Milk n Milk White Chocolate, also a cocoa butter-based chocolate with rice crispies; and Funtan Dark Chocolate, which has high cocoa butter.The gift pack has two bars each of Funtan Dark Chocolate and Milk Marvel Milk Chocolate and one bar each of Dietier-Dark and Milk n Milk White Chocolate. The pack is priced at Rs. 500. An individual bar costs Rs. 100.The foundation stone for building a new warehouse of the cooperative in Kavu was also laid on the occasion. A bust of Varanashi Subraya Bhat, the founder of Campco, was unveiled."

Through her sugar mill at Kiri Afgana in Gurdaspur, now in eye of the storm after spillage of molasses killed thousands of fish in the river Beas and thus became ammunition for opposition parties, she rules the entire chain  from distillery to retail.Her father Harvinder Singh Sarna and his younger brother, Paramjit Singh Sarna, are former chiefs of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and have close ties with Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who has appointed Paramjit as his religious adviser.Kaur has played her cards well to upstage Pontys younger brother, Raju Chadha, who had major share in state's liquor business during the Akali regime. In Jalandhar, of nine zones in the municipal limits, six were won by Pontys group, AR Enterprises, in 2015-16. Kaur had bagged one.This year, as government tried to break the syndicate by capping the business to Rs 5 crore per group from Rs 25 crore to encourage smaller groups, Kaur played the game of probability. She put the highest number of applications to take 43 out of 47 groups within Jalandhar municipal limits, three in Mohali division, and a major chunk in Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts of the Jalandhar division.Rajus firm, one of the biggest players in liquor trade in Punjab with control over lucrative Ludhiana, which alone has business of Rs 750 crore, and Jalandhar markets till last year, did not participate in the auctions this year.The empireKaur owns Adie Broswon group, a Rs 600-crore annual turnover company, with stakes in transport (four bus clusters in Delhi), sugar and alcohol. The Gurdaspur plant has the capacity to crush 6,500 tonnes of cane per day and houses a sugar factory, a 6-million-case brewery and a distillery. A private limited company, Adie Broswon has Harinder Pal Singh Bhatia, Jasdeep and her brother, Prabhjit Singh Sarna, as directors.But her father denies any links with her business. Her husband had a tragic end. She is handling a business empire alone. All inquiry reports on water quality are fine. The opposition is making it a political issue as she is my daughter. That seems to be her only crime, Harvinder Sarna says.But Paramjit Sarna, who met environment minister OP Soni after the spillage, says he is not bothered by the criticism. She is my niece. If any report imposes penalty on her mill, she will pay. I dont care about what people such as Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal are saying. The SAD had defeated the Sarnas to take control of the DSGMC. Kaur could not be reached despite repeated attempts.The nexusThe excise department admits the distillery-retail alliance is an unholy one. It allows the distillery to sell its own brands at the vends, at times at higher costs. And it is not possible to have day-to-day monitoring and surveillance, an excise official said, requesting anonymity, adding, It is this nexus that the government wanted to break by forming a state liquor corporation, which was stalled by vested interests."

(NTPC) has withdrawn from the 2,000 MW solar park project, which is being set up at Pavagada in Tumakuru district. The government will now call a fresh tender as the NTPC informed the government that it would not be able to supply power at the agreed cost.According to the agreement, the NTPC would purchase 600 MW power from six developers at Rs. 4.80 per unit and supply to the State electricity supply companies at a bundled tariff of Rs. 3.30 per unit.Energy Minister D.K. Shivakumar told presspersons here on Wednesday that the NTPC had to said it cannot sell at Rs. 3.30 per unit. He said tender will be called to generate 600 MW from the solar park and complete the project in the next six to eight months. Already 600 MW is flowing. We are confident of getting bidders for supply of solar power within the KERC capped tariff of Rs. 3.56 per unit, he added.He said the government was confident of a good price from local generation of solar power, and capacity to generate 860 MW locally in 43 taluks is under way.Many have come forward to participate in the process. This local generation and supply of power will help in providing daytime power to villages. He also said there is demand from some dry places for staggered power supply during the day while in some places where irrigation facilities such as canals are in place, the demand was for continuous power supply during the day.The Minister, who also held a meeting to sort out issues of power supply from sugar mills that co-generate power, said the government was hopeful of getting 500 MW from them. At present, 61 sugar factories have an installed capacity of 1,515 MW of co-generation while the government was able to purchase just about 30% of the installed capacity last year. There are problems in this sector since sugar mills are unable to sell power at the KERC determined tariffs. Some are also selling in open market, he added."

Your vote will send out a message to the entire country. It will point to what might happen in 2019, he said in the run up to Kairana bypollBarely 40 kilometers away, in Jat-dominated Bhainswal village, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Choudhury loudly declares to his supporters: This is not a by-election. This is a big fight.Shamli lies at the heart of Kairana Lok Sabha constituency that votes Monday in a by-election necessitated by the death of its member of parliament (MP), Hukum Dev Singh of the BJP. In 2014, Singh won this seat in western Uttar Pradesh by a huge margin in a bitterly polarised contest following unprecedented communal riots in the region.Four years on, the BJP is struggling to defend Kairana against a united opposition. Its candidate, Hukum Dev Singhs daughter Mriganka, is up against the formidable Tabassum Hasan, who is contesting on an RLD ticket and has the support of the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress party as well.The stakes have increased for the BJP in Kairana following the defeat of its candidates to those of the SP, supported by the BSP, in by-elections to the Lok Sabha from Gorakhpur and Phulpur in March.The contest in Kairana is, doubtless, a crucial test of opposition unity. The tone and tenor of the campaign in the constituency also makes it a microcosm of the social issues and economic concerns that may potentially define the general elections of 2019.Take, for instance, the decision to field Tabassum as the opposition candidate. The social arithmetic is compelling. Kairana has about 1.6 million voters, of which an estimated 960,000 (60%) make up the new social alliance the opposition has stitched up  5,40,000 Muslims (33%), 2,80,000 Dalits (18%) and 1,40,000 Jats (9%), according to data available with political parties on both sides.The BJP is leaning on upper caste groupings, that account for about 2,80,000 voters (18%) with other non-Jat backward castes adding up to 3,60,000 (22 %). The BJP also hopes to chip away at some of the Jat and Dalit votes  especially the non-Jatavs who lack an affinity for Mayawatis BSP.The oppositions challenge is to keep its flock together while the BJP sees a chance only if it gets most of its core supporters to show up to vote. Simply put, Kairana is telling us that new social alliances are being forged. The equations of 2014 and 2017 might no longer hold.Also read: How will a BSP-SP alliance shape up? Key LS bypoll in Kairana may hold the keyTowards a new unityA split opposition and the unwavering support of the Jats helped the BJP score a spectacular sweep of western UP in the 2014 general elections that continued into the 2017 assembly polls as well. The BJP won four of Kairanas five assembly seats.But once the dust of the 2017 polls settled, the Jats seem to have suddenly found themselves confronting a new political reality they had perhaps not bargained for. The natural party of the Jats, so to speak, has for long been the RLD, which is now facing political extinction, having failed to even get either a single MP or an MLA elected.I will not say this is your last chance to resurrect your honour, but I will say that this is not the last time there will be attempts to undermine the Jat community, Brahm Singh Baliyan, a local RLD leader, tells the voters of Bhainswal.Complaints against the current regime resonate among the community. Jat leaders and village elders, in particular, are the most vocal. At election meetings, they allege that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that it cannot pay farmers one-and-a-half times the cost of their produce.If that is not anti-farmer enough, they say, there is the Yogi Adityanath government in the state has almost doubled the cost of the electricity farmers use. No one, they bemoan, seems to be taking the Jat community seriously because it has lost its political clout.It is a fight to save the legacy of Chaudhury Charan Singh, says RLD spokesman Sunil Rohta, referring to the late Jat leader who became Indias prime minister in 1979 for about six months. Rohta says the fear of becoming politically irrelevant is bringing the Jats back to the RLDs fold.The Jats would have loved to see one of theirs contest Kairana, but they are willing to rally behind an outsider because they want to save the party symbol, says another RLD leader. They are voting for the handpump (RLDs election sysmbol). It doesnt matter who the candidate is.Tabassum Hasan was with the SP until a month ago and switched to the RLD after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav agreed to make RLD the contender for Kairana. Prior to joining the SP, she was elected MP from Kairana in 2009 on a BSP ticket.BJPs man in-charge of the elections in Kairana, Sanjeev Balyan, concedes that the Jats will mostly go with the RLD, which is why his strategy has been largely confined to mobilising voters from the upper caste and non-Jat other backward classes (OBCs) to turn up on the day of polling.Thus far, Balyan has refrained from holding large rallies. Instead, he has been holding street corner meetings, at which he often highlights an improvement in the law and order situation, the governments efforts to build roads, schools and hospitals and the danger of all these efforts being derailed if the opposition candidate wins.Back in Shamli, Nirwal is articulating a similar message. On May 28, you shall leave everything aside, come out in the open and cast your vote in support of PM Modi, he tells the crowd. If you stay home, it will not be one vote short for us, it will be one vote plus for the opposition. And if they win, everything you have dreaded will return to haunt you.But the politics of fear is not the only factor influencing the voters of Kairana. The failure of sugar mills in the region to make timely payments for cane procurement and the lack of intervention by the state government has angered farmers.Ganna, Jinnah and RanaSugarcane is Kairanas economic lifeline. The region produces more than 5 million tonnes of the crop annually. Farmers sell their produce entirely to the six mills that operate in Kairana. Mills procure sugarcane at a range of rates fixed by the government. Mill owners often tend to delay payments to farmers, especially when the market for sugar is down.This year happens to be one of those bad years; sugar prices have slumped nearly 25%. But the fallout on farmers has been more devastating.Across Uttar Pradesh, as of last week, farmers had not received more than a third of the Rs 33,376 crore that was due for payment from mill owners. It is even worse in Kairana, where farmers have yet to receive an estimated  890 crore, or 52% of the1,700-crore that was due to them.We have never seen a crisis like this. It has come to this because the government cares more for the mill owners than the farmers, says Ajay Kumar, a former MLA. In this election, they will pay a price for it.The irony is that the minister in charge of the sugarcane crop, Suresh Rana, belongs to Kairana. He was elected from the Thana Bhawan assembly segment. Rana told Hindustan Times that the payment crisis will have no impact on the vote of May 28.Few can agree with him, not even his own party colleagues. If this problem was not there, we would have won even without campaigning, says Balyan.Sugarcane growers are not the only ones taking the hit.The economy of this region revolves around sugarcane. When farmers dont get money on time, they defer their spending. The local traders have seen a slump in business. There is a cascading impact, said Ashok Choudhury, a local leader of the Samajwadi Party.The delays in payment extend up to 4-5 months in many cases, despite a new 14-day deadline set by the BJP government in the state. The anger amongst the farmers is palpable. The opposition is losing no opportunity to cash in on the mood.The latest in the string of barbs against the BJP is to mock the ruling party for obsessing over the founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnahs portrait in Aligarh Muslim University.At the Bhainswal rally, Jayant Choudhury asks the audience: What do you care for? Ganna or Jinnah? The crowd responds: Ganna! Ganna! Some in the back rows add: We also dont want Rana, a reference to the minister in charge of sugarcane.Also read: Inside the riot machineThe bigger messageWhile the social churn ahead of the elections may have been in part driven by the sugarcane crisis and farmer distress, a wholly unexpected set of interventions are also assuming shape as Kairana readies for the poll.The riots of 2013, as is now well documented, not only drew a sharp line between the two major communities, what is less understood is that the violence and murders also unraveled an otherwise tightly interdependent ecosystem of the villages in Kairana.An overwhelming number of Muslims who fled their villages after the riots have chosen not to return. And many of them still do not want to. The blacksmith who fixed the Jat farmers equipment was often a local Muslim; the carpenter who made furniture was a Muslim, the mason who the village needed for house repairs was often a Muslim. In villages that have been deserted by Muslims, these services have now become expensive, and in some cases inaccessible. Jat farmers are feeling the absence of the Muslims economically the most, if not socially.Muslim labourers, on the other hand, rue the fact that they could no longer easily borrow cash from their Jat employers or the local Bania trader. They, more than ever dread, now dread falling short of cash.Talk of reconciliation and burying the bitter memories of the past is fairly loud and consistent. We are ready to live together, says Rajinder Malik, whose father heads the Gathwal Khap that allegedly incited the riots.Maliks village, Lishad, was one of the worst hit. All but one of its 250-odd Muslim families fled the village after 13 of their members died in the violence. As many as 102 first information reports (FIRs) were filed, involving 600-650 residents of Lishad.Although Malik maintains that the Muslims are to be blamed for the riots, he has worked to clear a third of these cases through mutual settlement. He hopes the 22 cases that are still pending in courts would be resolved soon.The surprisingly strong yearning for social peace in many villages that Hindustan Times visited suggests that polarisation is probably not sustainable in rural India, where economic interdependence requires social harmony.In a nutshell, the election in Kairana tells us that issues of economic distress and growing clarity about the need for social harmony are indicating a possible social realignment on the ground in time for the 2019 election. The mood is very different from 2014."

On the first day, 1,485 booths would be set up in all localities to enable parents to bring children below the age of five for the administration of the drops.In the next three days, all 1,485 teams, along with 130 transit teams and 28 mobile teams, would visit every house in both rural and urban areas to administer pulse polio drops. The 329 supervisors from the Health and Family Welfare Department would carry out door-to-door verification to ensure that no child was left out.Mr. Venkateshkumar said more than 2,970 personnel including Anganwadi workers were part of the drive. Apart from this, separate booths had been set up at the bus terminal and railway station.The mobile teams would administer the pulse polio drops to children of labourers whose working hours did not coincide with the teams visits. The list of sugarcane cutters had been collected from sugar factories and health workers would reach out to them.Mr. Venkateshkumar said that India has made one of the biggest achievements in global health  the last polio case reported in the country was in 2011. However, neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan reported 14 polio cases while Pakistan reported 8 polio cases during 2016-17.Following the global polio eradication initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), India launched pulse polio immunisation as a movement in the country since 1995. As many as 63 rounds of the campaign had been held throughout the country till now, he added."

The case was lodged in Rajasthan and police from there were dealing with it. What promoted the Gujarat police to get involved, he asked, reiterating his claim that he was being targeted for speaking on important issues like Ram Temple.On the Rajasthan case, he said that Rajasthan Home Minister had clarified that the case against him was withdrawn long ago, but the papers were not supplied to the court, which issued a warrant against him.Dr. Togadia defended meeting Congress leader Arjun Modhvadia in hospital where he was admitted for low sugar levels. From Uttar Pradesh to the entire Northeast, Congress leaders are joining the BJP in increasingly Congressisation of the BJP.

Switching over from intake of jaggery that is rich in iron content to cane sugar is one of the major reason for anaemia. People are not inclined to consume greens that could help them fight anaemia, he added.Anaemic pregnant women are treated with Ferrous Sulphate tablets. They are prescribed to take this drug from the third month of their pregnancy and in many cases till delivery. But, these tablets smell bad forcing women to skip the dosage and their anaemic condition remains untreated, the doctor said.Government hospitals should be supplied with capsules or syrups that would encourage pregnant women take their daily dosages.This is not only true in the case of Virudhunagar district but also for the entire State, he added.Siddha tonicA block health officer said pregnant women could be given a siddha tonic, Mathulai manapagu , a syrup made of pomegranate or asvagantha legyam.But, this also faces short supply, he said. Women who could not take the Ferrous Sulphate tablets are given Iron Sucrose intra-venous injection.But the 100 ml normal saline bottle that is required for administering the IV injection is not supplied.Admitting that the tablets were not palatable for pregnant women, Joint Director of Health R. Manoharan said a proposal has been sent to the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation to supply capsules or syrups.The maternal mortality rate in the district has doubled from 45 deaths in 2016-17 to 98 deaths (till December 2017) in 2017-18.It is a matter of concern for us and we are taking all steps to prevent maternal mortality, he said.Meanwhile, treatment for other major cause of maternal mortality -- pregnancy-induced hyper tension -- is also facing similar problem of short supply of drugs.High blood pressure found among pregnant women shoots up during delivery and results in eclampsias, a type of fits that poses danger to the life of the mother.All such women are prescribed with Labetolol tablets, which are not regularly supplied to the hospitals, the doctor said.Often, the Government hospitals or primary health care centres make procurement of this medicine directly from the market and give to pregnant mothers. But, whenever the hospitals run out of funds, the doctors stop prescribing the medicines and leave it to the mothers to buy the medicines for themselves from medical shops. This often results in hypertension not get treated properly, the doctor alleged."

That exhilarating thrill of guitars, eddying dust and smuggled rum: sweet, heady and watered-down, slugged slyly from beat-up plastic water bottles.The taste of summers at the beach: lukewarm rum and Coke gritty with sand and a slick of displaced sunblock. Later, its the taste of your first foray into the bar scene, where you drink it army style to impress dates, with a pinch of salt and a lemon wedge. Or order a slew of marginally more elegant Cuba Libres, clinking with ice and spiked with lemon juice (which you inevitably regret the next morning, holding your head and groaning gently over paracetamol, tea and toast.)India has had a long and tumultuous affair with Old Monk rum. Its cheap. Its accessible. And its somehow always managed to be cool. Despite the clunky packaging and egalitarian price tag. Or perhaps because of it.When founder Brigadier Kapil Mohan (retired), Chairman and MD of Mohan Meakin and the creator of this iconic desi dark rum, recently passed away at the age of 88, social media saluted him with a rush of memories and memes. You know all the details by now, thanks to a flurry of press. How he was a teetotaller, and yet created the most popular rum in the country in 1954. And how Old Monk, brewed in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, went on to develop a loyal fan following with virtually no advertising or marketing.A dip in sales, which set off alarm bells in 2015, triggered rumours that Old Monk would stop production, leading to an army of loyalists buying up and hoarding bottles in an emotional frenzy. Of the many posts and memes that emerged, one stands out: a picture showing a bottle of Dettol and a bottle of Old Monk side by side. Both are similar in shape and size, except for the labels, and the text underneath: Dettol, for external wounds. Old Monk, for internal wounds.This is commonly acknowledged to be the drink of the 70s, 80s and 90s. But millennials still dive in, from Chennai to Copenhagen. Even now, when its tougher to source in trendy restaurants and lounge bars, youll find it in homes and hip flasks. The drink, with its sweet, rich and pungent notes of vanilla, toffee and spiced pudding, has loyalists all over the world.Sample The Rum Howler Blog, which promises spirited reviews, where reviewer Chip Dykstra waxes eloquent about its opening notes of dark brown sugar accented by maple syrup and rich baking spices. He poetically continues to explain how they evolve into a scent of licorice stained molasses. Hints of soy sauce and exotic spice wander into the air with sugar-covered walnuts and pecans sitting underneath.On the whisky exchange, where it is labelled one of the largest selling rums in the world, almost all thanks to word of mouth, Jeffo304 says straight ice cold, best rum Ive ever drank. While another user says he tried this rum for the first time in Lagos, Nigeria, Excellent!Old Monk seems to bring out the poet in everyone: Mr Surgeon says, This is not just a rum. Once you take a sip, its like an orchestra that plays for you. Heavens come to protect you. Angels flirt with you...Indian fan clubs are no less spirited. On Facebook, look for COMRADE (Council of Old Monk Rum Addicted Drinkers and Eccentrics), a group of more than 2,000 fans of the rum. Theres the Old Monk Appreciation Society, with more than 3,000 members. And an Old Monk community followed by 18,000 people.Gareth, who runs this community, says he began it in 2015 as a page, called Saving Old Monk. He created a series of posts under the title in a world without Old Monk (...Men would not know the price of lemons.) The cover photo of the page read, Save the rum by having some, and it got nearly 4,000 likes in 24 hours. It garnered a following of 10,000 people in the first three weeks of its existence. Gareth says this is despite doing no marketing. I refused to advertise the page by putting money in, to keep in line with the way Old Monk does their marketing  organic and by word of mouth, only.He adds, I believe Old Monk tugs at the very fabric of a classic Indian gentleman, without squeezing his pockets dry. Its great to taste and suits most palates. It doesnt hail from a massive corporation, it doesnt try too hard by advertising, and above all, its almost too inexpensive to be true.Boozy benefitsDuring the 18th Century, it was common for sailors to receive rum as part of their benefits package. Not too bad eh? So the next time you want your benefits at work increased, you could possibly drop a few not-so-subtle hints to your boss or HR head."

Palanichamy, president of the association.According to TNSGA, the private sugar mills took part in three rounds of tripartite negotiations between the mills, farmers and government, organised last year by the Ministry of Industries in TN.During the talks, the mills reportedly claimed that they incurred heavy losses in the year 2013-14 and 2014-15, while the next two years were profitable. Consequently, the government asked them to settle the dues to the farmers for the profitable 2015-16 and 2016-17 years first and decide on the previous two years later.This meeting happened in May 2017 and the mills sought few days time to decide. However, they never got back, alleged Mr. Palanichamy.Pointing out that the present move to settle the issue by paying a meagre amount would result in a cumulative loss of more than Rs. 1,150 crore to farmers, the association has asked the State government to convene another tripartite meeting without any delay.Mills are acting in an arbitrary manner, which will affect thousands of farmers across the StateN.

Papanasam region, famed for its numerous cast jaggery producing units, is witnessing frenetic activity but producers say that the price this year is relatively higher than that which prevailed last year.Bhogi, Pongal and Maattu Pongal sees a large consumption of jaggery as people celebrate the harvest festival as a thanksgiving endeavour to the Sun God and to the cattle which help them in the farm chores.Naturally, the producers flood the market with freshly-prepared cast jaggery which is famous in the Thanjavur area.``While jaggery production has withstood the times of change though the sugar cane mills had almost wiped out the jaggery units, the unique taste and flavour has helped jaggery retain its aura among the people, especially the rural populace, points out K. Sivaloganathan, a jaggery producer belonging to Udumalpet but manufacturing jaggery at Kabisthalam near here.In fact, the Papanasam-Ayyampettai belt including Papanasam, Ayyampettai, Iluppakorai, Mahalipuram, Ullikadai, Krishnapuram, Ganapathy Agraharam, Manalur, Devankudi, Veeramangudi, Someswarapuram, Semmangudi and Pattukudi still have cast jaggery production units where they process sugarcane juice into jaggery, as cottage industry.Mostly, the cast jaggery produced in this belt is despatched in truck loads to the major jaggery market in Neikkaranpatti near Palani in Dindigul district. Though manufacturing takes place round the year, the peak season is December-January and the produce is sold to traders from all over the country at Neikkaranpatti.More than a dozen group of people from Udumalpet have settled in the Papanasam-Ayyampettai belt just for producing cast jaggery. There are more than 100 units in operation in the belt and most of them are manned by us from Udumalpet. We come here in Aavani and stay till Panguni-Chitrai to undertake the cast jaggery manufacturing. We purchase sugarcane from the regions farmers at Rs. 2,500 per tonne, we then harvest and transport the cane to the units. Our families do the job at the manufacturing units, explains K. Ramasamy of Pallapalayam near Udumalpet.The Neikkaranpatti shandy meets every Wednesday and Friday.The arrivals at the shandy have been rather heavy this year, the jaggery manufacturers stress but also point to the hike in sales which has resulted in the price of a 30 kg Sippam fetching the producers Rs. 1,300. The same quantum was sold for only Rs. 1,000 last festive season, they said."

The Siddaramaiah government was sworn in on May 13, 2013, and leaders are estimating that the new government will take charge around the same time this year.While some poll ticket aspirants are giving away gifts such as saris, pressure cookers, sports kits and school bags, others are organising sporting and cultural events. Some others are doing both.On the day of Shivaratri, several leaders organised lunch for devotees. Shiva temples fed devotees standing in queues and put up boards with the names of the sponsoring patrons. Most of them were politicians.Ravi Patil, a city-based doctor and president of the BJPs medical cell, distributed over 50,000 litres of holy water from the river Ganga. Vans and autorickshaws ferrying Ganga jal did the rounds at several temples.Sanjay Patil, BJP MLA from Belagavi Rural, has publicly complained that his political rival, Laxmi Hebbalkar of the Congress, was going around villages in his constituency distributing saris and pressure cookers to the poor. She has retorted by saying that Mr. Patil had used a family wedding as an excuse to give away saris to thousands of women from his constituency.Lakshmi Tayi Foundation, founded by Ms. Hebbalkar, organised a blood donation camp on her birthday on Wednesday and gave away certificates signed by her to donors. Tayi means mother in Kannada and sister in Marathi. On Wednesday, the foundation felicitated over 8,000 officers and soldiers of the Indian armed forces, both serving and retired. Some were honoured on stage, but the rest would be felicitated by Ms. Hebbalkar at their homes.Another foundation that has been actively distributing goodies is Anjali Tayi Foundation of Anjali Nimbalkar. It has been distributing school bags and sports kits to students across Khanapur taluk. Bags with a picture of the donor are a common sight in rural Khanapur. The foundation also organises Kabaddi and cricket matches in Khanapur. The Kolhapur-born doctor is the wife of IPS officer Hemant Nimbalkar. Though he has been transferred around the State, Anjali has stuck to Belagavi.She contested unsuccessfully as an Independent from Khanapur in 2013. The district electoral officer had then complained to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority that she had bought insurance policies for voters in her constituency. The policies were cancelled later. She has since joined the Congress and appointed president of the Bal Bhavan.Cultural routeAbhay Patil, the BJP leader who won in the 2008 Assembly polls and lost in 2013, has been organising cultural competitions, mainly aimed at women and children. He hosts an international kite festival, a Rangoli and painting contest, and a singing and dancing competition. Cash prizes are given to the winners. His Holi celebration attracts women in hordes.Satish Jarkiholi is an old hand at organising events. Satish Sugars led by him has been organising cultural competitions for 17 years and bodybuilding and sports events for 12 years. The sugar baron served as a Legislative Council member for two terms before getting elected to the Assembly in 2008 and 2013. He maintains that there is no connection between his politics and his socio-cultural activities.These efforts are obvious attempts at campaigning and the leaders have started early, said a senior revenue officer who is in charge of election-related activities. We have read about such distributions in the newspapers and we know that they can influence voters. But then, we cannot do anything as the code of conduct comes into force only after the polls are announced, the officer said."

They also fed bananas, sugar cane and watermelon to the rescued elephants Laxmi, Phoolkali and Maya, he said.Mr. Satyanarayan said that at the end of the visit, the family was presented an elephant footprint painting, Padhchinh, of Phoolkali along with a portrait of the majestic elephant.The Padhchinh is a unique series of artwork, born out of the collaboration of Singapore-based gifted artist Alpana Ahuja and the rescued elephants at Wildlife SOS, India.Translating into footprint in Sanskrit, Padhchinh symbolizes the elephants march towards a safer future.Perseverance is the keyThe first collection of Padhchinh paintings was unveiled in December 2013.Each footprint continues to be taken with tremendous patience, subject entirely to the elephants decision to participate in the process and largely influenced by bananas and other treats.The photo of Phoolkali was taken by Mumbai-based photographer Himanshuu Sheth.Phoolkali, who was blinded by her owners and used for begging on the streets, was rescued from Uttar Pradesh in 2012. Years of abuse and neglect had left her with terribly worn-out footpads and overgrown cuticles, which made it extremely difficult for her to walk or even stand.As part of her ongoing veterinary treatment, Phoolkali is given regular medicated foot soaks and her overgrown cuticles and footpads are trimmed and treated.For a greater causeMs. Ahuja said: It is a huge honour for me that a piece of art that I helped create with Phoolkali to support Wildlife SOS has a pride of place n the Canadian Prime Ministers home. I hope that the message of elephant conservation travels along with the art to Canada and more people from his country will support the wonderful work of Wildlife SOS to help protect elephants in India."

After all, its the meal that provides the body and brain with fuel after an overnight fast, helping to wake up the metabolism, says Tripti Gupta, a nutritionist from Mumbai. The absorption rate of all nutrients dwindles through the day, so its best to eat a bigger breakfast than a large dinner. You dont need a whole lot of refined flour, sugar or processed meat to make your breakfast interesting. Wholegrains, which are rich in fibre and protein, work just as well, delivering both taste and a health boost, says Gupta. The fibre present in grains like amaranth, rye, maize provides satiety and a long period of energy supply, while the carbohydrates break down to supply blood glucose for healthy functioning of body and mind. Besides, they are also excellent sources of B complex vitamins and most essential minerals. Adding nuts and oil seeds will take it up a notch, with healthy fats too. Berries and dry fruit catalyse the absorption of overall nutrients consumed in your first meal.Whole eggs are a good source of protein, amino acids, vitamin D and other important nutrients like vitamin B6, B12, choline, says Preeti Seth, a nutritionist from Delhi."

This adds to the 14 known gene variants that cause MODY and could advance the emerging field of precision diabetes, by helping personalise diabetes care.Diabetes involves a disruption of how blood sugar is kept in check by the hormone insulin. In Type-2 diabetes, which is the most common form of the disorder, many genes and environmental factors combine to cause this disruption. In MODY, any one of the 14 genes, if defective, can hamper the bodys insulin usage and trigger Type-2 diabetes.Some forms treatableMany times non-obese children, with elevated blood sugars, are often misdiagnosed to have Type 1 diabetes and treated with insulin, leading to poor or no control of the blood sugar. Some forms of MODY can easily be treated with sulphonylurea, an inexpensive drug. And it works very well on the patients. If you consider the age group  young adults [14-21 years]  it is a game changer. It dramatically improves quality of life, says V. Mohan, president, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), a partner in the study.Type 1 diabetes, that MODY is usually mistaken for, is not gene-dependent, and therefore not inherited. While it will not be cost effective to test everyone, you can look for signs such as the children are not obese, they have a family history, and the insulin they are being treated with does not seem to help. Running the MODY gene test, first for the more common forms, and if they are negative, testing for the rare ones would be the line to take, he adds.In a paper published in the BMC Medical Genetics journal, researchers outlined that variants of the NKX6-1 gene found in MODY patients were functionally impaired. The study was carried out by the MDRF in collaboration with scientists from Genentech, California, and MedGenome, India.Of the 14 MODY genes already identified, largely from European studies, MODY 13 are the most common. Radha Venkatesan, who heads the molecular genetics wing at the MDRF, says: I was testing for 1-3 and it was the causative factor in only 11% of the cases. Therefore, we figured that there must be others. We found four other variants in RFX6, WFS1, AKT2, NKX6-1 that may contribute to MODY. A further functional assessment of the NKX6-1 variants showed that they are impaired. She is hopeful that further evidence might emerge to fix the role of the three other variants also discovered, as more and more families come forward to be tested.The study carried out was based on a comprehensive genomic analysis of 289 individuals from India that included 152 MODY cases and 137 patients without diabetes. The latter showed no genetic variants associated with MODY.The costsCurrently, the costs of testing could be pretty high. While the cost of testing each gene is about Rs. 3,000, the costs for the entire MODY genetic panel, come to about Rs. 18,000. However, we are trying to bring it to under Rs. 10,000, for the entire package, Dr. Mohan explains.ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in"

This is especially true in the case of children, say city doctors.Avoid synthetic coloursChemical colours can irritate the skin by causing itching, rashes, swelling and aggravated eczema. Colour can compromise the eyesight resulting in severe irritation, redness, watering and itching. The scalp can get affected, leading to hair damage and hair fall. One should avoid playing with chemical colours and celebrate Holi by using traditional colours made from spring flowers and herbs [organic colours], said Dr. Naresh Bhargava, senior consultant, Dermatology, Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh.Doctors say that people should avoid using synthetic colours as they contain heavy metals like lead, which can cause red eye, chemical burn or corneal abrasion. Green synthetic colour used during Holi can cause fleeting blindness. Shining mica particles in the red synthetic colour can damage the cornea. Use sunglasses to protect your eyes from misfires of colour-filled darts or water jets.Avoid using contact lenses as the colour may get trapped between the lenses and result in eye infection. The lenses may also be of no use any more, said Dr. Neeraj Sanduja, senior ophthalmology consultant, Fortis Memorial Institute, Gurugram.Staying hydrated is vital. Drinking enough amount of water before and after playing Holi would be a good idea. Instead of tea and coffee, fill your stomach with coconut water, lemon water, soup and fruits. Follow a diet which is low in sugar and fat but rich in protein, complex carbohydrate and fibre, advise doctors.Dr. Sanjay Sarup, senior orthopaedics consultant, Tattvan eClinics, said, It is our responsibility to celebrate the festival with a little care in mind. Do not splash water on slippery places. Play in gardens where water can be absorbed easily and no one slips causing injury. People should not drink and drive, do not throw balloons on motorcyclists as it may lead to accidents"

Chandrababu after visiting the Agricultural Research Station (ARS), Mannuthy, the Minister said he wanted to have a tie-up with the KAU to replicate its successful models in Maharashtra.I am impressed by what I saw and learned from ARS, Mannuthy. The Food Security Army, Agro Machinery Operation and Service Centres (AMOSC), mobile units for agro-machinery service and repairs are all excellent models. Growth of farmers income is possible only through such innovative and pragmatic approach. I want to extend these models to Maharashtra, may be two districts to start with, he said.Mr. Kesarkar said different regions in Maharashtra had different cropping patterns. While crops in the Konkan area are similar to those in Kerala, Central Maharashtra has sugar cane and turmeric and Vidarbha, cotton and oranges. Therefore, the FSA and AMOSCs required in different regions will be different. Integrated farming systems are what we aim for. For example, coconut plantations have to be supported with production units of neera and coir. Expertise of KAU scientists can be used to develop them, the Minister said.SHGs hailedMr. Kesarkar also praised the self-help groups (SHGs) involved in the development agenda of Kerala. I appreciate the successful involvement of SHGs in agriculture and other productive ventures. The Kudumbasree Mission, which has a forward and backward linkage with all levels of clientele, is a great example of empowerment and entrepreneurship. Such agencies enable smooth technology transfer, the Minister said.Dr. Chandrababu offered guidance and support for replicating FSA, AMOSC, and other allied models in Maharashtra.  Extending our technology for agricultural development in other States is highly satisfying, he said."

Nor did they think that a bunch of vegetables can be raised beside each other on a three-acre plot. When they saw the field rich in vegetables, they heaped praise on Sekar for his pioneering efforts.The group of about 20 farmers from near Paris had planned to visit the famed Sri Airavateeswarar temple at Darasuram near here. When they heard about the endeavour of Mr. Sekar in his field, a few kilometres from their place of stay, they dropped in out of curiosity.Years of experienceThe team was received with a bouquet of vegetables, many of them alien to the delta region, where paddy is raised traditionally along with a handful of other crops such as sugar cane. The tourists came to know that cabbage, broccoli, beetroot, cauliflower, carrot, green peas and radish were raised. Mr. Sekar told them that he had been doing this for seven years.The team, led by a farmer named Terrier, quizzed Mr. Sekar on the cultivation method, the cost of cultivation, returns on investment, market opportunities and other secrets.Our guests said they were as much amazed by Mr. Sekars field as they had been by the sculptural beauty of the Darasuram temple, said Lata Raman, Chairperson, Paradise Resorts, who arranged the field visit for the tourists."

Rajamani said here on Friday.Disclosing this at the farmers grievances meeting, Mr.Rajamani said this was the second phase of the sanction of compensation to farmers for 2016-17. Initially, about Rs. 29.27 crore was disbursed to 11,071 farmers. Of this, about Rs. 2.8 crore was yet to the credited to the beneficiaries due to discrepancies in the data relating to their bank accounts and other details.The details were being verified and the money would be credited to the beneficiaries accounts once the process was completed, he said responding to complaints from a section of farmers over the inordinate delay in disbursement of compensation, he added.List of omitted farmers forwarded to govt.Mr. Rajamani also disclosed that a list of farmers who were omitted in sanction of the drought relief given by the government had been prepared and forwarded to the government. Similarly, an enumeration of the damages sustained by coconut and other crops due to the drought conditions had also been done and a proposal for sanction of compensation to the affected farmers had been submitted to the government.Responding to complaints of delay in providing free power connections, Mr. Rajamani instructed Tangedco officials to ensure that the target was achieved without fail by March 31. Cases where power connections had not been given for applications submitted prior to 2000 can be brought to his notice.He also instructed the Department of Cooperation to ensure that the entire sum of Rs. 276 crore, allocated for sanction as crop loans by cooperative banks and societies in the district, was disbursed before the end of the financial year.The Collector also ordered the department to ensure resumption of operations of the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (PACS) at Alangudi Mahajanam in the district within a week.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says not more than 12 teaspoons a day. Overload of sugar in diet is known to cause weight gain, which is is now being linked to higher risk of diseases from diabetes to some forms of cancer.Doctors add that sugar naturally present in whole fruits and milk is not considered free sugars. Fruits are relatively high in natural sugar but are also high in vitamins, minerals, fibre and antioxidants.Fruits and vegetables offer more nutrients than any other food group. Thus, it is advisable to consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. The WHO has noted that a large amount of free sugar consumed is hidden in processed foods and drinks.A maximum of 12 teaspoons of free sugars is recommended by the WHO a day for both adults and children. This includes sugars added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer or cook, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices.Solid food versus liquidsMeanwhile, evidence suggests that calories from liquids leads to weight gain more than calories from solid food. The body breaks down sugars in solid foods slower as opposed to energy in fluids, resulting in large amounts of nutrient-poor calories in sugary drinks being consumed quickly and thus not providing the same feeling of fullness as solid foods. Overweight and obesity  starting in childhood  are linked to several non-communicable diseasessuch as type-2 diabetes, heart diseases, stroke and hypertension, said doctors."

The layoff would be in force till May 10, 2018.The managing director of the mill made the announcement as per the decision taken by the government.The mill, established in 1984, had been in the news after the management failed to pay sugarcane farmers due to the financial crisis it faced.The mill has an accumulated loss of Rs. 150 crore with salaries yet to be paid to workers since last February.The delay on the part of the mill management in the disbursement of salaries since February has left the workers in the lurch.The management has defaulted on crediting the amount debited from salaries of the workers in Employees Provident Fund (EPF), LIC and settlement of dues to banks and cooperative societies, T. Muruganandam, president of Joint Action Committee of the trade unions, told The Hindu .In spite of repeated representations, the Puducherry government has not paid remuneration to the employees since July.Nearly Rs. 22 crore remains unpaid towards payment of EPF, salary and other statutory liabilities on the part of the management, he said. The sugarcane growers have started sending their produce to private mills causing an erosion of growers base for the cooperative sugar mill.Panel blamedA section of employees alleged that a three-member committed appointed by the previous government in 2012 to manage the affairs of the mill resulted in maladministration and irregularities. The mill is now struggling with a huge financial crunch and workers are severely affected due to non-payment of benefits by the mill management.There was a move on the part of the government in November to privatise the mill which invited widespread protests from the workers and political parties.Layoff of workers was apparently not new in Puducherry. The practice was adopted in some of the important public sector undertakings (PSUs), including the century old Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mills.S. Senthil Kumar, president of the Lingareddypalayam Sugarcane Farmers Association, said the crushing season, which should have normally commenced in November, had not yet started as farmers had also been left high and dry due to delay in payment of dues.The mill management was yet to pay arrears of Rs. 18 crore to farmers who had supplied cane for the crushing season during 2014-15 and 2015-16 and 2016-17. Many farmers were not able to avail themselves of fresh crop loans as the management had not paid interest to the banks concerned, he alleged."
5b141f169855b72ada079910,Sufism in the simplest terms,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sufism-in-the-simplest-terms/article22921877.ece,2018-03-04,"Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, who lived from 1238 to 1325, is an extremely popular Sufi saint of the Chishti Order. The Nizamuddin Dargah (mausoleum) in New Delhi is visited by thousands every week. He had two disciples, both well-known poets of their time: Amir Khusrau and Amir Hasan Sijzi. Next to Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas shrine lies the shrine of Hazrat Amir Khusrau. It is called the Choti Dargah. This is the story of the shrine of Auliyas other disciple, Amir Hasan Sijzi.On a recent trip to Aurangabad, I visited Khuldabad, also referred to as the valley of saints. Most people know it as the burial place of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, but there is much more to the area. There is a reason why Aurangzeb had asked to be buried there.The valley of saintsWhen Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq ordered in 1327 that his capital be shifted from Delhi to Deogir, which he named Daulatabad, he instructed the elites, nobles, officers, common men, and even the saints to shift with him.The Sufi saints, 1,400 of them, decided to settle in an area near Daulatabad. The shrines of these saints dot the area, which is why that place was initially called Rauza (shrine). After Aurangzebs burial it was renamed Khuldabad as he was given the posthumous title of khuld-makani (hw who resides in paradise). Famous saints such as Shah Raja Qattal, Shaikh Burhanuddin Gharib, Shaikh Muntajibuddin and Aurangzebs spiritual master, Shaikh Zaynuddin Shirazi, are buried there.It was while I was researching why this place is called the valley of saints that I found that Amir Najm al-Din Hasan Dihlavi ibn Khwaja Ala al-Din Sistani, commonly known as Amir Hasan Sijzi or Hazrat Amir Hasan Dehlvi, was also buried there. He too had been ordered to leave Delhi for Daulatabad, and was never to return.If Amir Khusrau captured Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas teachings in his songs and poetry, Amir Sijzi did the same in the famous compilation titledFawaid-al-Fuad, which contains the literary discourses of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Unlike Amir Khusrau who became his disciple when he was around eight years old, Amir Sijzi became Auliyas disciple quite late in life, when he was already an established poet and called the Saadi-e-Hind. Amir Sijzi was born in Badaun in Uttar Pradesh in 1254 and died in Daulatabad in 1337.Saiyid Zaheer Husain Jafri, professor at the department of history at Delhi University, says that Fuad was the first book of its kind in India. It was for the first time that anyone had written about the day-to-day interactions, reactions and teachings of a Sufi Shaikh in his khanqah. He says: In this book, you find the principles of Sufism being talked about in the simplest of terms by the great Shaikh, and we also see that every section of society is represented. The Shaikh is not only talking to the elites but to the common man as well. Its not that Shaikhs didnt speak earlier, but a mature scholar, recognising the value of these discourses, recorded it for posterity. The entire book is in the form of conversations supported by examples. It is a lively speech that captures the readers imagination. It is also important because the saint himself checked the account for veracity. Very simply written, this book is an important historical, social and literary document as it records contemporary life and society.Professor K.A. Nizami has written in his preface to the English translation of Fuad by Bruce Lawrence: It soon found a distinctive place in Muslim mystic literature. In fact, Amir Khusrau offered to exchange all his works for it.The shrine and some sugarWhen I reached Khuldabad, I had to ask many people about this shrine. I was told to look out for a big gate with an old man sitting in front of it. This was to the west of Khuldabad and it seemed as though not many people visit this place. I found the old man, the caretaker, sitting in front of a big gate, which he opened when my car stopped there. He took me inside and I offered my prayers.It is believed that the original copy of the Fawaid-al-Fuad is buried with Amir Hasan Sijzi as per his will.

Ms. Salma, a diabetic and having hypertension for the last 10 years, had visited several hospitals and was diagnosed with umbilical hernia. As she also had heart problem, she postponed the surgery.However, at the Tumkur District hospital, an ultrasound revealed she had multiple gallstones in her abdomen. When she came to us, she had severe abdomen pain. Her sugar level was abnormally high and haemoglobin was low, apart from other issues. We admitted her for 15 days and stabilised her parameters before we worked her up for the surgery. The surgery was done on Tuesday, said Dinesh R. and Waseem Imran, the doctors who performed the surgery.Dr. Waseem said although multiple gallstones are not unusual, finding 99 in a person is rare. In the three-hour surgery we removed her umbilical hernia and the gallstones. She is recuperating well in the ICU. She will be discharged in eight days, he added."

We hope it will pave the way for revival of sick units, he added.CITU State vice-president D.Govinda Rao said that the government should encourage small-scale units and eco-friendly industries instead of trying to establish pharmaceutical and other polluted firms in the district."

Apart from quality, market conditions dictated by intermediaries determine the returns.Most of us raise the variety in a small portion of our lands or in leased lands as a tradition. Given the high cost of cultivation for this variety, not all farmers can afford to go for it. We do it in the hope of getting some money in bulk during the Pongal season, says G. Sundaravelu (58), a farmer of Nadupadugai village near Thirukattupalli.The sugarcane raised in villages around Thirukattupalli is known for their quality. They usually stand about seven feet in height. But this year, the growth seems to have been stunted and the cane is just about 5-5.5 feet high, and this will affect the price, he says and attributes it to the local seeds that they had used.High investmentFarmers have to invest about Rs. 1.50 lakh to raise the crop in an acre as it requires much maintenance and care, in contrast to the cane variety that is sent for crushing in sugar mills. This year, good quality cane fetches about Rs. 160 for a bundle of 10. With this, we will just be able to break even. We can earn some profit only if we get about Rs. 200 a bundle he says.Traders, mostly intermediaries, pay an advance to the farmers ahead of Pongal and the harvest is done a few days before the festival. We have had a good harvest and the demand has also been good this year unlike last year. Labour and other input costs have gone up heavily. But we are getting just about Rs. 140 to Rs. 160 a bundle, says P. Raghu another farmer of Nadupadugai.Good demandThis year, there has been good demand with traders transporting sugarcane from the village to Melur in Madurai and even Gujarat.At Saidambalpuram on the road to Pattukkottai from Thanjavur, C. Karuppaiyan is supervising harvest of dark variety sugarcane at the field he had leased.Depending on the size, a cane will fetch me anywhere between Rs. 13 and Rs. 16 this year. Traders from Tiruchi, Dindigul and Thoothukudi have already entered into a deal with me and most of the harvested sugarcane will be despatched to them. I sell only a portion of the produce in the Thanjavur market, he says.After Pongal, which is less than a week away, this sugarcane variety will lose its market value and people will seek a disdainful rate for them.Some distance away, P. Selvaraj, another cane grower belonging to Soorakottai, is arranging the produce for sale in the local market. This year, I had to spend a significant amount on irrigating the fields as we did not get adequate water in the Kalyana Odai that branches off the Grand Anicut Canal. Along with increased cost of labour, the input cost has shot up reducing our margin this year, he says.Since they would not supply the cane to the sugar mills as registered suppliers, they do not have access to crop loans from recognised lending institutions and have to rely on private lenders. The interest they have to cough up for the whole of the cultivation period hikes their input cost and they cannot do anything about it."

In the same way that a patient requiring a transfusion must receive the right blood type, diabetes sub-types need different treatments, the study suggested.Similarly, scientists have also identified distinct kinds of microbiome  the bacterial ecosystem in our digestive tract  that can react differently to the same medication, rendering it more or less effective.This is the first step towards personalised treatment of diabetes, said senior author Leif Groop, an endocrinologist at Lund University in Sweden, adding that the new classification is a paradigm shift in how the disease is viewed.People with diabetes have excessively high blood glucose, or blood sugar, which comes from food.Some 420 million people around the world today suffer from diabetes, with the number expected to rise to 629 million by 2045, according to the International Diabetes Federation.Building on knowledgeCurrently, the disease is divided into two sub-types.With type-1  generally diagnosed in childhood and accounting for about 10% of cases  the body simply doesnt make insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels.For type-2, the body makes some insulin but not enough, which means glucose stays in the blood.This form of the disease correlates highly with obesity and can, over time, lead to blindness, kidney damage, and heart disease or stroke.It has long been known that type-2 diabetes is highly variable, but classification has remained unchanged for decades. For the study, researchers monitored 13,270 newly diagnosed diabetes patients ranging in age from 18 to 97.By isolating measurements of insulin resistance, insulin secretion, blood sugar levels, age, and the onset of illness, they distinguished five distinct clusters of the disease  three serious and two milder forms.Among the severe types, a group of patients with insulin resistance  in which cells are unable to use insulin effectively  was at far higher risk of kidney disease.This group has the most to gain from the new diagnostics as they are the ones who are currently most incorrectly treated, Mr. Groop said. Another group facing serious complications was composed of relatively young, insulin-deficient patients.The third severe group were people with auto-immune diabetes corresponding to the original type-1 diagnosis.Early treatmentThe two other groups have milder types of the disease including one, which includes about 40% of the patients, beset with a form of diabetes related to advanced age.This will enable earlier treatment to prevent complications in patients who are most at risk of being affected, said lead author Emma Ahlqvist, an associate professor at Lund University.The results were checked against three other studies from Sweden and Finland.The outcome exceeded our expectations, said Mr. Groop. The researchers plan to launch similar studies in China and India."

The total budget allocation for the agriculture sector this year is Rs. 18,112 crore while another Rs. 3,250 crore has been set aside for the rural development plans. Financial benefits of the budget will likely go to the industry and services sectors, farmer leaders said.H.M. Desarda, agriculture economist and former member, Maharashtra State Planning Board, said, There are only Budget announcements for the farmer, whose distress is growing by the day. This Budget is packaged as pro-poor and pro-farmer, but in reality, it is pro-rich and pro-industrialist.Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had said the Budget was farm-centric, and has special thrust on farming and food processing schemes. He also allocated Rs. 1,500 crore for the flagship Jalyukt Shivar project. But farmer leaders said the benefits of the scheme are not trickling down to them, and the outlays dont match the outcome.Atul Deulgaonkar, a Latur-based author and expert on Maharashtras agriculture sector, said, There is no synchronisation between the outlay and outcome in this budget, even as farmers remain in distress. Who is the government trying to fool with the Magnetic Maharashtra summits and promises of investments and jobs? Since this government has taken over, nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide. These statistics in the budget are just lies and more lies.Even the Economic Survey has painted a bleak picture while projecting a negative growth in the sector. This is worrisome, farmers said. Kaildas Apte, Executive President, Maharashtra Shetkari Sangahatna, said, The farmer of this State is selling milk for Rs. 16-17, while the government had promised a support price of Rs. 27. Rs. 3,500 crore is due to farmers in the form of RFP from sugar mill owners. The budget is silent on all this. There is nothing for the farmers in this budget except empty talk.Since this govt. has taken over, nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide. These statistics in the Budget are just lies and more liesAtul DeulgaonkarAuthor and agriculture expert"

The Left front has remained in Kerala and that too has been developing cracks. Till recently, we did not have a single MLA in the north-eastern States. When we could beat the Left front that ruled Tripura for five consecutive terms, it will not be a difficult task to capture power in Telangana, he said. Lauding the partymen and leaders Yendala Laxminarayana and Dharmapuri Aravind, who led the padayatra, he said it was not easy to travel 140 km on foot covering several villages for the cause of workers. It was we who extended an assistance of Rs. 5,500 crore to reopen the Ramagundam Fertiliser Factory. We are also planning to revive the IDPL in Hyderabad and a jute mill at Nirmal that were closed down during the Congress rule. We will also help reopen the NSF units if the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, comes forward with a proposal and meet the Prime Minister in Delhi, said the Union Minister. MLC M. Ramchander Rao, former MLA Laxminarayana, party leaders Raghunandan Rao and Aravind also spoke. BJP district president P. Ganga Reddy presided over the meeting."

A special mechanism will be set up to control and implement the process.A senior government official, who declined to be named, said the government will be focusing more on meeting demands concerning tribals. The government has faced numerous farmer agitations in last few years, but this was the first time that tribals took to the streets. We will be more focused on the ensuring that their demands are met under a time-bound programme.The government clarified that the suspension of the pre-condition under the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that makes it mandatory to get approval from the gram sabha while acquiring land will remain. It, however, said there will be no land acquisition without the approval of the farmer who will be giving up land, and assured the farmers that there will be no forceful land acquisition for Mr. Fadnaviss pet Mumbai-Nagpur expressway project, or the bullet train.Loan waiver for allAmong the major demands accepted by the government is inclusion of farmers who didnt receive benefits under the farm loan waiver scheme in 2008 in the current loan waiver scheme, officially known as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana. The committee that will be set up to monitor its implementation will have farmer representatives and Ministers.Mr. Fadnavis said, A demand to consider each family member as an independent applicant for a farm loan waiver has been made.

It will be followed by a campaign asking the government to come out with salt and sugar reduction guidelines for the food industry. Then we will reach out to the industry as well, said Dr. Umesh Khanna, chairman of the IMAs Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) project.Dr. Khanna, who also heads the Mumbai Kidney Foundation, said that excessive salt consumption is one of the major causes of high blood pressure (BP), heart disease, stroke, and kidney ailments.Nearly 40% of CKD patients are diabetics, while 60% of them have both BP and diabetes, conditions where salt and sugar intake plays a big role.Oil intake too has been linked to obesity, which in turn could lead to BP and diabetes.The three ingredients are linked to nearly every major lifestyle disease.The World Health Organisation prescribes one teaspoon of salt, six to eight teaspoons of sugar, and four teaspoons of oil per person per day. However, the IMA said, the average Indian consumption is a worrisome two to three teaspoons of salt, 16 to 20 teaspoons of sugar, and eight teaspoons of oil per person per day.We will soon be petitioning the government to push the food industry to display the salt contents and also suggest ideas to bring in low salt variants of popular foods. This should be done not only for branded products but also for local items. Similar initiatives will also be planned for sugar and oil control. If the government issues mandates for the food industry, we can definitely bring about changes in the publics eating patterns, said IMA coordinator Dr. Jayesh Lele."

Conflict of interest between the two leaders, who are the key aspirants for the party ticket to contest the Lok Sabha constituency in coming elections, embarrassed the party cadres.During the nine-day padayatra which concluded at Bodhan yesterday, both the leaders walked down silently without interacting with each other. They shared the common dais only a few times at road-side meetings in the course of the padayatra. Followers also walked separately behind their respective leaders.Political observers had expressed their surprise on the joint padayatra of Laxminarayana and Aravind. The former has a record of defeating Aravinds father, the former PCC president D. Srinivas, twice, and they have been arch rivals in politics. Even though the high profile entry of Aravind, a successful businessman, into the national party which has been gaining victories one after another ever since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, enthused some leaders in the party, some others were not keen about it. His way of talking and certain political comments are not palatable. Our partys culture is different from the one which he came from, said a BJP senior leader. In the public meeting addressed by the Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, followers of the duo shouted slogans in favour their respective leaders Though the padayatra was successful in highlighting the issue, it has become a matter of speculation as to who would be given the party ticket in the elections.His [Aravind] way of talking and certain political comments are not palatable.Senior leaderBJP"
