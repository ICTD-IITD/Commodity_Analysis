But has the income of farmers increased? No, Kalyan said, adding that during his visits to agriculture universities in Rajasthan, he has appealed that scientists undertake crop awareness programmes among farmers so that they dont face glut in the harvesting season.It pains to see tomatoes being thrown on roads, potatoes dumped in cold storages and sugar cane burnt in fields as farmers are not getting remunerative prices for their produce, he said.Another issue he is going to take up is the low standard of the political discourse in the country.I would not name any leader or party but the way some leaders have uttered some below-the-belt remarks is not good for democracy, he said."

A 19-year-old who was called a hero by her family, and ""always laughed"", hanged herself in a room in a Betul village on New Year's morning, leaving behind a note that said: ' my life is ruined '.In a hut where a lone naked bulb throws gloomy shadows, the mother brought herself to speak about the moment she found her daughter dead. ""I thought she was playing a prank. I touched her body. It was cold. I shook her twice. I told her this isn't done, you are looking scary, but she didn't reply.""She makes no attempt to stop the tears and gets up to fetch a packet of gulab jamun mix and sugar from the shelf. ""I will make gulab jamun for all of us on New Year Amma... Those were her last words,"" she says.On New Year's Eve, the teenager stepped out of the house to relieve herself. There were two men waiting. They dragged her away and raped her. When she returned home, she was a broken person.The night she killed herself, she had walked over to where her father slept. ""For a moment during night, she came to me as if she wanted to tell me something. I thought it was thieves and woke up. As soon as I realised it was her, I went back to sleep. I wish I hadn't. What if she wanted to tell me about her ordeal? I could have saved her life,"" the father says, lying on a makeshift bed on the floor.Youngest daughter-inlaw said, He is unable to speak. His children try to comfort him as he shivers. She was very close to him. He would take her advice in every decision.The now-gone teen was the brightest in the family, even the village. She passed higher secondary though the village doesnt have a school, and dreamt of becoming a police officer. She was the hero of our family. Always happy. Always laughing, the father said, choking up.The teenager had bought the gulab jamun mix on the morning of December 31. There was laughter in the family. Who knew everything would change in just 12 hours, said the mother. I woke up on New Years morning and went to ask her if she was going to make gulab jamun. My knees gave way on seeing her hanging, sobs her mother. I see her everywhere. As dusk falls, the setting sun lights up pink flowers blooming outside the house. She planted this tree, saying this would make our small home look beautiful, the family says.More people start gathering at the damp three-room mud house, the family calls home. They gesture toward a shed barely 4x5ft. This is where she hung herself, one says. Its barely tall enough for someone to stand properly.This is where the teen wrote her last letter: Mera jeevan bekar ho gaya hai. Marne ke alawa koi rasta nahi (my life is ruined, no other option but to die). Its from the letter that her family knew about the rape. Police have arrested two suspects.This familys tragedy makes you realise why its so crucial to have a system in place to counsel victims of sexual violence , and why it needs to reach out to remote villages."

However, farmers are not happy. They say the factories never buy sugarcane at the State-favoured fair at a remunerative price and that a substantial amount of the promised amount is withheld as arrears for years.The district has 37 sugar factories and two more are on the anvil. Of these, around 25 are functional. Some factories are in the cooperative sector and some are privately held. But most are controlled by leaders with political clout.In an average year, all factories together produce around 1.3 crore quintals of sugar by crushing around 15 crore tonnes of sugarcane. A third of the 10 lakh hectares of land is used for sugarcane cultivation.Bhalachandra Jarkiholi, MLA, and chairman of Ghataprabha Sugar Factory announced the price of Rs. 3,200 per tonne of sugarcane. This led to an assumption among sugarcane growers that other factories will have to match this amount.No factory pays the right price and pays on time, Appasaheb Desai, farmers leader, said. He added, We have been agitating for weeks for payment of arrears as old as three to five years. But what we have got are only assurances.He pointed out that some factories in Maharashtra were offering prices upto Rs. 3,600.In some other factories, even the cutting and transport charges are borne by the factories and farmers get lumpsum amounts. It is time factories in Belagavi followed this, Mr. Desai said. He said the factories here were controlled by politicians across parties."

For starters, doctors will spread this basic awareness aggressively. It will be followed by a campaign asking the government to come out with salt and sugar reduction guidelines for the food industry. Then we will reach out to the industry as well, said Dr. Umesh Khanna, chairman of the IMAs Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) project.Dr. Khanna, who also heads the Mumbai Kidney Foundation, said that excessive salt consumption is one of the major causes of high blood pressure (BP), heart disease, stroke, and kidney ailments. Nearly 40% of CKD patients are diabetics, while 60% of them have both BP and diabetes, conditions where salt and sugar intake plays a big role.Oil intake too has been linked to obesity, which in turn could lead to BP and diabetes.The WHO prescribes one teaspoon of salt, six to eight teaspoons of sugar, and four teaspoons of oil per person per day.However, the IMA said, the average Indian consumption is a worrisome two to three teaspoons of salt, 16 to 20 teaspoons of sugar, and eight teaspoons of oil per person per day.We will soon be petitioning the government to push the food industry to display the salt contents and also suggest ideas to bring in low salt variants of popular foods. , said IMA coordinator Dr. Jayesh Lele."

These decisions were taken at a high-level meeting.With an accumulated non-performing assets (NPA) of about Rs. 64 crore, the risk-asset ratio of the bank had dipped to 8.52%, which is below the mandatory ratio recommended by the Reserve Bank of India.As per the banking norms, the risk-asset ratio should not go below 9%, said a senior government official who deals with the PSCS Bank.As an immediate solution, the bank sought permission from the Nabard, the inspecting authority, to show 10% of its NPA in the balance sheet to tide over the crisis.Loan amountNabard agreed to provide a loan to the government so that the amount could be parked in the cooperative society.The loan amount could be invested in the bank as government share so that it had adequate capital to deal with the risk. The inspecting authority had agreed to depute two of its staff as General Manager and Managing Director. Hitherto, the bank was functioning without the two important posts, the official said.A proposal was being mooted to utilise the assets of the Pondicherry State Weavers Cooperative Society, The Pondicherry Cooperative Handloom Export Development Project, sugar mills and spinning mills. These were considered main defaulters who had pledged their property as collateral for the loans availed.The Registrar of Cooperative Societies had been directed to insist that various defaulting societies should route their financial transactions through the PSCS.Another key decision was to close down some of the newly opened branches.Except the one at Tirunallar, branches at Kirumampakkam, Thavalakuppam, Sorapet, and Sederapet are loss-making units.The unviable branches would be merged with nearby units and the manpower re-deployed, said the official. The inspecting authority had agreed to help the bank in proper re-deployment of the 282 employees working with 28 branches across the Union Territory.All these proposals would be sent to the Cabinet for approval. The Cabinet is the final authority in deciding on the proposals, said the official.On Monday, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi chaired a meeting with officials from the Nabard, the Reserve Bank of India and senior officials to find a way to revive and professionally run the PSCS.Ms. Bedi, in a message, said the bank was on the road to adopting total professional management. It was a productive meeting. It is on the road to total professional management, she said."

The mill owners have said that that despite record-breaking sugarcane production, the industry has been in crisis for three-four years.Sugarcane is one of the most politically sensitive crops in Maharashtra, with the cooperative mill lobby enjoying undisputed control over politics, and being at the centre of one of the most aggressive farmers agitations before 2014.This season, nearly 290 lakh tonne sugar has been produced in the country. The annual consumption in the country is about 255 lakh tonne. Together with the leftover 40 lakh tonne from before, the total unused stock of sugar is likely to be around 75 lakh tonne.This will have a negative impact on sugarcane prices given to farmers and local sugar rates. The balance sheets of sugar mills have completely collapsed, as the mills have to sell sugar at Rs. 6 to Rs. 7 less than production cost. This will impact the fair and remunerative price (FRP) given to farmers, said Dilip Walse-Patil, president of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited and NCP MLA.Mr. Walse-Patil said the dues of the mills have gone up to Rs. 2,500 crore in the State, and Rs. 15,000 crore at the national level. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has broached the issue with Mr. Modi too.The sugar lobby has urged Mr. Fadnavis and Mr. Modi to announce measures such as eliminating export duty; creating buffer stock of at least 50 lakh tonne as done in 2002-03 and 2007-08; initiating dialogue with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and China under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement, SAARC free trade agreement and for barter trade of sugar; and fixing price of sugar under the Essential Commodities Act.Interestingly, NCP will hold the next leg of its  halla bol  rally in its bastion of western Maharashtra, the States sugar belt."

Though a significant portion of the budgetary allocation has been earmarked for agriculture, the ground reality is that without water in River Cauvery, all figures and words will remain worthless, they aver.The allocation for kudimaramathu works, water and soil resource development works, establishment of farm ponds in the delta region and Rs. 8,000 crore credit disbursal target through cooperative societies are welcome developments. On the other hand, the Budget is silent on our long pending demand for farm loan waiver, disbursal of arrears for sugar cane growers, profitable price fixation for agricultural produce and the like, points out P. R. Pandian, coordinator, All Farmers Federation of Tamil Nadu.Since farmers were unable to repay the already availed credit to the cooperative institutions, the societies were refusing them new loans.Also, the tardy kudimaramathu and desilting works in several water bodies have not served the farmers cause in the past. If new works were allotted, then they have to be monitored by a group containing farmers representatives, Mr. Pandian added.The Budget speaks of the allocation for the agriculture and allied sector. But all funding will come to a nought in the absence of water in River Cauvery. The State Government must concentrate on getting the Cauvery Management Board instituted early as much as it seeks to implement the budgetary schemes, says Thanjavur district vice-president of the Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam V. Jeevakumar.The Budget speaks on making cane suppliers stakeholders in sugar mills. What is the use now as many sugar mills are said to be operating on losses? Instead, the State Government must look into means for clearing the arrears due to the cane growers from the defaulting sugar mills. We were expecting some direction on our important demands of pricing of agricultural products and loan waiver and we are disappointed that they do not find a mention, Mr. Jeevakumar observes."

Over 253 rivers and 259 waterbodies are being monitored under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme.Water bodiesKarnataka tops the list in critically polluted water bodies, followed by Telangana with 12 and Kerala with 6. While lakes in and around Bengaluru are polluted, it is hard to believe that lakes in other States are not as polluted or worse off. This is perhaps because other State Pollution Control Boards do not monitor or give reliable data, said an official of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, which is monitoring 120 lakes and tanks in the State.Even according to KSPCBs monitoring, all 51 lakes in the city or immediate outskirts are in the D or E category  that is, unsatisfactory water that can be used only for wildlife propagation or industrial cooling purposes.Bhima most pollutedInterestingly, in the list of 38 rivers, only Bhima from the State finds mention.This is surprising as Arkavathy and Vrishabhavathy carry the sewage and industrial effluents from industries in and around Bengaluru, said Sharachchandra Lele, researcher from Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).Research from the organisation had shown that Peenyas effluents had seen COD in Vrishabhavathy exceed 800 mg/l while Arkavathy often exceeded 500 mg/l. Even KSPCBs monitoring data shows that Arkavathy, followed by Bhadra river, is in the lowest category of water quality.However, for Panchappa Kalaburagi, president of the Bhima River Farmers' Committee, the listing of the 86-km-long river which passes through Vijayapura, Kalaburagi and Yadgir districts, the extreme chemical pollution in the river is not a surprise. Sugar factories and cement factories along the stretch dump effluents directly into the river, while rampant sand mining in both Karnataka and Maharashtra has resulted in the disappearance of sand, which can naturally filter pollutants, he said, adding: Where is the river now? It is only stagnant pools of effluents."

Then government Medical Officer P. Ravi Raju working at the Public Health Centre at Karveti Nagaram, 10 km from Puttur, had happened to come across a five-year-old girl child, depending on insulin. Due to high cost involved in insulin, the parents had neglected the treatment of the baby.Dr. Ravi Raju undertook a series of campaigns at the rural side, speaking about sour facts about sugar if neglected. For the first time in Andhra Pradesh, he had started the Diabetes Day on a Tuesday in February 2007 at the PHC in Karveti Nagaram.Dispelling mythThe campaign soon spread to over a dozen mandals in Nagari, Satyavedu and G.D. Nellore Assembly constituencies. Arranging medical and awareness camps at a number of villages, Dr. Ravi Raju kept propagating that the essential requisite for a diabetic is to first visit a hospital and undergo a blood test.He tried to dispel the myth that diabetes was exclusive to the rich and those who were obese and lethargic. Dr Raju holds the record as the medical officer who had first started distributing the insulin vials directly to the public in 2007.Ravi Raju was transferred to the Government Hospital at Puttur in 2013. For five years, he had extensively visited hundreds of villages in the division, holding awareness camps on diabetes with the help of voluntary organisations and philanthropists.Booklet in TeluguRavi Raju himself had prepared a booklet in Telugu on the aspects of diabetes and its adverse impact, distributing it to the patients, along with medical kits.Speaking to The Hindu , Dr. Raju said that during the last 10 years, revolutionary changes had taken place in diabetic care in government hospitals, with free medical checkups, tests and distribution of medicines at the PHC and cluster level hospitals.HonouredIn recognition of his services, the State government had honoured Dr Raju with the Best Medical Officer Award thrice since 2006."

PeriasamyM_PeriasamyDespite being a habitat for several living organisms and a charger of citys groundwater level, Valankulam is facing threat in the form of pollution and encroachment.Surrounded by roads for long stretch, the water body is becoming a safe place to dump non-biodegradable waste, sewage and concrete debris at night. Besides, waste is strewn on the banks of the tank by a number of eateries, vendors of sugar cane juice and tender coconut.More than 1,000 bottles including that of liquor were removed from the banks of the tank in a recent cleaning drive conducted by two NGOs.We removed half tonne of waste from the tank during the cleaning drive for a few hours. Plastic bottles, liquor bottles, polythene sheets used instead of banana leaf and plastic cups are being dumped in the tank. Of late, we have been engaging people living close to each water body for the cleaning drive so that they realise the real threat of pollution and littering. Many who took part in the cleaning drives have said that they were not aware of the gravity of the issue until they themselves picked up garbage, said Sanjay Prasad, chief coordinator,Environmentalist Foundation of India which conducts cleaning drives in city tanks along with Kovai Kulangal Paathukaapu Amaipu on Sundays.The link road connecting Classic Tower junction on Tiruchi Road with Sungam-Ukkadam bypass has become a safe place for dumping concrete debris.Miscreants have levelled a portion of the water body at one point on the road by levelling debris.The dumping is done at night and I have personally stopped and informed the civic body on some occasions. Ambulance operators are supporting the act so that they will get a space to park the vehicles. We appeal to the Coimbatore Corporation to allot a place or arrange abandoned and unused quarries to dump debris. A mechanism can also arranged wherein people who want debris for levelling dry wells can get the same from contractors, said R. Manikandan of Kovai Kulangal Paathukaapu Amaipu.Corporation Commissioner K. Vijayakarthikeyan said that a team from the civic body would be sent to the spot, and ensured appropriate action.We will also look to demarcate various collection points for construction and demolition waste. The processing plant coming up at Ukkadam for construction and demolition waste will provide a long lasting solution, said Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan.People who live on the side of the bypass near Sungam also allege that sucker trucks used for cleaning septic tank are also releasing waste into the tank.Waste water from automatic water washer of TNSTC depot is released into the tank."

Also called the water bug, it can live for a week without its head. It eats just about anything, including faeces, the glue on book bindings, and other cockroaches, dead or alive.All these feats and more are encoded in the American cockroachs genome. The complete set of genetic instructions was sequenced by Chinese scientists and published this week in Nature Communications .In China, the cockroach is often called xiao qiang, meaning little mighty, said Sheng Li, an entomology professor at South China Normal University in Guangzhou and lead author of the paper. Its a tiny pest, but has very strong vitality.His team found that groups of genes associated with sensory perception, detoxification, the immune system, growth and reproduction were all enlarged in the American cockroach, likely underpinning its scrappiness and ability to adapt to human environments.Their study comes on the heels of the sequencing of the German cockroach genome, which was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution last month. While the German cockroach only inhabits human environments (particularly kitchens), the American cockroach flourishes in a wide range of habitats.That generalist lifestyle is reflected in the species genomes, both of which are massive, said Coby Schal, an entomology professor at North Carolina State University and an author of the German cockroach study.Consider, in comparison, more specialised insects like bedbugs or termites. Feasting exclusively on blood, bedbugs no longer need sugar receptors. Most termites, which live in the dark, are blind.Repertoire of proteinsCockroaches, on the other hand, need eyes, sugar receptors, ways to survive nasty environments  you name it. As a result, cockroaches have to have a very large repertoire of proteins, and therefore a lot of genes, Mr. Schal said.In the American cockroach, Mr. Li and collaborators annotated thousands of genes, including more than 1,000 thought to help the insect detect chemical cues from the environment. Among these are more than 300 genes associated with perceiving bitter tastes, which could help them decide which foods are safe.The scientists also interfered with more than 20 genes thought to be related to immunity, reproduction and development, and found that doing so had damaging effects on the cockroaches.Genes such as these are promising targets for future pest control methods, said Xavier Bells, a research professor at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. Such methods are already being developed for agricultural pests.In terms of basic biology, comparing the genomes of primitive cockroaches and termites  which evolved from cockroaches  will allow scientists to learn more about eusociality, a rare phenomenon in which organisms cooperate through sophisticated division of labour, said Tanya Dapkey, an entomologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the new research.For now, Mr. Li will follow up on the American cockroachs extraordinary healing capabilities: cut a leg off, and the insect will quickly regenerate it. His team is identifying the proteins and pathways involved in this process, with the hope that they can be harnessed for medical treatments. Cockroach extract has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to speed healing on cuts and burns.Weve uncovered the secret of why people call it xiao qiang, he said. Now we want to know the secrets of Chinese medicine.NY TIMES"

Muthuramalingam has said.Chairing the farmers grievance redressal meet held at the Collectorate on Friday, Mr. Muthuramalingam said the district administration, after opening adequate number of direct procurement centres, was buying fine variety paddy for a minimum support price of Rs. 1,660 per quintal and Rs. 1,600 per quintal was being given for other varieties as harvesting was about to be completed. Since the district experienced good rainfall during the last north-east monsoon, the Tamil Nadu Civil Services Corporation had so far purchased 10,220 tonnes of paddy.As for the disbursal of crop insurance benefits, the DRO said 7,221 maize farmers had received Rs. 22.22 crore and Rs. 7.52 crore had been given to green gram farmers. Moreover, 20,205 black gram farmers had been given Rs. 48.56 crore and 8,730 paddy farmers had been given Rs. 7.51 crore as insurance benefits for the year 2016  2017.Steps have been taken to get insurance benefits for cotton farmers (1,527) and sugar cane farmers (228), he added.Since coconut growers suffered hefty loss in 2016 owing to unprecedented drought, 457 farmers would get Rs. 14.55 lakh and this compensation was being paid to the accounts of the beneficiaries, Mr. Muthuramalingam said.When a few farmers who are yet to receive the insurance benefits raised their problems in the meeting, the DRO replied that the insurance firm officials had been instructed by the Collector appropriately during the recently held meeting and hence the beneficiaries would get the benefit shortly.Even as the meeting was in progress, farmer E. Madasamy of Karunkaadu near Narasinganallur sat on the floor in front of the DRO in protest against the delay in giving compensation for the plantains reportedly destroyed in recent gale. Since the officials took no step to compensate my loss despite repeated appeals, Ive been forced to stage a protest, he said even as other farmers persuaded him to give-up the agitation.As Mr. Madasamy picked-up a heated argument with the farmers pandemonium prevailed for sometime. After the police entered the hall, the protestor and others returned to their seats.Raising the issue of attempts being made by temple authorities and some Mutts to evict farmers cultivating crops in the temple and Mutt lands by cancelling the lease agreement citing non-payment of lease amount, farmer P. Perumbadaiyar appealed to the officials to arrange for tripartite talks to sort out this issue, for which the officials assured to arrange for a meeting within a week."
5b1479ba9855b7624638025f,Civilisation and its malcontents,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/civilisation-and-its-malcontents/article23345433.ece,2018-03-25,"In August, 1600, a 16-member delegation from Morocco landed at Dover, England. It was led by a 42-year-old man named Abd al-Wahid bin Masoud bin Muhammad al-Annuri whose portrait, drawn during his time in England, survives to this day. In it, al-Annuri is draped in a black robe with a scimitar tied to his waist. His right hand is pressed across his chest in an act of supplication and suspicion. He projects an unease and comes across as a man wary of others. Al-Annuri had been entrusted by the ruler of Morocco, Ahmad al-Mansur, to solicit and enlist Queen Elizabeth I for a military campaign against Catholic Spain, which was ruled by the great Habsburg monarch Philip II. To get a sense of Philip IIs importance, it is useful to note that the great historian Fernand Braudels influential work on the Mediterranean was titled La Mditerrane et le Monde Mditerranen  l'Epoque de Philippe II ( The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II ).Navigating a world of menMeanwhile, Elizabeth I, who had spent a lifetime deflecting Philip IIs aggressive moves, and being herself in the 42nd year of her reign, was shrewder than the Maghrebis had imagined. Since the 1560s, England had progressively become addicted to Moroccan sugar  nearly 250 tonnes was imported every year  and by 1600, nowhere was the evidence of this trading partnership seen more vividly than on Elizabeths face. Her teeth had begun to rot from the sugared fruits that she was hooked on. Presumably, they imagined a pliant old woman who could be seduced with visions of geopolitical freedom from Spain. But like many a woman who have had to navigate a world of men who foolishly underestimate them, her response was a masterclass in blunt refusal masquerading as reluctance. Elizabeth agreed that the Moroccans had an excellent idea but unfortunately, logistical difficulties and her curmudgeonly advisers prevented her from waging war together.The inspiration for Othello?What al-Annuri made of this refusal we will never know. But his complicated identity  he was a Muslim from Spain who had been forcibly converted to Christianity, and who then reconverted to Islam  was a source of great fascination and dread to not just Elizabeth but to many others who had heard and seen the Arabs wander about London (They are very strangely attired and behaviored, wrote an observer). And in all of Elizabethan England, no one observed more keenly than a playwright called William Shakespeare. As per Professor Jerry Brotton, who writes in his fascinating book The Sultan and the Queen , al-Annuri was most likely the inspiration for Shakespeares famous hero Othello  a protagonist of divided loyalties, physiologically (a dark skinned moor in white Europe) and psychologically (Othello is most likely of North African Muslim origin and fights for Christian Europe against his coreligionists, the Ottoman Turks). Predictably, Shakespeares Othello arouses admiration and envy among the Venetian elite and his own contemporaries, especially when the fair skinned Desdemona chooses him over all others. None of this absolves Othello of his own failings  overconfidence about his own talents, willingness to countenance hearsay, and, most fatally, an inability to identify the serpent in his marital garden: his standard-bearer Iago who poisons Othellos mind against Desdemona.For his part, when Iago conjures up visions of Desdemona in bed with Othello to her father  even now, now, very now, an old black ram is tupping your white ewe!  the anxiety is not mere jealousy of an inferior man towards his better. Nor is it sexual rivalry between two men. It is a deeper animus that we find, to this day, burbling in the rhetoric of far-rightists across the U.S., Europe, West Asia, and India: the fear of outsiders and their women. Iagos words to Desdemonas father, Brabantio  Awake the snorting citizens with the bell. Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you  is echoed on social media with the solemnity of theologians: demographic change is imminent. These messages are couched as a public safety announcement: civilisation is in danger, culture is in peril, act now!Concern trollingIn our age of social media, Iagos malodorous whispers come across as a strategy of deception called concern trolling in which, under the guise of righteousness and compassion, one preys on the natural insecurities of humans. As we learn more about how expertly democratic institutions can be subverted via social media and fake news, we realise that our polities are no different than Othello: easily suspicious, overzealous, and quickly aroused to overreaction. When capable  even if cynical  ideologues, intelligence agencies, and politicians act no different than Iago, pouring sweet authoritarian poison into our minds that lulls us away from thinking for ourselves, we risk becoming all too eager, like Othello, to strangle the Desdemona of our public lives: these hard-won collective freedoms."

According to her aide V.K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa had indicated she was unwell while she was in the bathroom situated on the first floor of her Poes Garden residence, after having brushed her teeth.In an affidavit filed before the Justice A. Arumughaswamy Commission (probing Jayalalithaas death), Sasikala provides an account of what transpired at Jayalalithaas residence before she was rushed to hospital. She says she helped the former Chief Minister to her bed, where she fainted.Shortly afterwards, K.S. Sivakumar, Sasikalas relative and a doctor, entered the room. Two personal security officers and a driver were called immediately.Ambulances despatchedAccording to sources privy to the 55-page, 99-paragraph affidavit filed on March 12, Dr. Sivakumar phoned Vijay Kumar Reddy, husband of Apollo Hospitals vice-chairperson Preetha Reddy. Two ambulances were despatched from Apollos Greames Road and Teynampet hospitals, which reached the residence in 10 or 15 minutes. The Apollo team brought an unconscious Jayalalithaa down from her bedroom on a stretcher. The police control room was informed and roads cleared of traffic.Sasikala has declared that Jayalalithaa regained consciousness in the ambulance and asked where they were taking her. She was told they were en route to the hospital. Earlier in the day, Dr. Sivakumar had examined Jayalalithaa twice. Significantly, Sasikala has said she suggested a visit to the hospital on that very day, but Jayalalithaa had refused to go.Her fever subsided later, the affidavit says. Sasikala claims that Jayalalithaas health issues were mainly due to the stress caused by her conviction (and imprisonment) in the disproportionate assets case in September 2014.The mental stress adversely affected her health, she says. Jayalalithaa had chosen to contest from the R.K. Nagar constituency in Chennai only because her mobility had been affected greatly due to high levels of blood sugar, the affidavit states.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas health deteriorated significantly in the first week of September 2016, partly because of fluctuating sugar levels.Two doctors, a diabetologist and a dermatologist, were consulted and they prescribed low dosage steroid tablets.She recovered but had a fever starting September 19.

Vidyasagar Rao had met her on October 22, 2016. AIADMK leaders O. Panneerselvam and M. Thambi Durai and Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar saw her sometime during September 22-27, 2016. Akka (elder sister) was being taken from the MDCCU (Multi-Disciplinary Critical Care Unit) on the second floor to the ground floor on a day before September 27 for being scanned. At that time, Jayalalithaa saw Veeraperumal and Perumalsamy, her Personal Security Officers. Akka told them, I am fine now, do not worry. Doctor has asked me to stay for a few days. I can go home soon. The three AIADMK leaders mentioned above and other party functionaries saw her speak from a distance, according to the affidavit.On October 22, 2016, Governor C. Vidyasagar Rao saw Akka through a glass partition. Akka saw the Governor and raised her hand. The Governor has described this interaction in his book Those Eventful Days . After this, the Governor met me too, says Sasikalas affidavit.Sasikala has further said State Labour Minister Nilofer Kafeel and certain other ministers saw Jayalalithaa on November 19, 2016, when she was being moved to a private room.When contacted, Sasikalas counsel N. Raja Senthoor Pandian, said, Multiple senior bureaucrats have deposed before the Commission that they met the then CM from September 22, 2016 to December 3, 2016 at Apollo Hospitals. Various witnesses and evidence would prove that Jayalalithaa was conscious and interacted with multiple individuals during that period, he added.Video recordsSasikala says she has made videos of Jayalalithaa with her permission, of which four have been submitted to the Commission.The footage includes Jayalalithaa being treated in 2015 and 2016, before the Assembly election.Sasikala says this was part of Jayalalithaas efforts to document her health. Four video clips shot at Apollo Hospitals have also been submitted to the Commission.According to Sasikala, Jayalalithaas room at Veda Nilayam contains a note proving she was lucid in November, 2016. In it, Jayalalithaa had instructed AIADMKs parliamentarians on the partys strategy for the winter session of Parliament.Sasikala also provided a list of five officials, who attended a September 27, 2016, meeting on the Cauvery water sharing issue, and obtained instructions from Jayalalithaa directly.

5b1485d49855b75db2e6c93a,Combating a needle phobia,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/combating-a-needle-phobia/article23404701.ece,2018-04-01,"Around five years ago, when M. Balusamy, 72, was told he would need injections to control his diabetes, the retiree was apprehensive. What if I had problems with the shots? he wondered. Until then, he had been on tablets and a controlled diet. But given that he switched to injections, today his blood sugar is well under control.Handling anxietyFor many people with type 2 diabetes (a condition characterised by the body being unable to effectively use its natural insulin to control blood sugar) the prospect of self-administering injections appears scary. To determine if this anxiety could be handled through psychological counselling, the M.V. Hospital for Diabetes, Royapuram in Chennai recently conducted a study.One group of patients received psychological counselling after they had been told to start their injections in addition to the regular counselling from diabetes educators, while the control group only had the counselling with diabetes educators. All the patients were about to start injections for the first time. Results showed that those who received psychological counselling better overcame their fear of self-injecting and self-testing.About 40% of people with diabetes require insulin injection after about six to eight years, when oral medications are not enough to bring down their blood sugar levels, says Vijay Viswanathan, head of the hospital. But the thought of self-injecting made patients reluctant, he adds. They believed injections to be the last resort and wanted to avoid them or feared they would get used to them and later find it difficult to be weaned off them.Reluctance on the part of the patient to start insulin injections when advised to do so can lead to poor control of diabetes and complications, including in the kidney and eyes, he says. This is of particular concern in India, with the number of diabetic people in the country estimated to be 72 million. The Chennai-based study, published in the International Journal of Current Research , had 80 patients ranging from the ages of 30 to 70 and living with diabetes for at least two years.All patients were given a questionnaire to assess their fear of self-injection and self-testing. The group that got psychological counselling addressing their various concerns had a significant drop in their HBA1C levels, while the other group did not record much of a drop. HBA1C is a test to determine average blood sugar levels of the last three months. The first group also reported a lower fear of injections and self-testing than the other group.Studies from many parts of the world have revealed that a fear of injections is common among patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with poor glycemic control and lower adherence to therapy.Explaining itThis fear, some researchers suggest, may have its roots in human evolution. In past centuries, even a non-fatal puncture wound could have caused a fatal infection and individuals who feared being struck by thorns or knives may have been less likely to die in accidents. Thus protecting oneself from jabs and pokes, the argument goes, could mean higher survival rates.There are lots of myths about insulin and the fear of injecting it is very common, says P. Dharmarajan, Director, Institute of Diabetology, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Chennai. He says that it took time to convince patients to start it and most have tried to postpone it. We have to counsel them to begin insulin. Patients should understand that it needs to be taken when required and that it is a life-saving hormone.Jaichitra Suresh, consultant physician at SIMS Hospital, Vadapalani, Chennai, says the goal of treatment now is to start insulin early in order to preserve the insulin reserves in the body. But most patients believe that starting insulin is the end and that it will lead to complications, when actually it is begun to keep blood sugar under control in order to avoid complications. If they are not advised properly, some even drop out of treatment, she says.Now that we know it helps, psychological counselling should be the norm for patients starting insulin for the first time, for them to overcome their fear of injections and help build confidence to take insulin regularly, says Dr. Viswanathan. An article in Diabetes Update (Summer 2017), a publication of Diabetes UK, a charity for people affected by diabetes, spoke of the importance of needle selection and good injection techniques. Research into needle technology and newer modes of insulin delivery can also potentially help, it says.zubeda.h@thehindu.co.in"

Several new varieties have been developed and the near-extinct, indigenous varieties from the region are back in business. The reason being that varieties from Lucknow are fast gaining ground in Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and west UP. Farmers in Malihabad are growing these varieties not for the fruit but to sell guava grafts to other states. Hundreds of nurseries have come up in the area to meet the growing demand of guava grafts from across the country. Arunachal Pradesh is the latest to have taken at least a lakh guava grafts from Malihabad in July this year. Since it is guava season at present, flowers and fruits could be seen on the grafts already.""Guava is being preferred for cultivation in different parts of the country due to its hardy nature and ability to give higher profits with limited inputs,"" said director, Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture CISH ), Lucknow, Shailendra Rajan.Indian Council of Agricultural Research ( ICAR )-CISH, Lucknow, has been instrumental in developing commercially viable varieties. Scientists at CISH have used hybridization and selection as a major tool for developing new varieties. Guava breeding aims at developing high-yield and high-quality varieties with fruits of uniform shape, good size, attractive colour of pulp and skin, high lycopene content, lesser and softer seeds and, at the same time, being suitable as a table variety and for processing purposes and having a wilt-resistant rootstock. That makes lab varieties Lalit, Shweta , Dhawal and Lalima are better than the ones growing naturally.Notable breeding program for guava improvement started about 30 years ago at CISH. So far, the institute has developed about 2,100 guava hybrids and about 1,000 half-sib population of famous varieties like Apple Colour and Allahabad Safeda.The institute's commercial varieties like Lalit and Shweta are being cultivated commercially in wide range of agro-climatic conditions due to their high yield, good fruit quality, responsiveness to pruning and wider adaptability.

He wanted to know why the NSF units were closed when private factories were being run on sound lines making profits.Stating that K. Kavitha, Member of Parliament, had become a liability to the constituency as her performance as an MP was the worst among all, he dared her for an open debate on the efforts of the TRS government to reopen sugar factories.

While khoya tilkuts, til laddoos and special jaggery tilkuts are in demand, sugar-free tilkuts have also become popular.Tilkut is a traditional sweet which is painstakingly made by a group of three to five workers. Sugar syrup is prepared and kneaded with til in a utensil. Later the dough is flattened with the help of a heavy pestle. It is a labour-intensive process which requires patience and caution.More than six workers have been engaged in tilkut making for the last 15 days. Every day they prepare over 35kg of the sweet, said Mantu Kumar , a tilkut trader near Patna Museum. He added, We have introduced sugar-free tilkuts keeping in mind our health conscious customers.Another trader Dhruv Kumar , who has been selling tilkuts on Boring Road for 10 years, expects better business this year. He said, I have sold over 40kg of tilkuts in 15 days. Last year we suffered losses due to note ban.According to city-based doctor Vijay Kumar Gupta , people should consume til owing to its medicinal properties. It keeps the body warm in winter and has a high content of vitamins and minerals. Til reduces blood pressure, lowers cholesterol, prevents cancer and is also good for digestion, he told this reporter and advised diabetics to refrain from eating too many tilkuts.Apart from their unique taste and the health benefits they offer, tilkuts packed in colourful boxes are also attracting Patnaites. Homemaker Swati Ranjan, who was buying jaggery tilkuts from a store near Boring Road roundabout on Wednesday, said her family members had been eagerly waiting for Makar Sankranti because everyone loves eating tilkuts on the day."

The other is developing Quality Standards for the implementation of Standard Treatment Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary hypertension in Kerala, for which the State is partnering with the Imperial College, London, and World Health Organisation (WHO).The integrated programme will be implemented in six districts in the State  Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Kannur, Wayanad, Ernakulam and Alappuzha. Protocol-based diabetes management too has been added as an additional component as 20% of the States population suffer from diabetes.The study reported that the treatment and control of hypertension and diabetes are alarmingly low even among the educated, with only 13% of those diagnosed with hypertension and 16% of those with diabetes achieving adequate BP and blood sugar controls. Our aim is to increase this control rate to at least 50%, a senior health official told The Hindu.Everyone over 30 years in the designated area will be screened under each ASHA for diabetes and hypertension at primary health centres (PHC) through outreach camps and household surveys.The screening at the Primary Health Centre level has already been initiated while field-level screening will be taken up soon.Patient-friendlyUnder the IHMI initiative, an expert committee has developed and revised hypertension and diabetes management protocols in such a way that henceforth the specified drugs in the protocol alone will be purchased and distributed by the State to PHCs. The aim is to make the treatment schedule more patient-friendly and to improve adherence.Blood pressure and blood sugar levels will be routinely checked for anyone above 18 years coming to the sub-centres or clinics and protocol-based management will be initiated for those with diabetes or hypertension.The target Blood Pressure is below 140/90 mmHg for those below 80 years and below 150/90 mmHg for those above 80 years.The target routine blood sugar (RBS) should be less than 140 mg/dl.These patients will be followed-up for one year to ensure treatment adherence. Vital Strategies is offering technical assistance and training for personnel.They have also appointed cardiovascular health officers and treatment supervisors in four districts to follow up on the patients, sources said.The patients will be evaluated every quarter. The training of medical officers and health staff has been completed and protocols have been disseminated, he said.The separate module for the programme has been integrated into the e-health platform so that details of every patient is recorded, analysed and systematically followed up for an entire year to measure the impact of the protocol-based management of diabetes and hypertension."

The five-year-old terminal is now exporting rice, sugar, marine produce and paper products by using the weekly scheduled call of M/s Far Shipping.A joint venture of the Kakinada Seaports Limited and the Bothra Shipping Services Private Limited, the KCTPL was launched in 2015 and commenced operations from the next year. Till recently we have handled rice and sugar to the African and the Gulf countries. However, there has been a steady increase in the commodities and the destinations as well, observes M. Subramanian, terminal manager of the KCTPL.In the year 2016-17, the terminal exported rice to the tune of 2,700 TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit that is used to measure a ships cargo carrying capacity) whereas the same has gone to 4,900 TEUs in the current fiscal. Same is the case with the sugar that has gone from 2,800 TEUs to 3,800 TEUs during the corresponding period.Hassle-free executionThe exporters are realising the proximity and competitiveness of the KCTPL hitherto being exported from Visakhapatnam. They are expressing satisfaction over the hassle-free execution of their shipments, he says.The terminal accepts a minimum quantity of 20 tonnes, as the average capacity of container is 26 tonnes. Since there has been a steady increase in the frequency of vessels, the shipping time is getting reduced steadily. With regard to the export of marine produce, the volume of reefer containers during the current fiscal is likely to reach 250 TEUs, whereas the same was registered as 64 TEUs in the last financial year.The destinations for the reefers increased from the United States to the Europe and Gulf countries.Denmark-based Maersk Line has announced the launch of import services to Kakinada, which is a long-pending demand from the local trade fraternity. This will accelerate the activities of the terminal and the frequency of cargo movement will be intensified further, Mr. Subramanian explains."

Asia Mariam, District Collector, presided over the meeting.Thangavel, leader of the cane growers association, complained that the private sugar mills functioning in the State are not giving the government support price for the cane procured for crushing for the past four years. About Rs. 1,433 crore is due to the farmers from 24 private sugar mills, he said.He said a private sugar mill functioning in Pallipalayam has to pay Rs. 65 crore to farmers. The farmers representatives held discussion with the sugar mill management on various occasions. The sugar mill management has come forward to sanction only Rs. 300 per tonne instead of the government support price of Rs. 1,200. This was gross injustice, he said and demanded action against the sugar mill for its failure to pay the government support price.S. Nalla Gounder, state president of the Tamil Nadu Cane Growers Association, said that River Cauvery was the lifeline of the state and enabled farming operations in 12 delta districts and solved drinking water problem in as many as 20 districts of the state. The Centre should ensure setting up of the Cauvery Management Board as per the direction of the of the Supreme Court to enable Tamil Nadu to get its share of Cauvery water every year without fail.Mr. Gounder urged the state government to exert total pressure on the Centre for setting up the Board.Demanding steps for the CMB and provision of government support price for cane, the farmers staged a walkout from the meeting. They raised slogans highlighting the demand outside the meeting hall. The police pacified them and took them outside the Collectorate campus.Vaiyapuri of Nanjaiidaiyaru said that farmers demanded release of water in the East and West canals for launching farm operations.

According to revenue department figures, 1,753 of these cases, which account for 60% of the total, were recorded after the loan waiver was announced in June.Despite the waiver, the number of suicides fell just 4.4% over the previous year. In 2016, the state saw 3,052 suicides.Yet, one region in the state saw a rise in cases. The sugar belt of Western Maharashtra reported 102 cases in 2017 compared to 75 in 2016, a rise of 36%.The Vidarbha region, from where chief minister Devendra Fadnavis hails, continued to report the highest number of cases. The region reported 1,344 farmer suicides in 2017, just 7% lower than the previous year. The five districts of the Amravati division saw a decline of only 20 cases since last year while the Nagpur division recorded a decline of 80 cases.By the end of 2017, cotton farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada had to contend with a massive pest attack of the pink bollworm. Vidarbha also faced another form of distress -- as many as 51 farm labourers died after the use of toxic pesticides in spraying operations. However, these figures are collated separately.Arid Marathwada reported 991 suicides in 2017, which was 5.8% lower than the previous year. North Maharashtra recorded 475 cases, almost on par with the 479 cases recorded in 2016. Konkan recorded five suicides in 2017, while in 2016 not a single case was reported.The government maintains the loan waiver will not bring down the number of farmer suicides and the solution is increasing investment in agriculture. The roll-out process was delayed initially owing to the lengthy verification process.Farm activists point to inefficient delivery of the loan waiver. There were so many eligibility criteria for the loan waiver that a large number of debt-ridden farmers were excluded and have been unable to benefit from it, says Ajit Navale from the Kisan Sabha.In some cases, money for the loan waiver has reached the banks, but farmers are yet to receive fresh crop loans, points out farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. He points out that crop pricing is yet to improve without which indebtedness will continue in the farm sector. Cotton prices are currently at Rs 5,200 per quintal, down from around 5,700 per quintal at this time last year, he pointed out."

Addressing the meeting to form the committee, Speaker Hriday Narayan Dikshit cautioned the the newly elected chairman of PAC, senior SP MLA Mehboob Ali about impending challenges.Among nearly a dozen of committees of the House, PAC is considered most powerful and prestigious and its chairman is always from the Opposition side and not from the ruling party. The selection of Ali as its chairman also reiterates its thrust on Muslim-Yadav (MY) combination as the leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary is a Yadav.""A large number of audit reports are pending for the past 15 years and now the time has come to act upon it,"" Dikshit said on the occasion. ""To maintain and implement the financial discipline in the state machinery, the founding fathers of the constitution have made this PAC a very important committee which should act against the guilty on the basis of audit reports presented before the House,"" he added.Several audit reports submitted by the CAG and the lokayukta, recommending action against government officers and politicians are gathering dust for the past 15 years.Even Governor Ram Naik reminded the previous SP government several times about the action-taken reports on the recommendation of CAG and lokayukta. But nothing happened despite lokayukta recommnending strong action against at least six BSP ministers.Similarly , various CAG reports also failed to draw attention of the previous government while among many cases it had highlighted corruption in the controversial sale of the sugar mills in the state during BSP regime. With the constitution of the PAC, which is already delayed by six months, the Speaker expected that those reports would be looked into now.The PAC has powers to call all those found guilty in various audit reports and and seek their explanation. The Speaker said that if the new PAC and its chairman worked hard to act on the pending reports, it would fix the erring officers and politicians and send a stern message that whosoever was found guilty of corruption would not be spared."

It would be a pleasure for my wife and me to bring these tastes to the city folk, says Jacson, who is a football coach.Yenenesh Mokenene from Ethiopia, who is a PHD student from Osmania , has on offer an innovative dish which is her inspired by the famous Ethiopian coffee. Our sweets are mostly liquid in consistency and take over a week to prepare. So I have tried to make some thing on my own, which i am calling Black Gold. It is of the size of coffee beans, and is infused with real coffee from Ethiopia, says Yenenesh, who has spent over 10 years in the city for her education. She would also be preparing some Turkish delights like Baklava and Molava, which though not indigenous, are quite popular with East Ethiopians.French student.

We wanted to make this a memorable event for the couple which is why a typical Marathi silk sari and halwyache dagine were ordered from our native place in Maharashtra. Though the jewellery is available here as well, the craftsmanship is different, shares Karuna. Sharwari, on the other hand, is excited to witness the festivities as a new bride, Im excited to wear the black silk sari my mother-in-law has got for me. Even she is going to don the traditional nauwari for the occasion, along with my elder sister-in-law. The family will converge at our in-laws place and they have even planned a menu with til laddoos, gulachi poli and more.The customary sugar jewellery, halwyache dagine, is sugar candies made out of roasted sesame seeds combined with sabudana and sugar powder. Smita Amol Chandwadkar, who makes the jewellery on order in Indore, explains, In ancient times, ladies used to make the jewellery at home. Today people either order from Maharashtra or some Maharashtrian stores in Krishnapura and Rambagh in Indore. I take orders for kamarbandhs, mukuts, bangles, necklaces and mathapatti for new brides and small ornaments like anklets, for new-born babies. Chandwadkar also sells and offers the jewellery on rent through social media portals. Neeta Thakur, who is conducting the ceremony for her daughter-in-law, ordered through WhatsApp. We are a Rajput family, but have a sweet Maharashtrian daughter-in-law Soudamini, for whom we will be conducting the ceremony. We sought help from her parents and they got us in touch with the ladies from the community who have been selling customised sugar jewellery online. We placed an order two weeks ago, and today she will wear it for the celebration, she informs.The quintessential black sari too holds a special significance. Irawati Paranjape, 68, matriarch of the Paranjape household in Bhopal and an erstwhile Marathi language teacher from Pune, shares, There is no religious significance of the black sari, but as the festival falls in the peak of winter, black is the preferred colour as it absorbs heat and keeps the wearer warm. Even men wear black on Sankranti. The week following Makar Sankranti will be marked by haldi-kumkum celebrations at various households, where Maharashtrian ladies will apply auspicious colours on each other and exchange sweets and gifts. English teacher, Snehal Deshmukh, 28, who will be hosting her second year of haldi-kumkum celebrations adds, Its a week full of revelry for our community as we welcome the new year with hopes of full harvest and prosperity. Food on this occasion will consist primarily of fruits specific to the season  like ber and amla  and of course more dishes with healthy helping of til (sesame) and gud (jaggery).While the Maharashtrian community will celebrate with tilgul and kites, the Punjabi community finished up royally with a night full of dancing around bonfires and getting decked up in vivid colours of the state. The ladies of Bhopal-based Agroha Ladies club made sure they left no stone unturned as they tuned up in their brightly coloured Patialas, parandas and jootis and danced away around the Lohri. Freshly harvested gehu (wheat) and rebdi was also offered to the fire as families shared popcorn and other sweets."

The deceased, Anant Ingole , hailing from Samnapur in Beed district, worked as a computer operator with the Vasanwadi gram panchayat in the district. He also ran an internet cafe and an agency which helped prepare PAN, Aadhaar and other documents for people.Ambad deputy SP Ramesh Sonawane told TOI, Ingole had come to Aurangabad around six months back and was attending a course in preparation for his banking exam. During this period, he got to know the suspect and had invested the money with him to buy the truck. The vehicle was rented out to a Mumbai firm, which recently stopped its operations. Ingole then started asking the partner to return his money.Sonawane said that when matters began coming to a head, the partner, identified only as Dhumal, called up Ingole on Monday saying he wanted to discuss returning the money. Dhumal took Ingole in his car in which the other two suspects were already seated. They stopped at a dhaba in Pachod where they allegedly forced Ingole to consume alcohol.Sonawane said the trio took Ingole to Shahagad-Patharvala near Kuran phata in Ambad division of Jalna district. There, they assaulted him and tied his hands and legs. One of them illegally fetched petrol in a bottle from a petrol pump. They threw the petrol on Ingole and set him ablaze, he said.While at the dhaba, Ingole got a call from his friend Tukaram Gholap in Beed, who is also a gram sevak. Ingole told him that he was at the dhaba with Dhumal and two others. A couple of hours later, Gholap again called Ingole, who informed him that he was facing a threat to his life from the trio. Gholap called up a friend in Aurangabad, who contacted a policeman attached to the Pachod police. They went to a few dhabas in the area but got no information about Ingole.Ingole had also sent a text message to his older brother, Govind, who is a civil engineer in Pune. In the message, Ingole had mentioned that he was with Dhumal who owed him Rs 21lakh. He also told his brother about the threat to his life.A security guard employed with the Beed-based Samarth cooperative sugar factory saw the burning body and informed the Gondi police. A team headed by inspector Machindra Survase went to the spot. Ingoles identity was known from his PAN and Aadhaar lying nearby. The police contacted his family which identified the body."

(Express Photo by Praveen Jain/File)The Centre on Friday announced a scheme to reimburse its share of GST on raw material used to prepare meals in community kitchens run by religious organisations, such as langar.The scheme, called Seva Bhoj Yojna, has an outlay of Rs 325 crore for financial years 2018-19 and 2019-20, according to a statement by the Ministry of Culture.Union Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma told The Indian Express, We have been getting representations from many social and religious organisations in this regard and have been working towards this for some time.The scheme envisages reimbursement of the Centres share of CGST and IGST on purchase of raw items such as ghee, edible oil, atta/maida/rava/flour, rice, pulses, sugar and jaggery, which go into preparation of prasad or langar offered free of cost by religious institutions. The objective of the scheme is to lessen the financial burden of such charitable or religious institutions who provide food free of cost without any discrimination to public/ devotees, said the statement.The scheme applies to only those charitable or religious institutions  temple, gurdwara, mosque, church, dharmik ashram, dargah, math and monasteries  that have been in existence for at least five years, and who serve free food to at least 5,000 people a month.A month ago, SAD leader and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had written to the Prime Minister for waiver of GST on ingredients used for langar in gurdwaras.

Express Photo By Pavan Khengre, India has 7 million tonnes of surplus sugar this year and with forecast of good rains the surplus stocks were expected to pileup further next year. Express Photo By Pavan Khengre,India on Friday made its first pitch to export about 1.5 million tonnes of Indian sugar to China in a bid to reduce surplus stocks, weeks after an informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Wuhan.About 50 officials of the 25 Chinese sugar companies attended a close door interaction with top officials of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) to discuss the possibility to import about one million or 1.5 million tonnes of Indian sugar, which could fetch about USD 350 million.India has 7 million tonnes of surplus sugar this year and with forecast of good rains the surplus stocks were expected to pileup further next year, Gaurav Goel, President of ISMA, told the media after his delegations talks with Chinese officials.While most of the sugar produced in India is consumed at home, India so far has restricted sugar exports to East Africa and Sri Lanka.With the surplus stocks, India is now looking to export to China. China imports about 4.5 million tonnes of surplus stocks mostly from Brazil, Thailand and Cuba, Abinash Verma MD, CEO of Indian Sugar Exim Corporation said.This is the first-time India is making a strong bid to export to China though India has exported about two lakh tonnes in 2007, he said.Besides East Africa and Sri Lanka, India is making a strong pitch for export of sugar to China and Bangladesh to cut losses due to surplus sugar stocks, he said.Fridays meeting took place following the informal summit during which Prime Minister Modi had urged Xi to import Indian sugar, rice and pharmaceuticals, official sources here said.Modi was expected to have follow up discussions during his visit to Chinese city Qingdao to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to be held on June 9 and 10, Verma said.Fridays meeting was organised by the Indian Embassy here.Speaking at the meeting, Counsellor Economic of Indian Embassy, Prashant Lokhande elaborated on the growing economic engagement between India and China and assured Chinese firms that India would emerge as a major sugar trading partner for China with consistent policies and quality product.ISMA officials said India hopes to export its sugars to China under the 50 per cent tariff category, though details are yet to be worked out. China charges 80 per cent tariffs on sugar imports.The response from the Chinese officials for Indias offer of exports is extremely positive, Goel said.There were also inquiries whether the Indian firms could supply and match the quality, he said, adding that an invitation has been extended for the Chinese officials to visit Indian mills which have the most modern facilities.Those who attended the meeting included officials from China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, (CCPIT), China Sugar Association (CSA) and COFCO.The ISMA officials also called on Indian Ambassador, Gautam Bambawale, who informed them that exports of sugar was discussed during Modi-Xi meeting. He offered the embassys full support to push Indian sugar exports to China.Earlier, India has made strong bid to export Soybean and rice to China to address the trade imbalance between the two countries which now amounted to USD 51 billion in over USD 80 billion trade last year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav) Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac in Idea Exchange. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac talks about the constant shift in the Lefts position and the need to reinvent the system, asserts that the Left can fight rabid fascism while retaining its identity, discusses the hill highway project undertaken by the state and slams the Centre for shabby implementation of GSTANIL SASI: Some of the decisions taken by your government are not traditionally associated with Left governments  land acquisition for highways, having a Harvard economist (Gita Gopinath) as an advisor, single-window clearance for industries. What prompted this?There has been a constant shift in the Lefts position. This is not the first time, the position of the Left has been evolving over time. If you look, traditionally, the Left tries to mobilise people on the basis of redistributive goals. The Left is not there to take charge of production or to develop industries. In agriculture, industry etc the Left mobilises workers to ensure that they get a fair share of the distribution. Over time, that system has evolved. We have done it well in Kerala. The average citizen in the state enjoys a much better standard of living and quality of life as compared to the rest of India. We are very proud of that achievement.Now, there are two things happening. One is the uneven development of the Left movement in India. Secondly, our success is raising expectations. For example, now that everybody is literate, people are not satisfied with ordinary classrooms. They want a much higher quality of education.Life expectancy has risen to 76-plus, and there are new lifestyle diseases which cannot be treated in the traditional way. So, you need to totally reinvent the system. The youth today are educated and their job aspirations have gone up, they are not satisfied with the employment opportunities that their parents had. They want quality jobs that match their educational qualifications. If the Left doesnt have a programme to meet these challenges, then we will be undermining ourselves. One has to reinvent and address these challenges.Now, these challenges are not a question of redistribution. Creation of quality jobs will mean that you will have to move away from the traditional labour-intensive industries or the highly polluting chemical industries into industrial sectors such as knowledge industries, service-based industries, highly-skilled industries or value-addition industries. This cannot be done by the public sector alone. You need to have private investment. The Left says you cant do what many others are doing in the rest of the country  give up on labour rights, environmental laws etc. So then, how do you attract them (the industries)? The opportunity lies in creating the best infrastructure, physical and social. The challenge is to revamp the entire infrastructure while keeping the past values alive. This means you will have to reposition yourself, rethink some of your stances We are not apologetic about it. We try to build up on our achievements. So you are right, we have shifted some of our positions.HARISH DAMODARAN: You said one has to move away from the traditional sectors. But why dont you look at more traditional industries such as pepper where Karnataka has overtaken Kerala. Another example is coconut, where the production in Kerala is nowhere close to that of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Why doesnt Kerala build on its strengths and focus on agri-based industries?Agriculture in Kerala cannot survive unless you do value addition  socially regulated modernisation. Thats the Left alternative. Yes, we will go for most advanced technology but we are not going to disregard our traditions; we will protect them. For coffee, we are going to make Wayanad coffee a brand. For coconut, unless Kerala learns to make value addition to every piece of coconut, the farmer is not going to have a decent life. So, value addition is part of the agenda. Thats the only way Keralas traditional crops are going to survive because protected market is gone, and structural adjustment is very difficult.RAVISH TIWARI: In the past, when the Left has tried to recalibrate itself, it has been jolted, like in Singur and Nandigram.In West Bengal, when we wanted to change the change was very fast and many people could not accept it. Land has to be taken if industry has to come up but farmers and people need to understand and accept the logic for that The Amaravati model is a fairly good model of land pooling. I went there to study it; it is well-compensated. We have to think of those models.We can debate, engage with people who protest and then make an offer that they cant refuse. Two times, three times the price But it puts a heavy fiscal burden on the State and there are financial constraints.A big battle is going on. We will definitely see to it that the BJP is defeated, said Thomas Isaac. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav) A big battle is going on. We will definitely see to it that the BJP is defeated, said Thomas Isaac. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)MONOJIT MAJUMDAR: In April this year, you said that the government cannot provide compensation for the land that will be acquired for the hill highway project, and that people should support the development project by voluntarily giving up their land.The hill highway project passes through areas which are mostly under-developed and the people want roads in those parts. They have been voluntarily giving up the land so that the roads can come up there. The collaboration with the population is good. The fact is that when the road comes, the prices (of land in the area) will go up. There will be price escalation in real estate and therefore we will continue it.Of course there would be people, like the marginal farmers, who will be compensated. But in stretches where the roads have already been built, the prices in the area are going to go up.I didnt make a statement like that. Somebody asked me if we will apply the same rate there (hill highway project), I said no.MANOJ C G: Every secular party in this country is thinking about ways to fight the BJP. Traditional rivals such as the SP and the BSP have joined hands, the JD(S) and the Congress are coming together. When every party is willing to shed their reservations, why is the CPM, despite being the most consistent, credible voice against the Right, still being rigid?We are different, and we want to be different also. All the other political parties are in the same boat when it comes to economic reforms or economic policies in India. Which party is denouncing neo-liberalism in India? Now you may have a debate on what is right or wrong, but we have chosen an economic platform and that is the platform on which we are trying to mobilise people. Therefore, we want to differentiate ourselves.Even in the past when we supported the Congress, we didnt join the government. We have done it unconditionally; we havent taken anything from them. We have always differentiated ourselves from the Right parties. It should be done all the more now because unlike in the past, even regional parties have succumbed to neo-liberalism.Secondly, we are introspecting. It is on the basis of this (introspection) that our cadres, our movement is being built as an alternative. At the same time, we have to fight this rabid fascism that is coming up in Kerala. We are introspecting when the Congress is ruling, you join the others and when the BJP comes, you join the Congress. In the process, what has happened is that the distinctive feature of the Left platform got blurred. It undermined the Left influence in many parts of India. Therefore, after a critical review, (we decided) that we had to keep our distinct identity and try to mobilise people.The threat of the BJP is becoming too imminent. This is a different animal; not something that we have seen so far. Therefore, we have debated democratically and come to an understanding Yes, as in the past, we will not have any alliance with parties but we will adopt electoral tactics so as not to split the votes and see the BJP defeated.MANOJ C G: Historically, hasnt a united front been the answer to fighting the Right?A big battle is going on. We will definitely see to it that the BJP is defeated.LIZ MATHEW: What would be the CPMs or the Lefts role in the run-up to 2019?Very complicated. We are critically examining our experiences; there will be a need for a united front with other parties. But, we will never give up on your identity, the fact that we are the Left.MONOJIT MAJUMDAR: In a country like India, where the pace of development is different in different states, there is always going to be this debate about rewarding performance and the need for equity. You would also agree that the more developed states are always going to be in a better position to keep increasing their leads while the backward states are always going to be struggling to catch up. So isnt that a question the Finance Commission, which is mandated to decide the devolution of funds from the Centre to states, also has to look at? The need for ensuring equity so that more developed states dont keep on increasing the gap with the less developed ones.I cannot claim to be Leftist if I deny the importance of equity of distribution. In any federal system where redistribution takes place, the backward, lagging, resource-scarce states will have to be given more. So if they (backward states) are given more weightage, its welcome. I have never said reward states which have achieved more, thats not the problem at all. We stand for redistribution to the poorer states. Fine, but dont make that the only criteria. (On April 10, Kerala had called a meeting of finance ministers of southern states in Thiruvananthapuram to discuss their response to the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission. The minister had then said that the southern states were being penalised for successfully implementing national policies.)There were two components to the distribution formula. One was income. Two, population. The population basis is 1971. Now when you move from 1971 to 2011, there is a perfect correlation between population transition and economic stature, except a few outliers such as Gujarat. Therefore, virtually, the 2011 population becomes a proxy for backwardness again. So you have a formula where the only consideration is backwardness.Then, how am I to run a government? There are minimum services that have to be provided from revenue; that cannot be borrowed. That (revenue) is required. So, Im not against equity, in fact I am for it. All we are saying is that there is a procedure adopted by all finance commissions, stick to that tradition.ANIL SASI: Wasnt the 2011 figure partly used by the 14th Finance Commission?Yes, so leave it to the Finance Commission. Let the Finance Commission choose what is the kind of percentage to be given to 2011 and 1971. Why bind their hands?There has been a constant shift in the Lefts position.

This is not the first time, the position of the Left has been evolving over time, said Thomas Isaac. (Express Photo by Gajendra Yadav)AANCHAL MAGAZINE: You have been quite vocal in the GST council meetings. In the last meeting you opposed the proposals for digital payments and sugar cess. How easy or difficult is it to put across your point during GST council meetings?Well, when the GST council was formed, there were 15 states. They could take politically different positions from the Centre and, therefore, there was a meaningful consensus. Now, the situation has changed. We have become a very small minority. But so far, I admire the approach taken by Arun Jaitley, who could have taken decisions based on the majority. He has always taken on the path of discussion and tried to reach an understanding.SUMIT JHA: Staying with GST, what has been the shortfall for Kerala in terms of revenue in the period between July and February? Have the states that have suffered a shortfall been able to identify the reasons for that? Some of the states have not suffered shortfalls and met their targets.Kerala revenues were rising by 20 per cent per annum. Thats very good, gives a lot of elbow room to do many things. Then, it came down sharply. Our revenue has to grow by 20 to 25 per cent. GST, we thought, will provide that, because Kerala is a destination state. 80 per cent of our marketable consumption comes from outside, so we thought we would start to gain.Secondly, Kerala has high density services, and therefore (with GST) it would be better off. Our government programmes, right from the first Budget, were aimed at increasing revenue by 20 to 25 per cent or minimum 20 per cent. But after the GST came, it increased by only 10 per cent, or even less. The reason: the GST system is not in place. Whoever would ever imagine such a shabby implementation of the most important programme of the nation. One year into the programme, and we are still debating about the return form, we have not finalised it. It will take another six months to do it.LIZ MATHEW: In March, an International Monetary Fund report said that India has survived the worst and that the economy looks in good shape  the effect of demonetisation is fading. What do you have to say about it?But why should we go through this ordeal? Why do we have to suffer all this, to prove what point? Tell me, has there been any instance in the world where for something like demonetisation to work, a nation goes through a crisis, money loses its worth Just imagine, the total quantum of the national loss; its a criminal act. It was such an audacious act, nobody would think it would be implemented unless there was a big reason. This kind of crude step has not been discussed even by decent economies. Even the economies that supported demonetisation would not have advised him (the Prime Minister) to implement it.SHOBHANA SUBRAMANIAN: Are you expecting an early election?Well, I dont know. Though the BJP thinks they have captured the entire country, Karnataka shows us that the moment you have Opposition understanding or unity, they (the BJP) are a small minority. They have not improved very much from the 31 per cent support base with which they came to power. So, the only factor which permitted them to actually capture power was Opposition vote split. Now, Karnataka election would, I think, speed up this process of understanding between Opposition parties, and prevent the split.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Use of certified seeds will naturally improve the crop quality, which in turn will help jute traders to go for enhanced diversification of jute products.According to her, the diversification of jute products will help jute mill owners reduce their dependence on the government under the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory use in Packaging Commodities) Act, 1987, which mandates packing of 90 per cent of food grains and 20 per cent of sugar in jute bags.According to the Union minister, West Bengal has all the potential to become the largest exporter of diversified jute products.

The deputy labour commissioners office in Meerut had also settled on compensation of Rs 8.5 lakh to the victims father, along with the mill owners contribution of Rs 3 lakh. However, SP leader Atul Pradhan protested outside the mills locked gates Sunday demanding Rs 50 lakh for Monus family.The management and local administration had been giving false information regarding the casualty and number of those injured on Saturday. Now they are unwilling to pay Rs 50 lakh compensation and provide job to a member of the victims family. This shows the apathy of the Yogi government towards the poor and downtrodden, said Pradhan. Jayveer, Monus father, however said, While no compensation can make up for the loss to our family, we are satisfied with what the government has done for us.BJP legislators from Meerut, Jitendra Satwai and Somendra Tomar, who were scheduled to attend the inauguration of the Peripheral Expressway in Baghpat, also reached Kinauni Sugar Mill where they tried to pacify the protesters, assuring that the government had announced adequate compensation.

(Photo: Praveen Khanna/File) Sugarcane farmers outside a sugar mill in Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. (Photo: Praveen Khanna/File)In Baghpats Baraut tehsil, all eyes were on a corpse kept on two thick slabs of ice. Sugarcane farmer Udayveer Singh, who was on a dharna over non-payment of dues by sugar mills and an increase in rural power tariff, died on Saturday morning at the protest site. Singh, 58, was among the 50-odd sugarcane farmers who launched the protest on May 21.As news of Singhs death spread, the protest site swelled and hundreds of angry farmers from the sugarcane belt laid siege to the tehsil office. Leaders of Opposition parties, including the SP, RLD and Congress, rushed to the protest site.Baraut tehsil is barely 30 km from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will, on Sunday, throw open the countrys first smart highway, which touches the western UP district of Baghpat. Initially, district authorities claimed that Singh may have suffered a cardiac arrest. Around 8 pm, nearly 10 hours after his death, the family lodged an FIR, which said Singh had suffered an unnatural death.At the protest site, Chaudhary Surender Singh, one of the leaders of the agitating farmers, said, Power bill has been raised to around Rs 1,600 every two months. Our dues have been mounting by the day. There are farms where the sugarcane has not even been harvested. The farmers are facing a crisis situation.The protesting farmers said that while the BJP had promised to clear their dues within 14 days of coming to power in the state, it instead raised the power tariff, aggravating the crisis for farmers such as Singh, who owned eight bighas in the nearby Jeewana village.The government hiked power tariff twice in the last five months. Sugar mills have closed. They are importing sugar from abroad. It is a grave issue. (Singh) sacrificed his life fighting for the interest of others, he is a martyr, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said.Chaudhary also pitched for Opposition unity, saying if parties can reach electoral understandings, they should make common cause with farmers as well.In neighbouring Kairana, where sugarcane dues have emerged as the biggest issue in the upcoming bypoll, the Opposition candidate is contesting on an RLD symbol.We will soon release last years dues. A proposal has been sent to the state headquarters. On tariff, we have promised farmers that a meeting will be arranged with the western UP power authority. We can only execute the policies framed by the government, SDM Arvind Kumar Dwivedi told The Sunday Express.Dwivedi said the current charge of using tubewells was Rs 180 for 1 Horse Power machine. The mills are supposed to pay around Rs 290 per quintal to the farmers, he said.In Jeewana, Singhs family members  his wife and three sons, the youngest in Class 10  huddled in the courtyard, waiting for his body to be brought.Baghpat ADM Lokpal Singh, who reached the spot around 6 pm, initially announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for Singhs family and later raised it to Rs 12 lakh.I will write to the government recommending that the compensation be enhanced to Rs 50 lakh as is being demanded by the farmers and the family, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File photo) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots and appealed to people not to give anti-social elements the opportunity to trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh. (File photo)Four days before the bypoll in Kairana Lok Sabha constituency, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots and appealed to people not to give anti-social elements the opportunity to trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh. Thrice in his speech, Adityanath named Jat youths Sachin and Gaurav, who were allegedly lynched in Kawaal village of Muzaffarnagar in 2013 after they accused Shahnawaz Qureshi for harassing their relative and allegedly killed him. That incident had led to a mahapanchayat meet that was followed by riots between Jats and Muslims in western Uttar Pradesh.Addressing a public meeting in Shamli in support of BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, the chief minister said, Polarisation is already done. I know. On one side, there are people who flared up riots in Muzaffarnagar and western Uttar Pradesh. Youths like Sachin and Gaurav were brutally murdered and they along with others were implicated. Then no other party spoke out. Only BJP workers raised their voice. Workers like Suresh Rana (now UP minister) and Sanjeev Balyan (former Union minister) were booked, Hukum Singh (former Kairana MP) was stopped from getting justice for people.Adityanath asked why SP and other parties were silent when Sachin and Gaurav were killed. If they get an opportunity again, they will follow the policy of appeasement and trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh, he said, adding that riots had become an industry in western Uttar Pradesh in the past and that BJP government improved the situation.If they could, they would have stopped Kanwar yatra too, he said, adding that before kanwar yatra  the yatra passes through Shamli  last year, the administration told him about restrictions on use of microphones, conch shells and pellet drums. He said that on being asked about reason for the restrictions, the officials said some people feel bad about it. I said that if some people feel bad because of celebrations of our festivals, do we feel good with the festival celebration by others?Adityanath said his government withdrew the restrictions, and helicopters were used to keep a watch on anti-social elements and shower flowers on kanwar yatris. He said arrangements were being made to develop dedicated lanes at both sides of Gangnahar for the convenience of pilgrims. Ab nahi hoga to kab hoga (If not now, then when), he said.In an apparent reference to the controversy over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Aligarh Muslim University, Adityanath said, Koi keh raha ki ganna ya Jinnah. Main keh sakta hun ki ganna hamara mudda hai lekin Jinnah ki tasvir bhi nahi lagne denge hum log (some people are chanting  sugar cane or Jinnah. I can say, sugarcane is an issue for us but we will also not allow Jinnahs portrait). The chief minister said payment of around Rs 984.88 crore has been done to farmers from sugar mills in Kairana and said he has taken responsibility to ensure payment to every farmer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The bypoll is all the more important for the ruling BJP after its recent loss in the Gorakhpur and Phoolpur bypoll where arch rivals Samajwadi Party tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party to defeat the saffron party.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which include an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. (Source: PTI) The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which include an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. (Source: PTI)The Kairana bypoll was necessitated following the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh in February. The BJP fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana, while RLD nominated Tabassum Hasan, who was also supported by the BSP, SP and Congress.In Kairana, there are 12 candidates in the fray. The opposition was hoping that by consolidating the anti-BJP votes, they would be able to repeat the results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections, especially after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan pulled himself out of the bypoll fray and embraced the RLD (Rashtriya Lok Dal). The ruling BJP, on the other hand, would be making extra effort to retain both Kairana and Noorpur seats after todays polling.The major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers. The farmers in the constituency have been losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which include an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the BSP, makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate.

(Source: ANI)The state election commission officer said in all the places where machine problems were reported, people were given more time to exercise their francise by extending the time beyond official 5 pm.The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena alleged that the breaking down of voting machines was a political ploy of the ruling BJP to swing the elections in their favour. They also raised questions as to why machines were procured from Gujarat.Senior NCP leader Praful Patel said, We have always warned EVM/VVPATs are being misused for the elections. If the EVMs/VVPAT are verified there should be no reason for its malfunctioning. He demanded provisions for alternative ballot papers along with EVMs/VVPATs.The NCP leader wondered why EVMs from Surat in Gujarat were used when machines were available in Maharashtra.The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Chavan expressed serious concerns over the developments in Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha by-polls.Almost 25 per cent EVM and VVPAT problems lead to hardships as voters had to stand in queue for long hours. We want repolling in all those places where machines broke down. Such instances make us suspect if ruling party was trying to manipulate the system. While dismissing the argument of the election commission about technical snag due to heat, Chavan said,  In the past elections have taken place during summer. Just a fortnight ago elections happended in Karnataka. In 2014, Lok Sabha polls were also held in peak of summer. If EVM cannot withstand summer heat, election commission should replace it with ballot paper.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said their fears of BJP using all means to win the elections have been proved correct.Meanwhile, the BJP questioned the Opposition over why similar allegations were not raised in Karnataka where Congress formed the government along with JD(S).BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, The opposition are raising questions on election commission which is an independent authority which is very unfortunate. They opposition should also explain if they have the same complains in Karnataka where they formed the government.The EVM/VVPAT failure is a pointer to ruling party trying to misuse the machinery to serve its own interest. The ruling party was going to polls keeping the remote and contril of EVMs/VVPAT in their hands, he observed. The Sena also demanded replacement of EVMs/VVPAT with ballot paper in elections.The bypoll in Palghar was necessitated following death of sitting BJP (MP) Chintaman Wanaga.

(Praveen Khanna) All costs considered, cane cultivation promises a net return of Rs 7,500 per bigha, which is 62.5% more than the production cost. (Praveen Khanna)Why are farmers growing sugarcane, even as arrears payable to them by mills in the current 2017-18 season has crossed Rs 23,000 crore? The answer is simple: It is one of the few crops today thats still profitable to grow. The Indian Express spoke to a cross-section of farmers in Shamli district of western Uttar Pradesh (UP), to get a reasonable idea of what it costs to cultivate sugarcane on one bigha and the corresponding returns based on the price and yield of the crop from that area (5.9 bigha make an acre).The seed requirement for cane is generally pegged at 5 quintals per bigha. At the UP governments current state advised price (SAP) of Rs 325/quintal, the cost of the crop planted as seed comes to Rs 1,625. Field preparation and sowing expenses are around Rs 700 per bigha each. Spending on nirai and gudai (weeding and hoeing) is another Rs 1,500 per bigha.Coming to fertilisers, farmers typically apply 15 kg of di-ammonium phosphate (costing Rs 350), 50 kg urea (Rs 327), 10 kg muriate of potash (Rs 120), one kg sulphur (Rs 100), one kg zinc (Rs 100) and 2 kg Zyme (a plant growth regulator; Rs 100) per bigha. Crop protection chemical costs are even more: Rs 720 for 60 ml of Coragen (used against early shoot borer and top borer insect pests), Rs 250 for 20 mg of Dantotsu (to control white grub and termites), Rs 300 for 6g of Sempra (a weedicide), Rs 100 for 200g of Bavistin (a fungicide) and Rs 50 for 6g of Strepto-Plus (an anti-bacterial).Nutrients and chemicals together, thus, add up to over Rs 2,500 per bigha. The next item is water. Farmers give 15 irrigations on an average for sugarcane, costing Rs 50 each or Rs 750 per bigha (this is using electricity; pumping with diesel gen-sets will be five times more expensive). They also spend about Rs 1,000 on bandhai or tying and propping up the cane plants to prevent lodging after they have grown beyond five feet (this is done 3-4 times, each costing Rs 300-350).Finally, there is harvesting and transport. Labourers now charge Rs 40 or so for harvesting every quintal of cane, while loading and transport to the nearest purchase centre cost an additional Rs 10 per quintal. The average yield per bigha in Shamli is 50 quintals for CoJ-67, an old general variety, and 60 quintals for Co-0238, an early-maturing cane that has gained popularity in the last 3-4 years.All in all, the cultivation cost of sugarcane on a bigha yielding 60 quintals works out to roughly Rs 11,800 (say, Rs 12,000). On the other hand, the realisation from this crop, at the SAP of Rs 325/quintal for early varieties, would be Rs 19,500. It translates into a net return of Rs 7,500 per bigha, which is 62.5 per cent more than the production cost.We will not get this from any other crop. In basmati paddy or potato, theres too much of price uncertainty, while the government hardly procures any wheat here. Moreover, the agola (green top leaves) from sugarcane takes care of the fodder needs of our animals during the crushing season from November to April, says Ashok Malik, who farms cane on 20 out of his 30-bigha holding in Karoda Hathi village in Shamli tehsil.But there is a catch. The above costs dont take into account interest on working capital, which would be even more in a scenario of delayed payments. Factories are supposed to pay farmers the SAP on cane within 14 days of purchase, but Malik hasnt received money for even half of the 1,200 quintals he has supplied to the Upper Doab Sugar Mill in Shamli this season.Further, its not just what we spend from our pockets. There is also the imputed value of family labour, rent on owned land and interest on our capital assets. The Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50 per cent return after factoring in all these costs. After all, dont we have other expenses as well, including on quality education for our children and healthcare?, points out Jitender Hooda, a farmer from Shamlis Kheri Bairagi village, who cultivates sugarcane on 40 out of his 48-bigha land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

According to officials, the private sugar mills contribute almost 40% of the total sugar production in the state.Amid the recent decline in sugar prices, Haryanas private sugar mills have failed to make cane price payments to the farmers on time. According to officials, the private sugar mills contribute almost 40% of the total sugar production in the state.One among the largest sugar mills of India, Saraswati Sugar Mills Limited situated in Yamunanagar, in a recent letter to Haryana Cane Commissioner, sought financial support from the state government stating that it was facing financial crisis following unexpected decline in sugar prices.Another private mill, Naraingarh Sugar Mills Limited, has also approached the Cane Commissioner citing similar problems. Haryana Additional Cane Commissioner Jagdeep Singh Brar told The Indian Express on Monday that they have forwarded the request of both mills to the state government.The state has one more private mill, Piccadily Agro Industries Ltd, in Bhadson (Karnal). Its Vice President (Cane), Karam Singh said, We have already made payments till March 15. We are trying our best to make the payments but without financial assistance, we wont able to make regular payments in future. Apart from three private mills, the state has 11 cooperative mills too.Speaking to The Indian Express on Monday, Haryana State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills Ltd chairman Chander Prakash Kathuria admitted that the private mills were not able to make payments to farmers on time but claimed cooperative mills were making payments on time.However, Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, Many of the cooperative sugar mills are also not making cane payments to the farmers on time for the past few months. The government should help both private as well cooperative mills.Saraswati mills CEO S K Sachdeva, in his letter to the cane commissioner, said, The unexpected decline in sugar prices has adversely affected our drawing power from banks and capacity to make cane price payments to the farmers during current crushing season resulting in discontinuation of cane price after 12th April, 2018 the financial constraints may also adversely affect our repair and maintenance schedule of the factory to make it operational in time for the ensuring crushing season 2018-19.As anticipateddue to higher production of sugar (both Haryana as well as all India), sugar prices have crashed. With the result, the cane price paying capacity has been affected adversely. Sugar prices which were about Rs 3675 per quintal during November, 2017 have reached at the level of Rs 2715 per quintal during the month of April, 2018 as such there is fall of about Rs 950 per quintal In view of anticipated much higher production even during the next season 2018-19, the sugar prices are expected to further go down, he mentioned in the letter.According to Sachdeva, the central government has approved financial assistance of Rs 5.5 per quintal of cane crushed during the current crushing season 2017-18 in order to help the sugar mills to clear cane price dues of farmers while the Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) is Rs 255 per quintal of cane. This assistance shall be paid by the central government directly to the farmers. On the similar lines, state government should also provide financial assistance/subsidy, Sachdeva demanded in the letter.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna/File) Kairana has come under the spotlight a couple of years back after local MP Hukum Singh claimed scores of Hindu families had been forced to move out of the area. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna/File)With the JD(S) and the Congress joining hands to keep the BJP out of power in Karnataka, all eyes are now on Uttar Pradesh where bypolls for the Kairana Lok Sabha seat and Noorpur assembly seat are slated to be held on May 28. The bypolls hold much importance for the ruling BJP after the recent drubbing in the Gorakhpur and Phoolpur bypolls where arch rivals Samajwadi Party tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party to defeat the saffron party.Moreover, after a show of strength by a united Opposition during the HD Kumaraswamy swearing-in in Karnataka, the BJP must have felt the pinch, and a defeat in Kairana and Noorpur will make it obvious that regional parties together can combat the invincible BJP in the 2019 general elections. Unlike in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the Congress has joined hands with the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party in a bid to deal another blow to the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats.Kairana hit the national headlines before the 2017 UP assembly elections after the local MP Hukum Singh raised the issue of Hindu exodus from the area. The bypoll in the seat has been necessitated following the death of Hukum Singh.To cash in on the sympathy wave towards Hukum Singhs family, the BJP has fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana. But RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan, who has the support of the BSP, SP and Congress, seemed confident too. Hasans candidature got a boost on Thursday after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal at a meeting held in Kairana in the presence of Jayant Chaudhary, the national vice-president of RLD.Now, there is no contest left in the bye-election. We are going to win with a huge margin in the range of 3-4 lakh votes, RLD chief Masood Ahmad said.On being asked about the issue of Hindu exodus, the candidates aired divergent views. The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped, said Mriganka. Before the 2017 UP Assembly elections, hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment. However, after the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath was formed, the law and order scenario in the region has improved, she added.Tabassum Hasan, however, outrightly rejected the reports of Hindu exodus from the area. There was no exodus from Kairana in the first place. Both Hindus and Muslims have been living here in harmony for generations. The exodus issue was flagged only to divert attention from important issues, to add a communal colour to the elections and divide voters, she said.Talking to indianexpress.com about his decision to withdraw his candidature, Hasan said, The basic reason behind my decision to withdraw is to defeat BJP. If I would have contested the election, BJP might have won. And I dont want communal forces like BJP to get stronger. Kanwar would have divided the Muslim votes, which form the major chunk of voters in Kairana, and thereby, would have weakened the united opposition candidate.Till yesterday, the BJP was in a strong position. There was a division of Muslim votes which would have taken place had I contested. And it appeared to me that BJP might win because of our internal family feud. And it would have sent a very wrong message in the entire nation. Thats why I decided to support Tabassum Hasan, said Kanwar.Mriganka, however, seems unaffected by Thursdays development and exuded confidence. The preparations are going all good and we are 100 per cent confident of winning the bypoll, she said.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which includes an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BJP), makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate.The BJP candidate expressed confidence that Muslim voters will vote for development which has taken place in BJPs rule, both at the Centre and the states. BJP will get the support of Muslim voters. Definitely, a significant number of them would vote for development which is taking place in BJPs governance, be it state or Centre. And people are going to support Modi ji, Mriganka told indianexpress.com. She added that results of the Karnataka elections will not have any impact on the UP bypolls.However, it is not just the Muslim vote which the ruling BJP has to worry about. Convincing the angry sugarcane farmers remains a big concern for the ruling party. The farmers are losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.Kairana constituency has six sugar mills. In the current 2017-18 season (October-September), the six mills have, as on May 18, bought sugarcane worth Rs 1,778.49 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315-325 per quintal. Of this, they were to pay Rs 1,695.25 crore within 14 days of purchase but have so far disbursed just Rs 888.03 crore. That translates into Rs 807.22 crore in arrears  for a single constituency.Asked about the farmers concern, Mriganka said the situation has improved. The chief minister himself has taken a lot of interest in the issue. And he has himself addressed their grievances. And this problem arose because there was a bump in the production of sugarcane and the output was I think three times over. So, it was beyond capacity. But the payment that has been released is already more than what was happening in the previous years. And whatever payment is left, we updated it very soon. The farmers are with us, said Mriganka.(With inputs from ENS)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Neither SAD nor Congress parties could provide clean and safe drinking water to the people of Punjab and on the contrary, even the natural water sources got highly polluted during their tenure in power in the past, he told voters.If they cannot even fulfill a basic need, that of clean water, what else will they be able to do for you , Rattan Singh asked.Punjab Cabinet Minister Tript Rajinder Bajwa, while travelling across villages of Shahkot Assembly constituency, has said the state government would clean all the natural water sources, including rivers of Punjab.Meanwhile, in Seechewal village, people have glued posters outside their houses saying that they will not vote for those who wont stop contaminating rivers and rivulets.Central team should visit for study: SukhbirSAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal Monday alleged that the Punjab government was patronising an environmental massacre in Punjab by turning a blind eye to the man-made ecological disaster caused by the Chadha Sugar Industries and owners of the distillery.In a letter to Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Harsh Vardhan, Badal described the pollution of Beas River water and the death of aquatic life in water bodies in Punjab as a shocking example of the insensitivity of the offending parties.He said a central team should be deputed for a spot study of the situation. That team should assess the extent of the damage so far and likely to be caused in coming days and determine the scale of compensation to be paid to the affected people.Another AAP leader joins SADA day after two AAP leaders joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), AAP Adampur candidate Hansraj Rana Monday joined SAD in the presence of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal.Speaking about his decision to join SAD, the AAP leader said that he got thoroughly disillusioned with AAP because its leadership professed idealism but indulged in rampant corruption. He said he was also distraught by the fact that the party did not respect Punjabis or their sentiments and believed in dictatorial control over the AAP Punjab unit.Rana added that the other main reason why he chose to join SAD because this was the only party which had taken utmost care to plan and implement pro-Dalit schemes. He said that Shagun scheme and SC scholarship scheme had been discontinued by the Congress government.Sukhbir Badal while welcoming Rana into the Akali fold, said his entry would strengthen the party at the grass-root level in the Doaba region.

Tonnes of molasses leaked into Beas river from the sugar mill located at Kiri Afghana on Thursday killing aquatic life and polluting water.Also, the government is mulling to increase the security deposit of sugar mill from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore. The security of Rs 25 lakh, earlier deposited by the unit has already been forfeited as penalty for pollution and killing aquatic life.Sources said that out of Rs 1 crore to be deposited as security, Rs 50 lakh may have to be deposited for restoration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water and Rs 50 lakh for the loss of aquatic life in case of any such incident in the future.Besides, the state government has ordered sampling and testing of water from all water works, supplying canal water to seven southern districts, so that the contamination could not affect potable water consumers.Water testing was done in about 300 water works after every 48 hours to ensure there was no affect on human population. We will charge this bill also from the unit if the inquiry report indicts the unit for negligence, said a source in the government.Kahan Singh Pannu, Chairman Punjab Pollution Control Board said the inquiry report was awaited. The DO of water at the tail end of canal network is five now. It was zero on Thursday, the day of leak. Anything above four is good enough. The inquiry is taking time. I cannot say anything else on the issue till the inquiry is completed.Sources said the government was dealing with a huge political pressure on the issue, but it would not spare anyone if found guilty.We have released 2000 cusecs (each cusec is 32 litres of water released in a second) of water to dilute and wash out molasses from Thursday to Sunday. The report is now good. It is a relief, said a source. Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore has meanwhile sought details of the extent of contamination and damage done to the environment by molasses leak into Beas from Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.Expressing concern over the spillage, Badnore in his letter to the CM has stated that the river water is used as drinking water in districts of Rajasthan and Punjab.

(Express Photo by Oinam Anand/File) Sources in the SUGARFED said that due to poor market of molasses this year, they were expecting a rate of Rs 150 per quintal. (Express Photo by Oinam Anand/File)While sugar prices have fallen by 30% in past few months owing to bumper sugarcane production across India, including Punjab, rates for molasses, a by-product of sugarcane, has also now crashed by 85 per cent. Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mill (SUGARFED) has already cancelled the first tender and has now invited more tenders expecting a higher price for molasses, which needs to be cleared from the mills before the next crushing season, which starts in November.In the first tender, the rate for molasses was quoted Rs 85 per quintal, against the last years Rs 550 per quintal. Sources in the SUGARFED said that due to poor market of molasses this year, they were expecting a rate of Rs 150 per quintal. Molasses is used either in the distilleries or in cattle feed making industry. There are 16 sugar mills in Punjab, 7 of them private and 9 cooperative. Together, they have crushed around 828 lakh quintals of cane till April 30. Around 42 to 43 lakh quintals molasses has been produced this year. The average production of molasses is around 5 kg per quital of sugar cane.While a few of the private mills have their own running distilleries where they use molasses, others sell it in the open market to cattle feed makers and distilleries. We sold molasses for Rs 685 per quintal a few years back. Last year, it was Rs 550 per quintal. But this year, we are facing huge losses, not only in sugar rate but molasses too, said R S Jhingar, chairman of Nawanshahr Cooperative Mill, one of the largest cooperative mill with 2500-tonne crushing capacity per day (TCD) which has produced around 120 lakh tonnes molasses this year. Jarnail Singh Wahid, president of Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association, said the extremely low rate this year was because of over production of cane across India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A first-time MLA, he became the Minister of State for Fisheries, Youth Empowerment and Sports and was then promoted to the Cabinet rank. His getting the Congress ticket is a foregone conclusion. He has come up the hard way in politics as he had twice tasted defeat in Assembly elections.He lost to the independent candidate K. Jayaprakash Hegde from Brahmavar Assembly Constituency (which has vanished under the delimitation exercise) in 2004 Assembly polls; and to K. Raghupati Bhat of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Udupi Assembly seat in the 2008 Assembly elections.Luck smiled on him only the third time when he won the 2013 Assembly polls with a big margin of 39,524 votes.Presently, the BJP has multiple aspirants for its ticket including Mr. Bhat, former MLA, Nayana Ganesh, UdayKumar Shetty and Yashpal Suvarna. The names of Kota Srinivas Poojary, MLC, K. Jayaprakash Hegde, former MP, too are doing the rounds. However, what has added a zing to the polls this time is the entry of Lakshmivara Tirtha Swami of Shiroor Mutt, who though desirous of the BJP ticket, has made it clear that he would contest as an Independent candidate, if the BJP denied it. He is the first among the seers of the Ashta Mutts with a history of 800 years propagating the Dwaita philosophy to enter the electoral fray.Since his announcement he has been in news because of a video clipping which purportedly showed him making sensational claims, which he has denied, and because of the letters being exchanged between him and other seers of Ashta Mutts over the video clipping. The seer who beats music drums is set to change the rhythm of the polls.Gangadhar Birti from the Janata Dal (Secular) and Shekhar Havanje from the Republican Party of India (Prakash Ambedkar) too would be trying their luck in this election."

Two liquor-making units located on the premises of the mill are functioning.The sugar mill and distillery units are on the same premises but we have sealed only the sugar mill as distillery units have nothing to do with the spillage, said Kuldeep Singh, XEN, PPCB.Our sugar mill had closed on April 30. Now PPCB has sealed it. Our distilleries have been running normally, said a senior employee at the mill who did not wish to be named.The tanks were the molassess were wrongly stored are located behind the sugar mill and the two alcohol-making units. One of the tanks in which molasses was stored was constructed to store the effluent produced by the two distillery units.PPCB has fined the sugar mill Rs 25 lakh. The PPCBs final report on the incident is still awaited.Farmers in the area contested the claim by the mill management that the spill occurred because it was forced to crush cane beyond its capacity and had nowhere to store the extra molasses other than a tank not meant for it.Several farmers showed an SMS message from Chadha Sugar Mills in mid-April, which read: We have been facing problem of less arrival of sugarcane at the mill. It is forcing us to shut down the mill again and again. So management has decided to completely shut down the mill by April 25th. Farmers are requested to bring the sugar cane till April 25th.However, the mill employee said the message was standard wording for the notice of closure that mills are supposed to give to farmers, and the same message went out every year.The farmers also denied they had staged protests outside the mill and forced it to accept cane for crushing, and said their protests were to demand dues owed by the mill to them.Mahja Kisan Sangarsh Committee leader Balwinder Singh said, We have staged many dharnas in front of this to put pressure on the management to release our payments.

Both brothers were killed in a shoot-out in 2012.On Friday morning, Kaurs father, and his brother Paramjit Sarna, who is officially designated as the religious advisor to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, met Industries Minister O P Soni at Punjab Bhawan. Paramjit Sarna told The Indian Express that they had gone to meet the minister to inform him that the molasses leak was an accident. My niece is going to face huge losses worth crores. It was not a chemical that she was throwing into the river. It was a by-product of sugar that she would have used as raw material for preparing liquor.

Till now only ethanol produced from sugarcane was allowed to be mixed in petrol.A meeting of the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the new policy which categorises biofuels as First Generation (1G), which produce bio-ethanol from molasses and bio-diesel from non-edible oilseeds. Second Generation (2G) ethanol can be produced from municipal solid waste and Third Generation (3G) fuels like bio-CNG.The Policy expands the scope of raw material for ethanol production by allowing use of sugarcane juice, sugar containing materials like sugar beet, sweet sorghum, starch containing materials like corn, cassava, damaged food grains like wheat and broken rice, and rotten potatoes, an officialstatement said.It also allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee, it said. Under the policy, a viability gap funding scheme for 2G ethanol bio refineries of Rs 5000 crore in 6 years in addition to additional tax incentives, higher purchase price as compared to 1G biofuels will be provided, it said.The policy also encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil and short gestation crops. Mixing of one crore litre of bio-ethanol in petrol saves Rs 28 crore of foreign exchange on oil imports. The ethanol supply year 2017-18 is likely to see a supply of around 150 crore litres of ethanol which will result in savings of over Rs 4000 crore of forex, the statement said.Besides, it will lead to 30 lakh tons of lesser carbon emissions. By reducing crop burning & conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in Green House Gas emissions, it said. It is estimated that annually 62 million tonnes of municipal solid waste gets generated in India. There are technologies available which can convert waste/plastic and municipal solid waste to drop in fuels. One ton of such waste has the potential to provide around 20 per cent of fuel.The statement said Rs 800 crore is investment needed to set up a 100 kilolitre per day bio refinery. At present Oil Marketing Companies are in the process of setting up 12 2G bio refineries with an investment of around Rs 10,000 crore. Further addition of 2G bio refineries across the Country will spur infrastructure investment in the rural areas and create jobs, it added.By adopting 2G technologies, agricultural residues/waste which otherwise are burnt by the farmers can be converted to ethanol and can fetch a price for these waste if a market is developed for the same. Also, farmers are at a risk of not getting appropriate price for their produce during the surplus production phase. Thus conversion of surplus grains and agricultural biomass can help in price stabilization, the statement said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari Thursday said that the governments spending this fiscal will witness a spike as more projects under the flagship Namami Gange scheme will be completed.The cleaning of the Ganga was one of the major poll promises of the BJP ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Gadkari said that efforts will be made to clean the river completely by December 2019.The Union Minister said that he had written to President Ram Nath Kovind requesting him to donate one-month salary to the Clean Ganga Fund (CGF)  set up by the Union government to aid efforts to rid the river of pollutants. He also plans to urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi, other ministers, MPs and MLAs, and the public to donate their one-month salary to the CGF.The Minister said that the CFG has received Rs 250 crore since it was approved by the Union Cabinet in September 2014. He added that all people should join the cause by donating whatever they can through digital transfer. Some people have donated even Rs 300 per month in the CGF. People can share Rs 500, Rs 1,000 or whatever amount, the minister said.Since 2015, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), which is implementing the project, has spent only 20 per cent of the Rs 20,000 crore sanctioned by the government. 20 per cent of the amount was spent till March (2018). This year, there will be lot of expenditure as per my assessment, we will be able to spend 60 to 70 per cent of the funds, Gadkari told reporters.Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 195 projects worth Rs. 20,959.54 crore have been sanctioned. This includes building sewage infrastructure, ghats, crematoriums and riverfront development, river surface cleaning, institutional development, rural sanitation, officials said. The Minister claimed that of the total 1,109 industry units grossly polluting the river, 358 units have been closed down. These include distilleries, sugar factories, paper mills and tanneries, he said.But it is not 100 per cent as yet I have only claimed that we will try to ensure improvement in the rivers water quality by 70 to 80 per cent till March 2019, Gadkari said.Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation Uma Bharti said that all the 1,662 gram panchayats and 4,465 villages in the five basin states  Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal  have become open defecation free (ODF). She said efforts will be made to turn the ODF villages into ODF Plus and polythene-free areas. We are making efforts to convert the Ganga villages into ODF Plus by managing solid and liquid waste there, by planting trees which will ensure cleanliness and increase the rivers catchment area, Bharti said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sridhar, endocrinologist and director of Endocrine and Diabetes Centre.Type-I diabetes is commonly seen in young adults and children and they need insulin injections for management.People are generally unaware of the latest ways of tracking and managing glucose levels, such as glucometer and insulin pumps.The common myth among the general public is that type-I diabetes can occur only in children.Despite being common in children, it can develop in young adults or even the elderly, says Dr. Sridhar.Contrary to the misconception, type-I diabetes is not caused by high sugar intake.It results from the immune system turning against the body by killing the insulin-creating cells that regulate the metabolism of glucose and other chemicals.Another common myth is that people with type-I diabetes shouldn't have children.It is also wrong to think that women with type-I diabetes would pass it on to their children, says Dr. Sridhar.There is also wrong to think that the mother plays a greater role in the child getting type-I diabetes.Expecting mothers suffering from the disease should, however, ensure that their glucose levels are kept in the normal range, adds Dr. Sridhar."

Maersk service from Visakhapatnam to Tanjung Pelepas (Malaysia), Quingdao, Xingang (China), Busan (South Korea), Shanghai and Nansha and on the return trip connecting Chennai and Krishnapatnam had emerged as the first choice for export and import cargo.Stating that the East Coast is their priority area, he said Dhamra and Paradip ports are getting ready to get into the container business. The huge hinterland offers a lot of opportunities for the growth in traffic, he pointed out. Kakinada is able to export a lot of rice, sugar and seafood. There is a huge potential for the import of cashew, water paper and other material via Visakhapatnam, Kakinada and Tuticorin. The mainliner from Visakhapatnam has several advantages for the east-bound cargo with a good connectivity to the Far East, Middle East and other destinations, Mr. Mota said.He said that they had already introduced export and import services at Kakinada, enabling the customers in the region to have a global reach. Our aim is to offer end-to-end service which will reduce wastage and complexities of dealing with multiple players. It helps move it to the port in a cost-effective and reliable manner. This will benefit the importers of cashew from Africa, wood pulp and waster paper from European regions, he said.Investment plansReferring to the Maersks investment plans, he said they would continue to serve customers in Indian inland markets by providing container freight stations, inland container depots, warehousing, transportation and customised container solutions in Nhava Sheva, Chennai, Dadri, Mundra, Pipavav, Pune and Tuticorin. We are constantly evaluating the opportunities to serve the Indian hinterland and to that end, we have recently piloted a door-to-door delivery service, linking the businesses in the hinterland with the key markets via an inter-modal inland network that connects seamlessly with our ocean vessels, he said.Container transportationOn the size of container transportation in India, he said as per CONCOR annual report, the container volume moved by rail was around 19% of the overall volumes handled in the country. There is a significant volume of cargo which moves by road between the hinterland and the ports both in containerised form as well as in bulk, which then gets containerised in or around the ports. Our market share from the hinterland is around 20% on aggregate, making us the largest integrated logistics service provider in the market, he pointed out."

(Express photo) Dead fish found in Beas River Thursday. (Express photo)A massive quantity of molasses from a private sugar mill in a Gurdaspur village has spilled into the Beas river, triggering anger and outrage among people in villages downstream, and raising concerns for the Harike lake and wetlands 110 km away, into which it flows.Officials said that from Wednesday morning to Thursday afternoon, 10,000 kilolitres of molasses spilled into the Beas at Kiri Afghana village from Chadha Sugar Industry Pvt Ltd. The spill was, however, reported on Thursday morning to the Amritsar district administration by some residents of Beas, the town named after the river. District forest officer Charanjit Singh said the impact of the spill was being assessed and filed a police complaint at Beas police station against unidentified persons for causing damage to wildlife. The SHO, Beas, however, said they were not taking any action on the complaint as the source of pollution is out of our jurisdiction.Meanwhile, people living along the Beas have been uploading videos and pictures of dead fish from the river, alleging that the molasses was killing all life in the water.Narinder Singh of Gram Vikas Society Beas said, We were shocked after seeing dead fish in the river on Thursday morning. Thy were floating on the surface. The water itself had turned dark and it was smelling like brewing liquor. I had never seen the river like this. We informed forest officials and the deputy commissioner also came. They came and went away. Nobody has done anything to remedy the situation.Harvinder Singh, member, panchayat of Chitta Sher village, said, My fields are adjacent to the river and I visit its banks every morning. On Thursday, I saw dark water in Beas. It really frightened me. I saw some dead fish flowing. My first thought was something really bad has happened with the river.Amritsar deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha has requested authorities to pump fresh water into the Beas from the Ranjit Sagar and Pong dams to dilute the molasses, but this is likely to reach the affected stretch of the river only by Friday afternoon. By then, the molasses spill would have reached Harike.XEN (Drainage dept) Amritsar Avtar Singh Kahlon said, The molasses will travel to Harike by Friday morning. Its impact has been felt most along an 80-km stretch from the point where the spill occurred.Amritsar DC said the Punjab Pollution Control Board had ordered the closure of the sugar mill. However, PPCB Gurdaspur XEN Kuldeep Singh, who is also probing the reason behind incident, said that he had no such information.According to initial information, in alleged violation of norms, the mill was storing the molasses in tanks not meant for the purpose. The tanks had been constructed for effluent produced during sugar making process.But the PPCB official suggested that Gurdaspur administration would have to share the blame. This particular sugar factory houses both sugar and distillery units. I have come to know that after a bumper sugar crop, farmers had staged a dharna in front of the mill as management had stopped taking more crop because the mill had reached its processing capacity, Kuldeep Singh said. He said the factory was using the molasses, a by-product of the sugar making process, in its distillery to make alcohol. It has two tanks of 1.35-lakh kilolitres to store effluent and these tanks were full when farmers staged dharna and district administration asked mill to take more sugarcane crop for processing.The mill processed more crop, producing more molasses. The extra molasses in the two tanks which were actually constructed to store treated effluent. These tanks were not to store the Molasses. When molassess is not stored properly, it starts boiling over. That is what happened here, and around 10,000 kilolitre Molasses over spilled over after boiling at 60 to 80 degree celsius, said Kuldeep Singh.A molasses tank has to be equipped with facilities for re-circulation and for pumping the molasses from one storage tank to another. It should have an air injection system and adequate ventilation on the roof top.The spill began at 8 am Wednesday, Kuldeep Singh said. It was not possible to control the flow due to high temperature. We could control it completely only by 2 pm on Thursday. The mill is located a kilometre from the river and the molasses made its way to Beas through a storm water channel passing near the mill.Till now we were busy in controlling the spilling and our next action in such cases should be ordering closure of the mill, said Kuldeep Singh.SDM Batala declined to comment on whether the administration had forced the private mill to process extra sugarcane in excess of its capacity. Kuldeep Singh has been appointed to probe the matter. I can comment on the issue only after I get a written report.Minister for Environment, School Education and Freedom Fighters O P Soni, inspected river along with other departments. Soni said teams from wild life department, pollution control, Guru Nanak Dev University and other wings were called and till now they have found no other toxins in water. Lack of oxygen has been determined as the cause of this damage, said Soni. He further said the factory operation has immediately been shut and the cause of accident is being determined. He said, No one is allowed to pollute our natural resources the errant will be penalised.

The NCP president and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Friday convened a meeting of sugar producers in Mumbai.A decision to constitute a committee of sugar experts to evolve a proposal seeking centres intervention along with workable measures to help both cane growing farmers, sugar mills and also protect the consumers interest were discussed at length.Amongst the three major recommendations made by Pawar were sugar export, use in ethanol and cogeneration. The surplus sugar production necessites exploring the market internationally. Giving a practical solution to the problem, Pawar said,  The government of India should initiate measures to facilitate export of sugar. The price difference between domestic market in India and International market which works to Rs 8 should be subsidies to the sugar producers. He advocated 30 -35 lakh tonne export of sugar to bring stability in the sugar prices and avoid its crashing down.The sugar production would be 308 lakh tonne. The sugar carried forward from previous year is 42 lakh tonne. The domestic sale would be 250 lakh tonne. The additional sugar would be 100 lakh tonne.The real concern is to find a solution to 100 lakh tonne. The NCP leader said the buffer stock of sugar was not the solution. As price mechanism works on the laws of demand and supply. When there is buffer stock, sugar cannot fetch good price as buyers psychology is not to shell higher rates.While sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 109, Maharashtra is 106.77 lakh tonne. This compared to previous year 40 lakh tonne is almost 2.54 times more. The requirement in state is 24 lakh tonne. As a result 94.77 lakh tonne sugar will have to be exported or routed for industrial use.Urging the sugar mills to equip themselves with cogeneration plant and ethanol plant to optimise the use of surplus sugar cane, Pawar said,  The farmers are going to cultivate sugar cane when ever there is good water. As sugar cane is the only cash crop which provides assured minimu support price unlike any other crops.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Around two lakh farmers are likely to take part in the andolan, which is to be held in all districts, sources said.The steering committee of farmer organisations, which has called the jail bharo, includes the Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raghunathdada Patil, All India Kisan Sabha, Baliraja Shetkari Sangh, Satyashodhak Shetkari Sabha, Akhil Bharatiya Shetkari Sanghamong others.After the announcement of farm loan waiver, around 2,000 farmers have committed suicide. The loan waiver hasnt helped in stopping farmer suicides. We dont accept the government loan waiver. It should be a complete loan waiver for all farmers, said Raghunathdada Patil, who is also part of the steering committee.Patil further said there has been no action against the milk dairies for not paying the rate of Rs 27 per litre to farmers. Besides, the government is also not following the norms of making payment in 24 hours after receiving goods from farmers. The sugar factories are paying as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP), he claimed.But, there has been no action against the market committees or the sugar factories. Most of the dairies, sugar factories and market committees are controlled by the Congress and NCP The BJP and Shiv Sena have also become part of the racket to loot the farmers, said Patil.The labour unions have also extended their support to the jail bharo andolan. The government is working for the corporates to provide raw material at low rates and cheap labourers for their factories. If the government can bail out the big corporates, then why cant it give complete loan waiver to farmers who are struggling for their livelihood? All the labour unions will take part in the jail bharo, said Vishwas Utagi, convenor of the Trade Union Joint Action Committee.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo Santosh Parab) NCP president Sharad Pawar at the meeting in Mumbai. (Express Photo Santosh Parab)Over 60 per cent of sugar mills in the state will find it difficult to raise working capital to commence operations in the next season. In a special meeting on the crisis, held in Mumbai on Friday and presided over by NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, millers from across the country spoke about the problems facing the industry. Mills have failed to pay the growers due to low prices of sugar, and the cane arrears in the country stand at Rs 19,000 crore. Mills in Maharashtra are facing arrears worth Rs 2,277 crore, with sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil issuing orders of confiscation of sugar against 10 mills.Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), said millers in Maharashtra are facing an unprecedented crisis over short margin  the difference between the advance released by the banks to the mills and the realisation of the latter. According to analysts, falling sugar prices and reduction in the valuation of sugar by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC) Bank has led to the financial crisis. The MSC Bank provides working capital to 40 sugar mills in the state and currently, almost all of them have gone into short margin. Mills are given a stipulated time period to clear the amount, failing which their accounts are declared as Non Performing Assets. Sugar production in the country has already crossed 300 lakh tonnes (lt) and estimates have put the production figures at 340 lt next year.During the course of the meeting, Pawar stressed on the need to export sugar to fulfil the 20 lt quota declared by the central government earlier. But exports at the current international prices of Rs 19-20 per kg would entail a loss of around Rs 8-10 per kg, as the cost of production is estimated to be Rs 30 per kg, said industry insiders.Another problem with exports is the shortage of international markets, with many traditional destinations such as the Philippines putting import restrictions in place. Meanwhile, a special study group has been formed to study the problems facing the industry. The group, which will have high-ranking officials from ISMA and the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories, will come up with a policy paper. Once we have finalised the document, Pawar saheb will be leading the delegation to meet the Prime Minister to apprise him about the situation, said Rohit Pawar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Hukum Singh had won the Kairana Lok Sabha poll in 2014 by getting 5.65 lakh votes The Kairana and Noorpur seats fell vacant following deaths of BJP lawmakers Hukum Singh and Lokendra Singh. Hukum Singh had won the Kairana Lok Sabha poll in 2014 by getting 5.65 lakh votesRashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice president Jayant Chaudhary and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav are likely to meet in Lucknow on Friday to strategise for a united front against the BJP in the Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur assembly bypolls. The nomination process for the May 28 polls began on Thursday.Sources said the meeting was likely even as the Congresss local leadership in Kairana had suggested in Delhi on Wednesday that they would prefer supporting Chaudhary rather than going with the SP.Sources said the Congress would be left with no option but to become a part of the bigger alliance or field a weak candidate if SP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and RLD ally against the BJP.RLD sources said they need at least one or two days to make a final decision while hinting they were ready to make sacrifices to ensure opposition unity. While our preparations are there but we also want to ensure that strength and unity of opposition against BJP remain intact, said RLD spokesman Anil Dubey.Sources said RLD is interested more in Noorpur and Chaudhary is unlikely to contest even as a final decision is likely to be taken after the first round of talks between SP and RLD.The local leadership of Congress including me is in favour of contesting alone or are open to the idea of rather supporting the candidature of Jayant Chaudhary if he plans to contest. Congress has been strong in at least in three out of five assembly segments of Kairana including Shamli, Gangoh, and Nakur, said Congress state vice-president Imran Masood. He said he and other local leaders have conveyed the message to the party high-command.BJPs state general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said the unity does not bother them. Let the opposition do whatever they are doing.The Kairana and Noorpur seats fell vacant following deaths of BJP lawmakers Hukum Singh and Lokendra Singh. Hukum Singh had won the Kairana Lok Sabha poll in 2014 by getting 5.65 lakh votes. His closest rival  SPs Nahid Hassan managed 3.30 lakh votes. In 2017, Lokendra Singh won Noorpur assembly constituency. He got 79,000 votes while SP candidate Naim-ul-Hassan managed 66,436 votes.The SP has claimed both seats arguing its candidates had stood close second in previous elections. Congress, SP, RLD, and BSP had won the Kairana seat before Hukum Singh was elected in 2014.The public in Kairana wants Jayant Chaudhary to contest and if SP supports him, then we will certainly defeat the BJP, said RLDs state president Masood Ahmed. He said the party leadership would take a final decision on a joint candidate.The SP is hopeful of getting the support of BSPs Jatav vote bank in Kairana, as the two regional arch-rivals have announced to continue their alliance, which helped them defeat BJP in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-polls, until the 2019 elections.Kairana Lok Sabha seat has around 17 lakh voters. They include around 3 lakh Muslims, 4 lakh backward castes (Jat, Gujjar, Saini, Kashyap, Prajapati, and others) and about 1.5 lakh Jatav Dalits.BJP insiders said a joint opposition candidate is a matter of concern for the party, which was hoping to benefit for the polarisation of the backward and upper castes votes in its favour after the state government decided to withdraw the 2013 riot cases.The opposition parties are likely to corner the government over the Rs 700-crore dues to the six sugar mills in Kairana Lok Sabha constituency.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Though this decision was taken in 2014 by the than SAD-BJP government, AAP leaders maintain that Capt Amarinder Singh had announced during poll campaign they will not let it happen. Sekhon, who is Malwa Zone-2 president of AAP, started his hunger strike from Monday onwards and stated that it will continue till the government does not give in writing that it will restart the mill.The decision to close the mill was taken by the previous Congress government ruled by Capt Amarinder Singh owing to heavy losses. Mill never operated after and in 2014, SAD-BJP decided to shift the machinery out of this mill to Bhogpur. However, the decision came into implementation now. Sekhon said, After opposing SAD-BJP governments decision, now Congress government itself is implementing it. We will not let it happen. Already 2000 employees have been rendered jobless. We want the mill to start again.The work of shifting of machinery started around two days back, but was was stalled Monday owing to protest.SSP Dr Nanak Singh also visited the dharna site on Monday.

(File Photo) The present production figure of 106.08 lakh tonnes has surpassed the previous record production in 2014-15, when the state had produced 105.14 lt of sugar. (File Photo)Maharashtra recorded the highest ever production of sugar at 106.08 lakh tonnes (lt) in the state this season. The record production this season, till April 22, however, has failed to cheer the industry, which is reeling under the curse of very low realisation. With sugar commissioner stepping up action against millers that have failed to pay farmers, distress sale by mills is likely to further reduce the prices.Of the 187 mills that had taken season this year, 169 have ended their operations as of April 22. The state has recorded 945.48 lt crushing of cane and the sugar production stands at 106.08 lt, as per the government figure. The present production figure has surpassed the previous record production in 2014-15, when the state had produced 105.14 lt of sugar. By the end of this season, which will be towards the end of May, the production figure in the state is likely to touch 107 lt.The record production has failed to lift the mood of the industry, which is facing the brunt of low prices of sugar. To add to their worries, the sugar commissioner, Sambhaji Kadu Patil, has started taking action, which includes issuance of orders under the Revenue Recovery Code to confiscate sugar stock of mills that have failed to clear their payment to farmers. Till Monday, seven such orders have been issued against mills that have failed to pay the farmers. Sources in the commissionerate say more such orders are in the pipeline. Cane dues in the state as of April 15 stood at Rs 2,277.35 crore with millers paying only Rs 18,120.88 crore as against the total due of Rs 20,088.29 crore.Meanwhile, mills in the state have started distress sale of their stock, which has added to the slide in the prices. Mukesh Kuvadia, general secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants said at present the ex-mill price of sugar in the state is around Rs 25.50-26 per kg. It might be recollected that the season had started with sugar prices ranging at Rs 38 per kg. The bumper production has slowed down purchase by commercial buyers. Even as summer kicks in, we are yet to see any significant increase in demand, he said. The trend of distress sales has picked up after the sugar commissioner strarted taking action, which has further subdued the prices. Many of the mills are short of space to stock sugar and so they are selling it at much lower prices, he said.Things are unlikely to get better next season as the state is expecting a bumper production of 115 lt.With just five-six months left before the next season, to start logistics is yet another reason for millers to press the panic button. Kuvadia said the 20-lt export quota issued by the central government seems unattainable. Even with subsidy the maximum export could be around 8-10 lt while without subsidy, its not at all feasible for millers to export sugar, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Veera Raghava Rao said that he would take it up with the bankers at the review meeting.Despite his assurance, the farmers, mostly sugarcane growers from the Alanganallur block and Usilampatti block, claimed that some banks even belittled them saying they could not even repay one EMI.Pacifying them to take their seats, the Collector directed the District Lead Manager to convene a meeting soon and ensure that the grievance was redressed.Only a few farmers said that they had received loans from Cooperative Bank/Societies.The sugarcane growers association representatives said that the sugar mills in the district were yet to clear arrears of Rs. 7 crore due to farmers.At a time, when many casual workers were unemployed due to very many reasons, such non-release of arrears to the sugarcane growers for over four years had forced many into mental agony and urged the district administration to intervene.Pleading repeatedly to evict encroachments from canals and public tanks, the farmers blamed the PWD engineers for lackadaisical attitude.An organic farmer Sadayandi from Perayur block said that a majority of the farmers growing minor millets among others depended on oorani water for irrigation.The need of the hour was to recharge all the 45 ooranis at the earliest and clean up encroachments, which alone would enable farmers to cultivate in future. Likewise, farmers from the Tirupparankundram block too appealed to remove encroachments.At this juncture, the farmers from Madurai north block alleged that a 15-cent land near Mattuthavani worth Rs. 20 crore, which belonged to the PWD, has been encroached upon by a private hotelier.Despite repeated pleas, action to evict the encroacher had not been done, they said.Immediately, the Collector ordered the officials from Survey Department and the PWD officials to check and file a report within three weeks.When a section of farmers submitted petitions that they were unable to get electricity connections from TANGEDCO, the Collector directed the officials to look into the issue.The Collector gave away subsidy cheques to farmers to purchase tractors.DRO R.

According to the State Cane Development department data, the mills are yet to pay Rs. 8,108.94 crore to the farmers after buying their cane till April 4. This has led to a series of protests by farmers.On Tuesday, a large number of farmers took to the streets in Shamli demanding their dues. Shamli is the constituency of States Cane Development Minister Suresh Rana.The protesters, led by former member of Uttar Pradesh State Planning Commission Sudhir Panwar, demanded timely payment of the arrears and rollback of the increase in the electricity rates.The Yogi Adityanath government took votes of farmers on the promise that it will ensure payment of cane dues within two weeks. However, the tragedy is that the farmers are still waiting, Dr. Panwar, a farm expert, said.Biggest defaultersThe sugar mills in and around the constituency of Mr. Rana are the biggest defaulters.While the mills in Shamli owe Rs. 432.84 crore, those in Saharanpur Rs. 415.36 crore and in Muzaffarnagar Rs. 373.58 crore, as per the data.Deepak Guptara, secretary of the U.P. Sugar Mills Association, said the decreasing rates of sugar had affected the paying capacity of the mills. The total investment in the production of one quintal of sugar is at least Rs. 3,450. The rate of sugar has gone down to Rs. 2,920, which means we are bearing a loss of at least Rs. 530/quintal, he said.Chaudhary Vinay Kumar, vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, told The Hindu that the State government has miserably failed to keep its promise because of which the financial situation of the farmers has become really bad.

He said the cyclical and synchronised recovery in the world economy had been marred and disrupted by some unseemly protectionist noises that are coming out of the Atlantic basin in North America and Europe.Referring to major geoeconomic shifts which China and India could sharpen, Mr. Kumar said Asia and the emerging economies could become the new drivers of global growth.He highlighted that the emerging economies of Asia seem to have ignored the protectionist noises and we have continued to grow at very high rates of speed with China growing at 6.8% and India growing at 7-7.2%. India was expected to gallop with growth between 8.5% and 9% in the next five years, riding on major structural measures that had already been enforced.Mr. Kumar acknowledged that India-China economic partnership was still a work in progress, but made it plain that New Delhi was committed to work with China as an important anchor and driver of global growth.I say this to emphasise that this is really the wonderful context with which India and China, the two great civilisations should intensify and improve their bilateral economic and commercial cooperation, he said.Mr. Kumar proposed joint research and development in renewable energy and electrical vehicles.D"

Compared with last year, the domestic ex-mill sugar prices are lower by 20% . The Centre helped the mills in 2015-2016 sugar season by paying Rs. 4.5 for a quintal of cane directly to farmers as part of the FRP.This reduced the liability of the mills towards farmers. The Centre should announce a similar scheme with a production subsidy of Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a quintal in the current season which would cover a substantial part of the increase in FRP. The amount can be paid directly into the farmers bank accounts, ISMA said.Association sources said, the Centre announced MIEQ (minimum indicative export quota) of 20 lakh tonnes so that some surplus stock can be moved out. Exports are, however, not viable as globally there is excess production and the market is depressed. Prices are also low in domestic and international markets, the sources said.In the domestic market, the ex-mill price in Uttar Pradesh is Rs. 28.50 a kg of sugar whereas the cost of production is Rs. 35 a kg. The ex-mill price in Maharashtra is Rs. 27 a kg against production cost of Rs. 32 a kg. By the end of March, the all India sugar production for the current season (October 2017 to September 2018) stood at 281.82 lakh tonnes. This is 92.95 lakh tonnes higher than the preceeding season."
