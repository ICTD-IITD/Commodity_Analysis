While employees in the section managed to flee, other employees were alerted when the alarm sounded.Assistant General Manager Alagendran informed the fire station at Papanasam and the personnel rushed to the spot.After a four-hour-long battle, the firefighters led by Station Fire Officer Kalaivanan brought the fumes under control. The factory personnel then plugged the leak in the chemical tank."

I am being shifted to a place where there are no facilities. It is a tough time, but I will face it. My health has not really improved, said the leader, citing heart, kidney and blood sugar problems. My back hurts and I feel dizzy... I have fallen in the bathroom several times. My blood pressure and sugar keeps shooting up, he said.The RJD called the move a conspiracy to murder him.The former Bihar Chief Minister, who was jailed last year after being convicted in fodder scam cases, was shifted to AIIMS here from the prison in Ranchi, Jharkhand for specialised treatment. He was forced to take a 16-hour train journey from Ranchi to Delhi.On Monday morning, Congress president Rahul Gandhi visited AIIMS to see the leader.AIIMS, in a statement, had said, Lalu Prasad has improved significantly and as per advice of the medical board constituted for his treatment, he is being referred back to Ranchi Medical College for management of his chronic issues.

In a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Associations secretary general Deepak Guptara alleged that some BJP MLAs and workers had indulged in unreasonable behaviour, unlawful demands and physical harm and threats against its workers.In the letter, a copy of which is with The Hindu , Mr. Guptara said: We regret to bring to your kind notice that there are repeated incidents of threats, manhandling and other cases of harassment against our members sugar factories. What is of grave concern is that almost all these cases involve elected representatives of the ruling party. This offensive behaviour against bona fide employees of sugar factories have left them demoralised and insecure and in many cases the employees are threatening to quit and leave.Mr. Guptara alleged that ruling party MLAs have been found involved in cases of threats and harassment in factories at Seohara (Bijnore), Babhnan (Gonda), Dhampur (Bijnore), Bundki (Bijnore) and Nigohi (Shahjehanpur).He highlighted that the sugar mills were the biggest organised industrial activity in the State, which faces deep crisis due to lowering of prices. But still the sugar mills were honouring their word on timely payment of the fixed support price for cane so that the farmers do not face any hardship.Deep unrestThe incidents of threats and harassment have the potential to cause deep unrest, he added.Mr. Guptara requested the Chief Minister to send a stern message to anti-social elements not to disturb industrial harmony in the State by exerting undue pressure on the sugarmill workers for meeting their unlawful demands."
5b15066e9855b72ada080b36,The cost of pollution,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-cost-of-pollution/article23734148.ece,2018-05-01,"Pollution is a challenge to developing countries which try to achieve rapid economic development without adequately managing the environment. In recent years, the pollution load has increased, sometimes beyond the carrying capacity of the environment. Though various measures have been adopted to manage pollution, significant progress has not been achieved.The environmental Kuznets curveIndias developmental activities are affecting the environment to a considerable extent, through over-exploitation of natural resources and indiscriminate discharge of waste. This has been interpreted by the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis which suggests that as per capita income grows, the increase in environmental impact hits the maximum and thereafter declines. According to the hypothesis, in the initial stages of economic growth, when more resources are used, there is greater waste generation and more emissions. But when a country has achieved a certain level of development, pollution reduces with greater protection of the environment, technological improvements, diversification of the economy from manufacturing to services, and increasing scarcity and prices of environmental resources, leading to lower consumption.India is on the upward part of the EKC. For achieving sustainable development, it must move to the second stage. However, it is not wise to wait for that stage. India cant ignore the environmental consequences of its rapid growth. Over the last few decades, water-intensive and polluting industries such as textiles, leather, sugar and paper have shifted from developed to developing countries. They withdraw huge quantities of water and discharge effluents without adequate treatment. Before 1980, countries like the U.K. and the U.S. played a vital role in textile production and export. But by 2000, their dominance had substantially reduced and the share of developing countries like India and China had increased. One of the factors attributed to this shift is that there are relatively less stringent environmental policies in developing nations. Countries like India are now manufacturing products which contribute to pollution for domestic and international markets.At the household level, the economic loss on account of pollution includes the cost of treatment and wage loss during sickness. Pollution impacts ecosystems and related economic activities like agriculture and livestock. Air pollution causes climate change. Hence, pollution leads to the real and potential loss of the overall development opportunity in an economy. Generally, pollution impacts the socially vulnerable and poor communities more due to their weak coping options. When traditional drinking water sources get contaminated, the rich can buy packaged water. But the poor cannot afford it and are hence compelled to use contaminated water. They are also less aware of the health hazards caused by pollution.Pollution is not a disease, it is only a symptom. Hence, its root cause should be investigated. For instance, in developing countries, water pollution has not been a major topic of political debate, but political instruments including Environmental Quality Objectives and Uniform Standards are in the political agendas of Western countries. Natural resources management agencies have centralised structures and function without the consultation of multi stakeholders. Emission-based standards have not been very effective so far, since they are rarely monitored and only occasionally enforced. The polluters pay principle is not in force. For the most part, polluters are not willing to internalise the external and social costs. Pollution is also neglected by funding agencies worldwide and by governments in budgets. However, experiences from the U.S. and Europe reveal that pollution mitigation can yield large gains to human health and the economy.Remedial measuresEconomic growth is an inevitable requirement, but it need not be at the cost of health. To tackle pollution, there should be public awareness about its consequences, adequate pollution-linked databases, integration of pollution prevention policies into the development sector, strict enforcement of pollution control policies, eco-friendly inputs in production, reliance on renewable energy, introduction of market-based/economic instruments (charges/taxes/levies, tradable permits, subsidies and soft loans), and increase in ecosystem resilience through the conservation of biodiversity.Prakash Nelliyat works with the Centre for Biodiversity Policy and Law, National Biodiversity Authority, Chennai.

The assistance will be paid directly to the farmers on behalf of the mills. It will be adjusted against the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 255 per quintal set by government as the rate that mills must pay to cane farmers, as well as the arrears of payments pending from previous years.Any subsequent balance will be credited into the mills account, the statement said, adding that assistance will be provided to those mills which fulfil the governments eligibility conditions.The subsidy will work out to Rs. 1,550 to Rs. 1,600 crore for the current season, said Abinash Verma, director general of industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA). He welcomed the decision, but added that this can be taken as a first step towards various other initiatives and financial assistance that the Government has to take very soon to help the mills and the farmers.Sugar production has hit record highs this year, crossing domestic consumption prices, and leading to a crash in prices. Industry lobbyist Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) estimates that wholesale sugar prices have fallen by Rs. 9 per kg over the past five months, and the mills are now incurring a loss of Rs. 8 per kg of sugar."

Sugarmills are yet to pay over Rs. 11000 crore in dues to the farmers in the State.The State sugarmill association, however, blames the decreasing rate of sugar for its inability to sufficiently and promptly clear the dues.According to officials of the State Cane Department, cane dues are Rs. 10657 crore, which has led to many farmers groups in the State to warn of agitation and State-wide protest.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the biggest and most influential farmers body, and the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch (BKMM) have threatened protests in every district against the failure of the State government to get the sugarmills to clear their dues.The BJP government had won the votes of the farmers promising them to deliver cane dues in 14 days from the beginning of the crushing. The arrears will soon cross Rs. 12,000 crore but the government is yet to come up with any solution. Only yesterday a farmer in Saharanpur attempted suicide by taking poison after the local bank issued him recovery notice. Such incidents will become more frequent if the Adityanath government continues to sleep, said Prof. Sudhir Panwar, former Member of the State Planning Commission.Mr. Panwar said the situation of farmers in western U.P. districts like Baghpat, Shamli, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur was worseCane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said the government was doing everything possible to ensure timely payment of dues. We are acting against sugar mills which are not paying the farmers. District administrations are issuing notices and taking actions against the defaulter sugar mills, he said.Highly placed sources in the State Cane Department told The Hindu that the Modi government was contemplating a whole range of solutions to deal with the crisis, including proposing a production-linked subsidy scheme for sugarcane farmers, imposition of sugar cess and reducing GST on ethanol."

The Barsys is more of a party trick that works really well if the demand for cocktails is not high. Furthermore, it does need some patient setting up.If you look at the photo of the product, then you will understand that the 5 nozzles on top are where you fit your liquor bottles through a special adaptor. The downside is that once you fit the bottles, getting them off unless theyre empty becaomes a tedious and messy affair.At the rear of the machine are caps with tubes that screw into soda PET bottles, and here you can have your aerated mixers. At the side of the machine are three mini missile silos into which special bottles fit. Into these bottles you can fill up your fruit juices, or sugar syrup or any other non-carbonated mixer. Setting the machine up is only half the job done.You have to then download the Barsys app, currently available only for Android; the iOS app is under development. The app is linked to the machine via Bluetooth, a smart move, since it eliminates the need for a Wi-Fi network. Then you need to input into the app what liquor or mixer is fitted where in the machine. Now, youre ready to go.The app has a huge library of cocktails that it will suggest, depending on your alcohol and mixers. It will also let you tweak cocktails to your taste by way of increasing or decreasing the measures. Plus, it will let you create cocktails of your own. Then all you need to do is put the glass on the moving coaster and tap your phone and watch, as your cocktail is prepared.It is quite amazing to see the glass slide left and right as various measures are poured out and mixed. There is also a cocktail mixer supplied, that has a little rotating mix mechanism inside it, that starts spinning once the cocktail mixer is placed on the moving coaster. The Barsys is great for a sophisticated gathering where the demand for cocktails is few and far between.Also, it is not cheap, retailing at Rs. 99,999 plus taxes.

Finding a pose of policemen, two- wheeler riders without helmets became scared but turned relaxed when policemen signalled them to stop with smiling faces. They were surprised when the SP presented them new helmets. The SP honoured those who wore helmets and seat belts with small gifts.The SP distributed pamphlets to road users advising them to obey traffic rules and avert accidents. The free helmets to limited people, who could not afford to buy helmets, was part of the road safety awareness programmes, he said. Similar campaigns were held in all the seven police sub-divisions in the district.The police installed a flex board near the bus stand exhorting two-wheeler riders to wear helmets and avoid using mobile phone while riding.

But, relatively, the number of women candidates fielded by all main political parties is abysmally low, although the total number has gone up from 170 in 2013 to 219 this year.At 15, Congress has fielded the highest number of women candidates this time. But, even that is a mere 6.8%. While the BJP has officially given seats to five women (2.3%), the JD(S) has named six women in their list (2.75%). As many as 53 candidates are contesting as Independents.Ironically, the Mahila Empowerment Party (MEP), which is led by a woman, has also fielded only 12 women candidates.This is hardly a surprise if you look at Karnatakas track record. In 2013, the total number of women candidates in the fray was 170, nearly 6% of the total number of candidates. While the Congress and BJP gave a mere 10 and seven tickets, respectively, to women, the JD(S) gave only six. Sixty seven women contested as Independent candidates.And of the 170 women who contested, only six won of which none was an Independent. Three of the six women MLAs were from Congress, two from BJP, and one from JD(S).Of the three women MLAs in the Congress, only one  Umashree  became a Minister in the Siddaramaiah Cabinet, with the portfolio of Minister for Women and Child Development. In the Gundlupet byelection in 2017, M.C. Mohan Kumari alias Geetha Mahadeva Prasad won from the Congress, and was then elevated as Minister of State with independent charge for Sugar and Small Industries.Former Minister and Congress member Rani Satish said women were lagging because party leaders only considered the winnability criterion.Parties are only bothered about number games and they feel if they stick to principles, it will affect the partys prospects. While we understand this, senior women politicians should be considered at least during nominations to Raj Sabha or Legislative Council, she said.Saraswati Chimmalgi of Mahileyara Rajakiya Hakkina Horta Samiti (committee to demand political rights to women) said all parties are only interested in getting votes from women, but not in giving them political representation and empowerment.We are now planning to sensitise all women to boycott polls because unless we do this, the parties will not realise our value, she said.

He was known for his simplicity and mild manners. Coming from the RSS stable, he was one of the old-timers who was committed to the party ideology and rarely sought publicity. As he had pledged to be an organ donor, his family has donated his eyes.His humility, dedication and commitment to the party and people will be remembered. A great loss for us. Our condolences to his family, said the BJP in an official tweet.BJP State president B. S. Yeddyurappa expressed shock over the death, describing him as a very decent politician who was known for humility and simplicity. Leaders cutting across party affiliations paid their condolences. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, in a message, described him as a sincere and hard working political leader.Collapsed during campaignKumar, who was seeking re-election, collapsed during his election campaign on Thursday evening. He had been rushed to the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research Centre. He breathed his last at 1 a.m. the following day.Institute Director C.N. Manjunath said he was brought in an unresponsive state to the hospital. Doctors preformed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for at least one-and-a-half hours to revive him.Even as the CPR was being done, he suffered multiple arrests, nearly 20. We did an angiogram and a stenting procedure, but he could not be revived. We were surprised to find clot formation in the artery, which was near normal a month ago when he underwent an angioplasty in our hospital. The artery where angioplasty had been done was normal. This could be due to acute stress that he may have been undergoing, the doctor said.Advising poll candidates to regularly monitor their blood pressure and sugar levels, he said any discomfort or excessive sweating should not be ignored.His humility, dedication and commitment to the party and people will be remembered. A great loss for us. Our condolences to his familyBharatiya Janata Party"

Comparing international and domestic market prices, there will be a loss of Rs. 8 per kg during exports, he said.He asked industry representatives to form a committee to deliberate on the issues facing the sector and to make a detailed presentation to the Union government."

Mani, Senior Director at Deloitte India said in a note.Businesses are relieved that they would no longer be penalised for their vendors omissions. Simplicity of the new return forms would be key to its successful adoption by businesses as past experience with complicated forms and processes indicates that complexity reduces compliance.While some of these ideas are welcome, the impossibility of the buyer to upload missing invoices or to take provisional credit [once the final phase rolls out] may lead to losses for businesses where the suppliers are not traceable and tax has been paid to them, Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner, EY India said. It may also impact cash flows on account of delayed credit in case of delay in upload of invoices by the sellers.The other issue under consideration was the imposition of a cess on sugar, particularly considering that its cost has risen beyond Rs. 35 per kg, and the market price is between Rs. 26 and Rs. 28, and the sugarcane farmers are in great distress, Mr. Jaitley said.How are such contingencies to be addressed in a GST regime? Are they to be addressed by an imposition of a cess, or through temporarily increasing a tax, or by some alternative mode of revenue raising.The Council agreed to create a Group of Ministers comprising five ministers, which will submit its recommendations regarding this issue to the Council within two weeks.While the decision on a sugar cess has been deferred for now, it would be ideal if it is not introduced given it was abolished when GST came in and GST was expected to subsume all such levies, Pratik Jain, Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax at PwC India said. If there is need for revenue augmentation, it can be done by increasing the GST rate rather than distorting the overall structure.Digital transactionsThe GST Council also agreed to the creation of a separate Group of Ministers to look into the issue of implementing a 2% incentive for digital transactions. This GoM will submit its recommendations by the next meeting of the Council.Mr. Jaitley also said that the Council had decided that the government would buy the remaining 51% stake in the GST Network, which is currently under private sector ownership.It was agreed that the 51% held by these private entities should be taken over by the government and eventually the Centre and the States will hold 50% each, Mr. Jaitley said. The 50% of the States will be divided among themselves according to their GST ratios. The Council also recommended that the GSTN continue to employ people contractually and have the flexibility to get the best talent on the best terms from the market."

Also, 85% of them have been found to be using toothpastes which do not contain fluoride.What is even worse is the fact that 82% children go for a dental check-up only when there is a problem.The findings of the survey has been released by the Department of Periodontics and Preventive Dentistry, Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences here on Friday.The findings were released at the first biennial conference of the South Asian Association of Pediatric Dentistry (SAAPD), which started in the Capital.About the surveyFor the first time a survey of such magnitude on evaluating the level of awareness on early-childhood dental problems has been done by us. The findings of this survey will give us a direction to map the existing level of awareness on dental health among parents and children and help us in intervention, said Dr. Gyanendra Kumar, organising secretary, SAAPD and associate professor, Department of Periodontics & Preventive Dentistry, Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences.Parents of children below 14 years, who visited the department during the last two months were interviewed. As many as 1,000 parents were interviewed through a questionnaire.Right toothpasteTalking about what toothpaste a child should use, Dr. Kumar said that toothpaste for children should contain fluoride as it prevents development of dental caries, which is very commonly seen in children now days.The toothpaste for children should contain lubricants and fluoride, which help in preventing oral problems, he said.Doctors adviceThe survey found that although dental diseases can be easily prevented, most parents do not visit a dentist every six months, as is recommended by all dentists.This leads to oral disease in children. We advise parents to take their children to the dentist every six months to prevent dental problems, added Dr. Kumar.The survey also noted that 40% children were suffering from malocclusion (misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of the two dental arches when they approach each other as the jaws close) due to their habit of sucking the thumb.CausesDentists also noted that some of the most common causes of childhood cavities are diet and oral home care. Fast foods that are high in carbohydrates and sugar develop cavities. However, with proper dental hygiene, tooth decay is nearly 100% preventable, they added."

But Andrew has Type 1 diabetes, and six years ago, in order to control his blood sugar levels, his parents put him on a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet.His mother makes him recipes with diabetic-friendly ingredients that wont spike his blood sugar, like pizza with a low-carb, almond-flour crust; homemade bread with walnut flour instead of white flour; and yoghurt topped with blueberries, raspberries and nuts.Andrews diet requires careful planning  he often takes his own meals with him to school. But he and his parents say it makes it easier to manage his condition and, since starting the diet, his blood sugar control has markedly improved and he has not had any diabetes complications requiring trips to the hospital.I do this so that I can be healthy, Andrew, who lives with his parents in Jacksonville, Fla., U.S., said of his diet. When I eventually move out and go to college, Im going to keep up what Im doing because Im on the right path.Usual advice and whyMost diabetes experts do not recommend low-carb diets for people with Type 1 diabetes, especially children. Some worry that restricting carbs can lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels, a condition known as hypoglycaemia, and potentially stunt a childs growth. But a new study published in the journal Pediatrics suggests otherwise.FindingsIt found that children and adults with Type 1 diabetes who followed a very low-carb, high-protein diet for an average of just over two years  combined with the diabetes drug insulin at smaller doses than typically required on a normal diet  had exceptional blood sugar control. They had low rates of major complications, and children who followed it for years did not show any signs of impaired growth.The study found that the participants average haemoglobin A1C, a long-term barometer of blood sugar levels, fell to just 5.67%. An A1C under 5.7 is considered normal, and it is well below the threshold for diabetes, which is 6.5%.The new study comes with an important caveat. It was an observational study, not a randomised trial with a control group. The researchers recruited 316 people, 130 of them children whose parents gave consent, from a Facebook group dedicated to low-carb diets for diabetes, called TypeOneGrit, then reviewed their medical records and contacted their medical providers.While it was not a clinical trial, the study is striking because it highlights a community of patients who have been extraordinarily successful at controlling their diabetes with a very low-carb diet, says Dr. David M. Harlan, the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, U.S., who was not involved in the study. Perhaps the surprise is that for this large number of patients it is much safer than many experts would have suggested.Im excited to see this paper, Dr. Harlan adds. It should reopen the discussion about whether this is something we should be offering our patients as a therapeutic approach.The authors of the paper caution that the findings should not lead patients to alter their diabetes management without consulting their doctors, and that large clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether this approach should be used more widely.We think the findings point the way to a potentially exciting new treatment option, says Dr. David Ludwig, a co-author of the study and a paediatric endocrinologist at Boston Childrens Hospital who has written popular books about low-carb diets. However, because our study was observational, the results should not, by themselves, justify a change in diabetes management.Standard approachAbout 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Managing the condition requires administering insulin throughout the day, especially when consuming meals high in carbs, which raise blood sugar more than other nutrients. Over time, chronically elevated blood sugar can lead to nerve and kidney damage and cardiovascular disease.The standard approach for people with Type 1 diabetes is to match carb intake with insulin. But the argument for restricting carbs is that it keeps blood sugar more stable and requires less insulin, resulting in fewer highs and lows. The approach has not been widely studied or embraced for Type 1 diabetes, but some patients swear by it.NY TIMES"

5b153ed79855b75db2e71acb,A river in distress,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-river-in-distress/article23859176.ece,2018-05-12,"Divided waters:The inter-State water dispute is over an overexploited river basin where demand has far outstripped the supply of water. Members of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association stage a demonstration in Mukkombu near Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu, against the Centres failure to constitute a Cauvery scheme. (Below) Devotees pray at Talacauvery, the birth place of the river in Kodagu, Karnataka.M. Srinath/ K. Murali KumarThe Sangam-era Tamil poetic work Pattinappaalai describes the Cauvery as an eternal river.  Vaan poithinam thaan poiyya malai kalaya kadarkaaveri ponal parandhu pon kolikkum  goes a line. Loosely translated, it means that even in the hot summer months, when the rain gods do not shower their mercy, the Cauvery, emerging from the hills of Coorg (Kodagu), continues to flow, helping to harvest gold from the land.But today, anyone touring the land from Tiruchi to Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu, where an ancient Tamil civilisation flourished, will find that the river is now a sea of sand, with rocks and bushes dotting the dry river bed. It is only during the monsoon season that any water can be seen flowing. Ask any farmer in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and he will tell you that the river has water only three to four months in a year.For the thousands of tourists and pilgrims climbing the 300 steps to the hilltop at Talacauvery, the Cauverys source in Kodagu, Karnataka, no mystical spout awaits. It is here that the river is believed to emerge as a perennial fount, and is worshipped as Kaveriamma by the Kodavas. But on top of the Brahmagiri Hills in Kodagu, only mud and stones greet the eye. In the temple at the bottom of the hill, the priest says that it is only during October, after the monsoon is over, that you get to see a water spout under the rocks.Problems at the sourceMadikeri, the hill capital of Kodagu district, is surprisingly warm on an April morning. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Kodagu circle, S.S. Lingaraja, blames the rise in temperature on the rapid loss of tree cover due to reckless urbanisation in the town. Last year, the State forest survey showed an overall increase in forest cover in Karnataka. Only in Shimoga and Kodagu districts had the forest cover shrunk, he says.Lingaraja cites a 2009 report authored by B.R. Ramesh, M. Seetharaman and others, for the Institut Francais de Pondichery, which compared satellite images of forest cover in Kodagu since 1977 to show how the dense foliage outside protected areas has declined rapidly. The authors blame the doubling of land under coffee plantations, and developmental projects such as the construction of dams and roads, for the loss of 28% of the forest cover during the 30-year study period starting in 1977.Between 2013 and 2015, for instance, over 50,000 trees were cut in Kodagu to make way for high-tension power lines to Kerala. Says Colonel Muthanna, President of the Coorg Wildlife Society (CWS), Now there is a proposal for a railway line between Mysuru and Kushalanagar, and another proposal for four national highways passing through the district. If these get approved, there will be disastrous consequences for forests. In Madikeri, trees have been cut to make way for government buildings and hospitals. A Right to Information application by the CWS found that between 2005 and 2015, 2,800 acres of private land were diverted for commercial purposes such as construction of new resorts, hotels and offices. Earlier, paddy cultivation was big in Kodagu, but now these are being reclaimed for real estate development. Paddy fields act as water sponges and help recharge underground aquifers, says Roy Bopanna, Executive Director of the CWS. The activists are now demanding that the entire Kodagu region be declared a protected area and land conversion be restricted.The loss of forest cover and change in land use has meant a decline in rainfall levels, adversely affecting the inflow of water into the Cauvery and its tributaries upstream. An annual rainfall chart prepared by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre shows that Kodagu district, in 1960, recorded over 4,500 mm of rainfall but between 2010 and 2015, the annual rainfall did not cross 3,200 mm. In the event of a poor monsoon, coffee plantation owners meet their irrigation needs by drawing water from the river, starting in December. Coffee plantations require sprinkler water irrigation to the tune of 250 cubic metres per hectare, as per the cultivation guide issued by the Central Coffee Research Institute. Kodagu has over one lakh hectares under coffee plantation. Do the math and you will see how much river water is being drawn for irrigating coffee plantations alone, says Gopakumar Menon, founder-trustee of the Nityata Foundation, an NGO that works on riverine ecosystems.It is therefore hardly surprising that the flow of water in the Cauvery has declined upstream. S.C. Rangasamy, executive engineer of the Harangi Dam, says that post-December every year, there is a 40% drop in the flow of water coming from Talacauvery. He says that excessive withdrawal of groundwater using bore wells has caused a significant decline in the base flow of the river. Kushalnagar is staring at an imminent drinking water crisis this summer, he says. In March 2018, the local administration passed a government order restricting the withdrawal of groundwater except for drinking purposes. The order copy clearly states that according to an inspection carried out in the upstream areas, the flow of water in the Cauvery has virtually stopped there.Inter-State disputeIt is election season in Karnataka; yet the declining water level in the Cauvery has not come up as a major issue. Rather, the focus has been the Supreme Courts decision concerning the distribution of the available Cauvery water between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The inter-State water dispute is over a century old. The fight is over an overexploited river basin where demand has far outstripped the supply of water (S. Guhan, 1993). Despite many attempts at resolving the dispute, neither the orders of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal nor those of the Supreme Court have been implemented faithfully. Earlier this week, the court rapped the Centre for not framing a Cauvery scheme despite the courts orders.Political parties and farmers in Tamil Nadu have been pressing hard for the constitution of a Cauvery Management Board. According to the court, the Boards mandate is to manage the distribution of water between the States during distress periods and control the schedule of release of water from the reservoirs. But given the complexity of the ecological crisis the river is facing, can the Board on its own fully resolve the ongoing water dispute? As environmentalists point out, the issue of rampant groundwater extraction, which directly impacts the flow of water in the river, has remained outside the purview of the Tribunal and the court. Disputes between the neighbouring States have escalated during periods of distress; only good monsoons have brought temporary relief in the past. With industries and the population expanding in Bengaluru, there is more pressure on the courts to ensure that Cauvery water is supplied to the city. Sustainable alternatives such as getting factories to use recycled industrial waste water and rainwater harvesting for domestic use have not been adequately explored. Bengaluru-based water conservationist S. Vishwanath says that in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka, at present only 23% of rainwater is harvested. In Tamil Nadu too, rainwater run-off flowing towards Kerala in the Cauvery basin has not been adequately tapped.Despite the court imposing restrictions on sugarcane cultivation in Karnataka, in Mandya district, which is part of the Cauvery-irrigated farm belt of the State, sugarcane fields abound. Mandyas farmers said that have not got Cauvery water to irrigate their fields in the past three years. We have sunk bore wells as deep as 1,000 ft to draw water for our crops, says G. Chandrashekar, a sugarcane farmer in Chendre village. Darshan Puttanaiah is contesting the upcoming Assembly elections from Melukote constituency near here. He says that sugarcane is not the ideal crop for this region, but with big sugar mills coming up nearby, the local farm ecosystem has evolved around the cash crop, deepening the water crisis.In Bengaluru, engineers at the Inter-State Waters section of the Water Resources Development Organisation throw up their hands in resignation when asked about the implementation of the court order. Karnataka has permission to irrigate only 40,000 hectares of sugarcane as per the February 16 court order. But farmers are growing much more than that. How are we to stop them, an official asks.The Bengaluru-based environmental research organisation ATREE has documented how the Arkavathi, a major tributary of the Cauvery in Karnataka, has been sucked dry by farmers using deep bore wells. In the Cauvery delta districts of Tamil Nadu too, similar unsustainable farm practices are common. With the riverbed remaining dry for most of the year, farmers are reclaiming it for cultivation. In the 25-km stretch from Melur in Tiruchi to the Grand Anicut, there are several banana plantations and coconut trees on the riverbed, irrigated by motor pumps sunk deep into the river. P.R. Pandian, president of the Coordination Committee of All Tamilnadu Farmers Association, says that this practice is a common sight right from Mayanur in Karur district, where he saw some 150 bore wells drawing water illegally from the Cauvery riverbed.S. Nallasamy, a farmer leader from Erode, is critical of the Supreme Court decision allowing Tamil Nadu to draw an additional 10 tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of groundwater. Indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater is the reason why droughts keep occurring in the State, he says. Motor pumps installed by men can go hundreds of feet underground to draw up water, but can the roots of trees go that far?The rights of other speciesWith the spotlight on the dispute between the two riparian States, not much attention has been paid to the various other life forms that the river sustains. Fishes, otters, birds and butterflies, too, need the Cauvery water.Though the Supreme Court has asked the Karnataka government to maintain 10 tmc of Cauvery water for environmental purposes, the State has not followed this directive. Officials at Mysurus Krishnaraja Sagara Dam say that water is released from the dam only during the monsoon, when adequate inflow is available. On a hot summer afternoon at the Brindavan Gardens by the dam, families from Mysuru arrive to cool off by the numerous fountains sprinkling water to the flowers and grass. But downstream, at the Butterfly National Park near Srirangam in Tamil Nadu, forest officials are forced to pump out groundwater from the riverside to keep the place humid enough for the 98-odd species of butterflies.Sandeep Chakrabarti, an angler with the Wildlife Association of South India, says that the population of fish species such as the Mahseer has dwindled considerably due to a reduced flow of water in the river. The Mahseer is one of the most charismatic fish species found in the Cauvery, but this underwater tiger is yet to capture the imagination of the world, he says. Only about 100 otters survive in the river now without fish, says Nityata Foundations Menon.The reduced flow of water in the river has also caused a spike in pollution levels. In Srirangapatna near Mysuru, people take dips in the shallow waters of the Cauvery at the bathing ghat. They are perhaps unaware that faecal coliform levels in the water are prohibitively high, making the water unfit for bathing. Professor K.S. Lokesh, an environmental engineer who studies pollution in the Cauvery at the JSS Science and Technology University, Mysuru, says that the quality of water in Srirangapatna and Nanjangud near Mysuru has been steadily declining for the past 14 years. He blames it on pesticide run-off from agricultural fields and the lack of adequate municipal waste water recycling in the major towns of Karnataka. The Noyyal, a major tributary of the Cauvery, no longer brings water. Its flow consists of untreated effluents from Tiruppur, the textile export town in Tamil Nadu. In Erode, another textile town by the banks of the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu, chemical discharge flows into what is left of the river. On one side of the bridge by the Bhavani Kattalai barrage on the Cauvery here, stagnant green water with dead fish greets the eye, while on the other side, effluents released by the 200-odd dyeing factories and mills in the area come into view. The stench makes it difficult to breathe and the toxic concoction sears the eye.Ecosystem under threatThe Cauvery has been a cradle of human civilisation. But today, all along the course of the river the ecology stands devastated by human activity. The riverbed is heavily encroached on both sides in several stretches. In Tiruchi, for instance, large chunks of the riverbed have been taken over for construction of residential apartments and hotels.In parts of Kodagu, especially near Siddhapur, sand mining on the banks has widened the course of the river, reducing its pace. While sand mining on the riverbed was a major issue in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu until recently, judicial interventions and a concerted effort to switch to M-sand (manufactured sand produced from crushed granite) for construction has curbed this menace to a considerable extent. However, in parts of the Cauvery delta districts in Tamil Nadu, villagers continue to mine river sand using bullock carts. Over the years, such practices have reduced the water retention capacity of the river.Every waterfall, gorge and rapid on the Cauvery is sought to be captured for power generation. At Gaganchukki in Shivasamudram falls, the 115-year-old Seshadri Iyer hydroelectric project lies dormant. But even as the water levels in the falls were reduced to a trickle, in the forebay tank inside the power plant, water brimmed up to the edge. Environmentalists are worried that hydel power projects on the river may be diverting too much water into reservoirs, thereby affecting the natural flow of the river. In 2013, the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People drew attention to how 98 mini-hydel power plants commissioned or allotted on the Cauvery basin were diverting drinking water meant for Bengaluru. The construction of dams on the river has had its own consequences. A Central Water Commission report in 2015 pointed out that sediment flow to the Cauvery delta has stopped due to siltation in the dams.Poompuhar, or Kaveripoompattinam, in Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu, where the Cauvery meets the sea, symbolises a civilisation in ruin. This is where you finally see some water in the river. But soon you discover that this is sea water entering the river from its mouth. A local resident complains that the State government, after having destroyed the natural sand bars at the mouth of the river, has dumped rocks along the shore to stem coastal erosion. But the rocks have not been helpful. Sea water ingress has been a major issue facing farmers in Nagapattinam, as the groundwater has turned saline at many places. About 25 km south of Poompuhar, in Tarangambadi (Tranquebar), much of the Masilamani Nathar Koil, a 14th century Pandiyan-era temple, has been swallowed by the sea.Kaveripoompattinam was once a busy port city, the capital of the Chola kings, where maritime trade prospered. But today, like the river after which it takes its name, the town is a shadow of its storied past. The Silappadikaram Art Gallery overlooking Cauverys confluence with the sea looks dilapidated.

5b1546229855b744d6390a5a,‘Transfat accounts for high morbidity in India’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/transfat-accounts-for-high-morbidity-in-india/article23939871.ece,2018-05-20,"Early this week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) released REPLACE, a step-by-step guide for the elimination of industrially-produced trans-fatty acids from the global food supply. REPLACE, which is an acronym for Review, Promote, Legislate, Assess, Create and Enforce, is the first global initiative to eliminate a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths globally, accounting for one in every three deaths. Given Indias disease burden of non-communicable diseases and also the urban movement towards healthier foods, this movement is vital for the country to prevent diseases, and the compromised quality of life and deaths caused due to transfats. The REPLACE action package will provide governments with a strategy to achieve the prompt, complete, and sustained elimination of industrially-produced trans-fat from their national food supplies. This includes six action areas. Dr. Frieden, a leading public health expert, spoke on the initiative. Excerpts.What percentage of transfat do you see in an average adult human being in middle/lower income groups/countries?The WHO recommendation is that people consume less than 1% of their energy from transfat. This translates to 2.2 grams for a 2,000 calorie diet. In some countries, and for some populations within some countries, exposure may be five times higher than that.Just how harmful are transfats? How does it affect children?Artificial transfat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol and is estimated to kill 540,000 people a year around the world. Transfat is harmful across the life course.What disease burden does it translate into for India?Published estimates are that transfat kills more than 60,000 people a year in India. However, there is currently limited data on what the level of exposure and consumption is in India.How would the WHO assist or direct India in reducing its transfat use? How would you work with multinationals operating in the country?The WHO recommends that every country, including India, eliminate transfat by reducing the allowable level to less than 2% in fats, oils, and all food. Countries such as Canada and Argentina when they controlled transfat have provided technical assistance and funding to national industries to help them replace transfat with healthier oils. Adding soybean, sunflower, safflower and canola oil to mixes will save both lives and money  and increase the proportion of oil consumed in India that is made in India.If not stopped what could the abuse of transfat mean for India?If the WHO-recommended REPLACE package isnt implemented in India, there will be lakhs of deaths and heart attacks that could have been prevented. Fortunately, the Government of India has indicated their commitment to eliminating industrially produced transfat in advance of the WHO target date of 2023.What can be done at home to cut out transfat from our diets?This is a matter for the government to ensure that transfat is out of the food supply. But families can choose healthier oils such as sunflower, canola, soybean, and olive and nut oils. Also, consume more vegetables and fruits and limit fried foods, salt and sugar.The REPLACE action package proposes to provide countries with tools to eliminate industrially produced transfats from their national food supplies. What are these tools?The six-step action package shows the way to elimination. This includes examples of regulations and laws that can be adapted to the local context, guidelines for testing of food and human serum to determine levels of exposure, technical assistance to promote healthier oils, and examples from countries around the world that have already eliminated transfat.Could you elaborate on what realistic commitments/strategies the Indian government has committed to?The Government of India, through the FSSAI [Food Safety and Standards Authority of India], has required a reduction to 5% transfat in certain oils. The global best practice is a maximum of 2% in all oils, fats, and all foods. No formal decision has yet been made by the Government of India for complete elimination.A lot of research also suggests that excess sugar too is an impediment to health. By focussing only on transfat, does REPLACE condone sugar consumption?Absolutely not! First we discourage companies from allowing companies to advertise unhealthy food, including high sugar, high salt, high fat food as transfat-free as this is marketing which deceptively implies healthy. Second, as far back as 2009, I had advocated a tax on sugar-sweetened beverage of 1 cent per ounce. Third, a strong component of the Resolve to Save Lives global work is the reduction of salt. Finally, REPLACE specifically promotes not just the banning of transfat but also the promotion of healthier oils such as sunflower, canola, soybean and safflower. Excess sugar is a major driver of the obesity epidemic. REPLACE addresses the removal of a very harmful substance as one part of comprehensive action to improve nutrition.REPLACE specifically promotes not just the banning of transfat but the promotion of healthier oils."

Rangasamy on Thursday censured Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for blaming Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for all the failures and called upon Puducherry government to address peoples issues.Dubbing the Narayanasamy-led regime a non-performing government, Mr. Rangasamy accused it of failing to implement poll promises. Addressing the media on Thursday at his party office, he said that Mr. Narayanasamy had made it a practice to blame the Lieutenant Governor for everything.On the one hand, the Chief Minister accuses the L-G of being a hurdle in the implementation of the schemes and on the other hand we see the ministers continuing to meet to get their files cleared. I do not understand this drama. This is affecting the people and the progress of the State, he said.Poor managementHe accused the government of failing to implement new schemes and announce financial assistance to students. Even those students who have taken loans are struggling to continue their studies. The government has failed to disburse the salaries of the employees working in public sector units, due to which they are unable to pay their childrens school fees, he claimed.The former Chief Minister alleged that the government has failed to provide loans to the backward classes. The constituency development funds have not been disbursed, the government has not been providing free rice regularly to all the poor. They have not implemented any projects for the farmers, backward communities, weavers or fishermen. They have failed to implement the public welfare schemes as well. How long will they blame the LG for this? They have even cancelled seven liquor licences for PASIC. We dont know who benefited from it. The cooperative sugar mills have shut down, affecting the sugarcane farmers. They are giving excuses and blaming the LG for their own failures, he said.Law and order worstMr. Rangasamy said the government did not function for the progress of the State. Mr. Narayanansamy has been constantly claiming that the law and order is under control. But what is happening today? Two murders occur in one day, vehicles are set on fire. Theft and burglary continue. Even the government officials are scared to leave their homes locked due to the fear losing valuables. A few days ago, there was violence in Kalapet and it is alleged that a Congress member was responsible for that. We see that law and order is not under control and crime is increasing every day, he said.Pointing out that the Chief Minister has asked the Lieutenant Governor to resign for receiving a letter from the Central government, he questioned: What should a government which has neither shown any progress nor realised their poll promises do? Should such a government stay? he asked.Mr. Rangasamy said that the activities of the present government for the last two years have not been for the progress of the state. There are no new industries in Puducherry. Has the government created any new employment opportunities? How many educated youth has Puducherry employed in the last two years? Only if there are new industries there can be jobs. The development of this State remains a question, he said while adding that his party would soon meet the Home Minister with a complaint against the government. We will approach the Central government at the earliest and apprise them of the situation here, he said."

The underpayment by private sugar mills is another story altogether, said N. Palanichamy, State president of the association.The association said that, of the Rs. 212 crore, the National Cooperative Sugar Mills in Alanganallur alone owed up to Rs. 20 crore. While the State government did not even bother to announce the State Advised Price (SAP) for this season, the mill has not even managed to pay the Central governments Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,550 to all the farmers, Mr. Palanichamy alleged.According to the association, the pending dues included payment of share from the profits for the year 2009, which has not been done despite an order by the Madras High Court.When we staged a protest in front of the Chief Ministers house in March, we were assured that the pending amount will be paid in 20 days. However, nothing has happened since then, he said.The protesters also raised strong objections to the introduction of revenue sharing formula as per recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee, which according to them will bring down the remuneration they get by at least Rs. 300 per tonne.Arguing that the State government had chosen to do away with the SAP and instead opted for revenue sharing formula, the association said that the formula had not been accepted even in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Stating that the option of sharing 70% of the sold value of sugar, molasses and other products with farmers as per the revenue sharing formula would end up benefiting the mill owners and affecting the farmers, the protesters demanded immediate withdrawal of the announcement. Instead, the government must announce an SAP of Rs. 4,000 for 2017-18, Mr. Palanichamy said."

HTN is not restricted to a specific gender or age bracket, noted a survey released by Max Healthcare on Rising Juvenile Obesity in the Delhi-NCR.The survey said rising obesity is causing lifestyle diseases, leading to early onset of ailments, and HTN is one of the critical symptoms that children and young adults are suffering from.The survey found that youngsters and children are increasingly suffering from HTN, hormonal issues, blood pressure and blood sugar fluctuations.Twenty-four per cent of obese boys and girls suffer from or are suspected to show symptoms of blood pressure fluctuations.These fluctuations have been commonly observed in 18% of obese boys and girls.Sample sizeThe survey was conducted on a sample size of 1,000 in Delhi-NCR.Pradeep Chowbey, chairman, Department of Minimal Access, Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, Max Healthcare, said: Youngsters are sleeping late and often resort to midnight binging. Moreover, increased screen usage time among children these days causes a lot of emotional and hormonal changes. Stress hormones and steroid production is increased in the body, which in turn increases appetite. This in turn contributes to weight gain.WHO saysNon-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes have overtaken communicable diseases as the leading causes of mortality in urban areas, said a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report.The report stated that HTN is the third biggest risk factor for heart disease in India and is directly responsible for about 57% of all stroke deaths and 24% of all coronary heart disease deaths in India.The national data stated that 9% women and 14% men falling in the age bracket of 15-49 years suffer from HTN.Lifestyle diseasesArindam Haldar, CEO, SRL Diagnostics, said, Lifestyle diseases like HTN can be prevented by shifting to a preventive healthcare mindset. The fact is that it is far more affordable to prevent a disease rather than cure it. And as is the case with most lifestyle diseases like HTN, once a person is diagnosed with one, he or she has to manage it for the rest of his/ her life.Regular check-upsHe added that it is far more easier for a person to get regular check-ups done by a qualified physician and at a laboratory, and follow advice on lifestyle changes that may need to be made to live a long and healthy life.Increased screen usage time among children ... causes emotional and hormonal changes.

One such is at Chanda (T) village, about three km from Adilabad district headquarter town.The trick? Making tea in a newspaper bowl. Sk. Annu aka Annubhaiyya, a 55-year-old tea vendor at this village, makes tea in a paper bowl, only on request. He has been doing so since he was 12 when he started working as an apprentice at a hotel off the old NH 7 near Chanda stream bridge.Heres how Mr. Annu does it. He folds a 6X6 inch piece of newspaper with four acacia thorns holding the folds at four corners making it into a bowl. Only acacia thorns can be used as they hold the folds together making them airtight so that the fire does not burn the paper, says the chaiwallah revealing his technique.He pours about 60 ml of milk and the required quantity of tea powder and sugar in the bowl. He uses the common air blower used in small tea vends in villages, but blows air from mouth to keep the coals burning. The paper remains untouched by the flames and after a few minutes later, the tea begins to boil. You have your half cup of tea, called a cut locally, in five minutes flat with the paper bowl intact except for some that sag due to the liquid. The milk makes the bowl wet enough to prevent the flames from reducing it to ashes though the temperature of the burning charcoal is quite high, says Mr. Annu. Only about 60 ml to 70 ml of tea can be concocted through this method, he says of its limitation.I have demonstrated this trick only as part of entertainment or made tea on being specifically ordered to do so. No money in it, he quipped, a broad smile gracing his face that was bathed in sweat after the five-minute exercise."

The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters, the SP chief told reporters here.He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said.Mr. Yadav demanded Rs. 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a fake cow slaughter case was registered, and claimed that he was tortured to death in custody by the Meerut police.It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of justice? he posed.As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in a little over a year in the State, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters.The former Chief Minister also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody.Creating riftThe BJP says that we used to give Rs. 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) not helping the Hindu? We do not believe in taking advantage by creating rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactic, the SP leader said.He also blamed the U.P. police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. If the government wanted, the situation would not have worsened, Akhilesh said.On reports of CBI probe into sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind.Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said: These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly.Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, The U.P. CM is not bothered about improving the law and order in the State. He is more bothered about the law and order of Karnataka (where he was campaigning for the Assembly elections)."

At that time, only Rs. 2,901 crore  or 17% of the sanctioned Rs. 16,000 crore  had been spent.A financial account from the NCGM says that as of March 2018, Rs. 20,601 crore had been sanctioned for 193 projects. So far, only Rs. 4,254 crore had actually been spent on their implementation.

Its basin constitutes 26% of the countrys land mass (8,61,404 sq. km.) and supports 43% of its population. Even as the basin spreads across 11 States, five are located along the rivers main stem: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Much of its pollution load  chemical effluents, sewage, dead bodies, and excreta  comes from these States. Though the industrial pollution, volume-wise, accounts for about 20%, its toxic and non-biodegradable nature has a disproportionate impact. The industrial pollutants largely emanate from tanneries in Kanpur and distilleries, paper mills and sugar mills in the Kosi, Ramganga and Kali river catchments. The municipal sewage, at a billion litres a day, accounts for 80% of the pollution load."

This was being done at the cost of our farmers who are committing suicide in the State. As a result of this decision, prices too have crashed. Who is responsible for this? former Maharashtra Cabinet minister and senior Congress leader Harshvardhan Patil said, claiming the lopsided import policy has already led to a loss of Rs 30,000 crore to the local industry. The losses in Maharashtra alone was to the tune of Rs 3,000 cr, Mr Patil claimed.Congress State president Ashok Chavan further alleged the sugar prices collapsed due to the untimely and unnecessary import from Pakistan to Rs. 24,000 per quintal from Rs. 36,000 earlier.The senior leader took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who, he said, had promised to bring back fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim from Pakistan but instead instead got sugar. At the same time, the Shiv Sena, an ally of Mr. Modi, did not oppose the import policy when they oppose everything else the government does, the senior Congress leader said.The central government had recently reiterated its commitment to supporting a struggling sugar industry, which is faced with depressed market sentiments and a crash in prices.Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan had in Mumbai on May 5 reiterated his governments commitment to ensuring liquidity, financial assistance and support to sugar mills to offset the crunch resulting from the falling cost of cane. , the government needed to do more on the ground and walk the talk before it could win their trust."

Sudarshan as the most brilliant theoretical physicist of Indian origin in the contemporary period.Way back in 2005, Dr. Padmanabhan was among the 10 scientists who wrote to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on the wrongful omission of Prof. Sudarshan from then Nobel Physics prize. The letter described the omission as a grave miscarriage of justice in overlooking the fundamental contributions of E.C.G. Sudarshan to the theory of quantum optics.Two of his contributions, one related to weak interactions and the other in the development of quantum optics, deserved Nobel Prize. The work in quantum optics did get a Nobel but he was not a recipient for reasons which could only be non-academic, says Dr. Padmanabhan, in an e-mail to The Hindu from Pauli Center, where he is a Visiting Professor.A distinguished professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune, Dr. Padmanabhan pointed out that Prof. Sudarshans research spanned a wide range of topics and in each of them he could make brilliant contributions of fundamental nature.Stating that Prof. Sudarshan was a victim of white supremacy in being denied the Nobel Prize, Babu Joseph, a theoretical physicist and former Vice Chancellor of Cochin University of Science and Technology, said that Prof. Sudarshan deserved to win the coveted award.Dr. Joseph, who was among the signatories to this letter to the Academy, said that the eminent scientist faced neglect from physicists abroad. One half of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics went to Roy J. Glauber of Harvard University for the contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence.Pointing out that Prof. Sudarshan was deeply influenced by Vedanta and Hinduism, Dr. Joseph said that it was not Hindutva, but the traditional Hinduism that fascinated him. Prof. Sudarshan found close parallels between science and Indian philosophy, he said.Reminiscing his close association with Prof. Sudarshan under whom he did his PhD (open quantum systems and quantum information) at the University of Texas, Austin, Anil Shaji, Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram, said that Prof. Sudarshan had deep knowledge of the subject. It [knowledge] was not at the superficial level. He always had the interest and energy to earn first-hand knowledge, he said.Asked to recall an anecdote that he would never forget, Prof. Shaji said that Prof. Sudarshans students used to sit with him during night, especially after being concerned about his fluctuating blood sugar levels.I have found him doing calculations while looking at tele-marketing shows even at 2 a.m. Prof. Sudarshan had a particular liking for such shows and was found ordering some of the products over telephone. As a teacher, he had deep insights and used interesting metaphors to explain complex topics, he said.Prof. Sudarshan was deeply influenced by Vedanta and HinduismBabu JosephTheoretical physicist"

In Chamarajanagar too, the party has won a seat. In what is seen as a best-ever performance by the saffron party in the district, once considered a Congress bastion, the BJP won in three seats, including Krishnaraja.The Congress wrested Chamaraja, which was a BJP bastion, in 2013. With the JD(S) facing rebel trouble in this election, the BJPs L. Nagendra won with a comfortable margin. The BJP, considered an urban party, made inroads into the rural pockets with Harshvardhan, son-in-law of the former Minister V. Sreenivas Prasad, winning from Nanjangud.Though there was opposition to Ramdas from within the party, the former Minister, considered close to BJP State president B.S. Yeddyurappa, was eventually chosen for Krishnaraja. The anti-incumbency factor seems to have worked in Mr. Ramdas favour as he trounced incumbent Congress MLA, M.K. Somashekar.Minister for Sugar Geetha Mahadeva Prasad, wife of former minister late H.S. Mahadeva Prasad, was defeated in Gundlupet by C.S. Niranjan Kumar of the BJP.It appears a sympathy factor also worked in favour of Anil Chikkamadu of the Congress, who won from H.D. Kote seat. His father, the late Chikkamadu, who was considered a grassroots leader, died last year. The JD(S) did not consider a ticket for Anil but favoured Chikkanna, who had won in 2008 on a Congress ticket.Mr. Anil secured 76,652 votes while Mr. Chikkanna got 54,559 votes."

Taking this into account, the policy allows use of surplus food grains for production of ethanol for blending with petrol with the approval of National Biofuel Coordination Committee.The policy also provides for a viability gap funding scheme of Rs. 5,000 crore in six years for second generation (more advanced) ethanol bio-refineries in addition to tax incentives and a higher purchase price as compared to first generation biofuels.One crore litres of E10 [petrol with 9-10% ethanol blended in it] saves Rs. 28 crore of forex at current rates, the government said. The ethanol supply year 2017-18 is likely to see a supply of around 150 crore litres of ethanol which will result in savings of over Rs. 4,000 crore of forex.The release added that one crore litres of E10 saves reduces carbon dioxide emissions by about 20,000 tonnes.For the ethanol supply year 2017-18, there will be lesser emissions of CO2 to the tune of 30 lakh tonnes, it said. By reducing crop burning and conversion of agricultural residues/wastes to biofuels there will be further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions."

The State government will initiate a crack down against traders indulging in malpractice by importing the commodity at cheaper rates, Mr. Deshmukh said.Earlier this week, opposition parties including the Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), the Congress and Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) attacked the government over the issue.Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan hit out at the Central and State governments for importing sugar from Pakistan at a time when production in the State was at a record high, with stocks lying unsold and farmers having a tough time to sell their produce in the market.Acknowledging that a bumper harvest had brought about a host of problems brought on sugarcane farmers and other workers in the sugar sector, Mr. Deshmukh observed the inability of sugar mills to pay a decent FRP to farmers was due to the steep devaluation in sugar prices.This year, owing to record production and consequent supply glut, the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) is going at barely Rs. 2,500 per tonne against a demand Rs. 3,500 per tonne, he said.He further stated that the Cabinets approval for a subsidy of Rs. 55 on every tonne of sugarcane sold to the mills was not enough for farmers."

But no amount had been released for the actual construction of the dams. This project was essential for meeting both agricultural and drinking water needs of the district.Even the construction of the Varahi Irrigation Project was progressing at a slow pace in the district. With the result, farmers were unable to use the water from the Varahi for irrigating their fields. It has been four decades since the project was sanctioned. Only its first phase work had been inaugurated.But a large section of its work was still under construction. If the BJP was voted to power, the party would give priority to the completion of the Varahi Irrigation Project, he said.He said that the Congress government had not taken any interest in reviving the ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory. The foundation stone for both the Varahi Irrigation Project and the Brahmavar Sugar Factory was laid on the same day four decades ago.But the factory, which started its operations early, shut down in 2004 amid mounting losses. The BJP would give priority to reviving the factory.The State unit of the BJP had released its manifesto recently and it had several schemes for the welfare of the farmers, Mr. Uppoor said."

MANJUNATHIn 2013 Assembly elections, there were four polling booths. For the 2018 polls, there is one. By the next election, the crumbling town of Kudremukh, set amidst the hills of the Western Ghats, may be entirely erased from the map.After a 2002 Supreme Court order closed the mines in 2005, the towns population has dwindled from an estimated 35,000 to barely 300 today. The forests of Kudremukh National Park is reclaiming the land: mining areas are now shrouded in green, shrubs are invading abandoned quarters, the river Bhadra has cleared up, and elephants have returned, pillaging the trees in the dying township.While around 15 permanent employees will be transferred out, for the rest who depend on the local economy, there is hardly a political voice to vent their troubles. This year, even candidates have largely stayed away. The incumbent JD(S) MLA had got three votes. Why will he bother coming here again, says Bhaskar Shetty, a shopkeeper who campaigned for the party last election. Despite his business drawing a blank, he hangs on. I came here 40 years ago, and I have no where else to go. If they want us to leave, they have to give us land outside the forests, he said.A little distance away from the township is the labourers colony  once densely crowded with those surviving on manual work in the township and factory. From 700 makeshift houses on government land, barely 50 are occupied. Being encroachments, they do not have electricity still. Those who could leave have left. We are managing a living by working in the plantations. What will happen to us when the land we built houses on is given to the Forest Department? says Paramashwarappa.Bhadravati simmersWhile Kudremukh finds no political audience, in Bhadravati, some 140 km away in Shivamogga district, the discontent over the closure of the Mysuru Paper Mills (MPM) has fomented to political vengeance.For the over 150 workers still working there, apart from 2,000 contract and retired employees in the town, their target is a BJP leader, Araga Jnanendra, who was appointed as the chairman of the mills between 2009 and 2013. The next year, the mills, set up as a paper factory and sugar mill by the Mysore maharajas in 1937, was closed. The local economy was destroyed.All political parties have failed us. But, he [Mr. Jnanendra] oversaw our destruction (a CID inquiry is under way). Losses went from Rs. 32 crore to Rs. 300 crore under his watch, and we now suffer because of this, says G. Babu, a worker.The epicentre of this anger is a bus stop, just outside the factory, where in the past political leaders had given them assurances that the factory would not be closed. This is the only sight of activity in a town of abandoned houses, clubs and shops. Each morning, workers update the number chalked on it: 896 (on May 9) signifying the number of days since their protest against the closure started.Mr. Jnanendra is standing for elections from the adjacent Theerthahalli constituency where more than 100 workers have been campaigning against him. Workers have even managed to get his political opponents there to question him on the MPM closure.Within Bhadravati, they throw their weight behind a Congress candidate whom they credit with getting a Rs. 400-crore grant to settle dues of more than 1,100 workers.Workers have been campaigning in the constituencies for over 10 hours daily, for free, and without political orders.As disinvestment spreads and more townships close, we want to tell the entire political system that we are not scapegoats that can be easily evicted and forgotten, says Shivamurthy C.S., president of the employees union."

Often, the reason behind the protests is low or delayed payment by sugarcane factories. However, they rarely become talking points come the elections.Farmers groups seldom challenge parties or candidates to fulfil their demands before seeking votes from them, and elected representatives are not held accountable for the promises they have made.Most of the 37 sugar factories in the district are either owned or managed by politicians. Politicians are either elected chairpersons of cooperative sugar factories or they invest in them, taking complete control. District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and his brothers own three factories and are in the process of building another two.Umesh Katti, former Minister and BJP leader, is the chairman of a cooperative factory and owns another private unit. Similarly, most of the candidates in the 18 constituencies in the district either manage factories or have invested in them. However, how efficiently the factories are run or if they pay remunerative prices to farmers or not do not seem to affect the poll outcomes.Farmers leaders say this is because of the focus on caste and other factors, other than common problems or shared interests.Lack of unityBabagouda Patil, farmers leader and former Union Minister, feels the lack of unity among farmers is the reason for this. Farmers are divided along the lines of religion, caste, land-holding and crop variety. A large land owner does not side with a small farmer. Similarly, a farmer who grows cash crops does not sit alongside a subsistence farmer during a protest. That is the tragedy. Efforts to bring farmers under one umbrella have repeatedly failed, he said.Appasaheb Desai feels there is a disconnect between farmers of different classes. Most candidates in this election have described themselves as farmers in the affidavits submitted before the Election Commission. Does it mean they represent us, the poor farmers? No. They look down upon us only as voters who are waiting for benefits from the government, while they consider themselves the rulers, Mr. Desai said.[The candidates] look down upon us only as voters who are waiting for benefits from the government, while they consider themselves the rulersAppasaheb Desai,farmers leader"

This would enable the Centre to act against sugar factories failing to meet their commitments, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday.Sources said Mr. Gadkari made it clear during a meeting in Mumbai with stakeholders and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis that though sugar prices have been falling and the industry is in crisis, millers cannot not make payments or part payments citing low sugar prices. Maharashtra has Rs. 2,228 crore pending as arrears in FRP payments.The State Sugar Commissioner has already served notices to 136 factories that failed to keep FRP commitments. Though the industry is in crisis and the government is committed to providing help, this cannot be an excuse to not make FRP payments. Nitin Gadkari has made it clear action will be taken against millers not paying up, a senior State Cabinet Minister who attended the meeting, said.Ministers to visit DelhiSources said it was also decided that a delegation of senior State Ministers will approach the visit the Central government with a list of demands to support the struggling sugar industry. Among them will be efforts to subsidise and incentivise exports, reducing GST on ethanol to 5% from the existing 12%, try to change the crop pattern and create a buffer stock.The Central government has reiterated its commitment to supporting the industry. During his visit to the city on May 5, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan said the government was commited to ensuring liquidity, financial assistance and support for export to sugar mills to offset the situation brought about by the falling cost of sugar cane."

Mr. Gandhi said, Political parties are under RTI as the law stands. Central Information Commission has given a clear decision which has not been challenged anywhere. Therefore the six political parties of this nation are flouting the law and defying the law.The remarks came after a member of the audience directed a question to former Maharashtra chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asking him when his party would get in line with the RTI. Mr. Chavan said, I think thats a very important question. It doesnt really pertain only to Congress, every political party should be brought into RTI. That will be one step to reduce corruption in the political process. There is a very strong case for bringing political parties under RTI.Mr. Chavan, who was part of a group of experts that formulated the first draft of the RTI, said the current government was trying to stifle RTI. Mr. Chavan said 32,000 appeals were pending, including questions on demonetisation, the Mumbai-Ahemdabad bullet train, and sugar imports. Whatever information I seek from the Centre or State government, nothing is being given out, he said.Information vs. privacyMadabhushi Acharyulu, the Central Information Commissioner, who launched his book RTI and misconduct of public servant: Is bribing a family affair? , criticised the Girish Deshpande case for being treated as a precedent.Mr. Acharyulu said, When you dismiss a special leave petition, you have rejected permission to take the issue in appeal. When it is not a full-fledged hearing and there is no judgement passed after it, then that order might bind those persons who are the parties to that litigation. But it can never operate as a binding precedent on the country.The Supreme Court had said that the copies of all memos, show-cause notices and orders of censure/punishment, assets, income tax returns, details of gifts received by a public servant are personal information, and hence exempted from the RTI. Mr. Acharyulu said, The information held by you is not your information, you have not generated it. It is in public domain and everybody should have access to it. Today the government questions citizens, against the CICs order, for having access to information.Advocate Jamshed Mistry, who delved on the dynamic nature of the law, said, There are Benches which pass contradictory orders every day. This is part of the system. All these issues are open to judicial review and the law is constantly changing. He said attempts were being made to ask the court to provide live broadcasts and legal transcripts of hearings.Anupam Saraph, activist and e-governance expert, said there is not much conflict between the need for privacy and information. He said, Any information with a public authority is for public consumption. We have created the public authority through a mechanism for our governance and therefore it is supposed to give us the information it has. So if it has any of our personal information which doesnt pertain to this governance, it should not be having it.Whatever info I seek from the Centre or State government, nothing is being given outPrithviraj ChavanCongress leader"

Is this what Veere Di Wedding all about? Well, according to Swara Bhaskar, one of the members of the gang, headlined by Kareena Kapoor, its a pretty ballsy film in more ways than one. After two back-to-back hard hitting films, it seems like Swaras attempt to let her hair down and have some fun but she insists there is more. In commercial, star-driven mainstream space, it is perhaps the first time that you see a story about four girls who are not falling in love with the same guy. They are just dealing with problems that adult life brings in a fun way. It is an unapologetic, realistic  not in terms of budgets but culturally  and unselfconscious film. Of course, it is set in a particular strata of society but it shows the women as struggling, confused and flawed. Usually, Swara emphasises, we give these freedoms to male characters. Like Bunnys character in Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani went through the entire film without realising whether he is in love or not. In Wake Up Sid , Sid goes about the entire narrative without realising what job he wants to do. If you go back further, you will find that we give anger and angst to male characters. The industry never invested that humanity into female characters.In recent times, there have been examples of Angry Indian Goddesses and Parched but Swara reminds that these films have come from independent space. They are not even made by Indian producers. Also, Parched and Angry Indian Goddesses were conscious about the fact that they were films about women. Similarly, Anarkali of Arrah was a film with a social agenda. In that sense, Veere Di Wedding is a film where the gender is incidental. Thats the nice thing about it. We should note that mainstream Bollywood is changing or at least seems to be changing. Otherwise, why would Kareena  a commercial film star  be part of this script.Liberating experienceThe promos do make some of us conscious for they give an impression that it is the good old Dil Chahta Hai template that the writers have built upon, and the generous use of cuss words could be construed as an attempt to normalise usage of four-letter words in everyday conversation. In Dil Chahta Hai and films made after that, filmmakers have been able to give male characters not one or two but so many stories of friendships. Even a film like Kal Ho Naa Ho is essentially about the friendship between Shah Rukhs and Saifs characters whereas whenever you have told a story through girls it becomes a Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega or Dil Toh Pagal Hai . It is always about two women falling in love with the same man, argues Swara. Also every time there is a story about women, it doesnt need to be a harsh, brutal take on society. I am not saying those are bad films as I come from that cinema, but it is so liberating that we also have a film about four girls in a normal comic space. Why are we okay with a Golamaal 4 or Dhamaal franchise? But when it comes to four women then we are like, achcha yeh bold hai!As for the language, Swara says there is a certain vocabulary of the young urban working youth. People are surprised because A-listers heroines are saying this. We never ask Anurag Kashyap why his actors abuse so much.Swara says she doesnt mind an intellectual discussion on the social impact of cuss words in films but personally she has no problem with swearing on screen as long as somebody is not inciting violence or abusing elderly people. Or it becomes a power equation as in case of men abusing women. Here these girls are talking about their personal lives in an unguarded way. But then who can get past the guards of Central Board of Film Certification. They have beeped out everything, curses Swara.Making of an actor-activist?With her frequent outbursts on socio-political issues, Swara is increasingly being seen as an actor-activist. I am not doing any on- ground activism. I only see this as my duty as the citizen of the country in line with the Constitution. I am a little more emotional about it ever since I hosted Samvidhaan . Our county has a very progressive constitution, enshrined with humanist values. We should protect it. My take is that artistes must engage with the world around them and keep an eye on politics of the country because ultimately it is the politics which decides what art you are going to make. Look at the Padmaavat issue. No interesting art can come out in an environment of hate and bigotry. We will only get propaganda films, she cautions.Has her opinions impacted her career? Of course, I know it is a collateral (damage). I am not doing anything as great but I always think of the story of Muhammad Ali who refused to go to the Vietnam War. The boxing legend was made to pay a fine and was banned from boxing for three years at the prime of his career.The explosive letterThe most shocking action, according to Swara, was her letter to Sanjay Leela Bhansali where she criticised him for glorifying Jauhar in Padmaavat . Having good command over language, could Swara have expressed her outrage in any other way?The piece was dramatic and it was deliberately so. I thought he was already dealing with a very dramatic subject. And I wanted to say it in a language which may sound hard but create an impact. Because ultimately this is what it is. To me, his presentation indicated that rape victims are cowards if they dont kill themselves or allow themselves to be raped. It is like putting responsibility on the victim, which is not fair. Thats why I used strong language.Bhansali fans and a section of media expected her to see the film as a period piece. The story is of a certain period but your lens is of today. Where is the perspective? Dont glorify it after Nirbhaya. She wanted to live. She fought back. I am not a proponent of sugar coating your views...chalo chalo sab theek hai, ho jata hai. I want to call a spade a spade.... And what about Shashanka Ghoshs lens? Well, we have given him the title of our honorary girl friend, Swara signs off with a smile."

It is being done for the welfare of the farmers. If they are happy the State will prosper, said the Chief Minister.The sugar mills in the State are yet to pay over Rs. 12,000 crore to the farmers for the cane they had bought in the beginning of the crushing season.After speaking at length on issues related to farmers, Mr. Adityanath slammed former CM Akhilesh Yadav for the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.

Following the incident, the temple was closed for the day.The female elephant, Masini, donated by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in 2016, turned violent suddenly even as devotees were visiting the temple on a Friday morning, triggering a scare. Its mahout, G.Gajendran (45) of Mahalikudi near Samayapuram, made desperate attempts to keep it under control. But the elephant unleashed its fury on the mahout by trampling him to death outside the main shrine.Panic-stricken devotees took to heels, leading to a near stampede. A couple of devotees sustained injuries while trying to flee.The incident occurred at around 10.30 a.m. when the 10-year-old elephant was brought to a spot between the inner praharam and the exit point on the western side. The mahout and his son, acting as his assistant, were near the pachyderm.The agitated animal kept kicking the body for some time after his death, leaving the temple staff and devotees in a state of shock. Harried temple staff closed the western exit point, but could not get near the elephant. Mahouts from nearby temples rushed to the spot to try and calm down the animal and help remove the mahout's body. Forest and police officials were present.It was only after half past noon that the body of the mahout could be removed by mahouts and forest department officials. The animal was chained to a pillar with a nylon rope and chains.The incident happened within no time. I was sitting nearby when everyone starting fleeing and I fell down while trying to escape. People ran over me, said a dazed P. Jayammal from Namakkal district, who had come along with her husband Periasamy to the temple.Animal provoked?Although it is not immediately clear as to what triggered the animals wild behaviour, Murugan, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry, Tiruchi, said the animal could have been provoked. A team of veterinary doctors and forest department officials along with mahouts gave the animal a wash and fed it with bundles of sugar cane and water melons. The animal calmed down and was normal thereafter, said Mr. Murugan, adding that it would be kept under observation and examined by another veterinary doctor.District Forest Officer D.Sujatha said the reason for the elephants behaviour could not be specified immediately. According to the information they had been getting from the district level Captive Elephant Welfare Committee, the elephant had been behaving normally.A temple priest said the elephant was like a child and friendly. It was brought every day to the temple where it would stay for couple of hours.The temple remained closed for the day following the incident and would reopen on Saturday after parihara poojas, official sources said.Masini, an orphaned calf, was shifted to the temple from Mudumalai Elephant Camp in 2016 in an ill-advised move and it could be very difficult to fully domesticate it by any mahout, a section of wildlife activists feel.In 2011, a 23-year-old male elephant, Mariappan, of the temple was shifted to the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai after it turned restive and unpredictable. It had to be kept chained in shelter for several years before being shifted to the zoo."

Patients should consult their diabetologists six weeks before the fasting period so that the medications could be adjusted to ensure safe fasting, said K.P. Dinakaran, consultant diabetologist, at Lifeline Institute of Minimal Access.Patients developed cardiovascular episodes after fasting and subsequent celebrations. This could be avoided if some simple steps were followed.Since Muslims shun water during the fast, which typically lasts 12 hours of day time, doctors advise patients to drink plenty of water and sugar-free beverages (2 to 2.5 litres) during the non-fasting hours. Their meal should include a liberal dose of fruits and vegetables.The human body synthesises fat during the evenings. Hence taking fat-rich food at night for iftar and high protein food during the suhoor (pre-dawn meal), could check episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.Delaying the morning food helped the body synthesise proteins and release energy slowly and thus balance sugar levels.Light exerciseA.

The 75-year-old had shaved half his head in protest and burned the money he failed to exchange. But, that was just one protest in a life filled with many such instances.Sanu Kummils documentary Oru Chaayakkadakkarante Mann ki Baat is a chronicle of that life, told engagingly, with caricatures of various moments from his life used to enliven the narration. The documentary begins from his early years of struggle in a family of 13 children. Not much thought was given to education, as each of them had to work to survive.Mookkupodi for guestsHis unconventional ways were evident in the earlier days too. When he got married to his neighbour Suhara, he offered just mookkupodi (snuff) to his guests, as the families did not have enough money for a feast. Soon, he went to Saudi Arabia. But what he had to go through there is reminiscent of Benyamins novel Aadujeevitham. For 18 years, he survived there in abject condition, looking after camels and goats. Using a forged passport, he landed in Mumbai, only to be caught and jailed.Buried savingsBack home, he opened an eatery in a push cart. Once he got slapped by a policeman, who thought Yahiya was disrespecting him by tying his lungi up. From that day, Yahiya has been wearing a maxi, to free himself from the expectation of tying it up in respect.He later set up a tea shop, which became popular for its local flavour and clean food. But ill luck followed him there too. Two men came for dinner late one night, beat him up and stole all his savings. Since then, he has been digging up the earth and storing his savings underground.The demonetisation in November 2016 came as a huge jolt for him. He queued up in front of the bank to exchange his savings, Rs. 23,000 in cash. On the second day, his sugar level dropped and he collapsed. After he was discharged from the hospital, he burned all the demonetised cash. The next trip was to the barber shop to shave half of his head.Yahiya lives according to his rules. He continues his protests even now, shaving half his moustache on the first anniversary of demonetisation. The documentary has got good response wherever it has been screened.

It was being seen as a battle between ganna (sugarcane) and Jinnah.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths repeated reference to Mohammed Ali Jinnahs portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University during the campaign was seen as an attempt to polarise voters on religious lines.The Opposition, however, campaigned against the Modi governments failure to get the sugarcane farmers their dues from the various sugar mills that stood at over Rs. 12,000 crore.The Palghar Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra brought cheer to the BJP as its candidate Rajendra Gavit defeated Shiv Senas Shrinivas Wanga by 29,572 votes.But the votes polled in favour of the BJP fell sharply from 5.33 lakh in 2014 to to 2.72 lakh in this election.

Amarinder, adding that Mr. Khairas trespass bid amounted to sheer violation of the law, with the potential to trigger violence.Despite being warned about the serious trouble it could lead to, considering the fact that the move could have provoked the mill workers and staff into retaliation, Mr. Khaira did not desist from moving towards the premises, said the Chief Minister. He termed it an attempt on the AAP leaders part to divert public attention on the eve of polling.Capt. Amarinder said the AAP had a history of resorting to theatrics in the run-up to any election and Mr. Khairas act had exposed the partys desperation in the face of their imminent wipe-out in the Shahkot by-election.Meanwhile, Mr. Khaira said he was in Buttar Siviato to inspect the villages adjacent to the sugar factory including Dhardion, Buttar, Gagarbhana, where the villagers had told him about their problems due to pollution caused by the factory.I had not gone to Buttar Sivia to fight with anybody but to listen to the problems of the people as a public representative so that they could be raised in the Vidhan Sabha, said Mr. Khaira. He added that he was forcefully stopped outside the factory from examining the drain where pollutants from the factory were being thrown. The police acted as a mute spectator and instead of taking any action against the goons, they pressurised me to cancel the programme, said Mr. Khaira.Rana Sugars Private Limited, however, refuted the charges and accused Mr. Khaira of running a malicious campaign against it.It is so characteristic of Mr. Khaira to resort to theatrics and create a hype and eventually beat a hasty retreat taking one excuse or the other, Rana Veer Partap Singh, one of the directors of the company and son of Rana Gurjeet Singh, said.Mr. Singh added that the company was running strictly according to the norms of the Environment Ministry and the pollution control board and had obtained all mandatory clearances, which were renewed from time to time after proper scrutiny and examination."

But the dues across the State is worth Rs. 12,000 crore. The other severe problem farmers face is that of power tariff hike. The Yogi Adityanath government revised the power tariffs twice in the last two months. It has raised our input cost on the crops to unimaginable limits, Mr. Singh said.He alleged that the State government remained indifferent to the farmers problems. Udayveer, along with us, was protesting for the past several days. No one from the local administration was ready to listen to our problems. and it led to his death. Now the administration is all out trying to be seen as sensitive to our problems. That is the tragedy. No one listens to you when you are alive, he said.Additional District Magistrate Lokpal Singh initially announced a compensation of Rs. 5 lakh for Udayveers family and increased it to Rs. 12 lakh as the outrage over his death grew."

Dinakaran, consultant diabetologist at Lifeline Institute of Minimal Access.Some patients developed cardiovascular episodes after fasting and subsequent celebrations. This can be avoided if some simple steps are followed.Doctors can prescribe medications to suit the patients requirement during the fasting period and prevent overindulgence during the non-fasting hours, said Dr. Dinakaran.Since Muslims shun water during the fast, which typically lasts 12 hours of day time, doctors advise patients to drink plenty of water and sugar-free beverages (2 to 2.5 litres) during the non-fasting hours.Their meal should include a liberal dose of fruits and vegetables. The human body synthesises fat during the evenings. Hence, taking fat-rich food at night for iftar and high protein food during the suhoor (pre-dawn meal) could check episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Delaying the morning food helps the body synthesise proteins and release energy slowly, and thus balance sugar levels.Light exerciseA. Ramanan, consultant diabetologist at the Madras Medical Mission Hospital, said people having diabetes should be encouraged to do regular exercise during Ramzan. The physical exertions involved in Tarawih such as bowing, kneeling and rising, should be considered part of the daily exercise, he added."
5b15a9819855b762463882f3,Green push?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/green-push/article24028511.ece,2018-05-30,"At a time when rising oil prices are putting increasing pressure on the economy, even small steps to encourage the use of biofuels are welcome. The Cabinet this month approved a National Policy on Biofuels, which encourages the generation and use of biofuels such as ethanol. It primarily tries to address supply-side issues that have discouraged the production of biofuels within the country. For one, it allows for a wider variety of raw materials to be used as inputs to produce ethanol that is blended with petrol. Until now, only ethanol produced from sugarcane was approved for this purpose. Under the new policy, feedstock for biofuels includes sugar beet, corn, damaged foodgrain, potatoes, even municipal solid waste. This will likely reduce the cost of producing biofuels and improve affordability for consumers, particularly during times when oil prices reach discomforting levels. In India, industrial-scale availability of ethanol so far has been only from sugar factories, which were free to divert it to other users such as alcohol producers, who would pay more. The oil companies have been floating tenders for ethanol supply, but availability lags behind their needs, because the price is often not attractive enough for the sugar industry. The Centre hopes the new policy will also benefit farmers, who will be able to sell various types of agricultural waste to industry at remunerative prices. But given the technology available, a large chunk of the biofuel will have to come from the sugar sector for now. Therefore, pricing is the key. The government estimates that ethanol supply of around 150 crore litres in 2017-18 could save foreign exchange worth over Rs. 4,000 crore. The production of biofuels from agricultural waste, it is hoped, will also help curb atmospheric pollution by giving farmers an incentive not to burn it, as is happening in large parts of northern India.But policy should not get ahead of technological and financial feasibility  and options should be realistically laid out for farmers. There is also a need for caution in using surplus foodgrain to produce ethanol. And while removing the shackles on raw material supply can have definite benefits, it cannot make a significant difference to biofuel production as long as the supply-chain infrastructure that is required to deliver biofuels to the final consumer remains inadequate. To address this issue, the new policy envisages investment to the tune of Rs. 5,000 crore in building bio-refineries and offering other incentives over the next few years. The government should also take steps to remove policy barriers that have discouraged private investment in building supply chains. Until that happens, Indias huge biofuel potential will continue to remain largely untapped."

Subsequently, NMCs anti-encroachment squad removed the temporary sheds constructed in front the food joint.Dharampeth zones assistant municipal commissioner Mahesh Morone stated the restaurant was being illegally operated from a residential premises. The flat is registered in the name of one Meenakshi Kalra and has been given on rent to Yohan Doongaji. Doongaji reportedly converted the flat into a restaurant and made structural changes without any permission from the zone office.According to development control rules and Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, one cannot carry out commercial activity in a residential flat or an independent house, he said.It is not the first time that the zone office has taken action against The Bawas. In the past too, similar action was taken. At that time, the owner had assured to remove the illegal constructions on his own. Later he approached the district court. Recently, he lost the case following which on Tuesday, the anti-encroachment team led by assistant municipal commissioner Ashok Patil demolished the encroachments.The owner tried to seek more time claiming they had filed a revision petition in Mantralaya. Morone asked to see the stay order and as owner failed to produce it, the squad armed an excavator demolished the illegal construction.Other residents of the building have objected to running of eating joint there. Since its opening, traffic jams have increased as visitors park their vehicles on road because restaurant has no parking place of its own. On Saturdays and Sundays, it is difficult to move on the road from Jaika Motors to old VCA gate, which is a narrow lane, residents said.The restaurant owner showed many other violations carried out in the same apartments. Morone was informed about illegal extension by a lawyer and another office of JJ Construction (Sand and Steel suppliers), Brown Sugar and Anchal Boutique.During the drive, Jagadeesan Krishnamurthy, a resident of Utkarsh-Anuradha Apartments and other residents met Morone and pointed out that since 2006, the 150 flat owners here had complained over construction of kitchen in the basement of The Heritage Hotel. The kitchen is also located next to electrical transformer creating a hazard.Residents pointed out they had only one exit point and that is beside the hotel. If a fire erupted, they would've have no escape route. The residents around the hotel have lodged complaints with the authorities a number of times. When almost 150 residents from Prestige Apartments, Jaika Apartments, Hemchandra Apartments, Manav Apartments and Utkarsha Anuradha Apartments approached the civic bodys town planning department they got a reply confirming that the hotel had violated all norms.Morone assured them he would take action against all violations including the hotel and commercial usage of residential flats.

On Tuesday, opposition leader Dinesh Sharma said he intercepted a garbage vehicle (Chhota Hathi) in Thakkarbappanagar running on Route 11, which was filled with flower waste that came from a nearby school.The waste consisted of flower decorations and kitchen waste from a function at the school. I believe that instead of going door to door they go to specific places and collect waste in bulk and collect money from AMC. Sharma questioned the efficiency of the real-time GPS monitoring system of the AMC, which was to ensure transparency in garbage collection. A few weeks ago, standing committee chairman Praveen Patel , intercepted a vehicle collecting sugar biscuits (Patasha) from a food processing unit in Madhupura area instead of going door to door. Patel had taken the issue up with the last standing committee.Two months ago, the municipal commissioner pulled up zonal officers for being slack in monitoring garbage collection in North, East and West Zones. We are trying to bring more accountability to the system, says a senior official from the North Zone. He added, We have taken serious note of the issue. We are also introducing QR code system at every collection point. Staff will have to scan the QR codes with their mobiles, and only then will payments be made to them, the AMC official said.The third such instance was BJP councillor Jatin Patel, who has been lodging complaints with AMCs central office that nearly 50 societies in Ghatlodiya had complained that door to door garbage collection has been irregular in the area."

The documents also that the CPCB issued directions on May 5, 2016, to close down the two units located in district Gurdaspur until they installed online monitoring devices and provided the required connectivity to CPCB.The suspension of operation of these two units was revoked by the CPCB in November 2017 after the management of the company informed it had complied with the CPCB directives, which was verified by the anti-pollution body.In another letter dated August 1, 2017, the CPCB mentioned that Chadha Sugar and Industries Ltd had misrepresented facts pertaining to closure of their units till they commissioned 24X7 monitoring system networked with CPCB and Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB). While Chadha Sugars responded to CPCB saying they had closed their manufacturing, the CPCB Member Secretary, AB Akolkar, said that this contention was incorrect as the mill was shut down only after operating it during the crushing season. The letter notes that this was non-compliance of the closure direction given by CPCB and for which action as per law shall; be initiated separately.Earlier, the Chadha Sugar Mill and Industries had also been closed down in 2011 after it was found dumping effluents instead of treating its waste. The order to close the unit down was issued by Kahan Singh Pannu, the present Chairman of PPCB, who was the Chairman at that time too. However, Soon after he issued the order, he was transferred.Minister suspends officialsIn another move, Punjabs Environment Minister O P Soni has suspended the Executive Officer (XEN) Kuldeep Singh and SDO Amritpal Singh Chahal of Regional Environment Office at Batala in the case of molasses spill in Beas.Soni said that these officers did not properly monitor the area of Kirri Afghana, which falls in their jurisdiction, which is why the incident of molasses spillover has occurred from Chaddha Sugar Mill.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(PTI Photo) Office-bearers of the Samiti said they had given a call for farmers strike on last June 1 over demands, including complete farm loan waiver, minimum support price for farm produce, among others. (PTI Photo)In a move thats likely to hit markets across Maharashtra, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) has asked farmers to stop sending milk and vegetables to urban areas from June 7 unless the government accepts its demands. The demands include a complete farm loan waiver, minimum support price for farm produce, implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and the Forest Rights Act, among others.Ashok Dhawale, president of the Kisan Sabha, said they have decided to stop the supply as the government has failed to respond to the crisis in the dairy and agricultural sector. The government has failed to act on our demands. So, we carried out the farmers long march from Nashik to Mumbai. But the government hasnt done anything in the last three months on our demands, said Dhawale.Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of AIKS, said despite the excess production of tur, sugar and milk, the state government was importing these commodities. So, we will present the tur imported from Mozambique, sugar imported from Pakistan and milk imported from Gujarat and Karnataka to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on June 5, said Nawale. He said if the government failed to act on their demands, then we will urge the farmers to take matters into their own hands.  If the government still doesnt act, then we will do rasta roko across the state on June 10, he added.AIKS members said they have urged the protesting dairy farmers not to spill milk on the road and, instead, to distribute it free-of-cost to underprivileged members of the society.On the strike by the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh from Friday, the leaders clarified that they have extended their support to the strike since it was also on farmers issues. While theirs is a strike, ours is a protest we are carrying out a separate protest, said Nawale.Meanwhile, on the second day of the nation-wide farmers strike, milk collection in Pune fell by 10 per cent. Vishnu Hinge, chairman of the Pune Dairy Union, said they have noticed declining supplies from the talukas of Daund, Indapur and Ambegaon.The situation in Kolhapur, however, seemed to be unaffected by the strike. Vishwas Patil, chairman of the Kolhapur Milk Union, said they have not faced any issues with procurement.The Directorate of Marketing has set up a special cell to monitor the arrival of vegetables in the wholesale markets. Officials of the directorate said arrival of fresh produce has been close to normal. Directions have also been issued to market committees to ensure that they remain open for trading.While supply of fresh produce remained largely normal on Friday, Rajendra Shelke, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Vashi market, said arrivals had dipped slightly on Saturday.Sandeep Gidde, one of the coordinators of the strike in Maharashtra, said it has received support from the Maratha Kranti Morcha, the Aam Aadmi Party and the NCP. The protest is gathering momentum many of the protesting farmer were taken into custody in Sangli, Sangamner and other parts of the state, he said.(With inputs from Mumbai ENS)For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

He said the fiscal deficit had increased and projects had been stalled.The government estimates put GDP growth in the financial year 2017-18 at a four year low of 6.5%.Earlier on Friday, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram too had called out the government following the release of the first advance estimates of national income for 2017-18.Worst fears realisedThe worst fears of an imminent economic slowdown have come true, Mr Chidambaram said. Modi governments tall claims of India growing at a robust growth rate have evaporated in thin air. No amount of sugar coating, false bravado and rhetoric along with headlines management can conceal the stark reality.New project announcements have declined, fresh investment is low, informal sector is still reeling under the ill effects of demonetisation, job creation is abysmal, exports are plunging, , manufacturing sector growth has slowed down, agriculture sector has been hit hard and rural despair is abundant, Mr Chidambaram said.He wondered how the government would create jobs while the economy is slowing.Job creation remains the single biggest failure of this BJP government, he said.

A palm full of these nuts a day could help reduce blood pressure and improve the level of good cholesterol, a new study has found.The findings, published recently in peer-reviewed Journal of Nutrition, is based on a study of 300 people in Chennai with type-2 diabetes. Half of them were asked to consume 30 grams of unsalted, raw, broken cashew nuts a day. At the end of three months, various parameters were studied: their blood pressure  usually high among those with diabetes  had dropped by 5mm. Their high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, dubbed the good cholesterol, had increased by 2 milligram. There was no deleterious effect on the body weight or sugar levels.While studies across the world have shown the benefits of other nuts like almonds and walnuts, little has been done on cashews  considered a rich nut that adds flavor (and fat) to Indian curries and sweets.Nuts are rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fats (PUFA)  the good fats. Current Indian diets are high on carbohydrates  derived largely from polished rice and refined wheat  which account for 64% of total energy intake, and low on MUFAs, which provide just 7-8% of the total energy. The recommended intake is 15-20%.Dr V Mohan of Madras diabetes research foundation and lead author of the study said unlike other nuts, cashew has higher amount of saturated fats  the bad fats found in oily food, ghee and meat.Around 20% of the fat in cashew nut is of the saturated variety. We wanted to check if this type of saturated fat has an impact on cholesterol. It didnt, said Dr Mohan. He, however, cautioned that these nuts are beneficial only if taken in their raw form and not when added with salt and other spices, fried or roasted.Both the study groups were advised to follow, in addition to their medication, a standard diabetic diet of 1,400 calories, with 6065% of energy coming from carbohydrates, 1525% from fat, and the rest from protein. One half, who were asked to take 30 grams of cashew nuts a day either as a mid-morning or evening snack, had to reduce their carbohydrates intake to make the comparison even. Biochemical tests were done in both groups to ensure they followed the diet and the nuts were consumed.Participants in the intervention group (those who were given cashew nuts) had a 1.9-fold greater reduction in blood pressure compared to participants in the other group. Those in the former group also had a 16-fold greater increase in HDL cholesterol compared to the others.Past studies have also shown that including nuts in breakfast could improve satiety and reduce second meal consumption in adults. Researchers also found that every 100 grams of cashew nuts have 20 grams of proteins.This is crucial as Indians are traditionally low on proteins because of high vegetarian intake, said Dr Mohan.The study is significant as past research has found that nearly 80% of Asian Indian adults have dyslipidemia, largely driven by low HDL cholesterol concentrations. Among those with type-2 diabetes, 86% of males and 98% of females have been shown to have dyslipidemia.The study was funded by the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India and supported by the ministry of commerce. Dr Mohan, however, denied the council had any influence over their research. We had asked them to be prepared for both scenarios  where the end effect is beneficial or detrimental. Other authors of the study were from Harvard T Chan School of Public Health and Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Spain.India is one of the largest growers, consumers and exporters of cashew nuts. Excluding groundnuts, cashew nuts are more affordable compared to other nuts like walnuts. The nuts are grown mainly in the south and western states of Karnataka, Kerala, Goa and Maharashtra.The findings of the study arent surprising, considering recent studies have shown the benefits of fat, said Dr B Sesikeran, former director of the National Institute of Nutrition.People in the Mediterranean belt, for example, have the lowest incidence of coronary heart disease as their diet is rich in nuts, he said, adding that studies have shown that all nuts that grow on trees, like almonds, walnuts and pistachios did not increase body weight. But this has to be taken in measured quantity, he said."

They decided to pay the remaining price in the next instalments.Angry with the move, farmers' organisations have demanded action against those factories that do not pay the entire amount. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and MP Raju Shetti said, ""We are against this decision of sugar factory owners. We will have to consider a fresh agitation against this type of behaviour of sugar factories. Its course of action will be decided after I return Kolhapur from Delhi on February 9.""Raghunanth Patil, leader of the Shetkari Sanghatana, claimed that sugar factories always give various reasons to not to pay farmers their dues. ""That is why the government has made laws to punish them if they fail to pay farmers. We will intensify our agitation against sugar factories if they fail to pay our dues. We cannot stop cane crushing at present, but will pressurise the state government to implement rules against sugar factories if they fail to pay FRP,"" he said.At the start of the crushing season in November 2017, the farmers' organisations and sugar factory owners had agreed on new formula over the payment of fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugar cane purchase. This formula was decided on the basis of the market price of sugar then (Rs 3,600 per quintal). The sugar prices have since dropped to Rs 2,850 per quintal.""The factories have to consider average rate of sugar price in the market throughout the year and not the particular prices of the month of November or December. This is temporary fluctuation of market and will be corrected automatically,"" said Patil. A meeting of all the representatives of sugar factories from Kolhapur district was convened at the office of Kolhapur District Central Co-operative (KDCC) Bank last week.""We are bound to pay the price decided by the state government and during the meeting with farmers' leaders before the start of the cane crushing. Till now, we have paid the first instalment to cane producers as per formula, but now we will pay Rs 2,500 per tonne as first instalment from February 1. We will pay the remaining amount later,"" said a senior member, who was present in the meeting.P G Medhe, consultant to Rajaram cooperative sugar factory, Kolhapur said, ""The decision has been taken following the constant fall of sugar prices in the market. We are unable to sell sugar at the price that will give us at least its production cost after processing. We will pay farmers their dues after we get good price for sugar in the market."""

Without burdening the state exchequer, the local residents have come together to keep the town clean.The complete segregation of bio-degradable and non-bio-degradable waste, which has not even started in most parts of the state, has already been achieved and the garbage dump of the townwhich had led to several protests in the past by the residents of the neighbouring localityis now a stink free place. Further, cattle dung is now being used as catalyst to manage biodegradable waste.As many as 100 pits have been constructed for managing biodegradable waste where layers of such waste are covered with alternate layers of cattle dung. The level of these pits-- initially filled to the brim -- are now decomposing and carbon dioxide is being let out using perforated plastic pipes.There are 32 specially-designed cycle rickshaws and 10 motorcycle-rickshaws ply in town collecting degradable and non-degradable waste in separate compartments. Nawanshahr municipal committee president Lalit Mohan Pathak, who is spearheading the cleanliness drive, personally supervises solid waste management at micro-level. He has fundraised for these rickshaws using sponsorship from local residents and business people. We are constructing 50 more pits and each pit takes 10 tons of green waste, he said.It is satisfying to see that things have improved a lot in the last couple of months and our financial contribution to the project has become part of the mission, said Umesh Sareen , a local businessman who donated five cycle-rickshaws.With MC president and councillors involving people in the project through contributions, awareness regarding segregation of waste is also increasing among the people, said Rajwant Singh , a local resident.We have got gloves, uniforms sponsored from Rotary Club while 150 pairs of green and blue waste bins have been sponsored by the local co-operative sugar mill, the MC chief said.Nawanshahr Sewa Society, specially set up to manage the waste management project, is responsible for collecting and spending funds. The Society collects monthly charges from households and commercial establishments according to the quantum of waste they produce and these collections are being used to meet expenses and pay salaries to the 55 workers engaged by the Society, Pathak said.Apart from the pits at the dumping site, pits for managing bio-degradable waste have also been made in all schools, colleges and the vegetable market. We did not spend a penny from municipal funds and got these sponsored, Pathak said.Earlier the vegetable market used to stink a lot but now after these pits have been made and waste is being managed properly, conditions have improved, said Sandeep, who has his vend in the vegetable market.The feedback being given by the workers engaged in waste collection is also interesting. The poor households are more cooperative as they give segregated waste while we still face issues from well-off households who pack everything in one carry bag and then we segregate. Almost 70% households have improved in terms of waste segregation, said Sonu, a worker.Waste is once again segregated after bringing it to the dump and we ensure that all non-biodegradable elements are removed before making a layer of the green waste, said Rajinder Khosla , who supervises the work at the pits.We have also got removed over 500 trolley-loads of waste from different plots in the town, said the MC president.Nawanshahr has taken the lead in implementing our project and the way things have been done it has become a model and now this would be replicated in each and every town, said Ajoy K Sharma, CEO of Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company, a state-run body. Now we are working on a de-centralized plan to manage waste and local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu has also pushed the idea, he said."

This was revealed in a research conducted by the Xavier Institute of Management , Bhubaneswar, which published the article in the latest edition of British Food Journal.Easy availability of soft drinks in college canteens and hostel messes has been a reason for consumption of soft drinks followed by restaurants and supermarkets. Besides, youth drink soft drinks mainly for pleasant feeling in their mouth, the survey said.The objective of the research was to examine the consumption patterns and attitude towards soft drinks among Indian youth. The findings reflect increasing awareness for health and healthy food and drinks among Indian youths. A shift among urban consumers towards low sugar beverages has already forcing companies to launch newer and healthier products and this trend will continue in days to come, said Niraj Kumar, faculty member, rural management, XIMB, who conducted the research.The survey was done among 300 youths between the age group of 18 to 30 years in different institutes across India. Among the respondents 67% were male and 93% were graduates.Among the frequent users, diet soft drinks were consumed the most while, in the case of less frequent consumers, fruit juices were consumed the most, the survey revealed. The study strongly indicated that if healthy drinks are made available and marketed as the appropriate substitute of carbonated sugary drinks, consumers may shift their preferences towards the healthier drinks, Kumar added. He conducted the study jointly with Subhajyoti Ray, faculty member, XIMB.Youths mostly consumed soft drinks as a separate drink item and not as a substitute for any other drink or meal. Soft drinks were the most common option for those who did not drink or did not want to consume alcohol, the survey said.Most of the respondents said soft drink consumption was least affected by their parents consumption and their home environment and they have been consuming soft drinks since childhood and did not remember when they started, it added.The findings reflect increasing awareness for health and healthy food and drinks among Indian youths.A shift among urban consumers towards low sugar beverages has already forcing companies to launch newer and healthier products and this trend will continue in days to come. The government and agencies encouraging consumption of healthy foods and drinks may work on the policy issues like, limiting the selling of carbonated soft drinks within the academic institutions, taxing carbonated sugary drinks and educating adolescents and youth about the benefits of healthy substitutes, said Kumar."

Influential people cornered benefits in the lakhs in the old scheme, with amounts even crossing Rs 40 lakh in some cases. So, the Fadnavis government decided to bring in stringent rules while launching the Rs 34,022 crore loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers.A senior bureaucrat told TOI on Thursday that high-ranking officials of the cooperation, finance and information technology departments as well as bank nominees studied the 2008-09 loan waiver schemes before finalising the rules for beneficiaries.The cooperation department found that a veteran NCP legislator, along with his entire family comprising seven members, was granted the benefit of the loan waiver scheme. In addition, a senior NCP legislator, a former Congress legislator and heads of the cooperative institutions were major beneficiaries under the old scheme.The NCP legislator and his family received a benefit of Rs 1.6 lakh, while a chairman of a cooperative society received a benefit of Rs 38 lakh, another head of a cooperative sugar factory received a benefit of Rs 37.17 lakh and a former panchayat samiti head got a benefit of Rs 10.91 lakh. In certain cases, the amount was more than Rs 40 lakh. One rich family even received a Rs 50 lakh benefit. The loan waiver scheme was drafted for small, marginal and poor farmers, but it was observed that rich politicians took most of the benefit while poor and marginal farmers were ignored, the bureaucrat said.In the 2008-09 schemes, the main criterion was land area  farmers with under five acres would benefit, mainly to halt suicides. Since a large number of suicides was reported in Vidarbha and Marathwada, it was expected that farmers from these regions will be benefited by the decision of the government. However, 24.1 lakh poor farmers out of 69 lakh were deprived of the loan waiver scheme, since their land holding was more than five acres, the official said.The bureaucrat said that for the new scheme it was decided that sitting and former ministers, legislators, MPs, members of the ZPs, pensioners, income tax payers (other than from farm income), persons with income over Rs 3 lakh, office-bearers of cooperative societies and agriculture produce market committees, and government employees would not be considered for the loan waiver scheme.The official said the Rs 1.5 lakh ceiling was fixed after much home-work, as it was found that 82% of loans were up to Rs 1.5 lakh and 6.45% between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh."

Walking up to sacred Shiva shrines offering water, honey, milk and even sugar cane juice on the Shivlinga are some of the activities that take place.Prayers are offered with the faith and hope that Shiva would redeem them from the life cycle. So fasting for 24 hours, carrying water and tridents to be offered at temples, doing night long rudra abhisheks, are all performed to appease the lord.Visit to a temple is a must as Shiva worship is usually performed at community level, says Prabodh Vekhende who studies scriptures.Carrying water to Shiva temples, observing Shiva Parvati wedding and performing abhisheks are all done in groups as Shiva was an ascetic and Parvati, his consort, tried hard to make him a householder to gain knowledge from him, says Vekhende.In city, lakhs of devotees throng to Kalyaneshwar temple in Mahal and at Jagnath Budhwari along with Kalyaneshwar temple in Telangkhedi to worship. Devotees start queuing up from as early as 3am for darshan, says developer Ashutosh Shewalkar whose family took over the temple decades back. The Shivlinga in the temple is considered jagrut.I believe when so many people enter the sanctum with pious and good thoughts and offer worship with good faith they leave behind a lot of positive energy which fills the temple with good vibrations, he says. Over 30,000 devotees visit the temple during the day and partake the mahaprasad prepared by the authorities.The ironsmiths in Itwari deliver innumerable trishuls to devotees. A symbol of Shiva, this divine weapon is made in different sizes especially for Shivratri. Offering a weapon to god is considered auspicious. Many do it after a wish is fulfilled, says Ramesh Kowade , a third generation ironsmith.Even at private temples built by individuals, prayers are offered the entire night. We will be performing laghu rudra puja at the temple which will go on till 4.00am, says Vivek Sisodia a farmer whose family built a small Shiva temple on his farm at Chatikhapa in 1963.A lot of snakes come out around the temple on Shivaratri day which has made this temple very famous in around Nagpur, says Sisodia.He makes arrangements for over 2000 devotees who come from Nagpur to offer worship. We organize mahaprasad and provide fruits and other foods that are eaten during fast, he says."

Most of us suffer from Central Obesity, which we call as beer belly. It is rapidly on the rise in India, he said.Lakdawala underlined the cause of adolescent obesity to excess sugar in food. He said, There is sugar in all forms. Even milk powder has 40% sugar, which is disguised under names such as malt syrup solids or corn syrup liquids. India is third among top five fat countries of the world. America tops the list, followed by China. We are second in the number of diabetics. If we merge both of them, there are a lot of people who suffer from diabesity.According to the Disease Control Centre of America , 40 types of cancer are linked to obesity, he added.Prevention, he said, is the solution to obesity. Losing weight should start from school, where a childs health is linked to his or her marks.
