When this was not implemented, Dadi Suryaprakash Rao and 59 other employees filed a plea in the Hyderabad High Court.Justice P Naveen Rao who heard the matter directed the state of AP in April 2017 to pay the dues to the retired employees immediately. When this order too was ignored, the aggrieved employees filed a contempt plea. The judge summoned Visakhapatnam joint collector G Srijana, asking her to be present before the court on February 2.What made him unhappy was the reason cited by Srijana in her plea filed before the HC seeking exemption from appearance. A private programme meant for women entrepreneurs was to be held in Vizag on that day and the JC cited this as a reason for her inability to appear in court, PB Vijay Kumar, the counsel for the petitioners told the court.The judge then imposed a penalty of Rs 2,000 on the JC and directed her to be present in court on February 8, on which day Srijana appeared in court and paid the penalty. The AP counsel sought six weeks time to implement the order."

However, Madurai is unique in that it is congested round-the- clock, even at midnight. Majormarkets and commercial hubs operating in the heart of the city keep it humming with traffic all through the day, leaving the city congested. Madurai is the market for the entire southern Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Kerala. In fact, some of the markets are over a century old -- the central vegetable market was started 115 years ago -- and so were the other markets for fruits, flowers, onion and provisions like foodgrains. A century ago, they were started on a small scale with just a couple of shops which quickly grew in proportion.Markets apart, commercial establishments mushroomed in the city over the period, turning every street into a hub of some product or other. One would find serene residential buildings used as shops or for stocking the products. For instance, the famous house at West Masi Street, where Mahatma Gandhi changed his attire to that of a common Indian peasant during his visit in September 1921 is an outlet of a handloom store, and most of this house now lies in a dilapidated condition.The popular demand is that the markets must go out of the city and be stationed on the outskirts. As the demand grew louder, there were efforts to move out major markets, and some really materialised. The central vegetable market, which used to operate near Meenakshi temple on the old prison premises for over 115 years, was moved to Mattuthavani during 2010-11. Ahead of the shift, the flower market which was operating close by was moved to Agricultural Marketing Committee campus in 2006.However, Madurai still reels under congestion because other major markets like fruit market at Yanaikal, fish market at Karimedu and the onion traders at East Marret Street are yet to be moved out of city. ""The wholesale markets have to move out of the city. Most of the wholesale traders stock their goods inside the city. For instance, 80 trucks come inside the city to transact sugar alone"", says Madurai Lorry Owners Association president C Sathiah.Some of the associations have moved their establishments anticipating this situation. The grains market at Sikkantharchavadi by was established by Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2012. ""Though most of the grain merchants moved their warehouses numbering 250 to the outskirts, the sales happen here because traders feel that they may lose business if they go out. When the entire market moves out, the business too will move out eventually. The issue here is, there is little pressure from authorities to move the markets outside the city"", opined the chambers senior president, S Rethinavelu.The proposals to move fruit market and fish market are in the pipeline with places identified at Mattuthavani and Virattipathu respectively. Most of the works have been completed for fruit market but the fish market ran into trouble. ""Local people are opposing the proposal to move the fish market"", quipped L Sundaram, president of Karimedu Commission Fish Vendors Association. Though the vendors who moved out of the city have no big complaints, they feel that staying inside city has got its own benefits. ""The retail sale of customers buying flowers at dawn or dusk dwindled because they have to come a long distance. We used to enjoy this last leg of sales, when customers pick flowers on their way home"", said A V E Kesavan, a flower merchant.There is also pressing demand from traders to create adequate facilities on these market premises which were moved out. ""We still dont have any cold storage to preserve vegetables and adequate room for maneuvering trucks. The original lot of 27 acres allotted by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa when she assumed charge first in 1991, is yet to be put to use"", said P S Murugan , president of Mattuthavani Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association.For the common commuters inside the city, it will be a great relief if markets are moved out. ""It is very difficult to negotiate the traffic congestion in Madurai because we have to traverse through these markets and commercial hubs. ,"" B Rabikraja from Ismai lpuram added."

Eight persons have been arrested so far in connection with the racket that has brought to the fore vulnerability of government in securing the storing biometric data of common citizens.After learning about the scam using biometric data, I checked the details of my ration card and found purchases from FPS in Rikadiya done in name of my maternal grandparents using biometric thumb impression. How can one make purchase in name of persons who had died so many years ago. Police need to probe how the purchases were validated using thumb impressions, said Gondaliya, who runs textile weaving unit in Surat. His family has donated Rs 40 lakh for various developmental work in their native village.However, Amreli district administration also could not explain how the purchases were validated. We have initiated an inquiry into the matter as it has come to our notice that there are two ration cards issued to the family and both were in use, deputy collector, Amreli, V M Prajapati said. Prajapati, however, could not explain how the purchases were made using the thumb impression of the person who died two decades ago.Sources in the police said this case indicated that forged data was being used to add beneficiaries under the NFSA. They said name of dead people could have been included with thumb impression of some local person while forming the database.It has come to our knowledge that attempts are being made to remove the biometric authentication system for sale from FPS. Biometric authentication should not be removed, but it should be made more foolproof, an RTI activist Ajay Jangid said."

According to a trader in Anakapalli, Kandregula Satyanarayana, a majority of businessmen from West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar place orders from Anakapalli NTR jaggery market. But now, they are giving priority to UP and Maharashtra markets because of low prices when compared to Anakapalli market, he said.The first quality jaggery is priced at Rs 2,400 for 100 kg in Maharashtra and Rs 2m200 in Uttar Pradesh whereas the same kind of jaggery here is Rs 3,100. The difference of price is Rs 600 to Rs 800. Traders of other states which are traditional buyers of Anakapalli market are now placing orders at UP or Maharashtra, one of the businessmen of the jaggery market P Raghu said. He added that the farmers are not sending the jaggery lumps to the market after dip in prices.Not only this, Anakapalli jaggery lumps are in between 15 kg to 17 kg whereas UP, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been manufacturing smaller lumps. When the crop infections or fungal infections were showed their impact, farmers of Yalamanchili, Madugula and Chodavaram Assembly Constituency limits are now transporting the sugarcane to sugar factories. This has shown impact on jaggery making and also reducing the volume, trader Malla Satyanarayana told TOI.He further said that usually the market witnesses around 30,000 lumps everyday in January and February months because of festival season and also marriages season. But now the volume has not crossed 20,000 lumps a day so far."

The sleuths raided offices of the companies spread across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, including those where the former minister's son, Rana Inder Partap, is a stake-holder.The 25 locations include homes and offices of businessman Sanjit Randhawa and chartered accountant firm Kansal Singla & Associates. Some 250-odd I-T officials, apart from a large number of police officials, are involved in the raids which started at 8 amsimultaneously at all locations. All attempts to contact Gurjit failed.Soon after the Congress government took over in Punjab in 2017, Amit Bahadur, Gurjit's former cook, had bagged the contract for a sand mine at Saidpur Khurd village in Nawanshahr with a bid of Rs 26.51 crore. Three other former employees of Gurjit's firm Rana Sugars Ltd had successfully bid for mines worth Rs 4.11 crore, Rs 9.21 crore and Rs 10.58 crore. This had led to allegations that all four were fronts for Gurjit who had allegedly sponsored them. Gurjit, however, insisted that he had nothing to do with his ex-employees.Some of the companies that were raided include Rana Sugars, Rana Polycot and Rajbir Enterprises. When contacted, Income Tax department's principal director Parneet Sachdev refused to give details.The department had started investigating the alleged scam in July 2017 and initially sought bank account details and the source of money deposited by Gurjit's four ex-employees - Kulwinder Paul, Balraj Singh, Gurvinder Singh and Bahadur from Punjab government. It had also sought details about the quarries they had invested in.Investigations had revealed that a common source had deposited the money in bank accounts of all four ex-employees of the minister. Following the development, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had set up Justice Narang Commission to probe the scam and it had given a clean chit to Gurjit.On January 5, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued summons to Gurjit's son for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) after he allegedly raised $ 18 million by floating foreign shares. The minister had finally resigned from the cabinet on January 16.Gurjit, who is Kapurthala MLA, was the richest candidate in fray in the Punjab assembly elections held in Fubruary 2017. He, along with his wife, had immovable assets worth Rs 169.88 crore in 2017. Known to be close to Amarinder, the 61-year-old businessman-turned-politician has interests in distilleries, sugar mills and solar power. He owns distilleries and sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh as well."

She is on lent , and when she tried to think of the one habit that should be probably abstain from till Easter, she could easily identify eating out. I stay in a hostel and there is generally a tendency to spend a lot of time and money on restaurant food, among hostelites. We either eat from outside, or starve. Its a habit thats tough to give up and its not easy on our pocket or health either. Thats why I felt I should challenge it, through the holy period of lent, Jacquelin says.While the basic idea of lent is self-denial and giving up luxuries to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus, most often its just equated to staying away from non-vegetarian food. However, many among the millennials, who care to observe lent, now take it as a time to challenge themselves to stay away from habits, which they know, arent good for them in the long run. Earlier, I had tried to stay away from sweets and television and thanks to lent, I am not obsessed with them anymore. Thats why I tried to take the route again, to curb my unhealthy eating habit as well, Jacquelin says.Mary Antony, who works as a stylist, is abstaining from something that she says she is totally nuts about  wearing nail polish! There have been times when I styled my nails even twice a week  from changing the colours to shapes; its been something I was crazy about. As thats what I love the most, I guess it qualifies to be my choice of abstinence for lent, she says.Its an often mocked fact that our homemakers cannot simply stay away from their daily dose of sitcoms. Well, a few are planning to challenge that during the period of lent. Sonia Cherian from Kochi says she has decided to turn her face away from soap operas. Though I have not been a serial addict, a few of them have become hard to stay away from. I dont know how far I would be able to execute my decision to not check them out during lent, but I feel its something worth trying, she says. In the same vein, many quote social media, constant checking of cell phones and overuse of technology as things they want to stay away from. Techie Chris Thomson says, I am planning to give up the constant chatting via online messengers. I happened to use an app to track my phone usage and lately, the duration it shows has been shockingly high. I felt that lent would be a good time to convince myself about the need to curb this.Meanwhile Issac Sunny, a media professional, has bid goodbye to two of his obsessions  watching movies and having rice! I am hoping that staying away from movies should be easier, as compared to saying no to rice! Its definitely a big temptation for me but its time I learnt to check it, he says.Staying away from sugar is high on priority on the list of many lent observers and for them, it's as detailed as having tea or coffee without sugar to putting on a brave face in front of all things sweet. Priya Joseph, a techie, says, ""I used to be a compulsive snacker at office and even had a 'snack rack' at my workspace which was always filled with edible stuff. I am abstaining from baking too, which I hope will help me cut down further on sugar. Another major point is abstinence from eating the leftovers at home. This may seem funny, but it's a fact and I guess it would help many moms like me to try it during lent.""How many of them would be able to continue the new practices, post lent? It might not be always easy to curb it forever, Chris says, adding, However, lent is an opportunity to try anyway. Most often, the habit will at least not come back with the same intensity and will leave you having more control over your unhealthy obsessions."

These mills have piled up Rs 2,230 crore arrears for the current crushing season and the amount is likely to rise in the next few months, say industry insiders.There are 184 sugar mills operational in the state this year most of which belong to politicians. Of the 136 mills hauled up for not paying farmers the pre decided Fair Remunerative Price (FRP), 97 are cooperative and 83 are privately owned. Sugar commissionerate officials said a total FRP of Rs 12,813 crore was to be paid to farmers, of which Rs 10,775 crore has been paid. The FRP is the minimum price mills have to pay farmers.Mill owners say the sugar prices in the open markets have dipped considerably this year leaving them saddled with huge stocks due to which they have not been able to pay the farmers. But officials say FRP is not related to market conditions. Officials also said that sugar prices were picking up due to policy interventions by the central government like increasing import duty and capping mill level sugar sales two weeks ago. Currently, sugar prices are ranging between Rs 2,850 and Rs 3,000 per quintal a far cry from the Rs 3,600 levels of November. The FRP is Rs 255 per ton of sugarcane with 9.5% sugar content.Farmers have decided to stage a protest if payments are not made soon. The market is controlled by mill owners. They will tweak it the way they want for own benefit, said MP Raju Setti who is also the chief of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana.

There was nothing for the Start-ups or industrial growth in it. The budget was filled with populist schemes.The budget had been drawn up with an eye on the forthcoming Assembly elections. It is a White Paper on promises, which are hardly going to be fulfilled. The government could have announced some concession for the Start-ups, he said.Satyanarayana Udupa Japti, general secretary of the district unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, said that the budget was a mixed bag for the farmers in the State. Though some of the schemes appeared to be good, there was not much clarity on them.But the budget was a disappointing one for the farmers of Udupi district. There was nothing in the budget on either expediting the Varahi Irrigation Project or for reviving the ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory, both of which were important for the farmers here, he said. The reactions of the political parties were on expected lines. Bhaskarrao Kidiyoor, spokesperson of the district unit of the Congress, said that the budget had given importance to correcting the regional imbalances and laid emphasis on rural development and irrigation. It had also given importance to e-governance. The farmers had received a good deal in the budget, he said.However, Mattar Ratnakar Hegde, president of the district unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), termed it a directionless budget. There was no provision for a complete loan waiver of farmers in it. There was nothing in it for the fisheries sector. Education and healthcare sectors had been neglected. The budget has failed to meet the expectations of the people. If the BJP came to power in the State, it will have to present a new budget, he said.Yogish Shetty, president of district unit of Janata Dal (Secular), said that there was no provision for full waiver of loans of farmers in the budget. There was nothing in the budget for the coastal districts.This is an election-eve gimmick budget and lacked any value. The new government after the elections will present another budget, he said."

The fact that the cotton cultivation had doubled, though small in numbers, when compared to other districts, he hoped it would improve in the coming years. When a farmer Santhanam from Velichanatham village near Chatrapatti (Madurai-Natham Road) raised the issue of non-functioning of street lights in his village, the Collector asked for more details.The farmer said that out of 52 street lights, only three were functioning. Complaints to all levels in the local bodies had not fetched any desired results, he said.The Collector directed the panchayat officials to visit the hamlet in the evening and get the problem rectified. When The Hindu contacted Mr. Santhanam at 9.45 p.m., he said that no official turned up to the village despite the Collectors order.When a majority of the farmers complained about non-desilting of canals and the encroachments, the PWD officials said that they had been doing it periodically.When the farmers asked about the status of the 58-canal project, Mr. Veera Raghava Rao said that it would be completed by March-end.I assure you (farmers) that during the next meeting, a power-point presentation would be done here and the officials too maintained that 97 % work was over, when he asked them... When the sugarcane growers wanted to know about settlement of arrears to the tune of Rs. 20 crore from the cooperative sugar mills, the Collector said he would let them know after having a word with the government."

However, the more worrisome fact is that half the population living with diabetes has absolutely no knowledge of it. This is intriguing when we consider the several innovations in health care taking place around the world.At present, American biopharmaceutical researchers are developing over 170 types of medication for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and related disorders such as diabetic neuropathy and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, there is a relentless global drive to invent fresh, life-saving and life-improving treatments to counter diabetes, apart from paying close attention to the attendant costs. These advancements are not only changing the way researchers and doctors are approaching diabetes treatment but are also having an enormous potential impact to helping people live longer and healthier lives.However, our government has a long way to go in order to integrate world innovation with health policies and tackle an epidemic such as diabetes. This is pertinent as the countrys productive segment of the population its youth  is increasingly being exposed to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which translates into prolonged treatment cycles or premature death. Thus, without a proper policy to integrate global innovation into the Indias health-care realm, the nations development is in jeopardy.Seize the opportunityGlobal innovation in Indian health care is critical to our future. For people living with diabetes, nearly every aspect of their life gets affected. This includes special dietary concerns and the necessary lifestyle alterations, along with daily medicines and regular check-ups. At the same time, there are multiple global innovations that have come into place in recent times and capable of improving the quality of patients lives.For the past 15 years, insulin delivery methods have progressed, from ordinary vials and syringes, to insulin pens and a sensor-augmented pump therapy. Some of the recent, incredible innovations in this space include a wireless glucose monitor that can send blood sugar data to a smart phone, an insulin pen that can tell you when the last dose was administered to you, and an artificial pancreas system that utilises algorithm-based logic on a smart phone to automatically deliver appropriate levels of insulin.In essence there is a huge opportunity to introduce new global innovations in our country and bring about a positive change in the lives of those with diabetes.Medical innovation and intellectual property rights (IPR) also go hand in hand. Health care is one of the few sectors that calls for ongoing investment and persistent research, innovation and development. This is because delivering pioneering medicines to tackle the ever-increasing occurrence of new diseases, is central to health care and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, a robust world-class IPR policy, and a system that ensures enforcement of that policy is of paramount importance in the Indian health-care environment and the management of diseases such as diabetes.While there are numerous medicines under development for the disease, the clamour for a strong IPR in the country needs more intensity if we are to fortify our efforts to tackle diabetes. A United Nations report of 2016 says that diabetes and cardiovascular diseases may cost the Indian economy a colossal $6.2 trillion (Rs. 400 lakh crore) in the 2012-2030 period. It also warns of a rampant increase in cases in countries such as India, where urbanisation is growing. A new IHS Markit report, titled The clinical and economic benefits of better treatment of adult medicaid beneficiaries with diabetes, finds unequivocally that better diabetes management saves money and improves patient outcomes.In short, integrating global innovation with the help of a powerful IPR might be the only effective pill we have in applying the brakes on the burgeoning threat that diabetes poses.Dr. Vishwanath Mohan is Chairman and Chief Diabetologist, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre"

We can check a patients blood pressure and, with the addition of a glucometer, record his blood sugar level too. We have used it in more than 500 to 600 patients so far, says Dr. Mohan Rajan, Medical Director at the hospital.Non-invasiveVinCense can be clipped to the wearers finger and connected to a wearable devvice, such as a wrist watch, using a wire. The pulse and respiratory rates, skin temperature and oxygen saturation are recorded. The readings are sent via Bluetooth to a mobile app, and stored on cloud-based servers. The equipment has been in use for the past year in select private hospitals in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Doctors who have used it say it spells relief from invasive and inaccurate readings that crop up when lab technicians monitor these parameters.A year ago, the emergency medicine department at M.S. Ramaiah Hospital, Bengaluru came forward (through its hospital outreach programme called Heart Rescue India) to test the equipment. Later, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT M) joined in and developed algorithms for the equipment that can be employed in broader public health programmes and screen for more vital parameters. Currently, third party devices are incorporated into the platform.The challenge was in developing an algorithm for testing glucose level. In another three or four months we will incorporate measurement of cardiac output and haemoglobin level, says M. Manivannan, Head, Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT M, whose team wrote the algorithm.MedIoTek Health Systems developed the hardware for VinCense. The firms Managing Director, Sharmila Devadoss, says the idea of making health care affordable came from watching her father, an orthopaedic surgeon in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. We could see the gaps in health care which was a motivating factor, she says.We used it in our outreach programme. Apart from other parameters, we would like to add height also. As per World Health Organisation criteria we classify patients as low, moderate and high risk. The measurements are transferred through Bluetooth so there is no tampering with data. We are also able to give a printout to those who are being screened, says Dr. Aruna C. Ramesh, Pogramme Director, Heart Rescue India.Looking aheadProf. Manivannan says the collaboration would lead to algorithms for medical simulation [being] applied to wireless health monitoring systems. The outcome of this collaboration could lead to early intervention, reducing risks and complications and improving clinical outcomes.Going ahead, the equipment will help monitor patients in post-operative care, who usually need more attention. It can also be used in a rehabilitation setting to step down care,(for patients in the intensive care unit) identify vulnerable patients, track newly-discharged ones and also patients in an ambulance.sujatha.r@thehindu.co.in"

In The Written World: How Literature Shaped History , Martin Puchner, a professor of literature at Harvard University, lays out a thesis that is difficult to contest: Literature isnt just for book lovers. Ever since it emerged four thousand years ago, it has shaped the lives of most humans on planet Earth. Taking in its sweep the invention of paper, the alphabet, movable type, etc., the book examines certain foundational texts. But this is more than a textual analysis  and as he travels across continents, Puchner manages to give his inquiry feisty shape. Beyond the recap, the book is a nudge to go about looking for foundational stories in the lay of the land and the conversations in places we visit, in the way theyve changed lives.Pillow booksThere is Alexander of Macedonia, for instance, going around his campaigns to conquer Asia and making sure he kept three objects under his pillow every night: The first was a dagger. Next to the dagger, Alexander kept a box. And inside the box, he placed the most precious of the three objects: a copy of his favourite text, the Iliad . The dagger was to escape his fathers fate of being assassinated, the box had belonged to Darius, and the book because it was the story through which he saw his campaign and life.In the chapter on the Buddha, Confucius, Socrates and Jesus, Puchner tries to find an explanation for the emergence of these teachers, for how each of these pivotal figures had in common the fact that they did not write: Instead they insisted on gathering students around them and teaching them through dialogue, talking face-to-face.And after he has written about the first great novel in world literature, more than a thousand years ago, The Tale of Genji by a Japanese woman (Murasaki Shikibu), about One Thousand and One Nights , about the Gutenberg revolution, he introduces Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (of Don Quixote ) as the first modern author: It was with Cervantes that the features of modern authorship, from the printing press and a market for literature to ownership, plagiarism, and literary piracy, came together as never before.Once something resembling modern publishing got underway, familiar anxieties would wrack the reading public. Were popular romances suitable reading? Were novels addictive? In fact, if you are of a certain age, youd understand when Puchner reminds the reader that the suspicion about novels has disappeared only recently, as anxieties about impressionable brains being dulled and attention spans being shrunk have moved to screens, with video games and social media being seen as the new intoxicants. Whats next, Puchner asks, Will there be a time when we will look back at the Internet with nostalgia the way many now look back longingly at the age of the novel?The most riveting portion on the power of storytelling is on Derek Walcott, the West Indian poet who won the Nobel Prize in 1992 and passed away a year ago. Based on a visit to Walcotts home in St. Lucia in 2011 to discuss his epic poem Omeros, Puchner takes the post-colonial effusion of writing to its extreme to explore how a societys first foundational texts come about in our day and age: Unlike many other former colonies with ancient literary traditions, St. Lucia had little literature before Walcotts works. With the native population wiped out within two centuries after the arrival of European colonists, and the forced importation of slaves from Africa to work the sugar plantations, the islands purpose was agricultural, not cultural. Walcott was, for all intents and purposes, the islands first writer of note [He] had managed to single-handedly write his postcolonial nation into world literature.Being in St. Lucia to meet the great writer is its recommendation; at the plantation where Puchner is staying, the manager offers him free drinks when he hears of the appointment. In the capital, Castries, locals have refused to call the central square by its British-given name Columbus Square, and name it after Walcott, who had managed the feat of translating a place, a culture, and a language into literature for the first time.Stopping at JaipurThese travels through history and canons come to a stop at the Jaipur Literature Festival. The year is 2014, and the gathering is still being interrogated for its handling of the proposed visit of Salman Rushdie (you can count on JLF to reflect the freedom-of-expression battle of the moment, with the Central Board of Film Certification chief withdrawing himself from attendance now in 2018, after the Karni Senas violent threat-making). But Puchners takeaway is all good, this enthusiasm for literature among the tens of thousands gathered is a good antidote to worries about the future of reading and writing. Literature will continue to draw us into new communities and conversations, no matter what new anxiety may take over the publishing and reading public."

Moreover, women with GDM and their children are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.Hema Divakar, Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) ambassador to International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), who is one of the contributors to the guidelines, told The Hindu on Thursday that the focus was on making the original guidelines released in 2014 implementable and feasible in the Indian context.Pointing out that the original guidelines were implemented with great difficulty in Hoshangabad of Madhya Pradesh on a pilot basis, she said there were several logistical issues and the health workers found it difficult to test all pregnant women. But every time they came across a hurdle, it was resolved to ensure it is implemented, she said.Hoshangabad trialBased on Hoshangabad experience, we felt there is an urgent need to prevent and minimise maternal and foetal morbidity associated with GDM. The revised guidelines strengthen the provision of universal screening and management of GDM as part of the essential antenatal package, she said. The report also underlines post-delivery testing.Apart from this, the new guidelines provide for creating a cadre of healthcare providers for medical nutritional threrapy and inclusion of oral drugs like metformin for control of sugar.At the primary health centre, the medical officer should initiate treatment and refer pregnant women with GDM to a higher centre if blood sugar levels are not controlled or there is some other complication, the guidelines said.According to the guidelines, States are free to choose the number of districts where the programme will be implemented initially, however all districts should be be covered in a phased manner.There is an urgent need to prevent and minimise maternal and foetal morbidityHema DivakarGynaecologist"

Sampath Kumar, senior consultant and Head, Department of Nephrology, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC). Proactive screening was necessary for early diagnosis of the disease.Speaking to the media here on Wednesday ahead of the World Kidney Day observed by The International Society of Nephrology and other organisations, he said that a variant of CKD was found among rural population.New typeIt is called CKDu as the exact cause is not known. Study of cases over the years has indicated that it is multifactorial. Different factors such as prolonged exposure to hot weather, dehydration due to water scarcity or distaste of water due to hardness, hard manual labour and consumption of alcohol cause the disease.Pointing out that CKD was a silent disease that either shows no symptom or mimics the symptoms of other diseases like heart-related ailments, he said that regular health screening with urine and blood analysis was needed to detect the disease. It affected around 10 to 17 % of the population and the number of patients requiring advanced treatment like dialysis or kidney transplantation was around 65,000 in Tamil Nadu. Only 10 % of those in need undergo dialysis and only 1 % of those in need go for transplantation, he said.The World Kidney Day coincided with the International Womens Day, Dr. Sampath Kumar said and added that women were worst affected when it came to kidney-related diseases since societal issues affect their access to basic medical care, dialysis or transplantation.R. Ravichandran, senior consultant and Head, Department of Urology, MMHRC, highlighted the proactive steps a person can take to reduce the risk of kidney-related ailments, which included controlling of blood sugar and high blood pressure, eating more fruits and vegetables, drinking enough water to produce around 2 to 2.5 litre of urine a day and avoid excessive use of over-the-counter pain killers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."

Launched in February, they make screening for GDM in pregnant women universal. All women who visit an ante natal clinic during their term will now have to be tested.The first test, which involves orally administering 75g of glucose solution, should be done during first contact as early as possible in the pregnancy. If negative, the second test should be done during 24-28 weeks of pregnancy. It is important to ensure the second test as many pregnant women develop blood sugar intolerance during this period (24-28 weeks), the document notes. Moreover, only one third of GDM positive women are detected during first trimester.The conditionGDM is defined as Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Worldwide, one in 10 pregnancies is associated with diabetes, 90% of which are GDM. It increases the risk to pregnant women and newborns and leads to poor pregnancy outcomes, says Union Health Secretary, Preeti Sudan, in the foreword to the new guidelines. She adds that while access to antenatal care has increased, universal screening for GDM has not yet been operationalised across the country, bringing focus and urgency to an issue that needs to be tackled at the womb.It is now accepted across the world that pregnant women need to be tested irrespective of their age, weight, number of pregnancies, or other issues, says Dr. V.

Seshiah, founder patron, Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group in India (DIPSI), an organisation that reports practice guidelines for GDM in India, says: If you do not control diabetes during pregnancy, a number of things will go wrong, with both the mother and the foetus. Also, about 10% of the people will have trans-generational diabetes. If the baby is female, she will develop GDM later, and if the infant is male, he will go on to develop a pre-diabetic condition called IGT. It is a vicious cycle and it will have to be broken.In 2010, he spearheaded what is possibly the only field study in the country, on GDM. Done in Chennai and its suburbs, it found that the prevalence of GDM was 17.8% in the urban setting, 13.8% in the semi-urban areas and 9.9% in rural areas. We are now attempting to conduct a nation-wide study and form a GDM registry so we understand the issue better, Dr. Balaji adds.On treatmentDr. Seshiah says the other key aspect of the revised guidelines is treatment of GDM. If diagnosed, a woman will be given a meal plan to follow for at least two weeks. If her blood sugar rests at 120 after fasting, then it has worked for her. This is the case for about 80% of all pregnant women who have GDM. For those it does not work on, the idea is to give an inexpensive drug (metformin) to control blood sugar. If even this does not work, then the recommendation is to start the woman on insulin. In a public health setting, this is a practical, workable alternative to immediately starting all GDM pregnant women on insulin.ramya.kannan@thehindu.co.in"

An estimated 600 million people chew it, with southern Asia, especially India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan, being high prevalence areas.Areca nut consumption is not only culturally ingrained in India but has also acquired large commercial potential; it is used as a key ingredient in several kinds of smokeless tobacco (SLT) preparations. In addition, non-tobacco brand extensions are also aggressively marketed and advertised leading to higher areca nut use in India. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey India Report 2016-17, says 8% of the population ingests areca nut.Health risksAreca nut chewing produces a sense of euphoria, heightened alertness, sweating, salivation, a warm sensation in the body, and a feeling of having an increased capacity to work. Arecoline, the major alkaloid of betel nut, has been thought to be responsible for most of these claimed effects. Many labourers chew large amounts of areca nut while at work to enhance their productivity. It is suggested that chewing it leads to habituation, withdrawal, and addiction, although the underlying mechanisms remain under-researched and thus poorly understood.Chewing areca nut is a risk factor for general and central obesity; it impairs blood sugar levels and delimits blood pressure control. Regular use stains the mucosa, gums, and teeth. It also acts as an abrasive and tends to wear off the tooths surface, causing fracture of a tooth in chronic chewers, besides, recession of gums and abrasion of exposed root surfaces. Some studies have shown that it causes anti-ovulatory and abortion-causing effects and affects newborns by causing a lower birth weight and reduced birth length. Available evidence suggests that areca nut is the cause of oral submucous fibrosis, a potentially cancerous condition in humans. Transformation of this disease to oral cancer has been estimated to be between 2% and 8%. It can also cause cancers of the liver, oesophagus, stomach, lung and cervix.Need for regulationIn India, there are hardly any regulations on the use of areca nut. When used as an ingredient in smokeless tobacco, it was subject to regulations under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. However, the government took a positive step by introducing the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulation, 2011, which prohibits tobacco and nicotine use as an ingredient in any food item. Considering that areca nut is classified as food, its use in chewing-tobacco products is now banned.With its adverse health effects, and given the huge number of users, there is an urgent need to step up regulation of areca nut products and their use. Their advertisement, promotion and sponsorship should also be regulated to prevent access by minors and those most vulnerable.There is consensus among experts on the following: ban on pan masala and supari advertisements under Food Safety and Standards Authority of India regulations; standardisation of all tobacco packs with minimum quantity for sale (in weight or unit as may be applicable); and an end to the sale of loose tobacco products. In addition, there should be research into the prevalence of spitting in public places and its impact on SLT and areca nut use and initiation, and a ban on spitting in public to meet the objectives of the national Swacch Bharat Mission. This calls for a national areca nut control programme.Prof. Ravi Mehrotra and Dr. Amit Yadav are with the ICMR-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research, Noida"

But, the subsidy would remain at Rs. 18.5 per kg, which would be given only to Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cardholders, representing the poorest of the poor.With the implementation of the National Food Security Act in the State since November 2016, the AAY cardholders are now considered part of the priority household (PHH) cardholders. The total figure of PHH cardholders is about 95.3 lakhs, of which AAY cardholders account for 18.74 lakh and the rest, 76.56 lakhs.The State government, through its representations in June and August 2017, wanted the amount of subsidy to be hiked to Rs. 28.5 per kg for all PHH cardholders.In T.N., sugar is being sold through fair price shops at a rate of Rs. 13.5 per kg for the AAY category and at Rs. 25 per kg for all others. To ensure that all the cardholders get subsidised sugar, the State government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 17/kg-Rs. 20/kg, as the price is around Rs. 42/kg-Rs. 45/kg in the open market, says a senior official in the Food and Civil Supplies Department. On an average, the State requires around 33,600 tonnes of sugar every month for its cardholders. It gets around 1,860 tonnes of subsidised sugar from the Centre. The remaining has to be procured in the open market.On Friday, the Centres decision on its position on the subsidised sugar was conveyed in a written reply by Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution C.R.

It was an added duty of the mill to take the issue of industrial safety more seriously in view of the fact that the industry is situated on river bed, which is environmentally sensitive zone, the PPCB said.Munish Pal, manager at the sugar mill, however, said they did not release anything into the drain. Not even a drop of clean water.While the mill was found to have been at fault, the molasses spill has also underlined that the PPCB has no policy of disallowing industrial units near water bodies.There is no policy of not permitting industries close to water bodies, but this episode will make way for such a policy. Such an accident has taken place for the first time. Regulatory bodies learn from such kind of accidents and new protocols will be laid.

Hence lack of policy of Punjab Pollution Control Board and unprofessional approach of the officials who cleared the site plan of the treatment plants should also be blamed for the crisis. The units are on 70 acres. That is enough space to keep a good distance between the water treatment plants and drain, said Seechewal whose restoration of Kali Bein is hailed as a model for the cleaning up of rivers.The effluent treatment plants at the mill are built at close proximity to the the drain at a height of 40 to 50 ft from the ground, an added risk factor.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

It is an open secret that the family of late Ponty Chadha as well as the Sarnas of Delhi are very closely connected to the Chief Minister, hence the government and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) have turned mute spectators to the disaster in our rivers, alleged Khaira.He said the step of approaching the NGT was necessitated as the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had miserably failed to discharge its duty to protect environment and pollution in the rivers of the state, primarily caused due to untreated industrial waste allowed to flow into the rivulets and rivers of the state. Khaira said its common knowledge that like other government departments, PPCB too works under political pressure.The Leader of Opposition said he was alarmed to note the huge quantum of industrial toxic waste, medical waste, untreated sewerage of villages and Ludhiana city flowing in the infamous Budda-Nala. He claimed more than 7.5 million liters of such waste flows through the Budda-Nala everyday and merges with river Sutlej at village Balipur in Ludhiana district, wrecking havoc on water species, animals including live stock and of course the lives of people of the state.Khaira said it was a matter of great shame for Capt Amarinder Singh, who claims to be Pannian-Da-Rakha (savior of the waters), that the people of Malwa region particularly the districts of Mansa, Muktsar, Faridkot, Bathinda etc, are drinking grossly poisonous and contaminated water flowing from the Sirhind canal into the water works of the villages. He said the latest poison released in the river Beas and Sutlej is bound to multiply many more times the spread of cancer, hepatitis, kidney ailments in the Malwa region and the state.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

The government is likely to take action against several government officials too.The official added that the government was preparing to issue a show cause notice to the owner of the unit as to why criminal proceedings should not be initiated against it for killing of aquatic life. The notices have been already drafted. We want to give notice to ensure a proper legal procedure is followed. A reply would be sought within 78 hours following which proceedings would be started, said another senior official, alleging that the government would not go soft on the unit owner despite political pressure.The unit belongs to Jasdeep Kaur Chatha, who is the niece of Paramjit Singh Sarna  Chief Minister Amarinder Singhs Adviser on Religious Affairs.

Whoever has done this should be punished, says Sarabjit Singh Dhotian, a preacher with Shiromani Gurudwara Parbhandak Committee.In the only action so far against the sugar mill, the states wildlife department has produced a challan in a court at Batala, which has kept the next hearing for June 2.The Amritsar Rural police have decided not to take any action on the complaint of wildlife official in Ferozepur, Charanjit Singh, saying the source of pollution was out of their jurisdiction.Beas was declared a conservation reserve in October 2017 by the Punjab government because of presence of Gharials and Dolphins.On his part, Charanjit Singh said it was up to the fisheries department to take action.When contacted, Raj Kumar, deputy director at fisheries department office in Amritsar, said, We have sent the sample of dead fish and polluted water to Ludhiana lab for test. We will send the report to office of our director at Chandigarh for further action. The Beas was made a conservation reserve under the Wildlife Act last year.

He was 96.Hes survived by two sons and three daughters.Madappa is fondly remembered for his contribution towards the unification of Karnataka, Chamarajanagara-Satyamangala railway line and the Chikkahole and Kabini irrigation projects. In 1956, he had moved a proposal in the state legislature urging the central government to implement the Chamarajanagara -Satyamangala railway project which is yet to be completed.Born in 1922 in Udigala, a small village of Chamarajanagara district, Madappa studied law in Belagavi and plunged into politics. He was elected to the state legislature from Chamarajanagara constituency to the first state assembly. He led the Karnataka unification movement in Chamarajanagara.He was selected for the state assembly in 1957 for the second time, but tasted defeat in the 1962 election. In 1976, he quit the Congress, opposing the Emergency. In 1979, he was appointed the Mysuru Rural district unit president of Janata Party by H D Deve Gowda. He retired from active politics in 1985.Madappa was a close associate of former deputy prime minister Jagjivan Ram. When Jagjivan Ram was the Union agriculture minister, Madappa was nominated as a member of the Farming Cooperative Society advisory committee and Agriculture and Labour committee.His son U M Mallesh said retiring from politics, his father stayed in Mysuru. ""The last rites will be on Friday in Udigala,""said Mallesh.Madappa served in various organizations, including the University of Mysore as a syndicate member, director of Kunturu Mahadeshwara sugar factory. As a true Gandhian, he was the founder director of the Badanavalu Khadi Gramodyoga Cooperative Society."

Its late May and the mercury is soaring, but at Malakpur, the air is thick with the smell of molasses.The sprawling plant, which in many ways epitomises farm distress from mounting cane payment dues, lies at the far end of acres of fields on the outskirts of Baraut town in western Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat district. Workers, the ones remaining after the mill has shut for the current crushing season, crowd around its unswept corners.Set up in 1998 and belonging to the Umesh Modi Group, the mill crushed 146.27 lakh quintals of sugarcane between October 24, 2017, and May 14, when it closed. This was worth Rs 459.01 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315 per quintal for general varieties. While mills are required, by law, to pay the SAP amount within 14 days of cane purchase, the Malakpur factory has till date disbursed a mere Rs 32 crore. That amounts to less than 7 per cent of what is due to its 34,000-odd farmers.The Kairana bypoll result now in, Narendar Rana from Bhadal village in Baraut tehsil says that the ruling BJPs defeat is proof that farmer anger cannot be wished away.

The 58-year-old died on May 26 morning, five days after he, along with other farmers, launched an agitation at the Baraut tehsil office over the pending cane dues. While the exact cause of his death is yet to be ascertained, it made headlines simply for the timing two days before a crucial by-poll in the neighbouring Kairana parliamentary constituency. Jayant Chaudhary, the vice-president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, whose candidate was fighting the election, rushed to pay his respects to Udayveer, whose body was displayed by the protesting farmers. Congress president Rahul Gandhi also referred to the farmers death in a tweet.On May 27, a day after Udayveer died, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the area, addressing a rally barely 30 km from Baraut in the same Baghpat district, after inaugurating the Rs 11,000-crore Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The Kairana bypoll result now in, Narendar Rana from Bhadal village in Baraut tehsil says that the ruling BJPs defeat is proof that farmer anger cannot be wished away.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna) The sugar mill in Malakpur, set up in 1998 and belonging to the Umesh Modi group, is among the worst offenders when it comes to non-payment of dues. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Payment to farmers by mills is made against parchis or receipts, specifying the weight of the particular batch of cane supplied and the price payable for that quantity. Each parchi represents roughly 20 quintals or one buffalo buggi (cart) load of produce. Farmers in western UP usually describe the payments owed to them in terms of parchis. Thus, Virender Singh of Badarkha village says he hasnt been paid for 75 parchis; Jaivir Malik from Chandanheri quotes 50 unpaid receipts; Karam Veer Singh from Sanauli cites 70; and Om Prakash Singh of Barauli 12. Rakam Pal, from Sanauli, is awaiting payments on five receipts against cane from a meagre 4 bighas of land (5.9 bighas make an acre).Udayveers eldest son Prahlad says he had grown sugarcane on 12 bighas and was owed over Rs 1.8 lakh by the Malakpur mill against the 29 parchis (about 580 quintals) of cane that he had supplied this season. He had not got a single rupee from them. On top of it, my father had a loan of Rs 2.5 lakh and unpaid electricity bills. A few days before he died, my younger brother Sagar told him about the Rs 30,000 tuition fees owed to the local private school where he was studying. He said that his name may be struck off the rolls if the payment was not made immediately.While the district administration announced compensation of Rs 12 lakh for Udayveers family, Prahlad says they are yet to get the money.Prahlad worked as a driver with the courier services company Blue Dart at Delhis T3 airport terminal until his fathers death, but is now back home. Sagar is in Class 10, while the middle son Deepak barely makes ends meet from a small private sector job in Delhi. The family stays in a four-room house at Baraut tehsils Jiwana village. Their possessions include two buffaloes and a non-functional washing machine.Read | A sugar rushBaraut Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Arvind Kumar Dwivedi points out that contrary to the general perception that Jats  the community to which most farmers in this belt belong  are big prosperous farmers, a majority own not more than 10-15 bighas.He adds, We have issued an RC (recovery certificate, which empowers the district administration to recover cane dues as arrears of land revenue from defaulting mills) of Rs 244 crore to the factory. It should start paying in the next few days.But how that would take place is not clear. Dwivedi himself admits there are no easy or quick solutions.The SDM says he is also looking into the increase in power tariffs for agricultural tubewell connections effected by the Yogi administration  from Rs 100 to 180 per horsepower per month. The farmers call this steep given the average13-HP electric pumpsets used by them for irrigating their cane fields. I have promised them a meeting with the managing director of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam (the power distribution utility in the western UP region). But there is not much we can do if the hike was a decision taken at the level of the state government, he adds.Meanwhile, at the Baraut tehsil office, the farmers continue their protest, camping under a large banyan tree. The next step, they say, would be a mahapanchayat, where they would invite leaders from the RLD, SP, BSP and Congress, to force the government to act. Satyendar Singh, who owns 21 bighas in Loyan village, not far from the Malakpur mill, is owed Rs 4 lakh for the cane that he supplied in the just ended season.

The Prime Minister likes to boast that it is much easier to do business in India now than it ever was.Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election that swept him to power. He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah. Modi promised to double farmers income but our earning has halved because of his apathy and anti-farmer policies. Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Currently director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) at Coimbatore, he isnt as well-known as Norman Borlaug or M S Swaminathan. Yet, the wonder sugarcane variety, Co-0238, bred by him has sparked no less a revolution, particularly in Uttar Pradeshs (UP) ganna heartland. It is probably also a reason for the present crisis in sugar  that of overproduction and India becoming permanently surplus in the sweetener.In the 2012-13 crushing season (October-September), UP farmers grew cane on 24.24 lakh hectares (lh) and its mills produced 74.85 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar. In the current 2017-18 season, the cane area is only 22.99 lh, but production of sugar by UP mills has already hit 119.22 lt as on June 1. It is likely to cross 120 lt when crushing operations end in another week or so.Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)The above 60 per cent increase in sugar output, despite area under cane shrinking, is largely due to Co-0238. Bakshi Rams variety, first planted in 2013-14, covers 12.08 lh or 52.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. It has led to average cane yields in the state rising from 61.63 tonnes per hectare in 2012-13 to around 77 tonnes in 2017-18. Thats not all. Co-0238 also gives more sugar from every tonne of cane crushed compared to other varieties. In 2012-13, the average sugar-to-cane recovery ratio for UP mills was 9.18 per cent. This season, it is close to 10.9 per cent.The production revolution from higher cane yields and improved sugar recoveries  thanks to unsung breeders like Bakshi Ram  is not an unmixed blessing, though.The sugar economy of India has traditionally been hostage to violent cyclical output oscillations. The typical sugar cycle is one of three years of high production followed by two years of sharp decline. Thus, 2000-01 to 2002-03 were good seasons in terms of output, while 2003-04 and 2004-05 were not. The same pattern was repeated over 2005-06 to 2007-08 (good) vis--vis 2008-09 and 2009-10 (bad).However, with advances in plant breeding  SBI and the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute are field-testing 20 drought-resistant clones in six locations of Maharashtra; these can save seven-eight out of the normal 34-35 irrigations over a 12-month crop duration (and even more through drip/sprinkler systems)  the old cycle of two-in-five bad production years is pass. Instead, we now have one-in-five or even one-in-seven bad, as seen from 2010-11 to 2016-17 (see chart below). Moreover, the recovery from declines is much sharper than before: Indias sugar output this season is projected at a record 322 lt, a 59 per cent jump over the 202.62 lt of 2016-17.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThe effects of moving to a permanently surplus situation are already being felt. Sugarcane is relatively profitable to grow. The average returns over cost of cultivation, estimated by The Sunday Express based on interactions with a cross-section of farmers in UPs Shamli district, work out to around Rs 7,500 per bigha or Rs 1.09 lakh per hectare. The green top leaves from cane take care of the entire fodder requirements of a farmers cattle during the crushing months from November to April. Also, it is a hardy crop that can withstand ola (hail), pala (frost), aag (fire), paani (waterlogging), nilgai (Asian antelope) and jungli suar (wild boar), to quote a Shamli farmer. Plus, there are no pricing and marketing uncertainties in cane. Mills are required, by law, to pay farmers a fair and remunerative price fixed by the Centre  UP has an even higher State Advised Price or SAP  within 14 days from the date of delivery.But these stable arrangements are bound to collapse in a regime of permanent surpluses. The 320 lt-plus sugar production for the country in 2017-18 will far exceed its annual domestic consumption of 250-260 lt. And with breeding breakthroughs and water-saving technologies practically rendering the sugar cycle redundant, surpluses are set to be recurrent  except in extreme drought years, when even irrigation from canals and groundwater is not possible.In such a scenario, sugar prices, far from rising, are more prone to falling. We have seen it this season, as ex-factory realisations in UP have collapsed from Rs 36-37 per kg in October to Rs 26-27 levels in May. That has, then, resulted in mills being unable to pay farmers the SAP. In UP alone, mills had bought sugarcane worth Rs 35,103.27 crore at the SAP during the 2017-18 season, as on June 1. Out of that, they were to pay Rs 34,549.28 crore within the stipulated 14-day period, but have so far disbursed just Rs 21,978.37 crore. It translates into arrears of Rs 12,570.91 crore.Read | Mounting molasses, and a scare in BeasThose dues may come down gradually, as crushing ends and mills sell sugar over the next few months. But the next season from October 2018  save in the unlikely event of a spectacular recovery in sugar prices  may start with Rs 7,500 crore of cane arrears in UP. Worse, the country as a whole would have opening sugar stocks of at least 100 lt (320 lt production, plus 40 lt carry-forward from 2016-17, minus 260 lt consumption). And going by reports of planting so far, there is every possibility of output in the 2018-19 season going up further to 340 lt.Simply put, India has too much of sugar today and the situation will only worsen in the coming season. For the Narendra Modi government  already smarting from a defeat in the recent by-polls in UPs Kairana parliamentary constituency, where ganna payment was the main issue  this could present a major challenge, ahead of the big national elections in April-May 2018. That is also the time when cane arrears usually peak. No ruling party would want that to happen.Next week, the Modi government is expected to take a few decisions in the hope of propping up sugar prices. On the agenda are the creation of a 30-lt buffer stock from sugar lying with mills (the government will bear the interest and storage costs on this sequestered quantity); the imposition of a minimum price of Rs 30-32 per kg; and fixing of factory-wise monthly sale quotas (what used to earlier be called the release order mechanism). Whether these can really address a problem of permanent surplus is, of course, a moot point.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A skilled worker handles each karahi, stirring the milk continuously and, from time to time, skimming off the malai from the top to the sides of the vessel with a twig.It takes at least two hours and 7kg of milk to make one kilo of khurchan, says Sunil Kumar Jain, 55, sitting in the shop named after his father.The malai is left to cool, with karchis resting on top of discarded autorickshaw tyres. Then begins the layering process; each layer of malai is cushioned with a dusting of sugar and the final layer is topped with kaju and pista.My grandfather, hailing from Madhya Pradeshs Bhind, started making khurchan over a century ago, from a godown near the Marwari Hospital along this very lane. He shifted to this shop in the 60s, says Jain, who could be the last from his family to make this sweet.It is difficult now to get skilled workers who must squat for hours in the heat to make khurchan. Five years ago, we started using Amul Diamond (creamy milk) after facing problems in sourcing buffalo milk, he says. I dont want my son, who is a BTech, to take up my profession.Back in Khurja, around two hours drive from Delhi, another third-generation sweet maker is more optimistic. We make khurchan the traditional way, using coal fire to boil buffalo milk on tawa, says Gyan Prakash Giri , 53, who runs Shiv Misthan Bhandar.The use of tawa instead of karahi, with lesser quantity of milk, is what makes the Khurja preparation distinct. Once the milk is all evaporated, the leftover malai forms a smooth sheet covering the entire tawa, unlike the ring of malai stuck to the sides of the karahi in Old Delhi.God has given us a sweet that does not last beyond a few days, limiting us to Khurja, unlike the Agra petha or Mathura peda, says Giri. The sweet, sold at Rs 600 a kg in Old Delhi and Rs 400 in Khurja, has a short shelf life and is harder to make in summers when these cramped shops turning into ovens.This is a dying craft. Soon, another Old Delhi delight may go the Ghantewala way, eventually disappearing among the rows of wedding shops."

(Express photo by Gurmeet Singh)As their agitation entered the third day on Sunday, farmers in Punjab and Haryana continued to dump their produce on roads as a mark of their protest, while vegetable prices soared in several cities of the two states. The 10-day agitation by farmers against the alleged anti-farmer policies of the central government began on Friday.Several farmers organisations are jointly protesting in 22 states, demanding remunerative prices for their produce, implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations and farm loan waiver. They have stopped the supply of vegetables, fruits, milk and other items to cities. Prices of vegetables and other items have soared in the wake of dwindling supplies of farm produce, traders said.The farmers, instead of supplying their produce to madis, are dumping them on roads to make their displeasure clear. At several places in Punjab and Haryana, including Ludhiana, Moga, Muktsar, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Sonipat, they held protests. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said protesting against the government will not serve any purpose.We have always been listening to farmers and we have come up with so many schemes and programmes for the welfare of peasants. Be it schemes related to crop compensation, crop insurance or shielding the farmers from price fluctuations or schemes related to irrigation, we have launched many initiatives for their welfare, Khattar told reporters. He said farmers would never forgive those who force them to throw their vegetables and spill the milk on the roads.Those who are misguiding farmers into doing so are their biggest enemies, he said, adding that vegetables, fruits and milk were produced after tremendous hard work by farmers. Responding to a question, Khattar said those who are stopping farmers from bringing their produce to markets and forcing them to throw them on roads, would be sternly dealt with. However, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh criticised the Centre for allegedly being apathetic to the distress in the agriculture sector.When farmers, who feed the nation, are forced to take to streets to draw attention to their pitiable condition, then it does not augur well for the country, he said in a statement. Sympathising with farmers, Singh wondered what else they should be expected to do when their survival was at stake.The farmers are suffering as a result of the central governments failure to waive their debts, which many state governments, including Punjab, had been repeatedly seeking, and also to give them the due price for their produce, he said, reiterating his demand for implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report.On Saturday, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said the protest by farmers were attempts to get media attention. It requires some unusual deeds to appear in the media, Singh told reporters at a press conference in Patna. His controversial statement triggered demands by opposition parties for his removal, with the Rashtriya Janata Dal accusing him of being insensitive to farmers plight.Addressing a public meeting in Samalkha in Panipat on Sunday, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda claimed that the policies of the BJP government at the Centre and in the state have delivered a death-blow to farmers. How will farmers repay their loans if they do not get fair price for their produce? If sugar mills are not clearing their dues, does the government have any face to ask farmers to repay their debts, Hooda questioned.Due to the protest, 5,862 litres of milk reached Vita Milk plant in Ambala City on Saturday against a daily average of 76,000 litres of milk. However, a senior official at the plant said they have sufficient stock of milk and the supply was not affected much. The supply may be hit if the agitation continues, he added.Farmers are holding the protest under the banner of Kisan Ekta Manch and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Molasses dumped in an open pit near Jalandhar city, which is lined merely by a tarpaulin sheet, instead of brick or cement to prevent seepage into soil. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)On the morning of May 17, Harvinder Singh of Chitta Sher village in Beas, the town named after the river in Amritsar district, went to check his fields near the river. What he saw in the water scared him.For the first time, I saw the water had turned dark. I saw dead fish floating. My first thought was something really bad had happened to the river, he says.Harvinder was right. In the early hours of May 16, a security guard at the Chadha Sugar Mill in Kiri Afghana village in Gurdaspur, barely a kilometre from Beas, called up a manager to inform that the molasses stored in a tank at the mill was boiling over. The mill is located on a sand rise, and due to the gradient, it was flowing into a drain that connected with the Beas.The management of the sugar mill, owned by the wife of the late liquor baron Ponty Chadha, battled to control the spill over the next day and a half. By 2 pm on May 17, nearly 10,000 kilolitres had flowed into the drain, and from there into Punjabs most important river, affecting the network of canals that feed off the Beas and Satluj in Punjab and Rajasthan. The Harike wetland ecosystem at the confluence of the Beas and Satluj was also affected.Dead fish floated downstream and into the canals for three days after the spill. Over 3,000 cusecs of fresh water had to be released into the Beas to flush the molasses.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has fined the mill Rs 5 crore, and ordered criminal prosecution of the management. As per the PPCB report, the sugar mill was storing molasses in two bricklined 20-ft deep tanks, neither of which was meant for the purpose.While the PPCB rejected the managements excuse that it had processed sugarcane more than its capacity during this season, this is a story being repeated across sugarcane-producing areas in Punjab and other states.For every quintal (100 kg) of cane crushed, mills produce around 10.7 kg of sugar and 4.6 kg of molasses, which is sold mainly to distilleries for manufacture of alcohol. With mills in India expected to crush over 300 million tonnes (mt) of cane in the current 2017-18 season, it translates into a record 32.2 mt production of sugar as well as 13.9 mt of molasses. This is against the 20.26 mt sugar and 9 mt molasses in 2016-17.Read | A sugar rushDead fish floated downstream in Beas for 3 days after molasses spill. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Dead fish floated downstream in Beas for 3 days after molasses spill. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Across major cane-growing states, molasses stored in the open is now a common sight. Punjabs 16 sugar mills alone produce an average 30 lakh quintals of molasses annually. This season, a bumper sugarcane crop has sent this up to 38.64 lakh quintals, apart from the molasses held over from last year.Good weather and improved cane varieties  especially Co-0238, covering 63.5 per cent of Punjabs total sugarcane area  have boosted the cane yield. We have recorded average yields of 89 tonnes per hectare in 2017-18, compared to 57-75 tonnes in the last few seasons, says Punjab Cane Commissioner Jaswant Singh.Distilleries in Punjab have the capacity on paper to consume 25 lakh quintals of molasses. In reality, though, they use up only 17 lakh quintals. Mills manage to sell around 5 lakh quintals to other states, while the rest is carried over.With no space to store molasses in tanks, mills are dumping the dark brown syrupy liquid in open pits.In one such open pit in Bhogpur near Jalandhar city, molasses, coagulating into yellow lumps in parts, shimmers in the 40 degree heat. The black tarpaulin lining the pit, 8-ft deep and 60 ft x 60 ft in size, is held down by bags of cement and sand around the edges, to ensure it does not give under the weight of the liquid. Next to the pit stands a round steel tank, 65 ft in diameter and 35 ft high, also filled to the brim. Behind the tank is a wall, marking the boundary of Punjabs first cooperative sugar mill.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThis is not a scientific method (to store molasses) and there can be serious problems if the liquid comes into contact with soil and water sources, warns Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) Chairman Kahan Singh Pannu.District Health Officer of Jalandhar Sewa Singh also admits a brewing health hazard. Such pits should be made with proper brick and cement lining, so that molasses doesnt seep into the soil. And there should be proper sheds over them, says Singh.A senior officer of the Bhogpur cooperative mill says they are helpless. We have two steel tanks with total 65,000 quintals storage capacity for molasses, which is what the mill produces every year. But this time, we crushed at least 4 lakh quintals more cane, producing around 20,000 quintals extra molasses. Since there was no time to make a new steel tank, we simply dug the pit. According to him, the mill was forced to dispose of some of the surplus molasses at Rs 100-120 per quintal.B S Gill, the general manager of the Bhogpur mill, says, What is lying in the open is actually quite less now and will not spill out. We will even shift it to the tanks in a day or two, once some space is created by the sale of molasses there.At Wahid Sandhar Sugar Limited, a private mill in Phagwara town in nearby Kapurthala district, molasses lies in a kuchcha 100 X 100 feet and 10-ft deep pit, also lined with tarpaulin. Its owner Jarnail Singh Wahid says the mills tanks can store one lakh quintals of molasses, but this years production has been 2.80 lakh quintals.We kept the molasses for a few weeks and now we are selling at abysmally low prices, just to get rid of it. When there is no market for it, what can we do? he says. If the government can decide the State Advised Price for sugarcane, what stops it from fixing a minimum rate for molasses and making it compulsory for distilleries of Punjab to buy from mills in the state first?R S Jhingar, chairman of the Nawanshahr cooperative mill, one of the largest in Punjab, says, We sold molasses at Rs 685 per quintal a couple of years ago and last year the rate was Rs 550 per quintal, but this year we lost heavily in both sugar and molasses.The Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills recently floated a tender for sale of molasses at the nine factories under it. The tender had to be cancelled. The reason: the low quoted rate of Rs 85 per quintal.But there is worse news emanating from Uttar Pradesh. Mills in the state have had to sell molasses free of cost  and, on top of it, bear the cost of transportation to distilleries.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI)Addressing criticism of the Central government on the issues of farmers protests over the governments allegedly anti-farmer policies and lack of job creation, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said that agricultural prices are influenced by the international market, and that the number of jobs created by the government needs to be seen also in the context of the growing population.Gadkari, the Minister for Surface Transport, Shipping and Ganga Rejuvenation, said, Jobs are definitely getting created but we have to also see this against the backdrop of growing population. On one side we are creating jobs, lekin log bhi jansankhya badhane ke liye puray taqat se bhide hain (on the other hand, people are also exerting themselves with full force to increase population).Gadkari was addressing the media on achievements of the Narendra Modi government in the last four years.Read | Stray clashes in Punjab, agricultural prices soar in RajasthanAmong other achievements of the Central government he listed was the effort to provide succour to the distressed farm sector. One of the measures taken, he said, was giving 1.5 times the minimum support price (MSP) to farm produce.Gadkari said there are many difficulties in addressing farmers distress. Agricultural prices are determined by the international market. For example, Brazil controls sugar (prices), Malaysia edible oil, and Argentina soybean prices. Currently, deflation has suppressed agricultural prices internationally. So our effort is to increase productivity and decrease cost of production, he said.Also Read | Farmers agitation: Stir enters second day, vegetable prices surge over dwindling suppliesBut the government, he said, is trying to do something innovative, such as involving more farmers in ethanol production under diversification plan. The effort is also to increase the percentage of ethanol blending in petrol and diesel to 22 per cent  from the present 8 per cent, he said. We have also hiked import duties on various agricultural produces to help farmers get a good price domestically.On jobs front, Gadkari said, In my ministries, lakhs of jobs  both direct and indirect  have been created.

(Representational)Indus Dolphin, one of the worlds rarest mammals, has not been sighted in Beas river ever since molasses from a sugar factory leaked into it, leaving a large number of fish dead, officials said on Saturday.About 40 sq km area from Goindwal Sahib to Harike is the natural habitat of the critically endangered dolphins which are found only in India and Pakistan. The officials said there was considerable damage to the aquatic life after molasses from a sugar factory leaked into the river in Beas town, about 40 km from Amritsar, on May 17.We have been searching for dolphins in Beas river but they have not been sighted yet by our teams which have been looking for them after the incident, Punjab Chief Wildlife Warden Kuldeep Kumar said on Saturday. Around 30 members of the World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF) along with teams of district forest officials have been searching for dolphins in Beas. The visibility was also low because the water had turned rusty brown due to pollutants.We are hoping that dolphins may have survived, Kumar said. According to the latest census, there were between six to 12 Indus dolphins in Punjab. The strength of Indus Dolphins in Pakistan is estimated be around 1,800, said Kumar. Meanwhile, gharials remained unaffected after the spill, the official said. Gharials are safe. We have spotted around 16 of them in upstream of Beas river, said Kumar, adding that he strength of Gharials is estimated to be 47.There has been considerable damage to aquatic fauna because of molasses getting spilled into the river, said Kumar. Tonnes of fish died because of reduced oxygen level in the water, he said. Even the fish seeds (fertilised eggs) have also damaged in this incident, he said. As many as eight to ten varieties of fish, including cat fish, common carp, died because of pollutants in the river, he said.Meanwhile, fish continued to die as water containing pollutants reached Tarn Taran and Ferozepur districts, he said. Yesterday, water mixed with molasses reached Rajasthan feeder canal. An alert was issued to villagers not to use canal water for drinking purposes, Kumar said. However, he said the situation has improved to a large extent in Beas following the release of fresh water.The Punjab government on Friday ordered the seizure of security deposit worth Rs 25 lakh of the sugar factory.

5b176b9b9855b7624638d6e4,Uttar Pradesh: Ganna trumps Jinnah in this bypoll when sugarcane arrears pile up,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/ganna-trumps-jinnah-in-kairana-bypoll-when-sugarcane-arrears-pile-up-5184737/,2018-05-21,"Sugarcane farmers outside a sugar mill in Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. (Photo: Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers outside a sugar mill in Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. (Photo: Praveen Khanna)Uth gaya ganna, dab gaya Jinnah (Sugarcane has displaced Muhammad Ali Jinnah), says Jitender Hooda as he interprets the upcoming bypoll to the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency.For this 48-bigha (8.1 acres) farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district and tehsil, the main issue in the election scheduled on May 28  necessitated by the death of BJP Member of Parliament Hukum Singh  is sugarcane.Kairana constituency has six sugar mills: four private (the Shamli factory of Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises, Rana Sugars factory in Unn, Bajaj Hindusthans in Thana Bhawan and Uttam Sugars in Shermau) and two cooperative (in Sarsawa and Nanauta).In the current 2017-18 season (October-September), the six mills have, as on May 18, bought sugarcane worth Rs 1,778.49 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315-325 per quintal. Of this, they were to pay Rs 1,695.25 crore within 14 days of purchase, but have so far disbursed just Rs 888.03 crore. That translates into Rs 807.22 crore in arrears  for a single constituency.How does it matter whether or not Aligarh Muslim University has a photo of Pakistans founder? Our only concern today is cane payment, says Hooda, who supplies to the Shamli factory, which alone has cane dues of Rs 190.33 crore. The other five mills, too, have sizable arrears: Unn (Rs 182.84 crore), Thana Bhawan (Rs 182.80 crore), Nanauta (Rs 115.66 crore), Shermau (Rs 80.79 crore) and Sarsawa (Rs 54.79 crore).Brahm Pal Singh, who grows sugarcane on 34 out of his 45-bigha holding in Laprana village of Shamlis Unn tehsil, is more direct. Their (BJP) manifesto stated that we will get full payment for our cane within 14 days of sale. The Minister for Sugarcane Development Suresh Rana is himself the MLA (member of legislative assembly) from Thana Bhawan. Yet, there been no payment after December 31 and this government is even allowing sugar imports from Pakistan, he alleges (the Commerce Ministry has clarified that only 13,110 tonnes was imported in 2017-18 and another 1,908 tonnes in the current fiscal till May 14).In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Hukum Singh garnered 50.54 per cent of the votes cast in Kairana. In the 2017 state elections, his partys vote share fell to 38.24 per cent, but it won four out of the constituencys five Assembly segments (Shamli, Thana Bhawan, Gangoh and Nakur) and lost only one (Kairana).This time, the BJPs candidate (Hukum Singhs daughter Mriganka) is up against a united Opposition, freshly emboldened by its success in preventing the saffron party from forming a government in Karnataka. Taking on Mriganka is Begum Tabassum Hasan, whose son Nahid is the Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana. She is fighting on the ticket of Chaudhary Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has a base mainly amongst the Jat peasant community.Religion is secondary. For us, she is the RLD candidate and we are all voting for Chaudhary saab, declares Yashpal Malik, a 40-bigha farmer from Lak. This village in Shamli tehsil has around 8,600 voters, of whom an estimated 6,600 are Jats who own 98 per cent of its 27,000-odd bigha farmland. Earlier, we had 1,450 Muslim voters, but they all left after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar and Shamli riots. Their going has affected us because they used for work for us as raj mistri (mason), badhai (carpenter), painters and also farm labourers. They lost lives, while many of our young boys were embroiled in false cases, he adds.Malik has supplied about 2,200 quintals of cane to the Shamli mill this season and received hardly a quarter of the Rs 7.15 lakh due to him at the SAP of Rs 325/quintal for early-maturing varieties.Recreating RLDs old Jat-Muslim alliance is what Ajit Singh, too, is attempting. Today, forget getting payments, you are actually having to beg mills to lift your cane. This is because they divided you on communal lines and your own party has not a single MP or MLA. You have a chance to vote again as farmers and not bother about the religion or caste of your candidate, he says at a rally in Shamlis Lisad village, where Jats constitute three-fourths of its 12,000-plus voters. This village also saw a dozen Muslims being killed in the 2013 violence, besides migration of all the communitys 2,000-2,100 voters.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which includes an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party), makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate. The other main community-wise voters are Kashyap (2 lakh), Gujjar (1.4 lakh) and Saini (1.2 lakh), in addition to Brahmins, Banias and Rajputs, who have all strongly backed the BJP in recent elections.Rana, UPs sugarcane minister, concedes that payments to farmers are an issue. However, he blames it on ex-factory sugar prices crashing from Rs 36-37 to Rs 26-27 per kg in the last seven months. This isnt the first time we are having the problem of cane dues from over-production. But unlike in the past, when you had to burn the cane in your fields or dump it in canals, we will ensure that mills will run till the last stick is crushed, he promises farmers at Kela Shikarpur village in Thana Bhawan block.UP mills are likely to end up crushing over 1,100 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane this season, as against 827.16 lt in 2016-17 and 645.66 lt in 2015-16. As on May 18, they had procured cane valued at Rs 34,518.57 crore, of which Rs 33,375.79 crore was payable within the stipulated 14-day period. They have paid Rs 21,151.56 crore so far, leaving arrears of Rs 12,224.23 crore.Yes, there are cane dues, but our mills have already paid more than what they did in the entire 2015-16 season. We are doing everything possible to expeditiously clear the arrears, Rana tells The Indian Express.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

LinkedIn has numerous Indian profiles offering escort services , adult entertainment and massages with happy endings, spanning across cities such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata.The LinkedIn profile of a girl named Pushpa (name changed) from Bengaluru describes her as a call girl offering a variety of massages across centres in the city such as Indiranagar, JP Nagar, Banaswadi, Domlur and Kammanahalli. Her profile provides a link to a website which claims to provide full body massage, happy ending massage and female-to-male body massage, among others.These services continue even though LinkedIn has banned them since inception. In its user agreement, the US company instructs its users not to create profiles or provide content that promotes escort services or prostitution.When contacted, LinkedIn said such profiles were in violation of its user agreement and said action will be taken.The LinkedIn profile of a spa in Bengaluru not only lists massages provided, but goes on to add that masseurs will be cute south Indian girls, pretty Kerala girls and can be chosen by customers. A random look at other profiles range from people in Vashi, Mumbai and Pitampura, New Delhi to a girl in Kolkata who describes herself as independent adult entertainer.STOI called a few contact numbers listed on the profile pages to ascertain if adult entertainment industry handlers were actively operating on the professional networking site. One call was answered by a girl and she admitted she was open to delivering all types of service along with a massage. She said, Well charge you Rs 2,500 for a three-hour service. We also have rooms at our place and you will like the experience. Come to Silk Board Junction and call, well tell you the exact address.There are profiles of women calling themselves naughty housewives, profiles looking for secret relationships, passionate sugar babies looking for one-night stands with cash benefits.LinkedIn India communications head Deepa Sapatnekar said in an emailed statement to STOI: The 47 million Indian members on LinkedIn, and the 546 million around the world, are members because they want to build their careers and become better professionals. Our user agreement clearly states that profiles or content that promote escort or prostitution services are prohibited. When we become aware of profiles and other activity on the site that may be in violation of our policies, we take appropriate action. We also encourage members to report any behaviour they consider to be inappropriate.The company, bought by tech giant Microsoft in 2016, added it is neither common, nor effective, to solicit such services on LinkedIn. We have robust measures in place that protect our members: They are empowered to block members who offend or threaten them. They can also report offensive conduct and the profile of that member can be suspended if found to have contravened our terms of service (and where necessary), remove them from the site altogether.A pimp in Bengaluru, who was arrested twice, told STOI that the prostitution business has moved online to a significant extent. The industry also uses social media tools such as WhatsApp. It reduces risk by ensuring anonymity for all, the man said.A senior officer of the police Central Crime Branch said the department had noticed such posts on social networking and professional networking sites, including LinkedIn. There have been no complaints received so far. Were monitoring the posts and will take suo motu action if needed, he said."

The IIT-Gn researchers say that the nanosheets  only three atoms thick  are among the thinnest materials crafted by humankind.To understand the scale in everyday context, the nanosheets are one lakh times thinner than a strand of human hair or a paper sheet. But the size belies the sturdiness of the nanosheets, which show promise to become central to the development of the next-generation mobile and laptop batteries, green energy, and lighter but hardier armours for the Indian armed forces.The nanomaterial we have synthesized has never existed before. This is an exciting development which opens further avenues for the use of boron, said Kabeer Jasuja , assistant professor of chemical engineering. Jasuja and his team of doctoral students  Gunda Harini, Saroj Kumar Das, and Asha Liza James  published their findings in ChemPhysChem journal.Jasuja said the invention was the result of serendipity. The team stumbled upon it while working on a project to develop a recipe for synthesizing nano-material from boron. The research on nanosheets has been centered on graphene, which represents the first such ultrathin nanomaterial obtained from graphite. The discovery won the University of Manchester scientists a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010.We were working on a project to make a graphene cousin constituted from boron by using magnesium diboride or MgB2, a chemical commonly used in labs, Jasuja said. We observed that MgB2 dissolved in water just like sugar. But dissolved sugar never reunites to form crystals again. However, when this solution was left undisturbed for 36 hours, the dissolved species surprisingly started to come together again.More importantly, the recrystallisation did not happen in the conventional three-dimensional way, but in the form of extremely thin sheets. The boron atoms in these nanosheets arranged symmetrically in the form of a honeycomb which makes these nanosheets similar to graphene, a honeycomb of carbon atoms which is the worlds thinnest material measuring only one atom thick, Jasuja said.Jasuja said that the team will now investigate the properties of boron nanosheets vis--vis graphene nanonsheets and work on projects to harness the materials utility for society."
5b17834e9855b762eced2cee,Few tickets for women despite call for equality,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/few-tickets-for-women-despite-call-for-equality/articleshow/63101351.cms,2018-02-28,"BENGALURU: During his whirlwind tour of Mumbai-Karnataka, Congress president Rahul Gandhi assured that the womens reservation bill would be passed in Parliament and urged the state party unit to give more tickets to women candidates in the coming assembly elections. Going by precedent, though, the chances of the party delivering on his word seem bleak.Aspiring women leaders say the mindset of party leaders is the biggest obstacle. The Siddaramaiah government took a historic step by enhancing the reservation for women from 33% to 50% in panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies and reaped full dividends. Now the party has been promising more tickets to women aspirants to repeat it. But thats easier said than done in the assembly polls, said one of them. This is despite women accounting for 48% of the voters in the stateCongress fielded only eight women candidates in Karnataka in 2013 when Sonia Gandhi was at the helm. Of them, two won and a third woman candidate later won a bypoll and went on to become a minister in Siddaramaiahs cabinet. Congress is not alone; both BJP and JD(S) have been giving women a raw deal when it comes to contesting in polls. In the previous assembly polls, of 175 women who contested, including independents, only six got elected to the 224-member Karnataka assembly. This was three more than the number of women in the 2008 polls.The reasons are not hard to find. Political parties continue to doubt the capability of women candidates to compete with their male opponents and match them with money and muscle power. Given this scenario, tickets are issued only to women with connections to political families or with a cinema background.On occasion, the ticket has gone to a woman to ride a sympathy wave. Sugar minister MC Mohan Kumari (Geetha) was thrust into the hurly-burly of politics following the death of her husband, cooperation minister HS Mahadevaprasad. While party leaders campaigned for her, Geetha merely stood beside them with folded hands.Even if women do get elected, few have risen much further. Karnataka has not had a woman chief minister, deputy chief minister or home minister so far. Tellingly, none of the parties has had a woman president either.Womens leadership can only grow if they get adequate opportunities at party forums and with reservation, said a former woman minister. Patriarchal political systems which do not tolerate women at the highest level block all such opportunities by creating a separate womens wing. Unless backed by family or party, a woman cant mobilise support and win polls. Therefore, the need of the hour is reservation for women as it forces men to fall in line as it has happened in panchayats and urban local bodies."

Over the years, Nestle has reduced salt in Maggi by 33%. The instant noodles brand, which has remained the mainstay of Nestles Indian portfolio, contributed around 35% to the companys growth in 2017.This change is happening not only in the packaged food business but also across categories such as cosmetics, said Arvind Singhal, founder of retail consultancy Technopak. There is a consumer backlash against products that are perceived to have higher content of sugar, salt and chemicals. There is a definite consumer shift towards products that have natural and Ayurvedic properties.And Nestle isnt the only food company that has been talking about tweaking products  to not only satiate palates of Indian consumers but also their newfound bias towards healthier products.Global food and beverage giants Coke and PepsiCo were some of the first companies to jump on to the health bandwagon. While PepsiCo has chalked out a strategy to shift its business away from colas to premium food products, Coke has pledged to reduce sugar content across its portfolio.Even junk food companies have been proactive. Recently, multinational fast food chain KFC chose rice bran oil over palm oil to fry its products in India. Similarly, Gunjan Shah, VP of sales at Britannia, said there is increased demand for fortified food. For instance, we have seen traction for bread that is fortified with vitamins."

This is in complete contrast to the SAD (Badal)-BJP government that was in power for 10 years before the Congress toppled it last year and came to power with a massive majority of 77 seats in a House of 117.During their tenure, then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son Sukhbir maintained a firm grip on the Akalis, restricting the rebellion to just a handful of names. But they could not manage the resentment in the voters and finished third in the assembly elections.Amarinders troubles started within three months of coming to power when it was revealed that power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh had allegedly put up his own ex-employees from a sugar mill as bidders in the state governments first online sand-mining auction. Amit Bahadur, Gurjits former cook, was among those who bagged the contract for a sand mine in Nawanshahr for Rs 26.51 crore. Three other former employees successfully bid for Rs 4.11 crore, Rs 9.21 crore and Rs 10.58 crore.This dented Amarinders attempt to project the government as corruption-free and transparent. The Justice Narang Commission was set up to look into the allegations and gave Gurjit a clean chit. But there still wasnt enough sand left to bury the issue as it remained politically volatile until Gurjit put in his papers as minister on January 4.Gurjit is considered a close confidante of Amarinder. It is believed that Congress president Rahul Gandhi too was keen to see the back of Gurjit as he would have found it difficult to carry the baggage of a corruption case against a Congress minister while campaigning in other states ahead of assembly elections.Just when things seemed to settle down a little, some 40 MLAs of the Congress wrote a letter to Amarinder saying he should act against those Akali leaders who were allegedly involved in drug cases. They insisted that this was a poll promise to the people that could not be broken. Amarinder, however, remained firm under pressure and said he would act only in accordance with the law.Just as Ranas resignation hit the headlines, Amarinders other trusted aide  his chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar  left the CMO after the Punjab and Haryana high court scrapped his appointment. His appointment was first scrapped by a single bench of the court and later stayed by a division bench, allowing him to return to Amarinders side.Amid all this, however, there was a strong belief that a retired bureaucrat being appointed to the CMO with wideranging powers had upset many serving bureaucrats and also some in Amarinders inner circle. Kumar himself was not keen to return to the powerful position until the division bench gave its final order, but he has since relented.There was also a brief but significant moment of unease between local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Amarinder. Sidhu claimed that he was neither involved in the process of selecting the mayor in his hometown, Amritsar, and was not invited to the oath-taking ceremony of the newly-elected councillors. This issue became an embarrassment for Congress party as well as the government, but since then Sidhu has patched both with the party and mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu.The restlessness within the government came through also when Moga SSP Raj Jit Singh moved the Punjab and Haryana high court and alleged that the chief of the special task force (STF) on drugs, ADGP H S Sidhu, nursed a personal grudge against him. The allegations came following the arrest of Punjab Police inspector Inderjeet Singh from whom drugs and illegal weapons were recovered and the case was projected as among the biggest operations yet by the STF. Sidhu was handpicked by Amarinder to head the STF. The development shocked both politicians and officers as a Punjab Police Service (PPS) officer was openly going against a top police officer, who is close to the chief minister.The chief minister needs to assert himself more and intervene actively to end the intrigues from within, a senior Congress leader said. The need is to put our own house in order as Punjab remains nationally important for the Congress. When the issue of sand mining has already claimed a minister, the government needs to crack down on illegal mining and the action should be visible.Allegations of goonda tax around Bathinda refinery have also dented the image of the state government.The political scenario of Punjab clearly suggests that both SAD and AAP have not yet recovered from their loss in the 2017 assembly elections, but the Congresss image has taken a beating. Punjab is in very bad shape and needs to be run effectively. The internal bickering and intrigues are set to take the steam out further, said Dr Joginder Singh Puar, former vice-chancellor of Punjabi University, Patiala, who is also a keen political observer."

5b1789099855b7604256c2b8,Bacteria can be used for strengthening cement: VNIT team,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bacteria-can-be-used-for-strengthening-cement-vnit-team/articleshow/63116288.cms,2018-03-01,"NAGPUR: In a path-breaking finding, researchers at the Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology VNIT ) have found an innovative way to use microbes (bacteria) to strengthen cement. This will also minimize the amount of cement used in construction activities and reduce the overall costs.The researchers claim that these bacteria can replace the commercial admixtures that are used to increase the strength of cement or mortar.The research team from environmental laboratory in the civil engineering department of VNIT has been working under the guidance of former director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and former environment chair of VNIT, Tapan Chakrabarti , for nearly three years. Chakrabarti told TOI that during experiments it was found that microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation could increase the compressive strength of cement by 23.49% for 28 days of curing period. It also reduced water absorption capacity of cement by 15.40% by filling the micro cracks through bio-cementation.The principal investigator of the project Madhuwanti Latkar, associate professor, said, Most important aspect of the process is that use of water during casting and curing is replaced by the microbial solution. The two types of ureolytic bacteria used in the project are bacillus cereus and enterobacter cloacae. The experiment also used lentil seed powder as protein source and sugar as carbon source and meat extract in the nutrient medium. The researchers plan to replace meat extract by yeast to further reduce the cost.Latkar said durability tests also yielded very good results and ranged between the standard figures. She clarified that the bacteria are used only in the first five/six days of the curing as they die after that. Otherwise also, these bacteria are non-pathogenic and extracted from rohizopheric soil. We didnt use pure cultures of bacteria. We used soil along with microbial solution, she added.Chakrabarti said the whole process was environment-friendly and minimized the carbon footprint. In fact, it is a very green technology, he said.A PhD scholar involved in the project, Anuja Charpe , said though the technology is green but transferring the technology or selling it will not be easy. It is difficult to convince people for using environment-friendly technology. People prefer easily available technology rather than green one, she said.Snigdha Bhutange, a PhD student who joined the project just a few months back, says she would be comparing all admixtures available in markets with bio-cementation process to make it more acceptable and accessible.The researchers have earned two patents during the work and the project is expected to continue for another two years or more."

Later that day, he received a phone call from a stranger: not only had this man found his wallet, he was returning it with all his money, Rs 9,000, intact. Yadav was in disbelief till he met Yatin Naik. He learned that his wasnt the only wallet the unassuming man had found and returned; he had been bringing succour to many for the past 10 years.Naik has been scouring the station area and tracks at Andheri, looking for wallets dumped by pickpockets after emptying them of cash. He has a trusted network of ragpickers, sweepers, beggars and gangmen who save discarded wallets and hand them over to Naik. The 53-year-old checks their contents to track down the owner.""I do it for the blessings and the smiles,"" said Naik, who lives in Khetwadi with his sister. . Commuters are overjoyed at getting back their wallets. Its not just about the money. People have memories attached to their belongings. They have pictures of their families, drawings made by their kids, besides government identity cards and ATM cards. Pickpockets dont care for these, said Naik, adding that Yadav was very lucky to get back his cash as he had wrapped it in a piece of paper.Recounting how he started off, Naik said he had landed in Andheri nearly 10 years ago to meet someone when he spotted a discarded wallet near a public tap. I picked it up and soon found another wallet. This got me thinking. I wondered if I could start tracking down their owners on my own as the police are anyway overburdened with cases. I started looking for addresses on identity cards and dialling MTNL to get the commuters landline number. Sometimes, I would write letters to commuters, he said. In Yadavs case, Naik found a receipt in his wallet with his mobile number scribbled on it.To earn a living, Naik puts together an annual directory of sugar factories in the state. I run around to gather advertisers and sponsors for the directory. But my heart lies in finding and returning commuters wallets. I dedicate three to four hours for it every single evening. There have been times when commuters touch my feet or start sobbing on getting their wallet back. At times, they call me back for help if a friend or relative has lost his wallet. I have limited resources and havent been able to venture out of Andheri, he said.But not all his experiences are savoury. There have been instances when commuters got their wallets back but not with all the contents intact. They vented their frustration on me. I promptly take these commuters to the police and ask them to intervene, he said. Naik is a known face at the Andheri GRP outpost.On an average, he finds at least two lost or stolen wallets every day. Andheri has among the highest crime rates on Western Railway and with the Metro station coming up next to it, the volume of commuters has grown exponentially. Naik has been meticulously maintaining a record of all the commuters he has helped over the years and has ended up filling three large diaries with names, contact numbers and photographs. It feels good to sit and go through the pages sometimes, he said."

But for those who are staying back to celebrate it with family and friends, environmental concerns are weighing them down.As much as I enjoy the festivities, Holi is a nightmare in terms of water wastage, burning of firewood and also the harmful chemical colours that are used, says banker Aditi Pimplapure Its for this reason that herbal colours are the way to go for many this season. Once a niche product sold at high end stores, today with increased awareness, it is freely available at reasonable cost.Last year many of us had a reaction from chemical colours. So this year we will use only herbal colours, says Nikhil Bhute, a commerce student. But in the markets it is still the mounds of chemical colours in various hues of green, red and pink that are selling.Herbal colours are still 50% costlier than chemical ones. People only talk about using herbal colours and end up buying chemical ones, says Abir Mummain, a vendor in Itwari. But I advise people not to buy pink colour as it is most harmful. It turns golden after application and is difficult to remove, he cautions.But diehard revellers have their own way of protecting themselves by using scary masks and hairy hand gloves with long nails. Masks help protect facial skin, says Suresh Devikar, another vendor in Itwari who sells them by the dozens. Half masks covering just eyes are also available in silver, golden and other shiny colours. These are very popular among the youth, he says.Besides the water guns, colours and masks, the standard food items also add to the festivities. The most significant one being gathi strings made with sugar found mostly in Vidarbha and some parts of MP and Chhattisgarh.The gathi strings are presented to elders, newly-weds and young children on Holi to make them feel special. It is more of a social gesture than religious.

Although the anointing is held for nine days between February 17 and 26, planning for the event kicks off at least two years in advance.The religious event is performed as per scriptures by Jain seers from across India. This years event, the 88th Mahamastakabishekha, is expected to draw about 40 lakh visitors. Temporary townships with scientific waste disposal systems have been built, massive temporary kitchens and dining halls, that can each seat 10,000 at one go, have been set up to provide meals for visitors. Right from the water used for the abishekha, to the scaffolding from where the abishekha is performed, everything is planned to the minutest detail.Shravanabelagolas Charukeerthi Bhattaraka Swamiji revealed that since the first Mahamastakabishekha in 981 A.D, the ceremony has been performed once in 12 years.""Generally we begin preparations two years in advance, the seer said. Most tyagis and munis walk to Shravanabelagola. And they come from across the country. This alone takes months. It is a big event. Even though the Mahamastakabishekha ceremony is over by February 26, the other work needs about two years to be completed. That is why it was decided that this event be held once in 12 years.The statue is bathed and anointed with purified water, sugar cane juice, milk and a paste of saffron, sandalwood, vermilion and turmeric powders apart from several other ingredients. On the first day of the Mahamastakabishekha, 108 Kalasas (purified vessels containing the abishekha ingredients) is offered. From the second day onwards, 1008 Kalasabhisheka are performed. Pure water from river Hemavati is specially used for the Kalasas which are then offered to Lord Bahubali.As in previous years, thousands of tyagis, munis and saints have already arrived for this years event. ""Generally, they reach Shravanabelagola by walk, said Deekshit Jain, a devotee from Hubballi. Along the way, they preach about the importance of nonviolence, sacrifice and other Jain philosophies. Some of them start their journey nearly a year in advance to ensure they reach Shravanabelagola on time. Hundreds of Jain monks are now in Shravanabelagola. It is a rare opportunity to meet all of them together and take blessings. It is one of the things that makes this event unique."

By afternoon, the entire quantity of around 40 to 50 kg is sold out.The demand has sustained by word of mouth. Regular customers are from Manapparai and its surroundings as well as repeat buyers passing through the town, society sources said.Yet, the society has no plans to increase the output from the present level. In fact, it is not in a position to do so, as the supply of native Murrah breed buffalo milk with which the special khova is made is limited.Though the society is among the most vibrant ones in the district accounting for production of about 21,000 litres of milk a day, the supply of buffalo milk is less than 100 litres. Hence, the society is constrained to confine the production level, says its secretary Thangavelu. Cattle rearers supplying milk to the society have not made any attempt to increase the number of buffaloes since rearing them is tough when compared to cows, he pointed out.There is a special reason, or rather reasons for the distinct taste of the khova. Mr. Thangavelu explains: The milk sourced from the native breed buffalo is converted into khova within hours of extraction, early in the morning, well before the natural aroma diminishes. And, the milk is stirred on a pan heated by firewood. Another important reason for the pure taste is that no other ingredient other than sugar is used to make the product.Even with the limited milk supply, the economics in conversion works out very well for the society, since the khova is sold for Rs. 400 per kg. The entire quantity of the creamy buffalo milk procured for Rs. 35 a litre is used exclusively for conversion into khova. About 30 kg khova is made with the daily supply during summer months, and up to 50 kg is produced during winter season, Mr. Thangavel says.The society has not been successful in replicating the procedure of making khova using cow milk. We tried it and dropped the idea as the product became sticky, he said.But, it has plans to produce other products out of cow milk such as curd and buttermilk.The society sells not less than 8,000 litres of milk locally every day, after supplying 12,000 to 13,000 litres to Aavin.Cow milk procured for Rs. 28 per litre is sold for Rs. 34. Revenue generation would go up significantly if a portion is converted into curd and butter milk, Mr. Thangavelu said."

And, with the dog days making a comeback, Trichiites have started thronging the refreshments stalls despite the soaring prices of the summer fruits and drinks.March, being a month synonymous with the board examinations that shoots up the anxiety level of students, also happens to be the start of the dedicated summer in the peninsula. The maximum day temperature from 31 to 32 degree Celsius in the mid-February has now shot up to 35 degree Celsius, resulting in tender coconut and watermelon stalls mushrooming along the streets.Putting up with the sizzling mercury in the city, prices of tender coconut and watermelon are shooting up. High demand from retailers and juice vendors is only adding to the soaring prices. ""Last year, a piece of tender coconut during March was sold at Rs 40. Now the price of tender coconut has touched Rs 55-60. Though there is good demand, we are facing difficulty in sourcing quality tender coconuts,"" V Mani, a tender coconut seller in Bharathidasan Salai said. Since the production of tender coconuts in delta districts have come down, traders largely depend on Pollachi and adjoining hamlets to source coconuts which evidently increase the transportation charges. Despite the surge, people are often seen in large numbers sipping the tender coconuts to keep themselves hydrated.Echoing similar views, A Dhanasekar, a watermelon trader, claimed that the price of watermelon has increased by Rs 3-5 per kilogram owing to the heavy demand. Similarly, people are making a beeline to the porridge and cucumber stalls in the city signifying the change in weather. ""Daytime will be generally warm in central districts as well as there is no chance for summer showers in the region at least for the next few days.

Though the price of the lemon fruit usually go up during the summer months, the hike in the price this time is said to be too steep.The recurring drought conditions have hit the lemon production in these districts. The lemon is in short supply. With mercury rising, demand for lemons is increasing, especially among the domestic users.The open markets and the 11 uzhavar santhais in Salem district received lemon fruits from Ayodhiyapattanam, Panamarathupatti, Veerapandi and the surrounding villages, where it tends to be a promising crop.These fruits were marketed for Rs. 5 each in the markets in these districts till last month-end. With increase in demand, the price of the quality lemon has increased to Rs. 10 per fruit. The smaller sized fruits fetch a price between Rs. 3 and 5.In the uzhavar santhais, the price of big fruits ranged between Rs. 6 and 8.According to a cross-section of the traders running vegetable shops in the markets in Namakkal district, the lemon fruits are procured in bulk from the farmers of Tiruchi and Karur districts. At present the wholesale price of a kg of lemon (comprising about 25 fruits) stood at Rs. 150. Due to this, they had no other alternative, but to market it at Rs. 10 per fruit.Despite the increase in the price, the people are making a beeline in front of the shops marketing the lemon fruits in Suramangalam and other uzhavar santhais in Salem city.The healthy market trend has brought joy to the lemon farmers.

PeriasamyM_PeriasamyThe road around the Power House, near Sivananda Colony, has been a cause for concern for long for residents of the area, and those who use it to move to and from North Coimbatore.Right from the western junction at Cross Cut Road to the eastern one, also at Cross Cut Road, the horse shoe-shaped road is full of potholes, damaged speed breakers and partially filled trenches.This has been the condition of the road for almost two years now, says former Ward 51 councillor S.J. Ashok Kumar.Given that Cross Cut Road sees one-way traffic flow from east to west, those driving down the North Coimbatore Flyover or the subway beneath are forced to take Power House Road to reach Sivananda Colony, 100 Feet Road or Gandhipuram. The poor condition of the stretch gives a harrowing time to road users.Motorists, particularly, have had a tough time negotiating the stretch, says R. Govindaraj, who manages a milk parlour in the area. I've seen two-wheeler riders, especially the elderly, struggle to drive on the damaged portion. They usually swerve to the edge of the road to escape riding in front of lorries and buses, but even there the road offers no comfort.During rain when the water covers the potholes and blankets the damaged speed breakers, the plight of motorists is worse, says K. Rajagopal, sugar cane juice stall owner.It is not that Power House Road alone is damaged. Many lanes and by-lanes of Tatabad and Sivananda Colony are equally bad, complains Mahalakshmi Subramaniam, a resident of the area. She along with residents had taken to the notice of the Coimbatore Corporation Commissioner the poor condition of Power House Road and also Dr. Subbarayan Road, Rajendra Prasad Road, Yard Road, Radhakrishna West Road, Tatabad IIIrd and IVth Streets, but the civic body took no action.The residents represented in person and also through petitions but to date there has been no reply or response, leave alone remedial action, she adds.Corporation officials say that the civic body has started patch work on the damaged stretches of the roads in the locality.

A wholesale vegetable trader said there was indeed a slight increase in prices owing to the hike in transportation charges, but there was no discernible impact in the market, as vegetable prices were very low owing to good production. If the transportation cost earlier was Rs. 2.5, today it is Rs. 3, he said.Prices were unlikely to increase for a month or two, but would go up again if farmers did not get the desired returns and failed to grow another round of vegetables. A retail trader in the market said provision prices too were stable. Tuvar dal ( sambar parippu ) cost Rs. 80 a kg and sugar Rs. 37, down Rs. 1 from Friday.A wholesale provision dealer said rise in fuel prices was usually reflected in the cost of provisions, but it was perhaps a bit too early to say the prices would not rise. We may be able to know how things go when the next truckload arrives, in a couple of days.Mohammed Rafeek, president of the Chala main unit of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said petrol did not matter much but diesel price hike was hurting the traders badly. Vegetable prices were stable, but those trading in other commodities were absorbing this increase in cost. Even parcel services will increase their charges now.Mr. Rafeek said price revision by oil retailers was being met without much protests because it was not a festival or wedding season and families were focussing on school reopening. Had that not been the case, there would have a been a huge brouhaha and the authorities would have taken a lot of heat."

With the sugar production estimated to set a new record by touching around 29.5 million tonnes in the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September) and likely to outstrip consumption by around 4-4.5 million tonnes, sugar mills may face pressure on prices and profitability in the near-term. The annual sugar consumption is pegged at 25 million tonnes.After hitting a low of Rs 31,500 per tonne in the first week of February, sugar prices picked up in the following weeks on the back of government initiatives such as the doubling of import duty to 100% and the imposition of limits on sugar sales by sugar mills.Prices, which increased to Rs 34,500-35,000 per tonne in the third week of February, have softened again and are currently hovering at around Rs 32,500 per tonne.Ratings agency ICRA has revised domestic sugar production for the 2017-18 season to around 29.5 million tonnes against its earlier estimate of at least 27 million tonnes. This has been driven principally by higher-than-expected sugar production in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior VP and group head, ICRA Ratings. This in turn is likely to exert pressure on sugar mills debt coverage metrics and also adversely affect liquidity indicators, including cane payments. Under these circumstances, government support will remain critical for the sugar industry, ICRA said. We expect the closing stocks to significantly increase to around 8.5-9 million tonnes in SY2018 (sugar year 2017-18), Majumdar stated. The reverse stock limits imposed by the government are valid up to March 31, 2018. Hence this upward revision in the sugar production estimate along with the liquidation of sugar stocks, especially by several cash-strapped sugar mills, post March 2018, is likely to result in pressure on sugar prices from the coming quarter, he said.Sugar mills profitability is likely to come under stress on account of the higher cane cost of production (higher SAP or state advised price and FRP or fair and remunerative price for the current season) along with the likely pressure on sugar realisations during Q1 FY2019 (first quarter of 2018-19), Majumdar said.However, most major UP-based mills have by and large seen significant deleveraging over the last couple of years, which will help them withstand cyclical downturns better, he said. Given the increase in production levels, the fall in prices could lead to an increase in the cane arrears, he stated."

However, this has come under threat in recent weeks.Last December, a CBI special court had acquitted former telecom minister A Raja and DMK leader Kanimozhi in the 2G allocation case. Billed as the biggest telecom scam that had allegedly caused a loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer, this was one of the main issues raised by BJP during the 2014 polls.A further dent to BJPs anti-corruption stance was caused by the alleged Rs 12,622-crore fraud committed by diamond jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi by getting fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) from PNB. The NDA government was put on the defensive when CBI in its FIR said 143 LoUs worth Rs 4,886 crore were issued or renewed in 2017 (during NDA rule).CBI arresting Rotomac promoter Vikram Kothari for alleged swindling of Rs 3,695 crore of loan funds also got a lot of bad press for the Modi government. However, a few developments in the recent weeks will help BJP counter the Opposition in Parliament when it meets on Monday for the remainder of the budget session The arrest of former FM P Chidambarams son Karti in a case of financial wrongdoing  based on charges levelled by Indrani Mukherjee of INX Media  is likely to be used by the treasury benches to take on the Opposition on the issue of corruption.The opposition, on the other hand, may raise this issue to allege it is a case of political vendetta and an attempt to divert attention from the PNB scam.The Cabinet also gave its not to the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill, 2018, last week and the government will push for its passage to show it is serious about fighting corruption. The proposed law would give powers to attach all properties and assets of a declared fugitive. The bill will apply with retrospective effect to all such persons as soon as it comes into force. The government has also announced setting up of a National Financial Reporting Authority that will have oversight over audit of listed and big private companies.The CBI FIR against promoters of Simbhaoli Sugar Mills, including Punjab CM Amarinder Singhs son-in-law, in connection with an alleged bank loan fraud, is also likely to be raked up by BJP members."

But there is no guarantee of a job even after graduating. So we start learning to roll bidis, says 21-year-old Priyanka Madgundi. Priyanka finished Class 12 and says she would have gone to college if shed been sure of a job.Besides the women bidi rollers , about 10,000 people are directly and indirectly involved in the industry. Solapur has highest number of sugar factories in the state, but there is no other employment for women. The bidi cards have made it easier for women to find husbands who do not demand dowry, says Narsayya Adam, a bidi workers leader and former MLA.Meanwhile, Radha is preparing to meet another prospective groom and his family. The moment they talk of marriage expenses, she will flash her bidi card and that will settle matters, she says."

Akhilesh stands to gain if he can win the bypolls with BSP support.Akhilesh gets the credit for striking this understanding with BSP since even after becoming chief minister he never caused any harm to Mayawati, her party leader or officers close to her despite being armed with vigilance and CAG reports that indicted her for the scandalous construction of lavish parks and memorials, controversial sale of sugar mills and scam in health department.Governor Ram Naik repeatedly exhorted Akhilesh to take action on reports of Lokayukta, CAG and vigilance, but he maintained a strategic silence and allowed the reports to gather dust. In a way he granted amnesty to Mayawati by closing the vigilance report against her government.In contrast, when Mulayam Singh Yadav was campaigning for 2012 assembly elections, he had promised to bulldoze the statues and memorials constructed in the regime of Mayawati. But when Akhilesh became chief minister, he did no such thing. Instead, when SP supporters beheaded Mayawatis statue in Lucknow, he got it replaced with a new statue within 24 hours despite Mulayams opposition.Whenever Mayawati slammed or ridiculed Akhilesh, he responded cheekily by referring to her as bua.Immediately after losing 2017 assembly elections and getting dislodged from power, it was Akhilesh who first extended a hand for friendship to Mayawati to collectively fight against BJP. His slow and steady efforts finally matured into an alliance in less than a year.Akhilesh has not only managed to patch up with his arch political rival, but he is also wooing back the sulking seniors within Samajwadi Party . He recently called upon SPs founding member Beni Prasad Verma on his birthday after winning over his estranged father Mulayam after a family feud when he wrested all power and authority in the party.As SSP, OP Singh saw BSP-SP split, as DGP, he sees their coming togetherIt can be termed a fantastic coincidence. While DGP OP Singh is the head of the police force on a day the SP and BSP are coming together, he was SSP Lucknow when the two parties broke ties 23 years ago. When the infamous state guest house incident took place in June 1995, Singh as SSP had drawn severe criticism for letting the incident happen. Mayawati had survived the assault by SP members as senior BJP leader Brahm Dutt Diwedi had challenged SP leaders and walked up to her room to rescue her. Singh as DGP now is the choice of chief minister Yogi Adityanath who had recommended his name to the Centre."

This is mainly due to 43% higher sugarcane production across India.The prices are likely to drop further as there will be more supply of sugar against demand in the coming days.Chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Pankaj Patel told TOI, This year sugarcane yield is higher compared to last year. This year we alone have 56,000 acre of sugarcane crop that needs to be crushed.Last year, we were able to give farmers rate of Rs 3,954 per 100 kg. However, this year it would be lower by at least Rs 700-800 due to bumper harvest, he added.A local farmer from Surat district Ketan Patel said, We have huge quantity of sugar coming from neighbouring Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, which sells at Rs 3,000 per 100 kg. As a result, our cooperatives are compelled to cut the prices to compete with them in market.On the other side, sugar cooperatives have to make payment to farmers every 15 days. We need Rs 40-45 crore to pay the farmers. So we have to cut prices and sell the produce to pay the farmers, Patel said.Last year, government imposed 100% import duty on sugar as a result local farmers were able to get good price. However, this year with production up by 43% in the country, the demand would not be more than 250 lakh tonne against production of 300 lakh tonne, former chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Dilip Bhakta said."

Gujarat sugarcane farmers contribute about 8% of the total sugar produced in the country.Former chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Dilip Bhakta told TOI, Farmers are expecting drastic drop in sugar prices as there is much more sugarcane available for crushing. Government need to create a buffer stock of 15-20% of the production at a reasonable price. This would instil some confidence among the farmers and prices could settle down at Rs 3,400 per 100 kg.Chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Pankaj Patel said, Allowing export at zero duty could also do the trick. Many would be inclined to send their produce abroad at fair price and it would reduce the burden on local market. In addition, if government could come up with some incentive scheme for exporters, it would be even better.According to sugar cooperative experts, stock was piling up due to over production and unless government intervenes things wont improve.In sugar industry, there is a cycle of over production and shortage and somehow industry is not able to come out of it. It is time government to come up with permanent solution for the betterment of farmers, Bhakta said."

A note presenting all the proposals will soon be prepared to present to the Cabinet, said the statement.The proposal is to reduce the GST from 18% to 5%, Mr. Paswan told The Hindu , adding that the GoM would hold another meeting to finalise the details of the proposals. He said the government was looking for ways to incentivise value-added products, including molasses and ethanol, which could utilise the surplus harvest of sugarcane, and which would reduce the burden on the mills.The GoM is headed by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, and includes Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, as well as Mr. Paswan.Last month, the Food Ministry told Parliament that sugar mills had pending dues worth Rs. 13, 899 crore as on March 21. Industry lobbyist Indian Sugar Mills Association estimates that figure has now crossed Rs. 20,000 crore.Record highSugar production has hit record highs this year, crossing domestic consumption estimates and resulting in a crash in prices. According to ISMA data, sugar production up to April 15 stood at 299.8 lakh tonnes. Thats already 50 lakh tonnes more than the governments estimated sugar consumption for the whole season, and 227 mills are still crushing cane. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra had each produced almost 105 lakh tonnes by April 15."

He was perfectly certain that the country would bear the additional burden with the same spirit with which it had borne sacrifices far greater than money."
