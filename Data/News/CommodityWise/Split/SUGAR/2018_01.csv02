Current laws, however, prohibit any GM food  unless cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, a Union Environment Ministry body  from being sold in India.Through a 2007 notification, the Environment Ministry had exempted processed foods from this requirement. This has been stayed by the courts.There was also dispute between the FSSAI, a Union Health Ministry body, and the Environment Ministry on who checks if a particular food had a GE provenance.The companies will check the GM content and we will conduct further testing and checks, said Mr. Agarwal.The draft also defines safe levels of fat, sugar and salt in processed food."

Moreover, foods that exceed norms of sugar and fat will need to carry red and green labels specifying the extent to which they do so, according to draft regulations by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). This is the first time that the Centre has laid down guidelines for labelling genetically modified food. Officials say they are awaiting public comments. This isnt the final draft. There will be one more version and that will be reviewed for 30 days, said Pawan Agarwal, CEO, FSSAI."
5b17fbbd9855b75db2e7c1ff,GSTâ€™s complicated,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/gsts-complicated/article23797217.ece,2018-05-07,"With collections from the goods and services tax peaking at over Rs. 1 lakh crore in April, industry hoped the GST Council would make life simpler for an increasingly compliant tax-payer base. Indeed, at its meeting last week the Council decided to introduce a new compliance system under which a single monthly GST return will have to be submitted by firms, barring a few exceptions. However, this will only be done in a phased manner  with the first of three transition stages to begin six months from now. Discussions over simplifying GST returns have been under way for months and considered by the Council, a committee of officers and a Group of Ministers. Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Technologies, the firm in charge of the GST Networks IT system, has been consulted. Yet, the solution offered has gaps. For instance, in the second stage of the transition to simpler returns, buyers will get provisional input credit even if the seller doesnt upload the invoices. While this could lead to disputes, in the third stage input credits will only be granted after sellers upload invoices. If a seller defaults on depositing GST dues collected from a buyer and remains evasive, the authorities can reverse the credit availed by the buyer for such outstanding taxes.In any case, the timelines for the transition are long and bring fresh uncertainty for businesses still recovering from the initial jitters and confusion around the tax regime. Firms will again have to cope with significant changes in accounting software in the middle of the financial year. The Council, credited with swift and significant course correction in GST processes in its initial months, could have done more. The most troubling is the Centres push for the imposition of a cess on sugar over and above the 5% GST levied on it. A cess at the rate of Rs. 3 a kg is proposed to alleviate deep distress among sugarcane farmers. Not surprisingly, this faces opposition from several States. It has been rightly argued that this will burden consumers while favouring larger sugarcane-growing States like U.P. and Maharashtra. In addition, a special sugar cess will signal a looming breakdown of the basic tenet of GST: the abolition of such cesses and surcharges, barring the compensation cess for funding States revenue losses for five years. Along with a proposal to reward digital GST payments, this has been referred to new ministerial groups, which are to revert in a fortnight. Lastly, the decision to make the GSTN a 100% government-owned firm, instead of the present structure with 51% private ownership, explains neither how this will address data security concerns nor the impact on the Networks functional efficiency, which was the original stated intent for giving private players an upper hand in operations."

Palanichamy, State president of the association, alleged that though around 37,000 tonnes of sugarcane was crushed this season at the mill, it has failed to pay even the Rs. 2,550 per tonne of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) fixed by the Central government to all the farmers.It is a great tragedy that the Tamil Nadu government did not even bother to announce the State Advised Price (SAP) for this season. The mill must at least pay the FRP to all the farmers, but it has paid only a section of them, he claimed, adding that the mill also owed around Rs. 20 crore in dues to farmers over the last few years.Stating that multiple protests and representations to the government had failed to evoke any response, he said that the association, with the support of its members and all other farmers, will begin an indefinite sit-in protest at the mill from May 17 until the amount is settled.Revenue sharingThe association also strongly condemned the Tamil Nadu government for deciding to switch to the revenue sharing formula from next year to remunerate the process as per the recommendations of Rangarajan Committee. This will end up benefiting the privately-owned sugarcane mills and not the farmers, Mr. Palanichamy alleged.He said that, according to the recommendations, the sugarcane price will be fixed at around 75 % of the revenue realised by the mills from sugar and few other by-products produced by them. This is being done based on the pressure from the mills. There will be no transparency. Farmers will be forced to give up sugarcane cultivation because of unremunerative prices, he said."

5b185f819855b738ead08fed,Mechanisation of sugarcane farming only way forward  say experts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/mechanisation-of-sugarcane-farming-only-way-forward-say-experts/article24070819.ece,2018-06-03,"There is a growing consensus among experts and stakeholders that mechanisation  ranging from sowing to harvesting  is the way forward to tide over labour problems that afflicts sugarcane farming.As the crop is labour intensive, the profit margins of farmers are depleting and many of them are abandoning sugarcane cultivation in favour of other crops. A case in point is Mysuru district where cultivation of sugarcane, which was spread over nearly 30,000 acres three years ago, is down to less than 12,000 acres owing to lack of timely availability of water and labour.This came to the fore during a two-day conference of Sugarcane Research and Development Workers that concluded here on Saturday and saw participation by over 100 experts from different States.According to P. Thimme Gowda, Sridevi and K.V. Keshavaiah of the Zonal Agricultural Research Station, V.C. Farm, Mandya, almost 75% of the sugar production cost is attributable to the cost on labour, seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, and plant protection. As per their assessment, 134 manhours are needed to produce 1 tonne of sugar and nearly 25 to 35% of the total cost of production goes for labour. And for cane harvesting, they estimated that 850 to 1,000 manhours are required per acre.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association, said the cost of cultivating one tonne of sugarcane was around Rs. 3,200 and this included Rs. 800  the cost of harvesting one tonne of the crop. Besides this, there are issues related to non-availability of adequate labour force on time for harvesting and hence farmers too are supportive of greater mechanisation in sugarcane cultivation, he said.Mr. Thimme Gowda and others pointed out that the cost of conventional planting was Rs. 53,675 an acre, while that of mechanised cultivation with surface irrigation would be Rs. 46,600 an acre. They said it would further reduce to Rs. 38,850 an acre with mechanised cultivation and drip irrigation.But the downside, according to Mr. Shanthakumar, is the steep cost of acquiring the machines."

Somasundara has said that three years of drought has brought down the area under agricultural cover in Mysuru district.He was speaking at a meeting of sugarcane research and development workers in Southern Karnataka here on Friday.He said as against the availability of 1.54 lakh hectares for agricultural activities, the area under crop cover was only 1.14 lakh hectares and there was a shortfall of 40,000 hectares in terms of coverage.Mr. Somasundara attributed this to declining availability of water owing to drought and erratic rains since the last three years. Though there were major dams like the KRS and Kabini but because of poor storage water was not reaching the tail-end areas in the command area, he added.Farmers are aware of the problems and crisis plaguing sugarcane cultivation and hence are abandoning it, said Mr. Somasundara. While 11,500 hectares was under sugarcane last year, it was down to 4,500 hectares this year owing to the prevailing distress. In addition, the area under paddy was also coming down due to non-availability of water, he added.The official said besides water scarcity, there were other issues such as lack of labour. Hence, to protect the interests of farmers, the Agriculture Department was giving a lot of equipment through customised service centres. This, he said, would promote greater mechanisation and help address labour shortage plaguing agricultural sector.There was emphasis on micro irrigation and hence the authorities were spreading awareness on drip and sprinkler systems. Last year, the department distributed 11,800 sprinkler sets. It was not for sugarcane but for other crops, including ragi and cotton. More than 100 experts working on sugarcane are attending the two-day meeting with focus on enhancing crop productivity, increasing productivity and sugar recovery besides focussing on soil health.To protect the interests of farmers, the Agriculture Department is giving a lot of equipment through customised service centres.

Ajay Nagabhushan (second from right), Commissioner of Cane and Director of Sugar, releasing the compendium of research articles status paper, in Mysuru on Friday.M.A. SRIRAMThe State government will phase out low-yielding variety of sugarcane and replace it with high-yielding ones in three years to improve productivity and help augment sugarcane farmers income.This was stated by M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, Commissioner of Cane and Director of Sugar, here on Friday. Delivering the inaugural address of the 21st meeting of Sugarcane Research and Development Workers of Southern Karnataka, Mr. Nagabhushan said Karnataka has around 4 lakh hectares under sugarcane cultivation of which nearly 50% is under the high-yielding variety  in terms of productivity per acre and percentage of sugar recovery per tonne of sugarcane crushed. But cultivation in the remaining 2 lakh hectares is of the low-yielding variety, and this would be phased out.It will be done over three years for which the government plans to bring 2,000 hectares under the high-yielding variety this year (2018-19), 20,000 hectares in 2019-20, and the remaining in 2020-21.We are preparing the availability of seeds for the programme and the government has released Rs. 5 crore for the purpose, said Mr. Nagabhushan. When translated to revenue, this works out to an increase in farmers income by Rs. 16,000 per acre of sugarcane cultivated, he added.The scheme follows the Uttar Pradesh model where a similar programme was launched a few years ago, consequent to which the average State sugar recovery increased by 1.5% from a low of nearly 9.5%.The official also hinted at modernisation of sugar factories in the State under the cooperative sector, besides training of manpower through a separate programme to be initiated by the government. He said there were nearly 60 sugar factories in the State while 30 more were likely to come up this year. This indicated that there was scope for improvement in productivity given the capacity increase in irrigation.The two-day meeting of sugarcane research and development workers is being jointly organised by ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, UAS-Bengaluru, and sugar industries of the region."

In the meanwhile, Mohan Kumari has been making regular tours of the constituency.The event held on Monday was attended by seers from Lingayat mutts, family members and senior Congress leaders including chief minister Siddaramaiah A Lingayat leader, Mohan Kumari is a first-time MLA who was elected from Gundlupet last year. The launch of her campaign to retain her seat comes amid speculations of her son Ganesh Prasad eyeing a ticket. However, the sight of the united family at the memorial event where Mohan Kumari announced her intention, had sent a strong message.Recollecting his long association with Mahadeva Prasad, Siddaramaiah said, He was loyal and disciplined. These characteristics prompted me to entrust him with major assignments. Although he was the district in-charge minister for Chamarajanagar , whenever I wanted some work done in Mysuru, I would ask him to shoulder the responsibility.The CM launched the book, Mahaprasad that lists the accomplishments of the late minister.Public works minister HC Mahadevappa, junior pontiff of the Siddaganga Mutt Siddalinga Swami, Mummadi Nirvana Swami of Kanakapura Degula Mutt and Chamarajanagar MP R Dhruvanarayana were present at the event.I want to live to be a 100Siddaramaiah, who turned 70 last year, expressed his desire to live to be a 100 years old.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the proposal will be sent to the lieutenant governor for his approval.Delhi has 72 lakh ration card holders who have been getting their subsidised rations from a network of 2,254 fair price shops. Notorious for siphoning off rations, these shops were made to start using electronic Point of Sale devices (e-POS) from January 1 this year. However, the proposed doorstep delivery will increase dependence on manpower to distribute essentials like grains and sugar among the beneficiaries, many of whom live in slums.The government says some of the intended beneficiaries do not get their rations when the e-POS system fails to read their biometrics. The fate of the contractor hired to maintain the e-POS machines and monitor the distribution of rations is now uncertain.The proposed switch to doorstep delivery will not be easy as e-POS was implemented after a cabinet decision duly approved by the LG. Now the previous decision will have to be annulled with the LGs approval.Chief secretary Anshu Prakash and other senior bureaucrats attended the cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal . Later, during a press conference, Sisodia described the decision as a major transformation of the existing PDS system. He said the system is riddled with corruption, theft at different levels, erratic functioning of ration shops and dilution of the quality of rations.The path of the scheme has been full of hurdles. Even in the cabinet note which was finally approved, enough attempts were made by people with vested interests to obstruct the proposal, Sisodia said.Last week, Kejriwal had blamed a deep nexus between some bureaucrats and the ration mafia, for resistance to the home delivery scheme. Sisodia had alleged that officers working under the influence of the ration mafia were delaying it.The scheme is related to food for the poor. I want to urge the LG to not obstruct it on the basis of comments by some officers, Sisodia said.The delivery will be done by a private company selected after bidding. The modalities for packing, monitoring the quality of the rations, and ensuring hassle-free delivery at the doorstep would be worked out in the process of implementation, a government official said.This decision comes amid the ongoing tussle between the political executive and the bureaucracy in Delhi. AAP MLAs have been claiming that ration was the point of dispute between them and chief secretary Anshu Prakash on the night the latter was allegedly assaulted at the CMs residence.Unlike last weeks meeting, security personnel were not stationed outside the meeting hall. Although the atmosphere seemed cordial, officers said they will continue to boycott meetings with the political executive while attending cabinet meetings that are necessary for governance. Even on Tuesday, officers at the secretariat and in field offices observed their daily five-minute silence in protest against the alleged assault on the chief secretary."

Led by Palwal MLA Karan Singh Dalal, the Congress MLAs raised slogans while accusing the state government of forcing cane growers into bankruptcy.Khattar advised the Congress legislators to maintain the dignity of cane growers. He discouraged them to follow such practices.In the assembly, heated arguments ensued between Congress MLAs Dalal, Kuldeep Sharma, R S Kadian and agriculture minister O P Dhankar, social justice minister Krishan Kumar Bedi and labour minister Nayab Singh Saini over the plight of cane growers. The ministers claimed that the cane growers were being paid the highest price in Haryana and their produce was being procured by the sugar mills of the state, which were told to operate for two more months after the end of the crushing season.Sharma, Dalal and Kadian reiterated the government rider in procuring sugarcane on the state advised price (SAP). The increased price is just an impression as farmers are not able to sell their entire produce on those rates, hence they are forced to take sugarcane to the mills in Uttar Pradesh. Despite bearing the cost of transportation, the farmer is forced to sell his produce at throwaway prices, said former speaker Sharma.Like the zero hour, the discussion on governor Kaptan Singh Solankis address also attracted criticism from Congress MLAs. Referring to law and order, Sharma accused the government of failing to control the entry of Dera Sacha Sauda followers in the state when Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted of rape in August 2017. First the government allowed the dera followers to assemble in violation of the orders. Later, it used paramilitary force to control the mobs resulting in 38 deaths. Similar was the scene in the case of violence during the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016. One MP, who provoked all, was set free, the police acted as a mute spectator and the action by paramilitary resulted in the deaths of innocent, he alleged.Odd man outTek Chand Sharma, the lone BSP MLA of Haryana, seems to be the odd man out. Notwithstanding the fact that his party supremo Mayawati had been taking a stand against BJP and its leaders, Sharma was all praise for chief minister Khattar and the saffron partys rule in Haryana."

""I chose this topic for research since diabetes is rising in the developed as well as developing countries like India, at a rapid pace. I am in my third year. If my research is successful, the future implications of it would be a possible development of beta cells that produce insulin. This would particularly help diabetic patients who either cannot produce insulin (type 1 diabetes) or become insulin resistant (type 2 diabetes). We are still trying to validate how beta cells will differentiate and respond to different molecules of the signaling pathway,"" Amtul told TOI from London on Tuesday.Amtul said her research on diabetes involves investigating Wnt/PCP signaling pathways in the beta cell differentiation. ""This pathway regulates many bodily functions including the development of organs such as pancreas which produces insulin and glucagon hormones that regulate sugar in the body,"" she said.The Wnt pathway regulates the development and differentiation of many organs in the body such as lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas and also regulates the alignment of cells and how a normal organ would develop without any defects, she explained.

For regularising illegal colonies, the MLAs sought a time-bound policy, saying they wanted a policy to enable registration of ownership rights for long-held tenancy properties.Meanwhile, the CM announced that the SC post-matric scholarship in government and private colleges, which had been cleared in the audit inquiry conducted to weed out fake enrolments, had been disbursed up till January 2018. He also promised in-toto implementation of the report of the expert group set up to examine ways to revive defunct sugar mills in the state.Members from Nawanshahr sought release of funds for pending dues of sugarcane farmers, on which the CM said the issue was being addressed. Some members asked for softening of CLU conditions for setting up rice-shelling units to boost industry and employment opportunities. Ludhiana MLAs expressed concerns over the pitiable condition of the 16km Buddha Nala and encroachment of government and corporation land, to which local governments minister Navjot Singh Sidhu assured of early steps to initiate the process of recalling encroached land.Most MLAs wanted better education infrastructure in their constituencies. Traffic concerns, sewerage problems, shifting of dairies and bus stands and stubble burning were some of the other concerns raised by the members. Members also wanted higher allocation of funds, in the budget, for research and prevention of cancer, as well as for pollution control programmes in the state. There were suggestions to further engage with Punjabi NRIs to encourage them to harness industrial and investment opportunities in the state to boost overall development. Amarinder said his government was working hard to partner with the NRI community to push progress in the state."

The project will be implemented on a pilot basis in Sattenapalle mandal of Guntur district and based on it the project will be extended to remaining parts of the state.Giving a serious thought to chief minister Chandrababu Naidus instructions to encourage healthy food habits, the civil supplies department has readied a plan to slowly replace white rice with brown rice from PDS shops. Several studies have shown that white rice is one of the chief culprits in spreading diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in the state. Brown rice is best for health and hence we decided to go for it, said civil supplies minister Prattipati Pulla Rao.Incidentally, it was TDPs first government under NT RamaRao that launched Rs 2 per kg rice scheme in 1983. The move had revolutionised the food habits of the state. People, who used to consume millets particularly in rural areas, suddenly shifted to rice after NTRs rice scheme started.Rs 2 per kg rice was started keeping in view the poverty in those days. Although, it helped achieve the goal to some extent, it turned into a villain over the years, said social activist SVS Lakshminarayana. The NTRs rice scheme has brought the consumption of jowar, raagi and other millets to zero while people fell in love for more white, silky and shiny the rice, he felt.We need to switch to the old days. We strongly advise people to go for brown rice to reduce the risk levels, said Dr VV Ram Kumar, a noted diabetologist. He said an Indian study showed brown rice lowers risk of rising blood sugar at least by 20 per cent when compared to white rice.When polished rice grains loose outer bran and germ layers it results in the loss of many vital nutrients and fibre in the bran. It is left with starchy endosperm which is easily digested and increases blood sugar, analysed Dr Ram Kumar."

Many of them fall even while theyre flying and get themselves injured. Birds often panic seeing their own wounds and die of cardiac arrest. Therefore, we use old socks to cover their faces during treatment.Using an old sock is important as its elastic has loosened, allowing the bird to breathe while covered. A new sock wont serve the purpose, she added.Many donors have been regularly donating socks as well as towels to JCT. Women members of the residential society I stay at, collect socks and old towels on a monthly basis and donate it at Jivdaya. Were able to collect at least 25-30 pairs which amounts to some 50 socks which can be used for the birds, said Priyanka Gadhvi, a resident of Shilaj.Ive kept cartons at my house where friends, neighbours and acquaintances come and drop their old socks, which I later donate to the organization. This way, I can contribute in my own way to the cause, said Jolly Patel, another donor and a trustee of the organization.Side by side, the volunteers also distribute water pots for free as part of their weekly campaign. It is time we do our bit for the birds. Thus, we distribute water pots during our weekly campaign usually conducted on Sundays. We also educate people to put a pinch of oral rehydration solution (ORS) or a pinch of salt and sugar each in the water bowl so that sodium-potassium balance is maintained, said Pratiti Desai, a student of GNLU who volunteers with JCT."

As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues worth Rs 1,913 crore.Restive cane farmers have threatened an agitation. Why should farmers be punished for improving their production? asked Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Sanghatana. We will launch an agitation outside the sugar commissioners office in Pune if the dues are not cleared by mid-June.The sugar belt in Western Maharashtra , which has the highest concentration of sugarcane and factories, owes the most to farmers.Mills in Pune division owe around Rs 843 crore, while those in Kolhapur division owe Rs 506 crore.Sugar factories in the Aurangabad circle owe Rs 237 crore.Caught in a bind, claim sugar millsWe have issued notices to defaulting factories but will wait before taking further action since they are making an attempt to pay, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.Nationally too, the glut is a crisis. The estimated output this year is 320 lakh tonnes, 58% higher than last year, according to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF). Sugar prices have dropped from Rs 3,600 to Rs 2,750 per quintal. And pending cane dues to farmers are estimated at Rs 20,000 crore. More than half these dues are from Uttar Pradesh, Indias top sugar producer.The sugar mills say they are caught between the price crash, which has eaten into their funds, and the fee set by the Centre to be paid to cane farmers at Rs 2,550 per tonne. This is known as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP).We are making losses of Rs 825 per tonne. Besides FRP dues, we have to pay for harvesting and transport worth Rs 650 crore, which is not included in FRP calculation in Maharashtra, said a representative of Maharashtras Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. Also, 71 cooperative factories owe banks around Rs 650 crore. These have been converted into short margin and need to be repaid before factories can regain the sugar stock hypothecated to banks.The Centre has increased import duty to 100% and removed export duty. to boost exports and reduce stock. We are hoping government helps control prices by declaring a price under Essential Commodities Act and retains a 30 lakh tonne buffer stock, said Prakash Naiknavare, MD of NFCSF. The industry is also hoping for an increase in the Rs 55 per tonne cane incentive."

However, such discrepancies in the medical measurement instruments lead to incorrect diagnosis, which also affect the treatment.There are possibilities that a healthy newborn baby is mistakenly deemed as under-weight due to the discrepancies in the weighing scale. It is mandatory under Legal Metrology Act that any measuring instrument used in public business should be certified by the department, Swamy said.Unfortunately, the hospitals barely take note of the mandatory rule and attain or renew the necessary certification from the department. Back on May 28, sleuths raided some private hospitals in Vijayawada and booked 10 cases against them for not holding appropriate certification from the department. Officials also stated that they are planning to conduct inspections at the hospitals in the state soon to curb these violations.However, there are practical problems within the legal metrology department like staff crunch, which throw up a challenge to the enforcement activities. The department has more than 200 vacancies from the existing sanctioned strength and they have been looking for additional sanctions to strengthen the department for the last 18 years.From blood sugar tests to BP tests, all the medical measurement scales are supposed to attain the certification from department after testing it. Exemptions exist on the instruments used for scientific researches, which do not require legal metrology approvals. Lack of compliance from the medical community also stands as a significant revenue loss to the state government."

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had on Friday given licence to tap and market neera to the farmer producer companies and also to one in Pudukkottai district.Chairman of Vinayaga Coconut Producer Company PK Padmanabhan said the firm had applied for the licence about three months ago. It has been tapping neera and making neera sugar as part of research, he told TOI. We had been conducting trials by supplying neera to local outlets in juice dispensers to keep it cold. We plan to introduce neera in tetra packs so that cold chain transportation would be easy, he said.There are two methods to arrest the fermentation of neera and prevent it turning into toddy. One is to keep it in cold storage and the other is to add an anti-fermenting solution to the drink, which would make it possible to store it in room temperature. Both the farmer producer companies in Coimbatore have opted for the cold chain process, as adding the anti-fermenting solution would alter its taste, said an official from the agriculture marketing department.Padmanabhan said the company would need at least two acres to set up the plant. We would need the equipment for cold storage and packing. Setting up a plant would need at least Rs 2 crore, he said.A coconut tree can yield up to 5litres of neera depending on its health and age. At present, a litre of neera is being sold for Rs 125, he added.Chairman of the Coimbatore Coconut Producer Company RA Sakthivel said the company consisted mostly of small farmers, who found it difficult to tap neera and store it in cold conditions. As we have now acquired the licence for producing neera, we hope the farmers would be benefited, he said. The company has more than 1,800 farmers under it while Vinayaga Coconut Producers Company has more than 2,000 farmers.The companies have been asked to submit proposals for setting up the plant to the horticulture department this week. The proposals would be forwarded to the collector. After the collector clears them, the proposals would be sent to the secretary of the horticulture department. Officials of the department said they were planning to get funds for the companies from the National Horticulture Mission.The chief minister, in a release on Friday, said that value-added products such as neera sugar, neera jaggery, neera honey, neera chocolates and neera cakes would provide employment in rural areas and also increase farmers income."

His utterance about Sitas birth had gone viral on social media and invited nationwide criticism, compelling the BJP leadership to ask him to exercise restraint.Taking a dig at the saffron party and PM Narendra Modi , Gohil also said he never used either God or his mother to gain mileage in electoral politics. He said there were people in Indian politics who get their mother queued up for voting to get peoples sympathy and mileage in vote politics. I personally take care of my mother. I will never ask my mother to stand in a queue just for the sake of vote politics, he said.Gohil said former President Pranab Mukherjee , who has been invited by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to its Nagpur event, would surely caution the Sangh parivar of the dangers involved in the divisive policy they are pursuing to win elections.He said Bihar tops the country in terms of youth power with 58% of its population below 25 years of age. He, however, lamented that the youths in the state were frustrated and directionless owing to hollow promises of PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar.Modi had won 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a number of promises and all have turned out to be mere jumlas (gimmick). Be it two crore jobs per year to unemployed youths, remunerative prices to farmers or revival of closed sugar mills in Mithilanchal, all have remained distant dreams even after four years of the NDA government at the Centre, Gohil said.He said more jobs were provided to the youths each year during the tenure of former PM Manmohan Singh than PM Modi has been able to provide during his four-year regime so far.Accusing the Modi government of failure on all fronts, Gohil cited the steep fall in GDP due to ill-conceived demonetisation, ill-implemented GST resulting in incalculable damage to small and medium industries, prevailing uncertainties in the banking sector, ever-increasing farmers suicides, price rise on account of unprecedented hike of excise duty on diesel and petrol.Modi ji has an obsession for power and he can go to any extent for that, alleged Gohil, who attended an iftar organized by party MLA Bhawna Jha here on Sunday.Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh , who was also here, said the state is being run by two engines which, instead of being in sync with one another, are pulling in opposite directions, resulting in a situation where law and order is at its lowest ebb, farmers are in acute distress, education is in a mess, contractual employees are agitating and corruption has assumed phenomenal dimensions."

We have raised the issues with the government and there is a need to consider our case. Delay in taking measures will impact the industry and payment of arrears to the farmers as well, said a source.The increasing sugar glut, falling prices and farmers arrears touching Rs 22,000 crore has put the government in a catch-22 situation.

While the saffron brigade tried to polarize the atmosphere by raising Jinnah portrait issue in AMU, rising cane dues not only neutralised its impact, but also made farmers rise above the caste and communal divide.Even PM Modi's promise to bring relief at a rally in Baghpat a day before polling failed to fetch votes for the BJP The BJP had gone full throttle in Kairana, with CM Yogi Adityanath leading the poll campaign in four rallies.The party has 18 MLAs, all Jats from the region, and Kairana is the territory of state sugarcane minister Suresh Rana. In addition, BJP organisational secretary Sunil Bansal along with UP ministers and general secretaries had been supervising the campaign.Despite its rigorous campaign, the Central and state leaderships of the BJP failed to gauge the simmering anger and anguish in west UP over mounting cane dues and escalating fuel prices. Kairana has six sugar mills - four private and two run by cooperative societies - and their arrears have spiralled to Rs 796 crore. Sugarcane is the sole source of livelihood for lakhs of farmers in this region. And unlike other regions, these cane cultivators hold sway in state politics and economics. Farmers had been holding demonstrations to demand payment of cane arrears. In fact, a farmer had died while protesting in Baghpat just a day before voting.Ajit Singh's Rashtriya Lok Dal sensed the mood on the ground as it went from village to village. The party focussed on Jat pride and also mobilised the farmers' anager against the Yogi government. RLD carefully avoided falling into the communal agenda stoked by the saffron brigade. ""While touring the districts we realized the anger among farmers against the BJP government. We appealed to the farmers to rise above caste and not fall into BJP's communal trap and instead focus on their issues,"" said RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary. ""Our slogan was to defeat Jinnah and fight for ganna,"" he told TOI.The joint Opposition vigorously raised the issue of cane arrears amounting to Rs 13,000 crore in the poll campaign. ""Rs 13,000 crore cane arrears indicate poor governance in the state,"" said a senior UP bureaucrat who has also served in cane department.The saffron brigade's attempts to polarise voters in communally sensitive west UP also failed. In his speeches, Yogi had attacked Akhilesh Yadav by saying ""his hands were soaked in blood of Muzaffarnagar communal riots"".The party also raked up the issue of exodus of Hindus from the region in the aftermath of Muzaffarnagar riots. The Election commission had also lodged an FIR against a BJP MP for using unsavoury language against Muslims."

The police, he complained, acted as a mute spectator. Instead of taking any action against the goons, the police pressurized me to cancel the programme, he said.When he could not get access, Khaira blamed chief minister Amarinder Singh for trying to shield his former minister.Due to release of polluted waste, residents of surrounding villages are suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer, hepatitis, blindness etc, claimed Khaira and alleged that the mill had dug several large bores of more than 500 feet within its premises for waste disposal.By doing so, the mill has contaminated ground water. The water of surrounding villages has been polluted to such an extent that it cannot be used for drinking and irrigation purposes, he claimed.Amarinder accused the AAP leader of trying to trespass into the factory and warned that any attempt to take law in his hands would be dealt with as per law.Accusing Khaira of indulging in cheap street politics for media and public attention ahead of the Shahkot bypoll, the chief minister said it was obvious that AAP leaders had not learnt a lesson from their series of ignominious electoral defeats, not just in Punjab but across the country. He said Khaira had behaved extremely irresponsibly with his shameless act, adding that as the leader of the opposition, it was Khairas responsibility to uphold the law and not defy it.Rana Gurjits son Rana Veer Partap Singh, who is a director of the company, lashed out at Khaira for allegedly running a malicious campaign.Challenging Khaira to prove even one allegation, Veer Pratap claimed that the firm was running strictly according to the norms of the environment ministry and pollution control board and had all the mandatory clearances.He denied that Khaira was stopped from visiting the mill premises. It is so characteristic of Khaira to resort to theatrics and create a hype and eventually beat a hasty retreat, taking one excuse or the other, said Veer Partap."

The five grains of sugar are the five people who made his otherwise unremarkable life in a nondescript village worth reminiscing. The story highlights the relationship he shares with the characters  his action-movies obsessed mother, poetic uncle, Pundalik, an elderly man called Radhe, his school hero, Raghu , and an unnamed truckwala friend. how he discovers their importance when faced with a predicament, forms the crux of the play.: The play begins with Rajkumar being in a dilemma  a problem that he is being dragged into by his poet uncle. With an aim to find a solution, Rajkumar involuntarily revisits the nuances of his relationships with the five grains of sugar in his life, one after another, and gives shape to the plot. The way the script smoothly oscillates between the characters, introducing them to the audience, speaks volumes about Manavs skills. Its not easy to hold an audience for 80 minutes with a monologue. And director Saurabh Garhipurikar tried every trick in the book to achieve that feat in this Udaan Production. From thoughtful stage direction to the right play of light and sound, everything strived to ensure the audiences focus doesnt meander. Scenes where the protagonist talks about Pundaliks poems, recalls the memories of his mothers red ribbon and recollects his admiration for Raghus fashion choices, are all well sketched and managed to captivate the audience, taking them on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.For an actor, it is relatively easy to bring out emotion as per the script. but to repeat it with the same intensity, impeccably, is a difficult task. But Siddhesh Dharmadhikari as Rajkumar did a neat job in this regard. His apt expressions, intonation, dialogue delivery not only helped establish Rajkumars outlook towards life, but also managed to etch every character in the minds of the audience giving them shape, demeanour and persona. If Siddhesh failed anywhere, its in making the character his own, as Manavs resilient script keeps taking over, making you forget that you are listening to the actor, and not the playwright.: Shakkar Ke Paanch Dane is an uncomplicated personal journey of a village commoner without a distinct goal or direction. The protagonist embarks on the paths that lie ahead of him and in the process, gets to learn about himself. This being the ninth staging of the play, the rough edges in technicalities and acting have been polished off, but undoubtedly, the hero of the play is the captivating script that deserves a thumbs up."

The state government has already submitted a proposal in this regard to the central government, he added.Chairing a review meeting in the wake of the recent molasses spill in the Beas, after a leak in a sugar mill in Gurdaspur district on May 17, the chief minister directed the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to monitor all industrial units and act against those found discharging untreated industrial waste into rivers.He emphasized on keeping a strict vigil on untreated industrial effluents which flow into the Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana, and Kala Sanghian drain passing through Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar. Local government minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, environment minister OP Soni and revenue minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria attended the meeting.The chief minister said none of the 64 water and sewage treatment plants in the state was functional when the Congress came to power last year. The number of functional units has gone up to 18 now. By the end of the year, 40 of these plants would become operational, said Amarinder.Describing the recent Beas river pollution as an accident resulting from record production of cane this sugar season, Amarinder said the central government was also expected to ensure that the right amount of cane was produced and sold to the mills for sugar production. He attacked Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA and leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira for indulging in cheap politics over such a serious issue. AAP leaders like Khaira are only interested in getting their pictures printed in newspapers through cheap publicity tactics, he said."

It has been planned for the forthcoming kharif season. Excess water in Kanhan and Sur rivers that otherwise goes into Gosikhurd dam will be tapped in these schemes. The VIDC will develop a water network and related infrastructure from these schemes to beneficiaries in phase-II at the cost of Rs 470 crore, he said.Under phase-III, the VIDC will repair and augment right and left bank canals of Totladoh irrigation reservoir at the cost of Rs 300 crore.Official sources told TOI that water crisis will increase manifold during kharif and rabi season if works get delayed.

There are nearly 17 lakh voters in the constituency with a significant number of Muslims, Jats and Dalit voters.RLD party worker Abdul Hakeem Khan said he had never seen an election in which the ruling party was being challenged by a joint opposition.""This is the beauty of our democracy,"" he said.The constituency fell vacant after the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh, whose daughter Mriganka Singh is now the party's candidate for the bypoll. She is fighting Rashtriya Lok Dal's (RLD) Tabassum Hasan , who is supported by the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.The opposition hopes that by consolidating anti-BJP votes, they will repeat the success of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections, where the ruling party suffered an unexpected defeat.The withdrawal of candidature of Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan from the fray and his joining of the RLD has only added to the opposition's confidence.The ruling BJP, on the other hand, is making extra efforts to retain the seat to try and send a strong message to voters, party cadres as well as the opposition parties -- that the drubbing in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections was an aberration, and that it was still strong in western UP.""The results of the May 28 bypolls may set the tone and tenor for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections ,"" Rajesh Kumar Saini, manager of a hotel on the busy Shamli-Panipat road, said. .Khan exuded confidence that ""Kairana's daughter-in-law Tabassum Hasan will defeat Kairana's daughter (Mriganka Singh).""The Yogi Adityanath-led state government has left no stone unturned in campaigning for the bypoll. He along with his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya campaigned in Saharanpur and Shamli.Apart from them, the BJP has thrown in at least five state ministers into the 'fight for Kairana'. They include Dharam Singh Saini (minister of state for Ayush), Suresh Rana (sugarcane development minister), Anupama Jaiswal (basic education minister) Surya Pratap Shahi (agriculture minister) and Laxmi Narayan (religious affairs, culture, minority welfare, waqf and Haj minister).Of these, Saini and Rana are MLAs from Nakur and Thana Bhawan assembly segments, respectively of the constituency. Jaiswal is the minister in charge of Shamli district, while Surya Pratap Shahi is the minister in charge of Saharanpur.""Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has been roped in since he hails from a farming background,"" a senior UP BJP leader said.BJP MPs Sanjiv Baliyan, Raghav Lakhan Pal, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar and Kanta Kardam have also actively campaigned for Mriganka Singh.The SP and Congress, however, termed the line-up of UP ministers as a sign of ""party jitters"".According to the locals, the major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers.RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan had accused the BJP-led state government of resorting to divisive politics.""Sugarcane growers in the region are feeling the maximum amount of pain, as no payments have been made to them by the state government,"" she told PTI, rejecting the official claim that the dues from sugar mills were being cleared.The issue was also raised during an election meeting of state minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, who said that the dues accumulated from the time of the past governments had been paid out, and the rest would be settled soon.""In Uttar Pradesh, 10,828.59 lakh quintals of sugarcane were purchased by sugar mills from farmers during the BJP government in 2017-18, as compared to 6443.41 lakh quintals under the Samajawadi Party government in 2015-16. Similarly, Rs 21,186.56 crore payments were made during the BJP government in the state in 2017-18, in comparison to Rs 11,841.34 crore made during the SP government in 2015-16,"" BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said.Divergent views also emerged on the reported 2016 exodus of Hindu families from Kairana.""The area is adjacent to Panipat district in Haryana. The labourers (both Hindus and Muslims) from the area go to the neighbouring state to work in the industries there. They go in the morning and return in the evening,"" Hasan said while rejecting the claims of any such exodus.The RLD leader said the locked houses, even of Muslims who had gone to Panipat for work, were photographed and used as a ""propaganda"".""In Kairana, both Hindus and Muslims live in peace,"" she added.BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, on the other hand, said, ""The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped now. But hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment before the 2017 UP Assembly elections"".Apart from Kairana, bypoll to Noorpur assembly constituency in the state will also be held tomorrow."

Singh had applied for VRS in March but it is yet to be accepted.Kumar enjoys the trust of Prime Ministers Office and was sent to the state on PMOs initiative.After Kumars retirement, two senior most IAS officers in the state will be Anoop Pandey and Pravir Kumar. There are other claimants too for the post of the chief secretary, but the BJP governments recommendation for probe into the sale of 21 sugar mills during BSP rule may thwart their chances.Sources in the government said Singh is most likely to remain APC till his retirement. For APC post, four senior IAS officers are in the waiting  Rajive Kapoor, Chandra Prakash, Sanjay Agarwal and Sanjiv Sharan.While the bureaucratic reshuffle at the top level may get delayed, chief minister Yogi Adityanath is expected to effect changes at the principal secretary level. Some ministers have also expressed their displeasure over the functioning of their principal secretaries .Free from Karnataka campaigning, Yogi is also expected to transfer principal secretaries to ensure speedy implementation of the central and state governments welfare schemes in the run up to next years general elections."

Cotton production fell by a steep 39% mainly due to pest attack by the pink bollworm, which devastated the crop across regions.One crop to thrive was the water-guzzling sugarcane, which saw a rise of 34% over the previous year and has contributed to a bumper nationwide production. Kharif is the main agricultural season in Maharashtra , in which three-quarters of farming is done. The states monsoon was 84% of normal last year, but in July 2017 dipped to 72% and in August to 77% of normal. But compared to five-year averages, production of kharif food grains and pulses saw a slight increase of 9% in 2017-18.Crop credit dips 40%, pushing farmers towards loan sharksThe decline in the production of food grains compared to 2016-17 was mainly because of a dry spell and uneven rainfall, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Bijay Kumar has said.In addition, the output of rice was affected by an attack of sucking pests and cotton was impacted by the pink bollworm pest, he said. Farm activists point out that its not just crop production which has declined, but also the prices of farm produce.Prices for most crops are lower than they were last year and farmers are facing larger debts. Crop loans from banks have declined by 40%, so, farmers have had no option but to turn to moneylenders, said activist Vijay Jawandhia . The production of kharif cereals declined by 4% compared to the previous year and oilseeds by 15%, estimates from the state agriculture department show.The production of rice declined by as much as 22% over the previous year. In 2016-17, the state saw a bumper production of tur dal, pushing up pulse production figures.In 2017-18, tur production in the kharif season declined by 49% and moong production by 37% compared to the previous year. Within kharif oilseeds, soya bean production dipped by 15% and groundnut by 11%. Sesamum (sesame is the best-known member of the genus) declined by 48%.In the rabi season (winter crop), cereal production saw a 30% decline in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, while the production of pulses dropped by 10%, estimates show. The state has seen a dramatic rise in sugarcane production, reaching a historic record of over 107 lakh tons.Nationally too, the country has seen a major rise in sugar production. But this has depressed prices and led to sugar mills not being able to clear farmers dues."

Sources in the state government said excise department was required to check sugar mills regularly for production and sale of molasses, which is used as a raw material in distilleries. The preliminary inquiry report has confirmed that the spillage was caused by a blast in one of the boilers installed at the sugar mill, which damaged the pipes that linked the boiler to molasses storage facilities.It also confirmed the mill lacked safety measures which could have prevented the molasses from leaking into the river. The board will now determine the quantity of molasses stored inside the mill, owned by Chadha Sugars and Industries. For this, it has asked excise officials to join the probe.Sources said PPCB would be asking the industries department to establish if it had conducted regular checks to ensure safety measures were in place at the mill. We will submit a final report to the state government on Thursday, only after getting all the inputs, said sources.The department is suspecting the molasses which leaked into the river could not have been washed away by the release of fresh water and some of it had settled on the riverbed, causing additional damage to the entire river system downstream Kiri Afghana village, where the spillage and occurred.CM wants update todayPunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh , on Wednesday, warned against any laxity or leniency in the May 17 molasses spill in the Beas River and directed agencies concerned to vigorously pursue legal and penal action against the offenders.

While Dr Usha Didwania was installed as the president, Dr Renu Rohatgi will be the vice-president, Dr Nibha Mohan the secretary and Dr Neelam will be the treasurer.The average menopause age in India is 47.6 years. The female body stops generating oestrogen harmone after the natural cessation of menstruation. Apart from controlling the menstrual cycle and physical changes during pregnancy, oestrogen also helps keep the bladder lining and the urethra healthy and strong, said Indian Menopause Societys national president Dr Ratnabali Chakraborty.Older women experience weakening of pelvic floor muscles which are responsible for bladder control, resulting in urinary incontinence. At times of coughing, sneezing or lifting heavy objects, leakage occurs through the weakened muscle. It is called stress incontinence, Dr Chakraborty explained and advised such women not only to conduct pelvic muscle exercises but also to control diabetes if they are diabetic.They can also opt for surgery to lift the sagging bladder. That may solve the problem, she said, adding menopausal women are more predisposed to health issues caused by metabolic syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that manifests itself after the body stops generating oestrogen.These health issues include increased blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, weight gain and high levels of cholesterol, which increases their chances of experiencing heart stroke, Dr Chakraborty said and underlined the importance of lifestyle management from an early age to prevent such post-menopause complications."

This was the second time that the woman had undergone the embryo transfer to get pregnant.The presence of an embryo within the yolk sac is an indication that the embryo is growing well and that the risk of a miscarriage has decreased, doctors say.

Her diet is also being prepared under the guidance of a nutritionist.The hospitals gynaecologist Milind Telang said, The woman is on immune-suppressants which makes her prone to developing diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension.There are other concerns in the pregnancy with a transplanted womb that include intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery.The hospital was following a strict antenatal monitoring, its gynaecologist and in-vitro fertilisation expert Pankaj Kulkarni said."

We knocked at the office of chief minister for an audience, but the CM was in Karnataka , chairman of a sugar mill in west UP and member of Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), told TOI on the condition of anonymity.This is first time when dues of cane-growers have risen to over Rs 11,000 crore in the recent past. It requires immediate government intervention to resolve the crisis, failing which the sugar industry might collapse, said a special secretary-rank officer in sugar department.The sugar mills, under the banner of UPSMA, are planning to submit a written memorandum to the government stating that they would have to shut down their units if the situation continues.Farmers in west UP have started protesting over delay in cane payments.All efforts to contact sugar minister Suresh Rana proved fruitless as he was in Kairana for the bypoll campaigning.Principal secretary, sugar, Sanjay Bhoosreddy , however, played down the claims of sugar millers and said that they were just trying to mount pressure on the government so that they could delaying payment to cane farmers which the government would not let happen.Bhoosreddy said that everyone knows that cane and sugar production has been high this year and that sugar prices would rise once the crushing season gets over."

Sugar sold at the rate of Rs3,000 per tonne only one-and- a-half month ago, was now being quoted Rs2,500 per tonne. Sugar cooperatives feel excess production of sugar to tune of 80 lakh tonne in the country means its rate could further fall much to their detriment.The annual requirement of sugar in the country is about 250 lakh tonne and this year the total production is about 330 lakh tonne. Next years opening would be at 120 lakh tonne because of the excess stock, Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Ltd managing director Pankaj Patel said.Industry will suffer unless an aid package is not given and buffer stock created. Farmers and cooperatives are both going to lose heavily. The cost incurred by cooperatives to produce a tonne of sugar is Rs3,500 but it is selling at Rs2,500 per tonne, Vatariya Sugar Cooperative Ltd chairman Sandip Mangrola said.Each cooperative has declared rate of Rs2,300 to Rs3,100 for farmers. We have to add harvesting, transportation and processing cost of Rs1,200 per tonne to this. So the total minimum cost is Rs3,300 per tonne, Mangrola said.The Central Government recently increased import duty on sugar from 50 to 100 per cent. Yet the imported sugar still costs Rs2, 600 per tonne.We expect sugar rates to go down further from Rs2,500 per tonne in the coming days. Only heavy demand can save the sugar cooperatives, Patel said.At present, sugar is selling at the rate of Rs40 per kg in the retail market. If the situation doesnt improve and the wholesale rate of sugar remains at Rs2,600 per tonne, then the price could further fall in the retail market. Market experts said sugar could be selling at the rate of Rs32 per kg in the next three months.A retail shopkeeper of Varachha said, We expect the rates to go down. It will become steady at around Rs32 per kg mark by the time festival season starts."

The order to inquire into the irregularities, fix Chaudharys liability and recover the sum from him was issued in last January, under section 93 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961. In June 2016, the cooperative registrar had issued a show-cause notice to him in this regard.Chaudhary moved the high court, but a single-judge bench turned down his petition. He filed an appeal before a division bench, which has also refused him relief. The bench, however, stayed its order for a month so Chaudhary can move the Supreme Court.According to the registrar, a loss of Rs 41.83 crore was caused by three irregularities or misdeeds by Chaudhary as the chairman of Dudhsagar Dairy.A loss of Rs 22.50 crore was caused by providing 13,731 metric tonnes of cattle feed to the state of Maharashtra during a drought.Some 21.57 lakh kg of cattle feed was found to be missing on September 15, 2015. This was either not bought at all  its price being Rs 2.06 crore  or was siphoned off.The dairy bought sugar between April 2012 and January 2014 without following proper approval at higher-than-market rates, causing a loss of Rs 17.26 crore.The inquiry into the sending of cattle feed to Maharashtra revealed that Chaudhary was liable for the decision. Inquiries into the two other decisions will begin as the HC had earlier stayed them. Chaudhary was removed from the post of chairman by a court order. He was also barred from contesting elections for six years by the registrar, but the SC struck down that order."

Now, suddenly it has ordered a CBI probeHaving audited the sale of sugar mills and detecting a loss of over Rs 2,000 crore in 2011-12, the CAG had submitted its report to the state assembly in 2013 which handed it over to the public undertaking committee (PUC) for giving its view for action on the report. The PUC is the committee of the state assembly comprising senior members of the house which deliberates on the CAG reports on the functioning of the public sector undertaking. After seeking the government's views on the reports, it recommends action .The CAG report indicting the core group of secretaries for disinvestment (CSD) for overlooking glaring irregularities in the sale of 21 sugar mills, had been submitted before the state legislative assembly in 2013, but hardly anything has moved in the past five years. Governor Ram Naik had been prodding the state governments from time to time to act upon the reports of various agencies on corruption cases also, but to no avail.During SP rule between 2012 and 2017, the PUC was first headed by the party's senior MLA Uday Raj and then by Shakir Ali. In present government, BJP's Ram Chandra Yadav is the chairman. Whether it was the Akhilesh Yadav government or of the Yogi Adityanath , the PUC failed to draw any conclusion on the CAG report which has nailed a dozen top bureaucrats for not applying their due diligence, causing nearly Rs 2000-crore loss to the state coffers.Both SP and BJP had promised stern action on irregularities in sugar mills deal, but in practice, they hardly moved an inch by stating that since the matter was pending before the Supreme Court - which was hearing a PIL on the issue- the PUC was waiting the verdict of the apex court.""It indicates that either successive governments were passing the buck or bidders which bought the sugar mills were so powerful that first they go the mills for much below the price and then succeeded in stalling action on CAG report for five years,"" says a retired bureaucrat, pleading anonymity. ""Now, for whatever reason, if BJP government has recommended the CBI probe into the scam, one hopes those responsible for causing a huge financial loss to the state would be brought to book,"" he adds."

Multiple bidders had common directors, common shareholders, common addresses, common email IDs and phone numbers, but these glaring facts were ignored. These interlinked companies had formed powerful cartel to buy 21 sugar mills at a dirt cheap price, the report, tabled in assembly during the previous SP rule, adds.Despite a laid down procedure and a method to scrutinize bid documents, top IAS officers of chief secretary and principal secretary ranks didnt follow it and allowed the private bidders to literally walk away with sugar mills, the report says.In a disparaging remark, it adds: ""There was a lack of competition which affected the realization of fair value of sugar mills. In respect of these mills only Rs 166.85 core could be realised against expected price of Rs 291 crore. This resulted in short realization of Rs 124.70 crore.""""IAS officers in various committees formed for the disinvestment of the sugar mills of UP State Sugar Corporation Ltd (UPSSCL) and Uttar Pradesh Rajya Chini Avam Ganna Vikas Nigam Limited (UPRCGVN) wilfully chose to overlook even the net worth of bidders. The core group of secretaries for disinvestment (CGD) did not look into the fact that after purchasing the sugar mills how some of the companies would fund it as their net worth was far below the cost of the sugar mill they were bidding for. It seems a good number of bidders were proxy for other major groups to take away the sugar mills, on paper for themselves, but in reality for their masters,"" the report says.The report highlights on page 34 (para 5.2) that two firms which bid for the mills had the same address of New Friends Colony in Delhi mentioned on bid documents. Not only this, even the demand draft of Rs 50,000 attached with the bid documents were issued by the same bank on July 16, 2009 and bore the consecutive serial numbers - 528450 and 528451. The bid documents of these two firms also had consecutive serial number - 119636 and 119637 - of bank guarantee forms issues by the same bank on the same date.When the state government replied to the CAG that there was no opportunity to know about bank guarantee at the time of evaluation of bids, the CAG refused to accept the excuses of the government stating everything was available on the records of the companies.Not only the bank drafts, bank guarantees, directors and the share holders were common, the CAG investigation found even the common address, phone numbers, e-mail ID and correspondence address of Sarita Vihar , New Delhi, mentioned by two bidders in their EOI cum RFQ and financial bid was same. Besides, address and the phone number mentioned on the letter head of one bidder was the same as the work unit of another bidder.The CAG report highlights that in contravention to these guidelines of disinvestment, certificates depicting the paying capacity of the applications were not demanded by the management form the bidders. Two firms made payments which far exceeded their net worth but the management made no effort to satisfy itself about the source of funds of buyers and ensure fairness in bidding process to rule out its participation as a proxy of other bidders.Three bidders though did not meet the net worth criteria fixed on June 18, 2010 remained in the fray and purchased one, four and three mills respectively.

This unusually viscous dark brown coloured pungent liquid after recovery of alcohol.If let out untreated, it can cause huge damage to the soil, groundwater and rivers.Now for the first time, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) in Bhavnagar has developed a technology that not only extracts potash fertilizer (potash is generally imported at present in the country) besides getting nutritious cattle feed binder. Most importantly they extracted pure water from the toxic waste.Industry experts have estimated that nearly 8-15 litres of toxic spent-wash is generated from production of each litre of ethanol. Realising this problem and the largescale environment damage the toxic waste was causing, in 2015, CSIR-CSMCRI director Dr Amitava Das formed a team of scientists with Pratyush Maiti, Dr Somya Haldar, Dr Subarna Maiti and Sanjay Patil to explore the possibility for utilizing the spentwash from distilleries as a potential resource for potash fertilizer along with recovery of residual organics.The process will also provide a major impetus to the production of cleaner ethanol blended fuel production. Today, our countrys current capacity can produce just 3% ethanol- blended fuels.If the CSIR-CSMCRI process is adopted, we can produce as much as 10% blended fuels as government will clear expansion of existing distilleries and allow new units, said Maiti.The first pilot project of the CSIR-CSMCRI process was executed at Kamrej Sugar Mills in Navi Pardi in Surat, while the first commercial deployment of the process plant will be operational at Aurangabad Distillery Ltd in Maharashtra.Maiti said that the spentwash is generally expelled by the distillerys fermenter blocks and consists of suspended organic and inorganic matter with high toxicity. The non-sugar portion of this coffee brown liquid is coagulated to precipitate out potassium and then converted to potassium sulphate, potassium nitrate and monopotassium phosphate to be used in fertilizers. Whatever is left is evaporated to recover pure water which is recycled back into the distillery plant.A normal 60 kilolitres per day distillery plant utilises 600 to 650 cubic meter of ground water, out of which 500 cubic meter of water can be recovered through this process and recycled, said Maiti. He added, In our process nothing gets wasted. We extract a nutrition binder in cattle feed that replaces molasses, the distilleries will not be extract groundwater or pollute our precious river resources, said Maiti."

About 6,000 undergo kidney transplant whereas 60,000 undergo haemodialysis.Dr Bakshish Singh , senior consultant, nephrology department, said with the easy availability of haemodialysis facilities at every district level civil hospital and many private centres, it has become very important to focus on the quality of the dialysis being provided to the patients.One of major reasons behind the meet is to create awareness among the people about the quality of haemodialysis treatment by using standardized techniques and operating methods. The newly available dialysis techniques like Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) were also discussed in detail. The medical specialists informed that the last decade has seen an epidemic rise in diabetes & hypertension leading to a huge increase in the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). As per the latest Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) report, prevalence of diabetes has risen to 7.5% in rural India and up to 28% in some urban parts of the country.Another point of concern is the relative early occurrence of kidney involvement in diabetics (20-40 years age group) in our country. To compound the problem further, majority of diabetics in India have a very poor blood sugar control. Patients who develop kidney failure are mostly unable to benefit from proper recommended therapy because of economic reasons. However, with the increasing availability of dialysis in government hospitals, there is some hope for the underprivileged kidney failure patients."

As part of the project, we get blood tests of patients done to check haemoglobin and blood sugar levels. Our doctor examines the patients for various diseases, and accordingly, they are given treatment and free medicines. The patient has to pay just Rs 10 for the treatment. We have a mobile health van that would initially go to each of the nine villages twice a week, but now the same small module goes to 19 villages a week, said HS Phoolka.We have a general physician Dr Baldev Singh Chahal (who retired from the army), staff nurse Sumanpreet Kaur , lab technician Karamjit Singh, and helper Arashdeep Singh as part of our team. Every day, we provide treatment to more than a 100 villagers. The team tours the villages which dont have a dispensary, said Phoolka. He added that the cost of healthcare for each village comes to around Rs 2 lakh a year, which is quite less.Phoolka said as their volunteer Amritpal Singh (28) had died of a heart attack, in his memory they got an ECG machine for the cardiac screening of villagers. The machine was inaugurated by Amritpals mother at his village in Talwandi Khurd. Dr Chahal said they cater to the primary health needs of the villagers and those with acute problems and chronic diseases are diagnosed and sent to tertiary care hospitals for treatment. After examining the patients, we give them medicines for various diseases, including blood pressure, sugar, joint pains, skin diseases, and anaemia. About 90% of the households in these villages have availed the facility, said the doctor.Phoolka said the cost of running the small mobile health module is low, as they dont have to pay infrastructure cost, as they hold such camps in dharamshalas and gurdwaras. He added that they would be spreading the mobile module in other villages of his constituency. The AAP leader further said the programme was undertaken as part of Gyan Sewa Trust, of which he is founder-member.Meanwhile, villagers are happy with the health system. My daughter would have gastric issues, and we would normally take her to hospitals where the cost of treatment would be higher. But they have to pay just Rs 10 for treatment in their village.

However, Mayawati had claimed that the sale order for the sugar mills was issued by Siddiqui, who was later ousted from the party.The Yogi Adityanath government referred the alleged scam to the CBI on April 12, and asked the agency to look into the entire sale proceedings of 21 sugar mills, including use of bogus companies and documents in the purchase of seven closed mills in Deoria, Bareilly, Laxmiganj, Hardoi, Ramkola, Chittauni and Barabanki.In its notification, accessed exclusively by TOI, the Yogi government sought a CBI probe as the culprits could be from outside the state. Uttar Pradeshs principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar told TOI, There were certain discrepancies in the sale of around 21 sugar mills, which were auctioned. The probe has been handed over to CBI.Sources told TOI that CBI has already started reviewing documents related to the sale and FIRs could be registered very soon. The agency will look into the role of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen involved in the scam. The UP government has shared with the CBI an FIR registered at Gomti Nagar police station in November 2017 against two companies which bought mills  Namrata Marketing Pvt Ltd and Girasho Company Pvt Ltd, which sources said were bogus, and the enquiry report of the state government.The sale of sugar mills at dirt cheap prices was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) as well.It is alleged that the then Mayawati government had sold the 21 mills, of which 10 were operational, at rates much lower than the market price. Besides machinery, these mills were built over 500 hectares worth Rs 2,000 crore according to present day rates.The Mulayam Singh Yadav government, in 2004-05, had tried to sell 24 state-owned sugar mills but the move was stalled due to an intervention by the high court.The Akhilesh Yadav government didnt take any action in the scam between 2012 and 2017 despite a CAG report. Adityanath, immediately after coming to power, had said he would probe the matter as nobody can be allowed to sell such government properties at dirt cheap rates as the property belonged to the people."

Kulkarni, a former MLA is the lone Brahmin candidate fielded by BJP in the 86 constituencies of north Karnataka.BJP enjoys the support of Brahmins. While it has not given the community its due share while distributing tickets, it has also failed to rope in the Niranis and make them support a Brahmin candidate in Shrikant Kulkarni. BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa could have ensured that there are no hurdles to Kulkarni from Niranis,  said a BJP leader from Jamkhandi.Murugesh Nirani, who was elected from Bilgi in 2008, lost the seat in 2013. He owns a sugar factory in Mudhol and has contact with people in Jamkhandi. Fearing another backlash in Bilgi he had tried for a ticket from Jamkhandi but BJP refused to accept his plea for a change in constituency.Niranis youngest brother Sangamesh, who has political ambitions, had also tried for a BJP ticket from Jamkhandi. When the party did not oblige, he entered the fray as an independent.Murugeshs younger brother Hanumanth is a BJP MLC. Now the entry of Sangamesh against the official BJP candidate has drawn criticism. BJP has suspended Sangamesh from the party.Sangamesh is wooing voters by all possible means and he would cut into BJP votes and spoil the prospects of Kulkarni. Murugesh Nirani should have compelled his brother to withdraw from the polls, said Sadanand, a BJP activist in Jamkhandi.Kulkarni is facing Siddu Nyamagouda of Congress. After winning in 2008, Kulkarni had lost to Nyamagouda in 2013 as KJP had eaten into his vote bank. This time, the presence of Lingayat Panchamasali candidate in Sangamesh may come in the way of Kulkarnis chances of victory.Rebellion in Cong camp tooNyamagouda is also facing a rebellion from Shrishail Dalawai, who belongs to Kuruba community. Dalawai enjoys chief minister Siddaramaiahs support and it is to be seen how much he will spoil Nyamagoudas chances.

And, unlike last year, when the return forms were rushed in at the last minute, the Centre and the states agreed to roll out the new mechanism in six months to ensure adequate preparation for the transition.The council also decided to turn GST Network GSTN ), the agency that provides and manages tech platform for the indirect tax, into a wholly owned government company but agreed to provide flexibility by allowing hiring of professionals at market-linked salaries. Decision on two other issues  cess on sugar and incentives of up to Rs 100 for digital payments  were deferred.These will be discussed by two separate ministerial panels, which were constituted late Friday evening. While the incentives are meant to wean away consumers from cash, at least two states, including West Bengal raised concerns. The GST Council meeting, which was chaired by FM Arun Jaitley , who joined the deliberations through videoconference, opted for single monthly returns for all taxpayers other than composition scheme dealers and those with zero liability, who will file returns every quarter.Those in the quarterly filing segment account for around 30% of the GST returns filed, finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia said. To ensure that there is no pressure on the system, the return filing dates will be staggered, based on the turnover of the registered entity. Adhia said the present system of return filing through GSTR 3B and GSTR 1 forms will continue for up to six months.On January 16, TOI was the first to report about the planned shift to a single monthly return. But a final decision was delayed as all stakeholders were not on board. Finally, a ministerial panel headed by Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi opted for a fusion model that was cleared by the council on Friday.The decision on converting GSTN into a wholly owned government company, however, went ahead without much debate and it was decided to get HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, NSE Strategic Investment and LIC Housing Finance to give up their 51% stake.Eventually, the Centre and states will hold 50% stake each.

The cess would have helped government raise Rs 6,700 crore.During discussions on the cess, which stretched for over two hours, these states, with support from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Pondicherry, argued that imposition of a cess on sugar will also make other states such as Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab demand a similar benefit for rubber, jute and foodgrains. There will be no end and will defeat the very purpose of GST, said a source, adding that some of the finance ministry officials were also sympathetic to this argument. While introducing GST, the Centre and the states decided to abolish all cesses and surcharges other than compensation cess (covering luxury and sin goods) for a period of five years.FM Arun Jaitley said after the meeting that cane growers were in deep distress as the cost of sugar production is over Rs 35 per kg, while the market price of sugar is around Rs 26-28 a kg. The cess on sugar was proposed to raise money to compensate farmers for a loss due to surplus production.The states opposing the cess suggested that UP and Maharashtra, which are grappling with the problem, should provide budgetary support as the move is only going to benefit sugar mills in their jurisdictions, although the cess will be paid by consumers across the country to help farmers.A panel under Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma , along with ministers from UP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, will deal with issue of levy of cess on sugar and reduction of GST on ethanol and is expected to submit its report in a fortnight.Jaitley said that the discussions have thrown up several new aspects. How are such contingencies to be addressed in the GST regime, are they to be addressed by imposition of cess or are they to be addressed by temporarily increasing the tax or by some alternative method of revenue raising?The ministerial panel would make a recommendation to the council on the avenues to raise revenue to meet contingencies of this kind where the cost of commodity is much higher than its selling price."

In the 2017 edition, the Swiss food giant used Times Groups POP initiative to attract creative agencies to work on promoting the cause of #EducateTheGirlChild. After the successful campaign, Narayanan is now upping the ante by using the print medium innovatively to spread credible information about childrens nutrition.What was the impact of the first edition of Power of Print, which centred on sending more girl children to school?It was a pioneering initiative for both Nestle and TOI. We took on a theme that was important to build some collective responsibility and inspiration around the campaign of sending more girls to school. Print continues to grow because it is tangible and has credibility. Print builds opinions over a period of time. We were very heartened by the response we had on the first POP.Why did you choose to focus on childrens nutrition in the second year?It goes back to the roots of the company. In the current over-informed society, we noticed that there is a paucity of credible and authentic information on nutrition. As a country, we have a dual problem of nutrition, which is obesity on one hand and on the other, we have children who are deprived of basic levels of nutrition. The whole area of nutrition needs to be objective, factual, proactive and helpful to consumers. Instead, it sometimes turns out to be emotive, less accurate, and fake news.Will we see a change in Nestle Indias strategy with respect to childrens nutrition?For us, improving the nutrition content of our products has been a continuous journey, whether its the reduction of sugar levels or the reduction of salt in Maggi range of products or even fortification of our products. We are striving to ensure the nutrient credentials that we shall offer over a period of time continue to improve.What is the difference between developed markets and India with regards to thechildrens nutrition?The level of awareness in developed countries of what is good nutrition and what is adequate or robust nutrition for children is well understood because of the levels of education and dissemination of adequate information. It is also due to the involvement of the government and other interest groups. In India, awareness of nutrition is becoming stronger day-by-day although its largely an urban phenomenon. Thats why we looked at this theme for POP.When should organisations similar to yours use print as a medium ofcommunication?For me, there are compelling reasons why marketers should use print. If you take the spread of print in this country, the fact of the matter is, print provides a platform for communicating brand related information in a targeted manner. Second, there are many Indias within India. The country has regional and local nuances which are best capitalised with print medium. The time for print has been there, continues to be there and like an evergreen hero, print will be around for a long time."

However, Olpad farmers claimed that by that time, it would be too late to save their crops.In the last rotation, our area was supposed to get water from March 29 to April 19. However, the supply began from April 3 and continued till April 15. The very little quantity of water was supplied that was insufficient for crops, Patel told TOI.This has happened for the first time, so we asked them to release last rotation for us from May 1. However, they are unwilling to do that. If they dont release water, we would be left with no choice but to commit suicide, claimed the former BJP MLA from Olpad.Currently, Ukai dam has 1,304 million cubic metre (MCM). Out of this, nearly 450 MCM of water would have to be released for irrigating 2 lakh hectare of land during the last cycle in May.The last cycle will start from May 10 as at many places the water is needed by May 20. For sugarcane and vegetables, this is ideal as it leaves 20-25 days gap before the rains arrive, superintending engineer, Surat irrigation circle, S Mahakal said.An official from irrigation department said the current issue does not affect all the farmers of Olpad, but a few from villages like Barbodhan, Bhandut, Pinjrat and others."

While all mills in Bihar have stopped crushing, few mills in Punjab and Haryana are still operating.The record production of sugar has resulted in sharp fall in prices of sweetener and huge losses to mills. Industry is currently at a loss of Rs 8-9 per kg as mills' average production cost is about Rs 35 per kg while ex-mill selling rate is Rs 26-27 per kg.To bail out the sugar industry, the government yesterday announced that it would pay Rs 1,540 crore to cane farmers directly on behalf of sugar mills. The total cane dues to farmers is about Rs 20,000 crore.Earlier, the Centre had doubled import duty to 100 per cent and scrapped export duty on sugar.

The official then closed down the warehouse to compensate for the Rs 33 crore arrears due to the cane farmers.As the attached stock of sugar would no way compensate for the arrear amount of Rs 33 crore, the state should take over the the sugar mill till the entire arrears would be settled to the farmers.

Last week, the treating doctors found him fit for discharge. Sources said the RJD leader, serving jail term in fodder scam cases, had sought time till Monday.However, on Monday, when Lalu was being told to prepare for discharge, he wrote to the AIIMS director that he was still unwell. ""I want to apprise you that I suffer from heart disease, kidney infection, sugar and many illnesses. I have back pain and repeated bouts of dizziness. I have even fallen in the bathroom several times, the RJD president wrote.He also mentioned in his letter, which was tweeted by his son Tejashwi Yadav , that Ranchi's Birsa Munda jail (where he is lodged) and RIMS do not have facilities to treat kidney-related ailments and that AIIMS should not force him out under ""political pressure.""If I am sent to Ranchi Medical College from AIIMS and it endangers my life, you will be held responsible for that, Lalu said.However, AIIMS maintained that he doesn't have any serious medical condition.

We constituted a board of senior faculty members from departments of medicine, surgery, cardiology, endocrinology and nephrology for his care. He was put on injectable antibiotics and then on oral antibiotics. His blood sugar was controlled and evaluation for cardiac and renal status was done. He showed significant improvement.

5b1b53069855b76d57039306,Need to make & use ethanol to empower farmers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/need-to-make-use-ethanol-to-empower-farmers/articleshow/63978807.cms,2018-05-01,"Ours is an agricultural country, and this is the reason the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee mandated mixing of 5% ethanol with petrol in India in 2003. The objective was to protect environment, save foreign currency, and empower our agriculturists by giving them another source of income.However, today, instead of mixing petrol with ethanol, doping is being done. Instead of scientifically mixing petrol and ethanol during manufacture, oil companies just add 300 litre of ethanol to 2,700 litre of petrol in each of the four compartments of oil tankers. Ethanol being denser, settles down instead of completely mixing with petrol, and causes many problemsEthanol has affinity for water, and when it comes into contact with water or moisture, it forms a mixture that separates from petrol. This causes problems in many vehicles in monsoons. Moreover, private companies are not bound to mix ethanol in petrol, so there are no traces of water in their petrol, which fact these companies use to defame PSU oil manufacturing companies and petrol pump owners. These issues needs serious consideration.Ethanol is basically alcohol, and when mixed in petrol, it helps petrol burn completely. This reduces pollution, which is why countries like Brazil and developed nations mix up to 25% ethanol in petrol. But it has some drawbacks too.Ethanol produces less energy than petrol, so it creates a load on the engine and damages it. It also rusts iron equipment, harming petrol tanks and silencers. It also melts rubber, which also leads to petrol leakage from vehicles. This is why America and some other countries have started mixing Butanol in petrol instead of ethanol.However, ethanol being agricultural based product, the agricultural sector and farmers should get benefited. But that is not the case.Today, average production cost of petrol is Rs 25 per litre. The Central government has fixed cost of ethanol at Rs 49.50 per litre. So, PSU oil companies bear a loss of Rs 2.45 per litre when mixing 10% ethanol in petrol. This is the reason they are not mixing the two scientifically, but just throwing them in together. Private oil companies take benefit of this to advertise their products.Hence, the ethanol blending scheme has moved away from its main objective. Even the government admitted in the Rajya Sabha that this scheme is empowering industrialists and not for agriculturists. The production cost of ethanol is Rs 36.20 per litre, and sale price is fixed at Rs 49.50 per litre, but sugar cane farmers are owed crores of rupees.Also, agricultural produce worth Rs 92,651 crore is destroyed after harvest every year due to lack of storage, transport, planning in production, and poor produce. No wonder we see news of potato, onions, brinjals and other fruits and leafy vegetables being discarded on roads. Even food grains decompose in yards. Every day, we waste food costing Rs 244 crore, enough to feed every American, yet crores of our countrymen remain hungry.Even if the food is going waste, we can generate ethanol out of agricultural produce and food. This will employ many in rural area, and help make agriculturists financially sound.However, we are stuck on producing ethanol from sugar cane only. Sugar cane producers are getting good income as entire sugar cane yield is processed. But, other agriculturists are not getting price for their crops, and are left indebted. This is due to lack of facilities for processing various types of other crops into ethanol.Even today, liquor is distilled illegally in rural areas from mahua flowers, jowar and other millets. Ethanol production facilities will curb such illegal activities, and generate employment.The Union government has a target of increasing ethanol percentage in petrol to 20% till 2020. But, we are far from achieving this due to non-availability of enough ethanol. As against a need of 300 crore litre ethanol for mixing in petrol, we produce only 161 crore litre. Unfortunately, industrialists are attempting to import ethanol, or even make it from bamboo.We should instead look at Brazil and America, the largest producers of ethanol, which manufacture ethanol from unused fruits, leafy vegetables, food, food grains and solid waste generated in urban areas. We need to create this infrastructure to help fulfil the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to empower agriculturists, peasants, and cultivators.The author is former MLA, ex-minister"

We will place all the three proposal before the Cabinet , food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters after the meeting on Monday evening.Sources said government will soon take a call on the quantum of sugar cess per kg that could be levied, while the production-linked subsidy could be of around Rs 5 per quintal of sugarcane, which would be debited to the farmers account directly.Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the proposal to reduce the GST on ethanol will definitely be pushed since this is a clean fuel for automobile. We have assured that the petroleum ministry will ensure procuring the entire ethanol that millers will produce, Pradhan told TOI.The proposals have come amid allegations from some farmers in Western UP and Haryana that millers have stopped issuing indents.

In a bid to find quick relief, people buy anti-acidity drugs, often the most potent ones, over the counter, which is a dangerous trend.The process of digestion involves the breakdown of food through the hydrochloric acid, which is naturally present in stomach. Health experts said frequent use of anti-acidity drugs can neutralize the effect of hydrochloric acid produced naturally by the stomach and alter the entire process of digestion. This can also cause kidney damage and osteoporosis.Regular use of such drugs without the supervision of professionals can alter the absorption of important elements like zinc, iron and chromium. The production of digestive enzymes will be hampered and, in the worst case, it can lead to kidney damage, said city-based physician Dr Diwakar Tejashwi.According to medical experts, anti-acidity drugs are mainly of three types  stomach acid neutralisers, or antacids that provide quick relief in the short term; H2 blockers that provide relief for up to 12 hours by inhibiting histamine, the stimulus for acid production in the stomach; and PPIs that produce greater acid suppression by preventing the acid from being secreted into the stomach.Doctors have advised people to prefer natural eatables like bananas, melons and coconut water to avoid the chances of acidity during the hot days. Dr Ramesh Kumar, a gastroenterologist at All India Institute of Medical Sciences AIIMS ), Patna, said the main reason behind stomach related ailments during summer was consumption of substandard edibles from roadside eateries.Water and food-borne bacterial infections, especially amoebic dysentery and diarrhoea, increase manifold during this time of the year. The major symptoms of such diseases are vomiting, food poisoning, loss of appetite, dehydration, constipation, heartburn, bloating and low blood pressure. To avoid such risks, one can avoid eating fried food items, cheese and the ones containing citric acids like tomatoes, tea, colas, coffee, as it can cause heartburn, Dr Ramesh said.He added small precautions can curb the risk of such diseases. Eating stale food, irregular meals and overeating can often lead to indigestion. Keep well hydrated and look for mineral water which contains bicarbonate as this aids digestion and reduces acidity, advised Dr Ramesh.According to general physician at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Ravi Kirti, mild digestion syrups can be taken in case of extreme restlessness as they protect the stomach lining and provide instant comfort to unbearable gastric symptoms. One should carry rehydrating salts before moving out in sun, by adding six teaspoons of sugar and half teaspoon of salt to a litre of water. Instead of relying on medicines, people should consume seasonal fruits and vegetables to keep their stomachs happy, Dr Kirti said."

The decision to shift the machinery is being resisted by a panel, Khand Mill Bachao Sangharsh Committee, and AAP. After it turned into a loss making unit, the sugar mill was closed 12 years ago in 2006. The struggle committee and AAP want the government to explore options to revive it.Three days ago AAP had started a dharna outside the mill, where AAP Faridkot MP Sadhu Singh and Jaito MLA Baldev Singh had sat on Saturday. Earlier, AAP MLA and leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira too participated in the protest. Khaira said his party would not allow the government to sell off the mill. Besdies, Sadhu Singh, MP, said that, The cooperative sugar mill was the only industry in the area. The government should make efforts to revive the mill so that employment could be generated and crop diversification could be achieved by making fames to plant sugarcane.As the machinery is being shifted to the Bhogpur mill in Jalandhar, we learnt that the state government wanted to earn money by selling plots of Faridkot mills land through Puda . We will not allow the government to sell the state resources, the KMBSC member Jiwanjot Kaur.On the other hand, Manpreet Badal on Friday had said that the issue of revival of mills would be discussed in the cabinet meeting. Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of the Congress said that, Only oudated machinery is being shifted out from the sugar mill. The government is trying for its revival. The cabinet sub-committee has hired a consultant, who will conduct feasibility study regarding chances of its revival. The study may be completed in a couple of months and only then any decision would be made.The cooperative sugar mill was set up in Faridkot in 1988 over nearly 50 acres. A total 136 acres were acquired for the mill, which was fed by farmers of Faridkot, Moga, Ferozepur and Muktsar districts. Nearly 4.5 lakh tonne sugarcane was crushed each season from October to March. There were 183 regular employees and 239 seasonal. On March 10, 2006, the mill was closed under liquidation after incurring losses. It was subsequently declared a sick unit and since then the machinery turned into junk, a former mill employee told TOI.Since then, almost all liabilities have been paid, including the payment to nearly 200 employees under voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and stakeholders. A part of the 136 acres was transferred to Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA). Plantation of sugarcane has also stopped in the entire area. On June 11, 2014, the state cabinet headed by the then chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, had put its stamp on the closure of the sugar mill.Bhogpur cooperative sugar mill general manager Bhupinder Singh Gill, who also holds charge of Faridkot mill, said that, The state government gave people nearly four years to explore options to revive the mill but it is not possible as the area farmers have stopped planting sugarcane. The machinery here has become obsolete and only a part of it will be used at Bhogpur. The employees of this mill have all obtained VRS, barring one."

Of 43 mills in the state, seven did not crush any cane during the current season due to low cane availability or financial difficulties. Others have either completed crushing or are about to complete it.""I havent seen anything like this in my living memory,"" said Palani G Periyasamy, chairman of Dharani Sugars and South India Sugar Mills Association (SISMA). Mills operated for 300 days in a year a few decades ago. ""This year we will be lucky if we operate for 60 days,"" said a senior SISMA official.The impact has had a spiraling effect on sugarcane farmers, many of whom havent got their cane arrears from some mills. With an estimated cane availability of just 75 lakh tonnes, sugar mills are operating at just 20% to 25% of their rated capacity.The industry is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to factors like failure of monsoon, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills.The impact of the downturn faced by sugar mills is so severe that the state which consumes nearly 15 lakh tonnes of sugar a year will have to import 9 lakh tonnes this year. ""Sadly, for markets like Sankaran Koil (in southern TN), we are getting sugar from Maharashtra,"" the SISMA official said. As if adding insult to injury, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are projected to have a bumper crop which makes it viable to move sugar from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu The sugar season starts in October and ends in the following September. ""This year while some mills have finished their cane crushing in February some have done it in March,"" industry officials said.From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in 2011-2012, crushing fell to 119.04 lakh tonnes during sugar season 2016-2017. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes.Adding to the woes of the already stressed mill owners, sugar prices have crashed  prices hover around Rs32,000 per tonnes now.The TN sugar industry is burdened with massive debts which it finds difficult to service and repay. Some loans categorised as SEFASU 2014 and Soft Loan 2015 have been taken for payment of FRP (fair and remunerative price) during those seasons since sugar prices witnessed a massive fall and not for creating any asset, officials said.With piling cane dues, the Rs290 crore sugar industry in the state is hopeful that the budget announcements of an incentive package for the industry will help it tide over the crisis.The government has announced a revenue sharing formula for sugarcane growers in its budget. It will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present state administered price (SAP) of Rs2,750 per tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers, said finance minister O Panneerselvam while presenting the budget.A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the cost of sugar for the mill is Rs4,000 per tonne, (at 25% capacity utilisation) while the selling price is Rs3,200.Introduction of Revenue Sharing Formula for sugarcane pricing, assures fair and remunerative price for the farmers and also enables farmers to get additional revenue over and above FRP, when the realisations from sugar and by-products move up. ""It is a boon for the sugarcane farmers as they are guaranteed of a minimum price and would get their due share out of higher sugar price in market and there would be certainty of payment. This also brings stability to the sugar industry since cane prices will get linked to realisation from sugar and its byproducts,"" said Periyasami."

She had Rs17,000 in her account in the Central Bank branch.For three days, she stood in the queue at the bank branch, but failed to withdraw her money which she needed for treatment of her illness. On the fourth day, she fell and died while standing in the queue again, Kunal said.The enraged locals blocked road and Dhamdaha SDO had to announce an ex gratia payment of Rs20,000 to her next kin, but the money has not yet been paid yet, Kunal added. He said the cash crunch has hit several other districts.Kunal also said CM Nitish Kumar has for the first time admitted after several years that the land problem is the biggest challenge facing the government and instructed the officials to expeditiously solve the land-related problems.The irony, however, is that the district administrations concerned have been evicting the poor from the land in their possession in West Champaran, Kunal said, adding the erstwhile Bettiah Raj and sugar mill owners have thousands of acres of land under them, but no action was being taken by the administration against them to free the land.Kunal said the CM should implement the land reform measures in the backdrop of the recommendations of the D Bandyopadhyay committee that he himself had constituted."

Unfortunately, social media posts have led to people believe that one must eat whatever one wishes. It is false, he said.Dr Hiremath on Saturday was speaking on Lipid Management at the two-day Central India Cardiology Conference . Cholesterol is required for many body functions, but when excess, it creates a problem, he said.Liver produces 70 per cent of cholesterol. If the liver produces more or if it is not able to uptake excessive cholesterol, there will be high levels of LDL in the blood. Sugar and fatty foods contribute 30 per cent of LDL, which finally get converted into fats, said Hiremath, adding that bad food habits and inherent problems both contribute to LDL.If ones LDL is high, it will result in heart, brain, kidney problems and atherosclerosis. One has to be aware about a good diet  red meat, egg yolk is bad. Animal protein, cereals and legumes are good, he said.The doctor further explained that sugar is worse than fats because it is responsible for blockages. Dietary restriction would include controlled fat, controlled carbs and high protein. That is the diet all of us should be eating at all ages, whether young or old, he said.Use of statins to reduce cholesterol levels is also advised, said Hiremath, calling it a miracle drug. He said, If body is not able to reduce cholesterol, statin comes to the rescue. It has saved maximum lives, only after antibiotics.Hiremath also spoke about a new discovery called PCSK9 inhibitor, a once-a-month injection which is twice as effective as statins. Indian companies have come forward to make this intra-muscular injection, which brings down LDL levels dramatically, he said."

The sugar glut has brought the ex-mill price down to Rs 26-Rs 28/kg, against the cost of production of Rs 36/kg.Sources said after issuing a few warnings to the sugar mills for non-payment of cane arrears to the farmers, the government has realised the surplus production, falling global prices and huge losses being suffered by the mills need to be addressed. The meeting will deliberate on each issue. Until and unless there is price correction, there will be no improvement. The government has to take some bold decisions quickly, said an official, who did not wish to be named.The sugar production has crossed 30 million tonnes against the domestic consumption of about 25 million tonnes."

His advocate has appealed to the court, saying Lalu needs three more months for treatment of various illness related heart and kidney in advanced medical centres. Lalu, who has been convicted in four fodder scam cases till date, is undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Delhi, under judicial custody.Lalu had filed petition for the provisional bail in all the three fodder scam cases in which special CBI courts have convicted him during the last four months. The cases are related to fraudulent withdrawal of money from the Dumka, Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries. In 2013, Lalu had been convicted in another fodder scam case related to the Chaibasa treasury.The hearing for the provisional bail for the cases related to Deoghar and Dumka treasuries came up for hearing before court of Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh on Friday.Lalus lawyer Chitttranjan Sinha said, We have appealed before the court stating that Lalu has ulcers in his rectum and could turn fatal if infected. He said Lalus kidney was also 60% damaged adding that his blood pressure and sugar level were not under control.We pointed out that AIIMS reports, too, have stated that Lalus blood pressure was fluctuating and the sugar level was also not under control. We argued that Lalu needed sometime for getting his blood pressure treated at the Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai, where he had undergone heart surgery. He also needed treatment for his kidney at Medanta hospital, Sinha said.The court has directed the CBI to file its reply on the AIIMS report and scheduled the next hearing on May 4. It also asked the defence lawyers to give in writing why it wants provisional bail for Lalu, Sinha said.Lalu was imprisoned at the Birsa Munda central jail since his conviction in the fodder scam case related to Dumka treasury on December 23, 2017. Lalu, however, developed several medical problems and was admitted to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, on March 17. After a few days, the RIIMS board recommended that Lalu be shifted to AIIMS for better treatment. Lalus lawyers, however, have now claimed that his condition has not improved significantly in AIIMS as well.HC stay on arrest warrant against RJD MLAThe Jharkhand high court on Friday stayed the arrest warrant against RJD MLA Bhola Yadav asking him to appear before the special CBI court within seven days and explain his stand.

After bringing his health condition to normal, he was discharged from the hospital. However, the doctors have advised him to take rest for at least 15 days and not take part in any political activity.Although the senior BJP leaders said they came only to enquire about the health condition of Lakshminarayana, speculation is rife that the BJP leaders have requested the former minister not to leave the party in haste. They are said to have suggested to him to take a call on his political future only after meeting party supremo Amit Shah. It was not clear as to what was Lakshminarayanas response.Lakshminarayana formally sent his resignation letter to BJP chief Shah three days ago and was supposed to join the YSRCP in the presence of its chief Jaganmohan Reddy near Gannavaram on Wednesday. However, he was rushed to hospital after suddenly falling sick in the wee hours of Wednesday.The pressure from BJPs national leaders, including Ram Madhav and Amit Shah, not to leave the party is said to have raised the BP levels of the veteran leader. In this background, the visit of Veerraju and Manikyala Rao have put the rumour mills to work overtime. While the BJP leaders believe that Lakshminarayana would not quit the party, his followers, however, are confident he will eventually.In fact, it was due to pressure from his followers that Lakshminarayana decided to leave the BJP and join YSRCP. Interestingly, the ruling TDP too is believed to be keen on getting Lakshminarayana, a strong Kapu leader in the coastal region, into its fold. Sources said two cabinet ministers are discussing the issue with the former minister over phone. A staunch supporter of a former minister also confirmed the lobbying from the TDP.But the continued silence of Lakshminarayana is adding to the suspense. He is saying that he needs some rest and break after which he will take a final call, said a close aide."

Yet this year, Maharashtra has broken a record and touched the highest sugar production in its history at 105.58 lakh tonnes.By the end of the season in May, sugar output in the state is set to hit 107-108 lakh tonnes. The previous record was in 2014-15 at 105.14 lakh tonnes. Maharashtra is the countrys second highest sugar producer, after Uttar Pradesh. This is record production and crushing is not yet over. But the state is likely to finish second behind UP whose projections are higher, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.But the glut is worrying for sugar factories and cane farmers. Sugar prices have crashed by Rs1,000 per quintal from Rs3,600 to Rs2,600. This is making it hard for factories to pay cane farmers the price set by the Centre at Rs2,550 per tonne. Pending dues to the states cane farmers are at Rs2,277 crore.Nationally too, the picture is one of excess, with production 56% higher than last year. So far this year, sugar output has reached 304 lakh tonnes compared to 195 lakh tonnes last year, said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NSCSF). Nationally, payments due to farmers are worth Rs20,000 crore, he said.With factories making losses due to low prices, it is difficult for them to get new working capital in the form of loans, said NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, NSCFC chairman. Many will not be able to function when the crushing season begins in October, he said. The cultivation area of water-guzzling sugarcane in India is expected to grow from 46 lakh hectares this year to 51 lakh hectares next year.The industry is pushing for export of 4 mn tonnes of stock to stabilize prices, with NSCSF writing to PM Modi. So far, Centre has increased import duty from 50% to 100% and scrapped export duty (earlier it was 20%)."

The case has been transferred to CID for a probe.Senior inspector M M Mujawar of the Bund Garden police confirmed registration of the case and said, We have transferred the case papers to the Kotwali police in Ahmednagar for further investigation.While a report by the hospital stated that Girwale died of a heart attack, his brother Babasaheb alleged, while speaking to TOI, that Girwale died of injuries he suffered because of excessive police torture in custody. We want a case of murder to be registered against the police officers responsible for my brothers death and their arrests, said Babasaheb. He also gave a complaint letter to this effect to the Bund Garden police.Girwales death had immediate repurcussions in the politically-sensitive Ahmednagar district where tension has been simmering ever since the twin murders. Scores of his followers started gathering at his residence in Maliwada area of Ahmednagar while many rushed to Pune. His family blamed the Ahmednagar police, especially the crime branch officers, for his death. Girwales relatives refused to perform his last rites till an offence was registered against the policemen responsible for his death. A heavy police deployment was made in Ahmednagar to avert any untoward fallout.A medical officer at the Sassoon General Hospital who did not wish to be identified, said, Girwale underwent a weight loss (bariatric) surgery a few years ago. After his death, we conducted a post-mortem. The cause of his death was coronary artery disease (CAD) with septicaemia. CAD causes impaired blood flow in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), it is the most common form of heart disease and a leading cause of death.According to the release issued by Sharma, Girwale was arrested on April 8 and was in police custody till April 10. Later, he was sent to the Nashik central prison after being remanded in judicial custody. On April 10, a separate case (involving sale and supply of illicit liquor) was registered against Girwale with the Kotwali police station under the Bombay Prohibition (Maharashtra) Act and he was taken into custody from the prison on April 13, Sharma stated. Girwale was produced before the court in Ahmednagar on April 14 and was remanded in police custody for a day.When Girwale started complaining of chest pain on Sunday (April 15), he was first taken to the civil hospital in Ahmednagar. He was then referred to the Sassoon General Hospital in Pune, Sharma stated. Girwale was taken to the Sassoon General Hospital with the courts permission. His relatives wanted to take him to a private hospital in Pune but the doctors at the Sassson General Hospital did not allow them to shift Girwale without the courts permission, he added. After the court granted permission, a team from the private hospital visited the Sassoon General Hospital on Monday afternoon and examined him. They told Girwales relatives that it would be risky to shift him, Sharma stated.The SP said that another medical practitioner from the private hospital went to the Sassoon General Hospital and examined Girwale again in the evening. He too had given a report that shifting Girwale was medically not advisable, Sharma stated. Later, he had to be put on a life support system and he passed away at 10.50pm on April 16.Girwales brother Babasaheb said, We had met him the day after he was arrested on April 8. He told me and his wife about the beating by the police. My brother had marks all over his body. He was a very strong person but he looked completely dejected when I met him. My brother did not have blood pressure or a sugar problem. He used to exercise daily. I cannot believe a heart attack could be the reason behind his death.Babasaheb said his brother was a firm person and was always in the lead on every issue. There is a political conspiracy behind my brothers death. We want a case of murder registered against the persons responsible for my brothers death, Babasaheb said.Hundreds of supporters of Kailash Girwale stopped the ambulance carrying his body at Supa in Ahmednagar, blaming police officers for his death and demanding their arrest. Girwales wife has lodged a complaint at Kotwali police station against inspector Dilip Pawar for her husbands death. Following the intervention of senior police officers, the complaint was accepted and the family was told that the case has been transferred to the CID.Around 5pm on Tuesday, the body was finally brought to Ahmednagar and a huge funeral procession was taken out amidst tight police bandobast.Additional forces were deployed in Ahmednagar city and Maliwada, the area to which Girawle belonged.Girwale was a two-time corporator and a key Maratha leader in Ahmednagar. He was also the district coordinator for the Maratha Kranti Morcha. In spite of being a leader of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , he was supported by the NCP to become co-opt member of the Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation."

It's families, not parties, that matter most. Earlier, it was VL Patil whose family was influential. Later came the Koujalagis.

Now, it's the Katti and Jarkiholi families which hold the reins,"" says Ashok Chandaragi , president, Belagavi District Kannada Organisations Action Committee.The five Jarkiholi brothers, three of whom are MLAs and two are seeking political entry, are firstgeneration politicians. Ramesh Jarkiholi is minister in-charge of Belagavi district. He replaced his brother Satish, who is also a Congress MLA. Sibling Balachandra is a BJP MLA.""They are spread in different parties as they want to retain power within the family. No party can afford to overlook their claim for ministership, as they can influence results in 7-8 seats,"" said a Congress worker.Similarly, the Kattis dominate in Hukkeri and surrounding constituencies. While Vishwanath Katti was a powerful leader and MLA, his elder son and sixtime MLA Umesh tightened the family grip further. He won his first four elections contesting from as many parties. Younger brother Ramesh was BJP MP from Chikkodi for one term, before he lost to Congress' Prakash Hukkeri in 2014.Besides loyalty of the people, what defines a family's clout is ownership of cooperative societies and sugar mills. ""This means having a solid vote bank of 20,000-25,000 people,"" says senior journalist Sarjoo Katkar. ""These mill owners do not lift sugarcane if they vote for other parties. With EVMs, it is easy to track the voting pattern,"" said Mahalingappa of Naganur village in Athani taluk."

Similarly, the capsules made from the mixture of stevia and fenugreek have nutritional values and maybe used by health conscious or diabetes patients.Final-year chemical engineering students Ravina Sonone and Chirag Chandaliya said concentration and ease of application is the main advantage of their product.Their guide, associate professor Shekhar Pandharipande, believes that curry leaves extract is a rare discovery while other products too have immense potential to add flavour to each morsel.Ravina, who belongs to Yavatmal, worked on chilli, curry leaves, ginger rhizomes and turmeric. Her study on ginger is still underway, while she successfully developed the extracts having medical properties, increased potential and lower inert (unwanted) material.Sonone said the products would come handy when the spices are not available in market. But they have the potential to replace the original products too. If produced on large scale, the cost would come down. Storage too wont be an issue, she said.Regarding ginger, she said the currently available products were too costly and she would work to bring down the price.Chirag, who is from Aurangabad and plans to set up a packaged food unit there, said his mixture of stevia and fenugreek can be added to any beverage, chocolate, candies, sweet dishes etc as sugar substitute. Stevia doesnt have any nutritional value while fenugreek is rich in medical properties but bitter in taste. The mixture now made in capsule form overcomes both the shortcomings, he said.Pandharipande said the innovation in curry leaves is unique. As far as I know, no work was done on curry leaves. We were able to retain taste and scientific ingredients after the experiment. There are always chances of losing the balance between ingredients and taste in labs, he said.He added that the products need to be further explored but in the given set up excellent results were achieved. At undergraduate level, we had attempted but couldnt succeed, he recalled."

According to ones taste, one could have asked for light tea or strong tea, more sugar or less sugar. There were a couple of tea shops in old city mixing salt in tea. But, menu at a tea shop detailing variety of flavours available and ingredient therein was simply unimaginable.Of late Bhopal is in the midst of a tea revolution with outlets cropping up at premium market places, attracting huge crowds mostly youths, using the place for unwinding, dating or simply gossiping with friends. And, remarkably, this revolution is pioneered by highly-educated youth, some of them MBA grads, who discovered that modest commodity called tea could be a big money spinner, if market was explored properly.Madhur Malhotra, an engineer by profession, studied in Australia and worked for South Australia government for three years before coming back to his hometown Bhopal some five years ago. With his friend Shelly George , an MBA, he was looking out to start a business.I wished to do something new. I would often meet Shelly at Six No. stop in the evening to discuss what to do. Once we ordered tea. I found the tea stall very dirty. I told Shelly if proper tea could be made and served in a hygienic fashion, it could be a lucrative business. That is how the idea of a tea shop was born.When asked whether he got any assistance/concession from the government like tax holiday as given to start-ups now, Madhur said no.Story of Mohd Faisal , an MBA from Pune University , is no different. He returned to Bhopal with an intention to start his own business but his father, an MPSEB employee, didnt endorse the idea.I knew my father wont give me money to start a business. He had already spent a lot on my education and would not have spared a penny for business. He wanted me to find a job. I laid the foundation of tea shop from my home in Jinsi .The fact that vast clientele at these new-age tea shops comprises youths- both girls and boys- decides its ambience. There is an air of informality in everything there. Self-service, tokens, chairs to pulled in one corner or another according to convenience of respective groups, comments of customers on tea and other edibles pasted on the pillars and light music going on unceasingly."

""My father D Srinivas is an MP from the ruling TRS. Ensuring development is also his responsibility. Tragically, this is not happening,"" Arvind told TOI.A businessman, who is into the construction industry, Arvind has set his sights on the Nizamabad Lok Sabha seat which currently is held by Kavitha, the daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. His father, popularly known as DS, had served as Pradesh Congress Committee chief and led the Congress to victory both in the 2004 and 2009 elections.Later, he joined the TRS and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2016. Recently, the son took to politics and is of the view that only the BJP can ensure the development of Telangana.When asked byon his remarks about his father, Arvind said he did feel that being an MP from the ruling TRS, his father indeed could do more and should have done. ""My relationship with my father is good. He is my father and I am his son. But, politically I differ with him and I believe it is the BJP alone which can bring about the development that Nizamabad and for that matter the rest of the state needs,"" Arvind said.Arvind recently undertook a Maha Padayatra from March 3 to 11from Muthyampet to Bodhan covering a distance of 142 km to highlight the issue of sugarcane farmers.""Though the TRS promised to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory in Bodhan, it has not done it.

No leader, however, has been critical of him. An ex-cricketer, Arvind has been able to galvanise the BJP in the Nizamabad parliamentary constituency and also get supporters from other parties. But if Kavitha Kalvakuntla were to be fielded again from the Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency, how would Arvind rate his chances?""That would work only to my advantage,"" he said. He may also have to contend with Rahul Gandhi's close aide Madhu Yashki Goud of the Congress if the latter were to jump into the poll fray as Yashki had represented Nizamabad in the past.""People look up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for development.

The farm is on the fringes of Koka Wildlife Sanctuary.The two cubs, a male and a female, are virtually fighting a battle for survival in the wild or lifelong captivity due to sheer carelessness on part of Hathzade.According to forest officials, the cubs and leopardess were first seen on March 22, when Hathzade partially burned bagasse residue left in the farm after cutting sugar cane. Incidentally, Bhandara honorary wildlife warden Rajkamal Job who was present there stopped Hathzade.Shockingly, after a break Hathzade continued cleaning operation of farm by burning the residue. According to Shahid Parvez Khan of Save Ecosystem And Tiger (SEAT), Bhandara, the cubs were with mother till April 4, when huge fire erupted in the farm.Bhandara deputy conservator (DyCF) Vivek Hoshing says, Fortunately, our men rescued the cubs and saved them from getting charred. Now all out efforts are being made to reunite them with the leopardess.A six-member team has been constituted to take all out efforts to reunite the cubs. We are taking instructions from Dr Ajay Deshmukh, who is wildlife vet in Western Maharashtra, and has reunited leopard cubs in 50 such operations, said Hoshing.However, its been 7 days that the leopardess has not taken the cubs despite visiting the spot. Dr Deshmukh says, It is a positive sign that the mother is at least coming near the cubs. There may be some varied reasons, may be presence of a male, why she did not take away the cubs.In Junnar, in 50-odd operations we carried out, the mother takes away cubs even after 8-10 days. We should not hurry and wait for even 15-20 days, Dr Deshmukh said.According to Khan, the cubs are being fed goat milk, lactogen and ORS. Their health is also being monitored daily by veterinarians. Camera trap pictures show the mother is visiting the place and a day before she was close to the cubs kept in plastic crates. Unfortunately, she did not take away the cubs, he said.As a matter of precaution, the forest department has replaced normal camera traps with infrared cameras (IR), which will not flash and distract the leopardess.Khan said a machan has been built near the spot from where monitoring is being done by volunteers. A natural environment is being given to the cubs.In the last two years, six sloth bears that had delivered cubs in dilapidated village homes were safely reunited in the wild in Bhandara."

Mango juice is sold in huge quantity during summer months. It is estimated that 2,000kg mango juice is consumed daily in the city in March and April. Traders generally mix milk, ice cream, artificial sweetener and lactose with mango juice.When mangoes are being sold at the rate of Rs100 per kg, how can traders sell keri no ras for Rs80 per kg? A kg of mango gives only 400 gram juice. So, unless the traders add something, they cant sell the juice so cheap, an SMC officer said. A trader said, Milk, ice cream, food colour and sugar are added in mango juice by us. Dr Aashish Naik, chief health officer of SMC, said, The keri no ras that we know actually is mango milk shake. SMC has given licences to only 12 producers to extract mango juice in the city.SMC health department has in the last three days collected 18 samples of mango juice from eight places of Katargam and Adajan. The samples have been sent for analysis to the public health laboratory in Surat. The samples would be checked for adulteration, food colour, artificial sweetener and lactose content. The food colour and lactose content should not be exceed 100 particles per milligram.We have found that generally there is at least 250 milligram of milk, colour, essence and sweetener in 1kg of mango milk shake. Some add additional 200gm vanilla ice-cream too. Mango pulp is of B or C grade ripe mango and milk is skimmed and has no health value.
