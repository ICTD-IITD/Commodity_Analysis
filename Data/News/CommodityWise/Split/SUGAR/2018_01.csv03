The latest data, which was reportedly provided by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), even gives rating to two Chandrapur-based industries which are non-functional.With the aim of making the data regarding industrial air pollution accessible to the common man, a star rating programme was jointly taken by the MPCB, Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India), the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) at Harvard Kennedy School and Tata Centre for Development (TCD) in June last year.On April 1, TOI reported that thermal power plants of the region got a five-star rating in the programme. Also as per the data, the two most polluting industries were based in Chandrapur  Murli Cement and Vasant Sahakari Sakhar Kharkhana. The latter belongs to the sugar and distilling sector.After the data was made public, Chandrapurs environment activist Suresh Chopane pointed out that two industries in the list were shut down around 2014-15. Only industries having at least four recent stack samples (air quality samples taken from chimney of manufacturing units) are eligible to participate in the programme. The ratings are based on the median concentration of the latest stack samples for particulate matter.According to environment expert Debi Goenka, who has done an extensive study on thermal power plants of the country, the data provided by the board is not always reliable. When giving star ratings to industries, not just one but all the parameters like liquid effluents, oxides of sulphur and nitrate and other pollution sources should be taken into account. Besides, the monitoring done by MPCB is extremely poor and many times manipulated. The censors might not be calibrated well, the software is not functioning properly or in many cases actual samples are not collected from the stack, said Goenka.In April last year, TOI had exposed how the data regarding sulphur dioxide emissions from Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) was fudged. While MPCBs data showed SO2 emissions well within permissible limits, data provided by KTPS revealed that the SO2 levels at the stack were over five times the permissible limit set by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC).Chopane further pointed out that emissions from only one stack cant decide the pollution levels. You cant just take the emission data of new unit of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station and give it a rating. What about the old units which are highly polluting? This is sending across a wrong message and there is a chance that industries might misuse the ratings, he added.The biggest loophole is that the ratings do not reflect the time period, said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil. If closed industries are being rated, it clearly shows latest monitoring data is not being used. The ratings must reflect the time period when sampling was done, he added.EPIC-India and JPAL said it is only a curator of the data. We do not collect the data directly but work on what is submitted to us. Moreover, the purpose of programme is to highlight such discrepancies too so that the public is aware of polluting industries, said a spokesperson."

We have urged the state government to give subsidy at the minimum rate of Rs 40 per quintal. It will help sugar millers to meet financial loss to some extent.Cane crushing in state during 2017-18 stood at 70 lakh tonne. With the sugar recovery rate of cane in the state being 9.5%, the expected sugar production would be 6.7 lakh tonne. However, the approximate cost of sugar production in the state is Rs 3,800 per quintal. Accordingly, the expected loss to the millers would be Rs 700 per quintal or Rs 485 crore in total.After the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) at 5% on sugar and 28% on molasses, the state government is getting the revenue of about Rs 600 crore from sugar industry, Bhatt said.The BSMA has also requested the state government to make early payment of the pending subsidy of Rs 70.97 crore to the sugar mills so as to help them in clearing the balance cane price payment of cane farmers."

With a month still left for the sugar season to end, officials say production could set a new record, and may even overtake highest producer UP.""At this rate, we estimate production may cross the historic high of 105 lakh tons in 2014-15,"" said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.The rise in production has seen prices drop from Rs 3,600 per quintal last year to Rs 2,900 now.Currently, the state is the second highest sugar producer in the country after Uttar Pradesh. Officials say the state may even surpass UP this year. Sugar production in the state is 140% higher than in 2016-17 where production was impacted by the drought.The area under water-guzzling sugarcane has increased by 2.7 lakh hectares over the last year. The cane area grew from 6.3 lakh hectares in 2016-17 to 9 lakh hectares in 2017-18.Kolhapur and Solapur regions led in sugar production, though the latter is an arid area. Productivity also increased from 75 tons per hectare in 2016-17 to 100 tons in 2017-18. However, the rise in production has led to a dip in sugar prices from 3,600 per quintal last year to 2,900 now.As a result, sugar factories say they are finding it difficult to pay cane farmers the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) set by the Central government at 2,550 per quintal. The pending payments to farmers have ballooned to 2,227 crore.Over time, Maharashtra has lost its traditional markets in the North and the North-east to UP which has a locational advantage.For the full report, log on to www.timesofindia.comThe state's domestic consumption is only 24 lakh tons and it currently has pending stocks of 79 lakh tons.The Centre has stepped in with an increased import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% and also scrapped export duty on sugar which was earlier at 20%.

But this will last barely for another week after which we will face a serious problem, says Kalpesh Jain, who runs a store in Sakkardara.For the last two-three days, I have been giving jute bags which are used by distributors and wholesalers to pack. I have asked customers to store them and bring them back to the shop next time, says Jain, who is planning to get cloth bags of all dimensions stitched out of old saris and clothes to use at his store.With notices being put up outside grocery stores saying no plastic carry bags will be provided, customers now will have to get used to bringing their own bags or shell out for reusable ones.People have still not got into the habit of carrying bags to stores, says Virendra Sahu, who runs a provision store at Golibar Chowk. So far, we were packing dry kirana items like dal, rice, sugar and others in virgin plastic bags which come without handle. Paper bags are no substitute as they are not sturdy, says Sahu.Wrapping items in newspapers and tying them with strings will be very time-consuming, so we are not even looking at the option, he adds.Agreeing that newspaper wrapping of grocery is a big no, Dhanesh Jethani, who has a grocery store in Khamla, says, We do not get the kind of hard working labour who would sit and pack the stuff and tie them with a string.Identifying the items while billing and making delivery also becomes a problem when they are not packed in plastic bags. We are waiting for some solutions to emerge and will follow accordingly, he says.The ban has provoked both dismay and praise, but the biggest question for many is what will happen when the supply of plastic bags dries up? Finding an alternate, calculating its cost are the biggest challenges facing us today, says Harish Pitalwar, who runs an online grocery store.Our services include home deliveries, so we cant ask customers to provide bags. Besides, a person who orders online is accustomed to decent packing of items ordered by him, says Pitalwar.So far, items are placed in huge plastic bags and delivered. But now we are thinking of getting big stainless steel crates in which we will put vegetables. For groceries, there is still no option, though we are testing bags made with corn starch for its strength, he adds."

Of the 135 days of crushing season, the factory could work only 88 days producing about 57,000 quintals (57,00,000 kgs) of sugar.The 45th crushing season, that started on November 14, 2017, came to an end on March 28 this year. Actual production had started on December 6.The factory at Dayanandnagar, Dharbandora, gets sugarcane from farmers in Goa, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This year, the factory crushed over 73,000 tonnes of cane.A proposal worth over Rs 29 crore for modernizing the factory was submitted to the Centre under the Rashtriya Krishi Yojana (National Agricultural Scheme), but was rejected as the factory is a cooperative enterprise and the scheme is available for units under the agricultural ministry.Factory agriculture officer Sadanand Sangodkar said there were several emergency shutdowns during the season which led to major losses. During the current season, the factory was shut down for 850 hours (about 35 days) on different occasions. The factory had developed snags in its turbine, condenser and jack well. A pipeline also burst thereby halting work.A sugar factory needs continuous water supply and an underground pipeline has been laid to fetch water from the Khandepar river basin. In mid-February, the dilapidated pipeline suffered cracks and the plant was shut for three days between February 14 and 16.When there are shutdowns for longer periods, cane juice gets spoiled. Though we use it to produce molasses, it is a waste as the juice could have been used to produce sugar. From extracting the juice, crushing the cane to producing the final crystalline sugar, it takes about 72 hours with the juice remaining inside the plant for 48 hours. If the plant stops during this time, the entire lot of juice goes into waste, Sangodkar said."

This has an adverse effect on the migrating people because they cannot enjoy the benefits of governments welfare and hygiene schemes besides their long absence also ruins the educational prospects of their future generations. The forest of Dang district has enough to sustain them, but yearning to earn a little bit extra is costing the tribals dear in terms of human development index.Dang district has total population of 2.10 lakh and 65,000 of them go to work in sugarcane farms of nearby districts. This is why the district authorities have been setting up seasonal hostels for migrating families kids studying in class V to VIII since the past few years. The children are provided accommodation, food and other facilities when their parents are out for several months.Dang district development officer (DDO) H K Vadhvania told TOI, We have 174 seasonal hostels where nearly 6,900 tribal children stay and are provided education. We ensure that their education doesnt suffer due to migration of their parents. We persuade the parents to leave their children with their grandparents so that their basic education doesnt suffer. State government spends Rs 1,600 per child every month under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.However, social scientists say setting up of seasonal hostels for children cannot be a solution to migration by tribals for jobs. Tribals have been migrating to work in sugar factories and sugarcane fields since 1962. The trend continues to this date because tribal villages neither do have basic facilities nor employment opportunities.Centre for Social Studies director Dr Satyakam Joshi said, The sugar factories and the state government should set up a migrant welfare board for tribal labourers. The board should spend money on the education of children, basic sanitary facility for women, health check-up and houses for tribal workers."

This is the largest seizure of exotic animals in the state so far, indicating that Guwahati is increasingly being used by traders as a conduit for illegally supplying exotic animals for sale in the international pet market.Police said one Pradip Kumar of Budaun district in Uttar Pradesh was arrested on Saturday when the animals were found in his possession during a vehicle search at Jorabat. Most of the species which were found with him are native to Africa and South America.Jorabat officer in-charge Partha Pratim Gogoi said Kumar sourced the animals from Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram, and was coming to Guwahati on a Tata Sumo to board a Delhi-bound train. ""We had information about a person coming with a large number of exotic animals from Aizawl. Our searches led to seizure of the live animals. All the animals have been taken to the zoo for necessary veterinary care,"" Gogoi said.Police informed that Kumar has said he was visiting Aizawl for the first time and a person named Sawma handed over the animals to him inside a hotel on Friday. The animals were to be handed over to a person named Pankaj in Delhi, Kumar has also revealed.Police, the forest department and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau ( WCCB ) are interrogating Kumar to unearth the opus operandi in sourcing the exotic animals and the role of the northeast as a supply route in this illegal trade.Guwahati wildlife divisional forest officer Pradipta Baruah said some of the animals which Kumar was transporting died during the journey.The other animals in the consignment were one meerkat, an Aldabra tortoise, one giant scorpion, one sugar glider and 13 snakes which are yet to be identified.""This is the first time that we seized such a large number of exotic animals.

While the rescued animals are under veterinary care, we are interrogating the person to find how they operate in the northeast,"" Baruah said.A senior WCCB official said the animals might have been procured from Thailand and brought into Mizoram through Bangladesh. ""The seizure has established that the traders have been using Guwahati as a transit route. Now it is clear that wildlife parts are not only smuggled out of the northeast to neighbouring countries, but also this region is becoming a major conduit for illegal trade in exotic animals which are in demand in the international pet market,"" the WCCB official said."

For those who havent filed returns in the past two years, the last date is March 31.The collection for the entire country was only Rs 1 lakh crore in 2004. Just over a decade later, weve been able to collect that much from just one region, principal chief commissioner of I-T (Karnataka and Goa region) Rajnish Kumar said.As on date, the department has collected Rs 98,000 crore, up from Rs 89,500 crore last year. Warning those evading tax of prosecution, Kumar said: While the law always allowed prosecution, it was a tool seldom used earlier. Now, weve completely digitised the system and all the data is easily maintainable and evaders can be tracked more efficiently.For evasion of more than Rs 25,000, the punishment can go up to seven years in jail with fine, while it is three-month imprisonment for lesser amounts.There is a big jump in the number of prosecution cases this year. A total of 111 prosecution complaints have been filed in 66 cases for various offences, the department stated. The sleuths had searched media houses, gutka and sugar manufacturers, educational institutions, IVF clinics among others.The department said the searches conducted on two gems and jewellery groups revealed unaccounted sales in the form of consignments and discrepancy in stocks. The total admission of undisclosed income is Rs 128 crore, it added.Post DeMo searchesStating that the department had received a lot of information after the 2016 demonetisation, Kumar said: Weve analysed 571 cases of deposits of over Rs 1 crore and 21,628 cases of deposits of more than Rs 1 lakh, where the depositors had not filed the returns. We are tracking all of them.The department conducted 50 searches this year and detected undisclosed amount of Rs 5,259 crore. In one case, one person had transferred properties worth Rs 200 crore in the names of his relatives to evade tax. He will be paying Rs 15 crore in tax now. In another case, an educated couple had been indulging in real estate dealings without paying taxes, he said.Many in the fishing community in Mangaluru had not been filing returns, and that a series of searches and surveys have been initiated to bring them under the net, he added.One arrestedOn Wednesday, the department arrested one man who had failed to pay a tax of Rs 16.45 lakh.Rajnish Kumar, while stating that the department has been empowered to carry out arrests, said the man has been handed over to police.The assessee has not paid taxes for 2011-12 and in the meantime parted with assets attached under the Income Tax Act. During a search in October 2010, Rs 5 crore was seized. The departments power to arrest defaulters has been used after a long period of time in Karnataka, a statement read, but officials did not mention when the department exercised this power last."

A health check-up campaign by Fortis hospital , which screened 138 women cops between the age group of 21 and 45 years, has revealed that they suffer from deficiencies and lifestyle health issues. The cops were tested for complete blood count, pulmonary function, blood sugar and blood pressure. They also had eye and dental check-ups.The test reports have revealed that an alarming 45% of women cops posted in the district are anaemic i.e., they have low count of red blood cells, which lowers the ability of blood to carry oxygen and weakens the body.The is the first time that Fortis has undertaken such a campaign, focussing on women cops, with its CSR funds.It is worrying that 45% of female cops are anaemic. This indicates menstrual cycle and nutritional irregularities, which lead to morbidity. They even lack awareness about their health and dont go for preventive check-ups. It is high time we apply WHO standards in India for haemoglobin levels in women. We will prescribe and give iron tablets to these cops and will conduct a regular health camp for them every six months, said Dr Rahul Bhargava, director, bone marrow transplant, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon.Cops spend considerable time outdoors for investigations. The exposure to high pollution levels is weakening their vital organs, said experts. Nearly 8% of the women cops were diagnosed with asthma and pollution-related respiratory disorders. Additionally, the cops handling traffic duties were found to be having dry eyes and allergies. Nearly 3% of them have high blood pressure, and 2% have been diagnosed with high blood sugar.The more revealing fact is that these cops are unaware of their medical conditions as most of them do not go for regular health check-ups.According to a 50-year-old woman sub-inspector, the number of women cops is limited and they have to investigate all women-related crimes as well as go for VIP and protest duties, which make it difficult for them to take care of themselves.There are times when we dont even drink water while on field duty. We spend some days on tea while visiting locations for investigations. It is embarrassing to ask for food or buy food when at work.The starting salary for a cop in the constable rank is nearly Rs 21,000 while for a head constable, the minimum salary is nearly Rs 26,000. A sub-inspector, on the other hand, starts at nearly Rs 35,000. Many women cops said that it was not financially viable to eat out with such salaries.A young woman recruit said, Many of us have to commute to the workplace from our houses in other districts. Sometimes, we skip breakfast because we have to rush to work. We cannot bring tiffin from home daily and nor do we get time to eat out. So, we dont go for lunch and get a very late dinner.Senior officials understand the plight of these cops but they believe a little nutritional knowledge is also needed. Their staple diet is roti or rice with dal and sabzi. It is filling but lacks micronutrients. Cops need to eat more nutritional food and we will help develop that awareness, said a senior woman police officer.The senior men in the police department are not even surprised with the high levels of malnourishment and weak health among their female counterparts. A senior official said, We need to understand their social and economic situation before talking about their health. A majority of them come from a rural background where they eat a heavy breakfast and dinner. There is no concept of lunch there. This continues when they join the force, too, as there is hardly any time for lunch. Considering their low salaries, they want to avoid splurging on fruits or juices while working on the field. Naturally, they are underweight and suffer from deficiencies.DCP (headquarters) Deepak Gahlawat said, We are aware that there might be some health concerns among women cops. We will continue with health check-ups and provide necessary medical aid to them."

In his plea, Sujan Singh has sought directions to consider the vacancies and select list of the year 2017 in a meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. In its meeting, UPSC is only considering the vacancies and select list from 2012 to 2016 of the HCS officers for elevation as IAS officer.The petitioner has mainly asked the HC to restrain the UPSC from holding the meeting for selection schedule to be held on March 22, 2018 and to determine the vacancies arisen in 2017 and to consider the same in the next meeting of the selection committee. According to him, he had approached the Chandigarh bench of Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) but the matter was adjourned by the tribunal. He has submitted that if the meeting is held on Thursday, it would cause irreparable loss to him.In support of his arguments, the state civil service officer has also produced a Union government communication through which the Haryana government was asked to prepare selection list and determination of number of vacancies in the promotion quota of IAS that has arisen between January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and further requested to submit the proposal by January 10, 2018 so that meeting of the selection committee could be scheduled earlier.The petitioner submitted that he had given representations to the Centre as well as the state in January and in February for considering the 2017 list but it raises doubt as to what circumstances have arisen to fix the meeting of the selection committee on March 22, 2018 without including the vacancies and select list of 2017."

After the introduction of smart card, this practice was withdrawn.Instead of officials blocking the cards, card holders should come forward to give up ration items, if they are not purchasing them. While the government wont allot commodities for these card holders, they can continue to use them as identity cards the official said.While about 126 people, including rice and sugar card holders, had opted for the give it up option in the past three months, as many as 4,739 families have chosen to have no commodity cards, according to an official source.In Coimbatore, they are about 9,97,443 card holders. Of them, 8,45,951 are rice card holders and 75,101 are sugar card holders, who, according to sources, could opt for the give it up option.The move would also help the deserving get the essential commodities, said G Rajendren of Tamil Nadu Ration Shop Employees Association. Presently, the government does not allot commodities to all the registered shops in an area and the ration items are sold on first come, first serve basis. Hence, some card holders dont t get the commodities. Once people opt for give it up option, things will change, he said.Rajendren has, however, some reservations. Even though the move could curtail illegal procuring to an extent, unless the government brings in more stringent rules, malpractices will continue, he said."

Almost one third of the material is being diverted by the PDS mafia. When poor people go to the PDS shop to get wheat, rice, sugar or kerosene, they do not get it and have to buy it from black marketeers. Biometric ration cards were issued in 2010 to improve this system. All below-poverty-line card holders were forced to go to mamlatdar offices to submit their fingerprints. The government claims it has the biometrics and fingerprints of 100% of BPL beneficiaries and claims that 100% of material is going to PDS beneficiaries.Government records show there are 8,15,607 Antyodaya ration card holders and 3.37 crore National Food Security Act beneficiaries in the state. In February 2017, 1,39,042 metric tonnes (MT) of wheat, 59,486 MT of rice, 6,622 MT of sugar, 4,652 MT of salt and 2,56,660 litres of kerosene was provided to beneficiaries. The cost of these supplies is Rs 78 crore a month or Rs 936 crore a year. The subsidy cost is Rs 57 crore per month or Rs 686 crore a year. The total cost of material is Rs 1,622 crore per year. About one third of ration cards are fake and the government is wasting taxpayers money, he said.Dhanani further said, Fake ration cards have even been issued in the name of religious leaders like Morari Bapu, Bharati Bapu and others and rations are being picked up in their name using bogus biometrics. Rations are even being taken regularly in the name of Surat BJP MP Vasant Gajera of Laxmi Diamonds, who is a leading industrialist. Those behind this scam, encroaching on the rights of the poor, must be given capital punishment. This biometric scam has been going on since 2010 with the connivance between district administrations and the PDS mafia. In the last 8 years, material and subsidy worth Rs 12,976 crore has been diverted and this needs to be recovered.Jayesh Radadia, the state civil supplies and consumer affairs minister, in reply to Dhananis allegations, said, The government has registered police complaints in Surat and Amreli districts and an inquiry is under way in all districts. The state government introduced the biometric system with the noble intention of stopping malpractices and taking necessary action in time. However, after receiving complaints about the biometric system, we allowed the issue of PDS goods by manual verification as well."

He said he was unwell and hence needed some rest at home. It is true that I did not attend office for the past three days and that might have fuelled some speculations at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters or in a section of media. I want to make it very clear that under no circumstances I am going to resign. I was not keeping well and hence decided to stay at home. I am now ready to join office, Chatterjee told TOI.Mayor said that his blood pressure had shot up and he had troubles with his blood sugar level too.Reacting to a TOI report published on Sunday highlighting piling of important files at the civic headquarters because of his absence, Chatterjee promised to clear all files once he joined office. He, however, claimed that he was keeping track of every important file. It is end of a financial year and we need to pay bills to keep up the pace of development work in the city. How can I ignore these files? he asked. However, a senior KMC official conceded that Chatterjee on Sunday called up an official and asked him to carry at least 150 files to his Golpark home that needed mayors signature at the earliest.The mayor, however, admitted that some problems were arising in some civic departments in the recent past. A source close to him said he was worried over the functioning of the finance wing particularly after the retirement of controller of municipal finance and accounts Debatosh Dasgupta . I have entrusted a senior official to take care of the department, Chatterjee said.Chatterjee on Sunday dismissed the rumour that he had distanced himself from partys high command. There is no scope for creating a rift on my part. All I want to say is that I needed to clear the air about some episodes and traumas in my personal life. My friendship with someone special. This has nothing to do with my political life. No more controversy please, Kolkata mayor said."

Sidhu, in his speech peppered with poetry and witty remarks, said Singh was both Sardar (a Sikh) and asardar (effective). I want to apologise to Sardar Manmohan Singh and that too bowing down... Your silence has done what BJPs uproar could not. I realised this after 10 years, sir, said the cricketer-turnedpolitician, who joined Congress before Punjab assembly polls in 2017.Lauding the former PM, Sidhu said the economy galloped like an Arabian horse when he was the PM. Whereas, he said, under BJP's rule, the economy is moving at the pace of a tortoise.Sir, you worked hard silently in such a way that your success created an uproar. Sir, you are a Sardar and also asardar (effective), a comment which had former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and senior party leader Ashok Gehlot, who flanked Singh, giggling.Sidhu hailed former party president Sonia Gandhi, party president Rahul Gandhi and Congress workers in his speech. He said Rahul was set to unfurl the tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort after becoming the country's prime minister post the 2019 general election. Sidhu said the BJP's lies stood exposed after its four-year rule. ""They (BJP) appear tall, but are hollow like bamboo from inside. I have seen them from close quarters. And Rahul Bhai is like sugar cane, sweet from within and outside,"" he said.Hailing Congress workers, Sidhu likened them to Sikandar (Greek emperor Alexander the Great) and said the party cannot be what it is without them.

They advise that these should be ignored for Indians.The controversial norm relates to relaxing the long-term blood sugar target, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) which, via a blood test, gives an estimate of a persons blood sugar level average over the past few months. Generally, an HbA1c of 6.5% indicates diabetes.There were over 72 million cases of diabetes in India in 2017, according to International Diabetes Federation. American College of Physicians, an organisation of internal medicine physicians, has recommended recently in the medical journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, that clinicians should aim to achieve an HbA1c level between 7% and 8% in most patients with type 2 diabetes as against the traditional 6.5 to 7% which has been followed over decades. The recommendation is leading to a conflict in views amongst doctors, with certain associations opposing it. Doctors here say the guideline of lowering the blood sugar target cannot be binding and should be ignored as diabetes in India is more aggressive, and, hence, riddled with complications. They say these recommendations should not be applicable here as India has its own three advisory bodiesthe ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), RSDDI (Research Society For The Study of Diabetes in India) and API (Association of Physicians of India)which are more tuned in to Indian cases.Anoop Misra, chairman of Delhi-based Fortis-C-DOC (Centre of Excellence For Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology), said, In reality, Indian physicians continue to follow US-based guidelines, hence ACP guidelines may have substantial impact in India. If blood sugar control is loosened (as advised by ACP), more patients in India will suffer from complications, the burden of which is already high. We should ignore these, and stick to previous time-tested glycosylated hemoglobin limit of control of 7%.Others concur the guidelines cannot be standardized because of several differences in lifestyle, physiology and food habits. Dr Shashank Joshi, endocrinologist and diabetologist who consults at Mumbais Lilavati Hospital, said, Asian Indians who develop diabetes are insulin-resistant and have different phenotype (observable characteristics, physiological properties, or behavior) compared to those in the western world. None of the North American or European guidance are applicable for Indians, Chinese or Asian geographies. Also, since Asians consume more carbohydrates, their response to medicines and doses is different.Says Dr Rajeev Chawla, president-elect of RSSDI 2018 and senior consultant diabetologist, Pharmacotherapy using oral or injectable agents may be used in addition to lifestyle modification therapies to achieve a target glycosylated hemoglobin target of less than 7% for all diabetics as far as possible to prevent complications. The RSSDI is the largest organisation of doctors in Asia engaged in diabetes care with over 7,000 members. The guidelines were first released in 2015 and revised in January 2018 based on Indian evidence."

Major sugar producing states like Maharashtra and Karnataka have already moved to the revenue sharing formula based on Dr Rangarajan Committees recommendations.The sugar industry is cyclical in nature and is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to a range of factors like failure of monsoons, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills. In turn, it has affected timely payments to farmers.The new pricing mechanism will come into effect in the current season itself. To facilitate this transition, the state government will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present SAP of Rs 2,750 per metric tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs 100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers.The sugar industries shall however continue to bear the transportation costs, said finance minister O Panneerselvam. He has earmarked Rs 200 crore in the budget towards the transitional production incentive for next year. About 55,000 acres of sugarcane field will be covered under the new scheme next fiscal.Another major initiative is to increase production and do direct procurement of pulses through Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation. During 2017-18, intensive pulses production programme was promoted through village clusters and about 85,000 hectare was additionally brought under pulses cultivation.Combined with these, a string of food processing parks would come up in many districts to reduce wastage of farm produce like vegetables, fisheries, diary, poultry and meat. It would also help value addition.While farmers organisations have welcomed the governments decision to procure pulses, they said unless the dues of Rs 1,460 crore that sugar mills owe to farmers was cleared, sugarcane farmers sufferings would not end."

While those from the delta region welcomed the announcement on procurement of cereals, sugarcane farmers have given a thumbs-down to the proposed revenue sharing method. Farmers said that the Rs 250 crore earmarked for constructing check dams was as meagre as the Rs 300 crore set apart for Kudi Maramatthu (maintenance of water channels).Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that there were a number of attractive announcements in the budget. These included Rs 130 crore for dairy development, Rs 1,227.89 crore for animal husbandry and the ultra mega food park under the new food processing policy. However, there was no scheme for small and marginal farmers, he alleged.Finance minister has announced that sugarcane farmers would get their incentive based on revenue sharing method. This system will not work because only mill owners will benefit from the revenue sharing method. The Rs 200 crore incentive for sugarcane cultivation is an eye-wash , he said. Sugar cane farmers have urged the government to do the needful to disburse the Rs 1,460 crore due to them first.If the government started procuring black gram, green gram and dhal, it should not be done through Tamil Nadu Agri Regulated Marketing. Instead, the government should open separate centres at the village level, so that farmers could sell their produces without spending money on transportation, he added.State organizer of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress, Puliyur A Nagarajan, said that when there was no announcement on writing off crop loans, nothing could be done with the allocation of Rs 8,000 crore as loan to needy farmers through co-operatives. The entire farming community was in the clutches of debt, he added.The Tamil Nadu government should first withdraw the case filed in the Supreme Court opposing the order of the Madras high court Madurai bench revoking the crop loan of the farming community in the state, Nagarajan further stated."

With little or no fiscal leeway, Tamil Nadu continues to live beyond its means and, worse, it will do so at least until 2021with amounting revenue deficit.The sugar industry, which is witnessing its worst phase in 32 years, gets a reprieve in the form of a revenue sharing model between mills and cane growers, the third state to implement it after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.The state will also go in for direct procurement of cereals, include more services under its e-seva scheme and build an ultra modern food park across 450 acres in Tindivanam. With inbound project investments drying up, the states deputy chief minister hoped to reinvigorate the states traditional bastions by promising new textile and food processing policies, which he hopes will kick-start job creation. However, much depends on how soon these policies are rolled out. For long the state has been waiting for a new IT policy. The last one was announced eight years ago.Despite the temptation to splurge, the state has pulled back its spending and kept a tight leash on government finances. For one, the fiscal deficit -- the difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the government is termed as fiscal deficit -- for the current year will be sharply lower at 2.82% (against a budgetary provision of 4.14%) and for the next year, it will lower this deficit to 2.79%.But, the rising growth will not benefit the common man on street as the significant portion of tax revenues that will accrue will go towards interest, salary and pensions for government staff and funding freebies. The magnitude of this morass is such that 95% of revenue expenditure will go for fulfilling these three heads.The continued unabashed freebie culture will force the state to borrow more, especially when rates are rising, which in turn will result in higher interest payouts in coming years.The governments vulnerability will be exposed in the absence of sops to the farmers in the form of farm loan waiver, which is the national flavour. The state government missed the bus with no mention of cleaning up of its state owned units. Inefficient state PSUs are sucking away hard earned tax income. I expected some measures for cleaning up these entities, said M Ponnuswami , chairman, CII-TN. He said that slipping fiscal discipline was worrying.The governments decision to create additional land banks of 9,030 acres to allot to new investors is a welcome measure as it has become very difficult for investors to buy land in the state. We feared a steep fall in tax collection due to GST, but the collections are actually up, S Chandramohan, vice chairman, CII TN, said.Meanwhile, the government will replace 3,000 rickety old buses with new ones, with old sanctions for new buses, the state will replace its 4,593 buses during the next year. It will set up a bio park--Ticel Bio Park in Coimbatore, construct 1.30 lakh houses under hut-free village scheme. It will build 4.37 lakh new toilets allocating Rs 550 crore.It will spend Rs 20 crore to make Veda Nilayam, residence of former chief minister Jayalalithaa into a memorial and Rs 50.80 crore has been earmarked for Jaya's memorial in Marina."

It certainly did in the case of Inspector Daulatram Jogawat from Madhya Pradesh Police, who came under the spotlight after columnist-author Shobhaa De fat-shamed him in a tweet and which eventually led to Jogawat undergoing a bariatric surgery in Mumbai last year.Sixty-five kilos lighter a year later  Jogawat weighed 180-kg before he was operated on by well-known bariatric surgeon Dr Muffazal Lakdawala at Saifee Hospital  the Madhya Pradesh cop said not only was he no longer bitter at Des jibe, he wanted to personally thank her, with his family in tow.While De told Mumbai Mirror that she would be more than pleased to meet Jogawat, the latter said hell wait till he loses another 30 kgs before presenting himself in front of De, whom he refers to as his elder sister.In Mumbai for a routine check-up, Jogawat said he had become a different person after the weight loss operation. You can spot the confidence on my face, Jogawat, who now weighs 115 kg, said. I genuinely believe the weight loss surgery was possible only after Shobhaaji tweeted my photo. The doctors did not charge anything for the surgery, he said.Jogawats unintentional publicity came about when De posted his picture on Twitter on February 21last year  a day before the BMC elections  with the caption: Heavy police bandobast in Mumbai today.While De was slammed by scores of people for fat-shaming Jogawat, the Mumbai Police pointed out that Jogawat was not even a part of their force. Today, De is happy for Jogawat. Im glad that my tweet not only helped him lose weight, he has also been rid of several diseases, some of which could be life-threatening. I thank Dr Lakdawala for acknowledging the tweet and treating Jogawat free of cost, De told Mumbai Mirror.Regarding being trolled for fat-shaming the cop, De said Jogawat himself had never complained, and that he had always maintained that the tweet helped him get the right treatment. Id love to meet Mr Jogawat who is no longer on heavy bandobast, De said.Dr Lakdawala credited Jogawats mental toughness and discipline for the weight loss, and said he could easily lose another 30 kgs. He is strictly monitoring his diet, which is essential post bariatric surgery as there are restrictions regarding food intake at least for a year. He had come in with fluctuating blood sugar levels, high cholesterol, hypertension, sleep apnea, lymphedema, joints pain basically the problems caused due to excessive weight. Now all his reports are normal, the doctor said.Jogawat is posted in the police control room in the town of Neemuch. He now hopes for a posting in Bhopal or Indore. Ill retire next year but before that, I want a good posting. I never got one all these years because my seniors in the force were worried that my health problems will come in the way of discharging duty. Also, such an overweight cop would have embarrassed the VIPs, he said.Jogawat, 58, said he started piling on weight 20 years ago. First came the slight paunch, which kept growing, he said. Within a matter of months, my weight had jumped from 69 kg to 105 kg. With mobility gone, I kept ballooning, he said.With his new-found frame, both physically and mentally, Jogawat said hes rediscovering the joys of living, such as taking a leisurely walk. I can walk without losing breath. Thats a wonderful feeling, he said.He has an advice for his colleagues and obese people at large. Dont mock an overweight person. Obesity is a disease, and it needs to be treated. Not many can afford weight loss surgery, and the police departments across the country should help cops in need of such surgeries."

Newer varieties are hitting the market while others are fading fast, sources from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee APMC ), Pune told TOI.While old varieties, like sugar baby and namdhari, have disappeared from the markets since farmers found them unviable, newer varieties like sugar king have become an instant hit with consumers. This new variant, said market sources, is not just sweeter than its former counterparts but even healthier.N D Ghule, assistant secretary, APMC explained that varieties like sugar baby and naamdhari have either stopped coming into the markets or are available in a limited quantity.Both varieties have been replaced by smaller watermelons. Farmers were finding it impractical to grow the long variety as the productivity is quite less, only around 10-11 tonne per acre. Meanwhile, the sugar baby variety comes from surrounding regions such as Solapur, Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar . It sells at Rs10-12, per kg, so its price is high but quality is low due to the brix content, said Ghule.Pandurang Supekar, a commission agent at Market Yard , said, The namdhari variety has almost stopped coming into the market, replaced by sugar king. For farmers, the two varieties have a huge variation in terms of productivity. While, naamdharis productivity is 10-12 tonne, per acre, sugar kings productivity is 25-35 tonne, per acre. Hence the switch to sugar king.Seedless mango a rumourRumours about a new variety of seedless mango that can be peeled like a banana has been doing the rounds on social media. Mandar Desai , a third generation mango grower, confirmed that such a mango does not exist anywhere in the world."

The clinics are mostly located in slums and are outpatient clinics. Medicines available here will be primary medicines.Taking a cue from Mohalla clinics in Delhi, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) along with Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare, Telangana, started the services in the city.While municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) minster KT Rama Rao inaugurated the Mohalla clinic in BJR Nagar in Malkajgiri, health minister Dr C Laxma Reddy and All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party chief Asaduddin Owaisi inaugurated clinics located in Hashamabad, Falaknuma, and Gaddiannaram Basthi in Malakpet.The government is planning to set up 1,000 more such clinics, said Rama Rao. He said eye screening tests are an important health care initiative and every citizen will be screened and treated accordingly.Besides the 17 that became functional, another 40 will be operational within in a month confirmed GHMC officials. Each clinic will have a doctor, staff nurse and an assistant.The aim of setting up these clinics is to provide basic clinical outpatient services and build referral linkage between the Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) and other major health facilities.Services provided in these clinics will include OPD (consultation), basic lab diagnosis, drug or contraceptive dispensing, treatment of acute simple illness, immunization services, family planning, counselling and contraception services. Screening for anaemia, non-communicable disease such as blood pressure, blood sugar will also be taken care of at these clinics apart from cancer health promotion activities.Most of these clinics have been set up in GHMC community halls located in slums. Depending on spatial distribution of the population, the Basthi Dawakhana will cater to approximately 5,000-10,000 people. We will keep mind places where people dont have access to UPHCs and other major health facilities such as area hospitals. The most vulnerable points where poor population lives will be identified, said Vakati Karuna, commissioner of health and family welfare.As per Rajiv Avaas Yojana (RAY) survey in 2015, GHMC reported 1,451 slums (986 notified slums and 465 non-notified). GHMC has 145 approved UPHCs out of that 112 are functioning."

The chemical analysis report that will solidify the diagnosis is likely to arrive in another one or two days.Mukerjea regained consciousness on Saturday afternoon, nearly 15 hours after she was found unconscious by guards at Byculla Womens Prison. Professor of medicine at JJ Dr Wiqar Shaikh on Sunday said she was responding to treatment. Its a case of drug overdose similar to what she suffered in 2015. She is presently conscious, responsive, cooperative, and obeying commands. Our only worry now is high fever and pneumonia that she has developed since Saturday evening, he said.A CT scan carried out on Sunday morning showed she had developed aspiration pneumonia, perhaps by swallowing her own saliva in a state of unconsciousness, said medical superintendent Dr Sanjay Surase. Dean Dr SD Nanandkar said she will continue to be in the critical care unit in case she needed oxygen support at any point.Mukerjea has been communicating with the doctors and nurses at the ward. But when I asked her what she consumed and how she got that, she didnt answer, said Dr Shaikh, who also visits the prison once a week as a consultant. He said Mukerjea consumes three pills every day: for blood pressure, depression, and vascular changes in the brain.I had asked jail authorities to administer the drugs under direct supervision. She is supposed to be called to the jail guards room for putting the pills in her mouth, the doctor said, adding that it is unlikely that she may have overdosed on the antiplatelet or the BP medicines. But, only the chemical report will rule out if the antidepressant had a role to play.Dr Shaikh also ended all ambiguity around her 2015 hospitalization to JJ hospital with similar symptoms. An investigation by the prison authorities at the time had attributed it to weakness caused by low blood pressure and sugar levels. This was despite a report from Hinduja Hospital establishing an overdose of anti-depressant benzodiazepines. Dr Nanandkar said they wouldnt be pushing Mukerjea for answers till she felt better.When TOI contacted prison officials on Sunday, they said an inquiry is likely to be initiated into the case."

The figure is higher than the 672 cases reported in the same period last year, despite a farm loan waiver declared last June.Of the 696 cases, only 206 or 29% have been declared eligible for compensation so far. These are cases which a state committee links to indebtedness.The data shows that farmer suicides have risen in the three regions of Marathwada (an arid belt), North Maharashtra (the epicentre of the farmers strike in 2017) and Western Maharashtra (the sugar belt ).The Vidarbha region, home to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, continues to report the highest number of farmer suicides, but has seen a decline of 24 cases compared to the same period last year (see box). Both the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions are in the cotton-growing belt, where 80% of the crop was affected by the pink bollworm pest attack last year.The impact of the loan waiver has yet to kick in with payouts proceeding at a slow rate, say activists. Till March 7, Rs 13,782 crore had been credited into the accounts of 37 lakh farmers, when the final beneficiary list is meant to be 69 lakh farmers. This slow pace has affected crop loan disbursements as well with banks waiting for the waiver money to come in, said Ajit Navle from the Kisan Sabha.Farmer groups stress that the crucial issue of pricing of crops has yet to improve, without which farm incomes will not rise. Officials admit that procurement by the government of crops under the minimum support price has been slow owing to the lack of storage space.Cotton prices have additionally been impacted by the pink bollworm attack, says activist Vijay Jawandhia. Good quality cotton is selling at Rs 4,800 but poorer quality cotton is selling at around Rs 2,500. This is the price for 30-40% of cotton sold, he added."

Most of us would now cringe at the thought of carrying it but in the good old days people would never venture out without picking one from the kitchen shelf.The shopkeeper would drop items from the weighing scale into the cloth bags. What needed to be kept separate used to be deftly wrapped in paper and a string would rapidly be tied around to prevent it from opening, remembers Prashant Gadge, a retired bank employee.Grocery stores have no reason to pack items in plastic bags even today feels T Swaminathan, retired professor of IIT Madras and an environmentalist. Plastic bags have put us in the habit of segregating the food stuff. It is for our convenience that we now pack every vegetable separately, he says and adds that we have discontinued buying milk from the local milkman for the convenience of picking up a pouch from the supermarket.We have to innovate with materials like bagasse (residue of sugar cane after it has been crushed) to make bags. This ban is an opportunity which we should avail to invent an alternate to plastic bags, sums up Swaminathan.For businessman Anil Raoka , banning of plastic doesnt mean going back to the old days. We misused it so much that it had to be banned. I remember going to the local milk man with a vessel to get milk. The women in the house kept up a steady supply of cloth bags which were used for carrying the purchases. It is not about any era we can still do it, he says.Terming plastic as indispensable in technological spheres, architect and conservationist Paramjeet Singh Ahuja says, We belong to an era when glass bottles and paper bags were used. It was much healthier too. Today too I store water in glass bottles which have lids like those on milk bottles in the olden days. Some of my guests get very excited when they see this, he adds.Pathologist Dr Kamayani Deshpande is happy that people will shift back to glass and paper once again. I am seeing a rise in cancer cases all because of use of plastic bottles, she says. Remembering her metal tiffin box Deshpande adds, We never carried a water bottle as drinking from the taps in school was the norm. But now everything is packed in plastic bags, boxes and bottles.Our habit of segregating things led to rampant use of plastic, feels Vishaka Rao who runs an NGO. We used to have huge metal drums for storing grains in the olden times and our refrigerators were never so loaded as they are today. Today a school going child carries plastic boxes, bottles, bags and baskets as these things are cheap and abundantly available. We used cloth pouches for keeping pencils, erasers and scales, she says.Amused at this habit of carrying own water bottle, organic farmer Hemant Singh Chauhan says, We were fine with drinking water from public taps but today water contamination has been hammered in so much that no one would dare to do so.Chauhan says that packaging does add value to a product so it became rampant. Plastic has made it possible to pack even 25gms of any item. We cant even think of tin containers in which ghee and oil used to be sold in those days, he added.There is no alternate to plastic when it comes to packing food according to Ajit Divadkar who runs a bakery and confectionery store. I remember till the late 60s wax paper was used to pack breads and biscuits. But it was not as good as plastic because the edges would not stick and open up. We used to pack snacks in brown paper bags but the food would spoil fast. Plastic gave a boost to food entrepreneurs and I feel it is the consumer who should be punished for abusing plastic so much, he says."

While Hebbalkar is accused of presenting her voters with cookers, stoves and other household articles, Jolle allegedly waived two loan instalments availed by self-help groups from her Beereshwara Cooperative Credit Society. Anjali Nimbalkar has been helping the poor get educational and health facilities.Hailing from a prominent political family in Maharashtra, Dr Anjali is trying her luck for the second time in Khanapur, dominated by Marathi-speaking people.

She is pitted against former MLA Kakasaheb Patil this time too.Jolle, a first-generation politician, her husband and other family members own Beereshwara Cooperative Society, which has a Rs 1,000-crore annual turnover and runs 151 branches and a chain of educational institutions, supermarkets and skill development training centres.The societys activities gave her a much-needed connect with voters and thats why she won the last election. This time too she stands a fair chance, says Parashuram, a government employee from Nippani and a resident of Bengaluru.Her husband Nanasaheb Jolle is BJP nominee from neighbouring Chikkodi-Sadalaga constituency.From being a nobody in the Congress to becoming KPCC womens wing president, Lakshmi Hebbalkar has come a long way in politics. Having tasted defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2013 assembly polls, Hebbalkar is leaving no stone unturned to win Belagavi Rural this time.She is facing twotime MLA Sanjay Patil, Manohar Kinekar of MES and Shivanagouda Patil of the JD(S).Active in the constituency for the past 3-4 years, she has managed to get some work done using her links in the government. Like her male counterparts in the district, Hebbalkar too started a sugar mill to build a network of supporters. She claims credit for helping the Congress wrest Belagavi taluk panchayat from the MES after a long time.But Congress insiders say Hebbalkars own party leaders pose a threat to her as they fear she will only grow if elected MLA, given her connections in AICC."

The greed to earn easy money has also put many foreigners in trouble as they deal not only in charas but also synthetic drugs like heroine, brown sugar and cocaine. Since 2003, Kullu police have arrested 161 foreigners under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. While many have been convicted, some were also deported.Police claim to have controlled cannabis cultivation in the district with the help of sustained campaigns but admit that its cultivation has not stopped completely.Increasing cases of recovery of synthetic drugs is a new challenge before police now. Kullu police arrested 1,936 persons in 1,798 cases for possession of drugs from January 2003 to March 2018. Out of those arrested, 161 are foreigners  from Italy, US, UK, France, Israel and Nigeria . In almost all cases, they had come on tourist visa and were carrying drugs. There have even been cases where the accused were charged with visa overstay.Kullu additional superintendent of police Nishchint Singh Negi said six arrested accused were minors and 78 were women. Most cases were registered for possession of charas and some were registered for possession of drugs like brown sugar, cocaine, heroin, LSD and MDM. Increasing cases of synthetic drugs are a matter of concern. They are supplied in small quantities at tourist places, he said.Years ago, said sources, foreigners encouraged people in Kullu to cultivate cannabis to produce charas. They targeted the illiterate, unemployed and poor people in remote villages. There were some foreigners who even gave funds to locals to produce charas and themselves took consignments out of the state. The easy money coming from trade lured more people to take up this way of life.We have seized nearly 60kg charas this year alone. All police stations and posts have been directed to set up more nakas and increase patrolling, Kullu superintendent of police Shalini Agnihotri said. She added that police are using technology to identify the land under cannabis cultivation. Police are destroying cannabis crop every year. We are taking help of locals as well. Cannabis cultivation is decreasing every year."

Why has he forgotten Madakari Nayaka and Obavva? he told a party convention at Hiriyur town in Chitradurga district.He, however, had to face some embarrassment as the visit to Shreeshaila Mutt branch was cancelled as pontiff Channasiddarama Shivacharya Swami was unavailable. The pontiff was in Hadagali, Ballari district for some rituals.In Hiriyur too, Shah criticised Siddaramaiah for ignoring Nayaka and Obavva. He assured that if the BJP comes to power, the government will build memorials to them. The memorials will catch the attention of the nation, he said.Shah said he has come to Chitradurga thrice. The response of the people is overwhelming. It shows the party will come to power in all constituencies of the district.

Earlier, AAP leaders, including Faridkot MP Sadhu Singh, leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Jaito MLA Baldev Singh had staged a sit-in against the moving of the sugar mills machinery to Bhogpur. Gurdit said that, The cooperative sugar mill was the only the industry in the area. The government should make efforts to revive the mill so that employment could be generated and crop diversification could be achieved by making farmers to plant sugarcane.The state government wants to make money by selling the sugar mill land. We will not allow this to happen, said the struggle committee convener Jiwanjot Kaur. Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of the ruling Congress said that, Only junk-like machinery is being shifted out. The government is trying for the revival of the sugar factory. A cabinet sub-committee will debate over the issue if the mill could be revived, and if so, whether in public sector or private sector. A decision on the matter will be taken soon.Faridkot DC Rajiv Parashar said that the state government had been apprised of the protest against the shifting of the sugar mill machinery."

RBI will be releasing money to Surat District Cooperative Bank by May 10 which is expected to give Rs500 crore to sugar cooperatives and Rs300 crore to SUMUL for distribution among farmers and cattle raisers.Lack of cash was an issue but the RBI officials have promised us that there would not be a problem at all. We have already made a request and would be getting the money required for payment to sugarcane farmers and cattle raisers by May 10, Surat District Cooperative Bank MD Indersinh Mahida said. The payment distribution is expected to be completed to more than 80,000 farmers and 1.5 lakh cattle breeders by June 10.Generally sugarcane farmers get their money from sugar factories in four instalments. The second instalment becomes due on May 01. This time out of eight sugar cooperatives of Surat and Tapi, three stopped crushing by April 10 and others on April 30. Nearly 64 lakh tonne of sugarcane was crushed out of the total of 100 lakh tonne produced in Gujarat by the factories.We need about Rs625 crore to be paid at the rate of Rs1,000 per tonne. However, not all have accounts with us. We need about Rs500 crore for distribution to sugarcane farmers.

In 2017-18 the figure plummeted to 47% of the Rs 54,221 crore target for that yeara drop of 35 percentage points shows data from the State Level Bankers Committee, a forum of banking institutions to coordinate on development programmes.It is true that a large number of farmers have not repaid their pending loans. Its because they are waiting to hear whether they have been declared eligible. In some cases, they are waiting to see if there is a relaxation in the cut-off date or eligibility norms, said farmer leader Ajit Nawale from the Kisan Sabha , among the groups that had agitated for the waiver.Farmer groups say the squeeze in fresh institutional credit has pushed more farmers towards money-lenders and dealers which is contrary to the intention of the waiver. The drop in fresh crops loans means farmers will have no choice but to turn to money-lenders and seeds and pesticide dealers who also extend credit in villages, said Nawale.However, some bankers argue that since farmers have not repaid the previous loan, they still have access to that money. The farmer can use the money that he would have used to repay the loan towards preparing for the kharif season, argued a senior banking official. However, the reason farmer groups were pushing for the waiver was that this sector was facing heavy losses and many did not make enough money to repay pending loans.Economist Madhura Swaminathan says even if the waiver was implemented fully, farm credit would still fall short. The availability of farm credit from the formal sector is woefully short of requirements. Even if the waiver was implemented fully, it does not address the problem of continued need of working capital for agriculture, said Swaminathan. She also pointed out that demonetisation has made things worse and is a major blow to liquidity among small farmers.The sugar belt of western Maharashtra was the biggest beneficiary of crop loans, accounting for Rs 15,773 crore or 62% of the loans extended in 2017-18.The data also showed that cooperative banks and private sector banks met the highest share of their targets by extending over 60% of their crop loan target. However, regional rural banks had extended only 24% of the target and public sector banks had released 38%."

It started out donating grains and groceries to about 20 to 25 organisations catering to orphans, widows, the homeless and the poor.But over the years, this number of partner organisations grew. Today, we cater to around 170 social organisations across Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune district and Pune city. Since our start in 2000, we have been able to donate 5,00,000 kg of foodgrains including rice, wheat, jowar, bajra etc.,  Vijay Kumar Marlecha, the head of food banks city unit, said.The initiative was started by Marlecha along with a few likeminded individuals, who were inspired by the Ek Mutthi Anaaj Yojana popularised by social activist and educator Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Bhaurao used to visit homes in Satara with a bowl asking residents to donate a fistful of foodgrain. That inspired us to start the food bank, said Marlecha. Today, the organisation too visits homes with a container, requesting residents to donate grain.Mahavir Food Bank, which has its office in Bibvewadi, used to receive grains and groceries from 200 people on a regular basis. But storing such huge quantities of grains was a problem. Also, some of them used to be pilfered. So we started doorto-door collection, he said.On Mahavir Jayanti every year, those associated with the food bank organise a rally to collect donations in cash, food grains and other grocery items. With the money collected, we purchase grains and grocery items and distribute them. We also visit orphanages and destitute homes, which rely entirely on government funds  he said.This year, th tion collected lakh and 1,000 groceries on havir Jayant which was cele brated on March 24.We dont collect vegeta bles since the are perishable Rice, dal, jow wheat, bajra grocery items tea, sugar and are also collected. Once we have a sizeable quantity, we distribute them to NGOs and ashramshalas, Marlecha said.The food bank has also teamed with The Robin Hood Army and the city-based Jai Anand Group, which helps farmers sell their produce.This month, we are planning to a donate a relief kit comprising 5kg wheat, 5kg bajra, 5kg rice and tea powder to 100 Dalit families in the Kasurdi village near Bhor. Both the organisations will be a part of this initiative, he said.Two years ago, during the drought in Maharashtra, the organisation donated groceries to Naam Foundation , an NGO, which works to provide relief to farmers in the barren, droughtprone areas of Marathwada and Vidarbha.The foundation ran an anna chatra (a community kitchen) in Pimpri with the foodgrain.

With temperature swinging between 40-43 degree Celsius, city hospitals recorded more than 1,500 cases of heat-related complaints this fortnight alone. Even short trips in the afternoon can lead to stroke. If left untreated, it can lead to hyperthermia, kidney failure, cardiac arrest, organ failure, brain damage and even death, warn doctors.According to figures from 108 emergency services, between April 26 and May 7, as many as 180 cases of chest pain and 70 of blood pressure fluctuations were reported in the city. Among all complaints, the cases of abdominal pain were the highest at 406. A total of 1,598 cases of various heat-related complaints were recorded in the city during this period. Nitu Verma, 32, steps out of her house every day at 1 pm to pick up child from the pick-up point where the school bus drops her daughter. All this takes only 10-15 minutes. A few days ago, she woke up with fever and vomiting. The doctor diagnosed it as heatstroke and put her on saline drip for an entire day. When body temperature exceeds 40C (104F), it may lead to heat stroke which can cause a number of ailments and even death. Heat exhaustion should be treated as a medical emergency, say health experts.Doctors warn that outings as short as just 10 minutes in the afternoon could lead to a stroke. While milder impact of heat like dehydration, fever and vomiting are common, negligence could lead to increased blood pressure, chest and abdominal pain. In extreme conditions, one could suffer organ damage and death as well.Forget an hour, if someone is exposed to direct heat for just 10 minutes, s/he can suffer a heat stroke. Of course, that depends on the history of heat exposure and the persons immunity as well, says Dr Nikhil Lala, CEO of Global Hospital.According to him, if the stroke remains untreated, it can lead to kidney failure, hyperthermia, cardiac arrest, system damage, brain damage and even death. He adds that thanks to increasing awareness, such severe cases are rare. Nitus stroke came as a shock, confesses her husband Rakesh Verma. Now I try not to let my family go out in the heat. We also make sure we remain hydrated, he says. The initial symptoms of heat stroke are headache, dizziness and vomiting, says Dr Maharshi Desai, physician and critical care specialist at Apollo Hospital. Heat stroke is potentially life threatening. Elderly and children are more susceptible to heat stroke and should avoid going out in the heat, he adds. Pointing out at a dangerous phenomenon, he says, This scorching heat has always been there but environmental conditions are also responsible.As humidity increases, the chances of heat stroke increase. I have observed that in past few years, common people like rickshaw drivers are suffering from heat stroke. Elderly people with medical problems can also have a heat stroke sitting inside their homes. He says he gets two to three cases of heat stroke every day on an average. Dr Janardan Jethva, a paediatrician in Ghatlodia, says, In last 15 days, the cases of seizures along with dehydration fever have increased due to aggravated temperature. The cases of viral fever, cold and cough and diarrhoea have also gone up.He advises parents to be extra cautious. There are a lot of social functions in this season, which require travelling. If possible, parents should avoid taking children along with them. If they must, children should be dressed in full clothes and their heads covered with wet napkin. Drinking cold water immediately after entering the house is a strict no-no, he says, explaining that the body should be allowed to cool down to room temperature on its own. Dr Kalpesh Talati, physician at Zydus Hospital, advises people to wear white clothes and use umbrella while going out in the afternoon. Those who suffer from diabetes or any such ailment should keep ORS or salt and sugar handy, he says.Talking about Ahmedabad Municipal Corporations heat action plan, Bhavin Solanki, medical officer of AMC, says, We issue alerts as per IMDs data. In case of red alert, we ask people to stay indoors and urge them to wear mask, dupatta and helmet if they must step out. We also keep AMC-run gardens open during summers and instruct builders to relieve labourers from construction work in the afternoon. He adds that ORS is also available at urban health centres. AMC white-washes the roofs of houses in slums and provides jute rags to cover the roof, both of which help reduce temperature inside the house.As per the IMD forecast, temperature will remain between 41 and 43 degree Celsius this week. Jayanta Sarkar, regional director of IMD, says, There is already yellow alert in city . Temperature has dipped in past days due to strong South Westerly winds. Another factor is also wind and increase in humidity in the atmosphere. With temperature set to rise, one should avoid going out in the heat, and instead try to stay in cool places. The peak hour of heat starts from 11am and continues till 5 pm but the worst hour is between 2:30 pm and 3:30 pm.STAY SAFE Increase liquid intake Stay indoors in the afternoon Avoid working in the open and exposure to direct heat Use an umbrella when out in the afternoon Cover yourself with wet napkin Do not delay consulting a doctor if required"

It has similar provisions for trans-fat and sodium content.Draft says that the nutritional information may additionally be provided in the form of bar code. The colour coding will make it easier for consumers to know about the nutritional value of food products and help them make choices as per their requirements.The issue of labelling of food products having GM ingredients has, however, drawn flak from certain quarters. Stakeholders have flagged that the move is inconsistent and ultra vires for FSSAI to issue any regulation on this matter when GM foods itself are not allowed to be sold in India.Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor of the Coalition for a GM-Free India, who sent the groups objections on the draft to the FSSAI told TOI that that the labelling move will, in fact, allow the GM foods to enter food supply chain when it is anyway illegal to sell GM foods in India currently. We need preventive action at this juncture rather than regulatory action, he said.Other experts, however, differ. Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, The GM labelling is an important step but we need a proper system to check it. We need advanced lab facilities to check whether the food stuffs contain GM ingredients or not.Bhushan is, however, critical about the approach of the FSSAI on finer points of the proposed labelling provisions. He said, It has adopted a reductionist approach towards nutrition. It allows a product to display nutrition benefits based on one attribute even if the product is bad on other attributes."

This unusually viscous dark brown coloured pungent liquid after recovery of alcohol.If let out untreated, it can cause huge damage to the soil, groundwater and rivers.Now for the first time, Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute (CSMCRI) in Bhavnagar has developed a technology that not only extracts potash fertilizer (potash is generally imported at present in the country) besides getting nutritious cattle feed binder. Most importantly they extracted pure water from the toxic waste.Industry experts have estimated that nearly 8-15 litres of toxic spent-wash is generated from production of each litre of ethanol. Realising this problem and the large-scale environment damage the toxic waste was causing, in 2015, CSIR-CSMCRI director Dr Amitava Das formed a team of scientists with Pratyush Maiti, Dr Somya Haldar, Dr Subarna Maiti and Sanjay Patil to explore the possibility for utilizing the spent-wash from distilleries as a potential resource for potash fertilizer along with recovery of residual organics.The process will also provide a major impetus to the production of cleaner ethanol blended fuel production. Today, our countrys current capacity can produce just 3% ethanol- blended fuels.If the CSIR-CSMCRI process is adopted, we can produce as much as 10% blended fuels as government will clear expansion of existing distilleries and allow new units, said Maiti.The first pilot project of the CSIR-CSMCRI process was executed at Kamrej Sugar Mills in Navi Pardi in Surat, while the first commercial deployment of the process plant will be operational at Aurangabad Distillery Ltd in Maharashtra.Maiti said that the spent-wash is generally expelled by the distillerys fermenter blocks and consists of suspended organic and inorganic matter with high toxicity. The non-sugar portion of this coffee brown liquid is coagulated to precipitate out potassium and then converted to potassium sulphate, potassium nitrate and monopotassium phosphate to be used in fertilizers. Whatever is left is evaporated to recover pure water which is recycled back into the distillery plant.A normal 60 kilolitres per day distillery plant utilises 600 to 650 cubic meter of ground water, out of which 500 cubic meter of water can be recovered through this process and recycled, said Maiti. He added, In our process nothing gets wasted. We extract a nutrition binder in cattle feed that replaces molasses, the distilleries will not be extract groundwater or pollute our precious river resources, said Maiti."

Mayawati added that people were already aware of the SP-BSP alliance even though no formal announcement had been made yet.In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the combined vote share of SP and BSP was 41.8%, while BJP and its ally Apna Dal got 43.3% and won 73 out of 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh. SP and BSP fought elections separately. While SP managed to win only five seats, BSP drew a blank.

Mayawati supported SP days before the crucial bypolls for seats that were vacated by CM Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya. The coming together of the two parties saw caste equations work in their favour.In the forthcoming Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur Assembly bypolls, Mayawati has reportedly asked her party cadres to work for SP and RLD candidates to defeat BJP.There had been signs of souring ties when SP failed to ensure victory for BSPs lone candidate in Rajya Sabha elections after the bypolls. While BJP had tried to warn Mayawati against trusting SP chief Akhilesh Yadav , she lashed out at the ruling party, saying it would not make any difference to the closeness between the two parties. Subsequently, SP contested one of two non-BJP seats for MLC elections, allowing BSP to field its candidate on the other one.When asked whether BJP was trying to put pressure on her as CBI recently took over the probe into alleged irregularities in the disinvestment of 21 state-owned sugar mills in 2010-11 when she was CM, she said: BSP has never come under pressure from BJP or Congress or any other parties. BSP has always fought back.The divestment has allegedly caused a loss of Rs 1,179 crore to the state exchequer."

The coming together of the two parties saw caste equations work in their favour.In the forthcoming Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur Assembly bypolls, Mayawati has reportedly asked her party cadres to work for SP and RLD candidates to defeat BJP.There had been signs of souring ties when SP failed to ensure victory for BSPs lone candidate in Rajya Sabha elections after the bypolls.While BJP had tried to warn Mayawati against trusting SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, she lashed out at the ruling party, saying it would not make any difference to the closeness between the two parties. Subsequently, SP contested one of two non-BJP seats for MLC elections, allowing BSP to field its candidate on the other one.When asked whether BJP was trying to put pressure on her as CBI recently took over the probe into alleged irregularitiesin thedisinvestmentof 21 state-owned sugar mills in 2010-11 when she was CM, she said: BSP has never come under pressure from BJP or Congressor any other parties.BSP has always fought back.The divestment has allegedly caused a loss of Rs 1,179 crore to the state exchequer."

They have not been paid for the sugarcane procured from them by the Alanganallur co-operative sugar mill.As many as 10,000 farmers from Madurai, Dindigul and Aruppukottai have still to get Rs 21 crore from Alanganallur sugar mill authorities, he said. Now, we understand that the government is going to implement the revenue sharing formula. But, that will only deprive the farmers of their benefits, he said. The farmers stand to lose about Rs 400 per tonne if the sharing formula is implemented and that would end sugarcane farming in many places, he said.Last year, the sugar mill had procured only 37,000 tonnes from the farmers of the region. But they are yet to pay them Rs 1 crore to them. Though the authorities tried to pay 400 farmers in cheques, they have bounced, furthering their issues.The amount that the farmers have not got due to this is Rs 85 lakh, he said. They are demanding that the dues be settled to all the farmers immediately"

The ill-preparedness of the district hospital to deal with such eventualities came to the fore when many children were brought in quick succession.With over a dozen students admitted post-vaccination, two students with intravenous drips were put on a single bed due to lack of facilities. Out-oforder air coolers further added to the discomfort of the sick children and their parents.Though most of the children who arrived at the hospital were vaccinated on Monday, two children vaccinated on May 1 and 4 respectively, also needed hospitalization on Monday.Earlier, six-year-old Gurnoor Kaur of Jai Singh Wala village and a student of Adarsh School, Bathinda had died on May 5. She had been vaccinated on May 4. The health authorities had claimed that she had died of gastroenteritis and not due to the MR vaccination.Navjot Kaur (15), a Class X student of Baba Farid School, was made to share bed with Prince (12), a Class VII student of Santa Public School in the hospitals children ward. Sixyear-old Rajbir Singh of a play way school in the Canal Colony was brought to the hospital with low sugar levels by the Lal Singh Basti dispensary staff. He was later referred to a private hospital where the doctors attending to him said he was recovering well.Another student of Baba Farid School, 15-year-old Neha complained of uneasiness after vaccination and was taken to the hospital. Her mother Kiran said, Initially we were scared, but now that she has recovered, we are taking her home.

Top IAS officers who called the shots in BSP government formed core group on disinvestment.The CAG report, a copy of which is with TOI, found them involved in the selection of advisers, valuers, responsible for undervaluing land of the 21 sugar mills, plant and machinery, as well as tailoring policies for bidders and committing other irregularities causing unprecedented loss to the state.Acting on the CAG findings, chief minister Yogi Adityanath recommended a full-fledged inquiry into the sale of sugar mills. In fact, CBI inquiry of the sugar mills sale was BJPs election promise and part of its poll manifesto.CAGs voluminous report did not mention then chief minister Mayawati nor cabinet secretary late Shashank Shekhar Singh anywhere as the decision of privatizing the loss making sugar mills was unanimously adopted at the cabinet meeting. The CAG also did not challenge the cabinet decision of disinvestment of sugar mills, but detected mass irregularities in its implementation.Majority of the IAS officers ranging from the then chief secretary, additional cabinet secretary and principal secretary dominated the three committees: core group of secretaries on disinvestment (CGD), consultative evaluation committee (CEC) and consultative monitoring committee (CMC) by virtue of the post they held in finance, planning, sugar cane, sugar and other departments.The CAG report had been submitted to the House during Akhilkesh Yadav government, but no action was taken on it. One of the two retired chief secretaries, who were in the CGD, has reportedly expressed wish to turn approver in the case.The CAG had criticized CGD for the frequent changes in eligibility criteria at the instance of bidders from time to time due to which three bidders remained in fray despite not meeting the net worth criteria. The report also blamed CGD for not analysing reasons as to how the bid prices for 11 mills were just above 50% of the expected price.The IAS officers in the CGD constituted by the state government on June 23, 2008, are likely to face heat in the coming days. They include then chief secretary, who was CGD chairman, while principal secretaries/ secretaries of finance, law, planning, public enterprises and disinvestment and industrial development commissioner were members."

She never recovered and died five years later. Singhs 12-year legal battle finally ended with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Delhi awarding him Rs 10.5 lakh as compensation. In a landmark judgment, the commission declared it a case of medical negligence while relying on the diagnosis of one of the doctors who was consulted after her condition worsened.A bench, comprising the consumer apex bodys president Justice D K Jain, members Rekha Gupta and M Shreesha, held: The pathetic condition of the patient is evidenced in the treatment record and discharge summary of Dr S M Rohatgi. The contention of the treating doctor that the letter head of Dr Rohatgi cannot be used for medico-legal purposes and, therefore, the prescription cannot be relied upon, is completely unsustainable.Singh, who has travelled 15 times from his native Gaya, Bihar, to the capital, had alleged medical negligence on the part of Dr Sudhir Mohan Kant, who had performed total abdominal hysterectomy on his wife on August 14, 2005. You see me standing here in front of you, but mentally, physically and financially, I feel dead, he says.During his wifes comatose condition, Singh moved a district forum in 2006 and was awarded Rs 10 lakh as compensation on July 11, 2007. However, the state commission brought the amount down to Rs 4 lakh on September 30, 2011, when the surgeon appealed against the order. In January 2012, Singh  through advocates Shashi Shanker and Pooja Mohanani  filed a revision plea in the apex body. Devi was operated upon by Dr Sudhir Mohan Kant at noon, but failed to regain consciousness. She was administered oxygen as she had difficulty in breathing. After she remained unconscious till 7 pm, a second surgery was advised for which Singh was asked to sign on some papers. He was later told that she would regain consciousness, but never did. In a desperate attempt to revive his partner, Singh visited a dozen doctors, including Dr Rohatgi, in September, 2005.Shanker asserted that Dr Rohatgi had, in a prescription, clearly written that a large amount of ether was used as anaesthesia before the surgery. The doctor (Kant) did not take any precautionary measures of conducting pre-investigative tests with respect to blood, urine, blood sugar etc, prior to the operation and used large quantities of ether on account of which the patient remained in a lifeless state, he argued.Dr Kant, on the contrary, blamed the anaesthetist, who had reportedly examined the patient and found her fit for administration of anaesthesia. The bench, however, noted the treatment record showed that the blood sugar, serum creatinine and other tests were performed only on the next day of the surgery, by when the patient was already in an unconscious state.In addition, for his loss of love and affection of a partner, the commission took into account the wifes age, deprivation Singh had to suffer in terms of companionship, care and protection which he and his children could have got, and the pain he had to endure. Amount awarded by the district forum of Rs 10 lakh deserves to be paid to the complainant, the commission held, besides imposing a cost of Rs 50,000 on the treating doctor.Of the total compensation, Singh was earlier paid Rs 3 lakh by the insurance company and, now, only the balance amount has to be paid to him by Dr Kant"

The announcement of a Rs 1,800 crore package for the sugar industry has pushed sugar prices from Rs 3,050 to Rs 3,300 per 100kg in the open market. The retail price of sugar is not going to dip further, experts say. It is unlikely that the retail price of sugar will fall further. This partial package to the sugar industry will help cut losses of sugar cooperatives, said Sandip Mangrola , chairman of Vataria Sugar.The sugar industry is partially satisfied by the central governments package . However, stakeholders still feel that export subsidy is provided, losses will not be covered completely.Today, the production cost for a sugar cooperative is Rs 35 per kg or Rs 3,500 for 100kg. The government has fixed the minimum support price at Rs 2,900 per 100kg and announced a decision to create a buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar.Sugar sells for about Rs 2,100 per 100kg in the international market and this causes losses.Along with the export subsidy, we also need working capital loans for sugar cooperatives to cover short margins. Today, we have high liabilities against lower stock and unless these two steps  export subsidy and provision for working capital loans  are taken, the industry will keep losing. We are looking at bumper yield in the coming year too, said Mangrola.The government has taken a few steps, but it is uncertain whether they will completely stop the losses. It will surely stop the decline of sugar retail prices. Sugar is unlikely to get cheaper for the common man, said a wholesaler, on condition of anonymity.Against the total demand of 240 lakh tonnes in the country, sugar production this year was a bumper 314 lakh tonnes."

Loans taken by TN sugar industry from banks/financial institutions must be rescheduled with three years moratorium period and a longer repayment period in view of the worst drought witnessed in 141 years, said Palani G Periasamy, president, South Indian Sugar Mills Association (SISMA), Tamil Nadu. TN sugar industry requires a special package in view of continuous monsoon failure for the past five yearsand failure of both the monsoons in 2016, he said. TN sugar mills should be exempted from export obligations  Minimum Indicative Export quotas (MIEQ) allotted by the Food Ministry to each sugar mill  as their sugar production during the current season is just 6 lakh tonnes as against the states annual requirement of 15 lakh tonnes, he stated.With capacity utilisation for sugar mills in TN slumping to 25% during the current season (October-September), cost of production has gone up, SISMA said. With low sugar prices, TN mills could neither pay FRP (fair and remunerative price) on time nor service nor repay the loans, it said. From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in the 2011-12 season, mills crushed only 119.04 lakh tonnes during the 2016-17 season. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes. Cane arrears to farmers have piled up to nearly Rs 300 crore in the state. Stating that the sugar industry needs structural changes for long-term sustainability, Periasamy, who is also the chairman of Dharani Sugars and Chemicals, said that cane price should be linked to the sugar price. Mills responsibility should be restricted to only 75% of realisation from sugar, he said. Otherwise, excess cane should be converted into ethanol and the entire quantity of ethanol must be procured by oil marketing companies at remunerative prices, he said. TN cane farmers should be paid the already announced subsidy directly without linking the same to export obligations. Otherwise, most of the sugar mills in TN will not be able to start their crushing operations during next season, Periasamy said. The union government has announced several measures including creation of 3 million tonnes of buffer stock and fixed minimum selling price (MSP) for sugar at Rs 29,000 per tonne to help the industry. The government intervened to support the industry following the fall in the sugar prices from a high of Rs 37,500 per tonne (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) in October 2017 to a low of Rs 26,500 per tonne in mid-May 2018.This resulted in losses for sugar mills and cane arrears crossing Rs 20,000 crores in the country."
5b1ed0f59855b74aba67e9fb,EPS writes to Modi seeking relief to TN sugar industry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/eps-writes-to-modi-seeking-relief-to-tn-sugar-industry/articleshow/64502720.cms,2018-06-08,"CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tamil Nadu sugar industry and mills, seeking exemption and relief from the purview of certain measures approved by the Union cabinet to improve liquidity of sugar mills.Exemptions from stock holding limits and minimum indicative export quota for sugar mills from Tamil Nadu were some of the key points raised by the chief minister in his letter.Palaniswami said the approval of the cabinet for creation of buffer stock will be useful only to the mills that have not yet cleared the fair and remunerative price (FRP) and have excess stock. These mills are mostly in the states of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh . In the case of Tamil Nadu, most of the private sugar mills have paid their FRP through borrowings, while cooperative and public sector mills have cleared the arrears with high interest cost through advance from the state government.Fixation of minimum sugar price of Rs 29 per kg for the domestic market may not ensure cost recovery for sugar mills in TN due to poor recovery and low capacity utilisation precipitated by drought. Further, the proposed financial assistance to ethanol projects will not provide any immediate relief to the sugar mills in the state due to low availability of sugarcane, Palaniswami pointed out, among other issues related to the sugar industry in the state."
