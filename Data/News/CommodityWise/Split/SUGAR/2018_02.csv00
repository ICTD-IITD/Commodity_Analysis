Owner of distilleries and sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, he was the richest candidate in the fray.Within days of the Congress forming the government, he faced allegations of impropriety for using frontmen to bid for sand mines in the state, but he brazened it out. Questions were raised over his familys power business.The latest controversy is about the enforcement directorates (ED) summons to his son, Rana Inder Partap Singh, in connection with raising funds abroad allegedly without the mandatory approval. HT spoke to Rana Gurjit about his resignation, his bte noire and the rumblings within the Congress.Excerpts:You kept saying that the Justice JS Narang Commission has given you a clean chit in the sand mine controversy. What made you resign?The reason is simple. I am in politics because of (chief minister) Capt Amarinder Singh. And I am a true Congressman. There was a smear campaign being run against me. Daily (AAP leader) Sukhpal Khaira was giving a statement against the government. Though I have been given a clean chit, it did not end. I, therefore, offered my resignation on moral grounds about a week ago.What was the final trigger?After sand mines, they have now started raising the issue of the ED summons. It was a public issue. The ED has the right to question anyone. When we are questioned, we have the right to give our reply to them. The public issue (through which funds were raised abroad) was in 2006. This case was being dealt by the ED office in Chandigarh for quite some time. Now, it has issued summons and the managing director of the company (Rana Gurjits son) will go and reply. There is no allegation. The ED wants some answers. Jheda gaddi leuga, challan odha hi houga. Who issues challan to those loitering on roads? Whatever we have earned is through our hard work.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira was demanding your resignation from the time when the sand mine controversy broke out.Sand mining is not an issue. Nothing was proved against me. The Narang commission has given its report, but they question everyone. I have resigned due to relentless tirade. It is for my party to decide now. Why doesnt Khaira also show some moral standard and resign from his position? He was issued summons in a drug case.When you gave the resignation, what was the CMs response?I cannot tell you that. This was between me and him.There is talk of rumblings within the party and there was not much support for you. What do you say?This is not true. I dont believe such talk. I believe in one thing that you should never suspect your party and your partner."

Lakha was arrested from Moga on Thursday, when he was heading towards Shahkot to raise the issue of contamination of water, especially after the leakage of molasses into the Beas and death of hundreds of fish.Presently, Lakha has become a activist, raising issues ranging like least importance being given to Punjabi language to contamination of water to drugs being supplied for money in jails. On May 21, he was called by Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, where Lakha told him about the going-ons in state jails. He was caught going online in Faridkot jail about burning of paddy stubble a few months ago.Lakha, along with Dal Khalsa vice-president Hadeep Singh Mehraj and supporters, was going to Shahkot when a police party from Bathinda stopped him near Buggipura intersection of Moga and took him into custody. He was taken to Bathinda from Moga. Before his arrest, Lakha said, We were going towards Shahkot to question the government, which is responsible for contamination of the canal waters. For the last 40 years, toxins are being thrown into rivers and canals but nobody is making any effort to ensure that clean water flows in these channels. We were going to tell voters in Shahkot to ask the government why they are not getting clean water.The government is shying away from taking strict action against the owners of sugar mill, which released molasses into the river, because it belongs to politically influential people. The waters of Punjab are being spoiled by bigwigs and people like us who want to raise their voice against it are forced to keep silent and our fundamental rights are being snatched, he added.Lakha said they had been moving around in Bathinda but nobody arrested them. It is now when we were going to Shahkot that the police have become active and arrested us from Moga, he maintained. Moga SP (investigations) Wazir Singh said, It is not Moga police which has arrested Lakha. Bathinda police has arrested him from our territory.Bathinda SSP Naveen Singla said, Lakha was wanted by police in a case of defacing the signboards written in English or Hindi at the offices of Union and state governments in Bathinda on April 1. We do not know where he was going. We got to know about his being in Moga, so our police party got him there."

Sukhbir also raised the demand that a central team from the Union ministry of environment should be deputed for an on-the-spot study of the situation in Punjab and Rajasthan.The former deputy chief minister said the mill was owned by highly-connected political leader who is also religious adviser to the Punjab chief minister. The grave irony of the tragedy authored by a religious adviser of the chief minister is that it has led to the contamination of the sacred Kali Bein which is historically associated with the life of Guru Nanak Dev , he added.Sukhbir said the scale of compensation should be established to be paid to the affected people and the burden of this compensation should be borne by the guilty industrialist."

However, this time around, the grand alliance claims that 5.80 lakh Muslims, 2.5 lakh Dalits and over 1.5 lakh Jats in Kairana, accounting for roughly 60% of the electorate, have been rallying behind the SP-RLD alliance.The numbers and the momentum are with us. With Jats and Dalits on our side, polarisation will not let BJP through, Sanjay Lathar, SP MLC and the partys Kairana poll in-charge said. The BJP however rubbished the claims as caste arithmetic which no longer held true.We are fighting this election in the name of development, not caste. We fought with development as our agenda in 2014 and won. If they (alliance) claim that all the Muslims are with them, we can also say that all the Hindus are with us. But we do not want to play that kind of politics, BJPs west UP in-charge Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.On the ground, BJP, jittery after the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypoll loss, has been on its toes over the new caste arithmetic where Kashyaps, Gujjars and others, dubbed to be BJP loyalists, comprise nearly 40% of the electorate.Unlike 2014, Jats have been rallying behind Ajit Singh. Plus, the consolidated minority votes has shifted the arithmetic away from us, a BJP insider told TOI.Jats and a split opposition were dubbed to be game changers for BJP in 2014. Claiming that the party has swinging votes among Dalits and Jats, MP Sanjeev Baliyan said, Among Dalits, people from Kori, Khatik and Valmiki communities are still with BJP. A section of Jat voters also support us.This time around, the grand alliance is trying to keep the flock together with RLD in attack mode over farm issues, especially the plight of cane farmers. The consistent attack has unsettled BJP with CM Yogi Adityanath trying to ward off some of the concerns during his first bypoll rally in Saharanpur on May 22.The earlier regimes had shut down operations of several sugar mills and we revived them once we came to power, Adityanath said at the rally in Saharanpurs Ambehta. He also assured the gathering that strict action would be taken against officials who fail to waive off farm loans by May 31.As of May 11, the arrears of cane farmers had accumulated to Rs 11,856 crore. Though in the 2017-18 season, UP has crushed and produced record sugarcane and sugar respectively, low price of sugar in the market has given a blow to the mills which is said to be one of the reasons for accumulated dues."

A time when the devout fast from pre-dawn to sunset. It is also when the citys quaint areas  the bylanes off Mohammed Ali Road Bhendi Bazar and the heart of Bohri Mohalla  come to life with mouth-watering foods. BT went to the most popular of these spots  the bustling and beautiful Minara Masjid gully. Head here by 7 pm to catch the buzz, sights and sounds that it is so known for. And take your appetites along. The brightly-lit lane has little stalls on either side dishing up rolls, kebabs, baida roti, rich haleem and khichda , chilled firnis and, of course, piping hot malpuas, drizzled with thick cream. Heres more...Right at the entrance of the lane is a little makeshift stall with a huge handi or cauldron of khichda. This is a specialty  made of delicious, slow-cooked meat and lentils and garnished with thin slices of garlic, birasta (fried onion), mint leaves, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Its said to infuse energy in those who are fasting to last through the day! You will also find a lighter and creamier version of the dish  the Hyderbadi badaami haleem  here.There are several finger foods to tuck into. Try the Chicken 65 (a fiery import from Andhra Pradesh), garam samosas, masala aloo, and more, with some naan.When youre here, reserve your appetite for kebabs, kheema, boti, bheja fry and other skewered fare, hot off the sigdi and made on a large, iron tawa. These dishes must be had steaming hot, with dollops of tangy mint chutney, onion and mint leaves.An unmissable part of your gastronomic trail is the malpua and it deserves special mention. It is essentially a large pancake-like sweet, made of egg, maida, sugar, saffron and milk. The round, sweet malpua is best had hot, straight from the kadhai, with a lavish dollop of thick cream or malai. Making it is also quite an art! First the eggs are beaten and charoli nuts, sugar and saffron are added to this. The malupa maker then swirls a generous portion into the smoking kadhai and deep fries it in ghee. If you want to have a small portion, ask for a single or then have the double and rabdi varieties.You cant leave here without a round or two of cold firni . You can also end your repast with sandan  the steamed sweet that looks like an idli, soft shahi tukda, cold fruity milkshakes, black currant and dudhi halwa and the mithai-centred flaky phool khaja."

For Jats, an upper caste community, it is a shahi (royal) crop, which decides their status in the society, notwithstanding the arrears of mills which now run into thousands of crores.Jaipal Singh Chaudhary, a farmer with 20 bigha land in Mandawali village of Bijnor, cannot think of anything other than sugarcane despite having a debt of Rs 90,000. He sells his produce to Bilai sugar mill, which has the worst payment record in the region. Out of Rs 2.4 lakhs that the mill owes him, he has received only Rs 80,000 so far.But, despite the hardships, Singh never tried vegetable or fruit crops, which he said is not the domain of the upper caste Jats. Our forefathers have been involved in sugarcane cultivation. How can we move to any other crop? This is against our tradition. We are known by this crop, he says.Jats in western UP feel that it is below their status to abandon sugarcane crop in favour of alternative options.Anirudh Saroha, a farmer in Muzaffarnagar , says, It is a shahi (royal) crop that does not demand much attention. And, at the time of harvest, one just needs to employ cheap labour and get it harvested. Sugarcane is linked to our honour and status of our family. Even marriages are settled on the basis of how much land is under cane cultivation. We know that the payment structure is very bad, but then we cannot forego our honour because of that.When contacted, soil scientist and director (Research), Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel University, Dr Ashok Kumar said, There is one more factor involved as to why sugarcane is favourite among a section of farmers. It is not a labour intensive crop. Rains or thundershowers have little effect on it. Then, unlike vegetables which require too much of nurturing and attention and need to be safeguarded against animals, sugarcane are less problematic. Jitender Hudda , another farmer from Thanabhawan town of Shamli, echoed similar sentiment. Market for sugarcane is easily available. There are a lot of sugar mills or collection centres. Regarding payment, sooner or later, it arrives."

Eating Ajwa will boost your health, said Nadeem Pasha at Dilkush Distributors.He added, There is a belief that if the seed is powdered and consumed, it will close holes in the heart, if any.Pasha, who has been involved in the trade of dry fruits for decades, said, We have, at least 18 to 20 varieties of dates, all of which are imported.

Dates coated with white and dark chocolate are a big hit, Santosh said.Asma Jabeen, a homemaker who was stocking up on dates, said, Dates are extremely good for ones health. We buy and eat dates throughout the year, and not just during the month of Ramzan. Dates are known to reduce sugar level, and keep one healthy.

But, the number of people preferring bottled beverages is dipping as many rely on healthy traditional drinks available in this season. People are gulping down more of chilled juices and sherbets or natural drinks like coconut water.Anshiki Dixit, a homemaker spotted at a Sudha milk booth near Vivekananda Marg, said, Whenever I crave for drinking something outside home, I prefer small packets of mango lassi rather than going for soda drinks. Its healthy and pure.Celebrating summer, the refreshing Bihari coolers that find place on the priority list include the humble sattu drink to the earthy shikanji to the lavish lassi and sherbet. A wide variety of drinks  creamy and fruit filled lassis and thandai made from milk and dry fruits, shikanjis of water, sugar and lemon, aam panna from unripe mangoes, chillies and mint leaves, chhach and regular fruit drinks and coconut water are also among the favourites.Speaking to this newspaper, 20-year-old Deepshikha of Boring Road area said, I am a hosteller and have to go for coaching in the noon time. Before going out, I drink sattu every day as it is the tastiest and healthiest way to fight with the extreme heat conditions, and also waives off the hunger pangs for pretty good time.Near a bustling spot adjacent to Patna Junction, Suraj Yadav, who owns a makeshift shop of variety of drinks, said, Sattu and bel sherbet have the highest sales. They come at a nominal cost of Rs20 per glass and I sell more than 200 glasses a day. Besides, people also go for various fruit juices to fight the scorching temperatures.Elaborating on the harmful effects of having carbonated drinks, Dr Ravi Kirti, a general physician at All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ), Patna, said, Sugar sweetened carbonated drinks are good in taste, but are really harmful for our body. Increased risk of heart attack, obesity, diabetes are some of the most prominent health issues that can be attributed to these drinks.He suggested that one should rather go for homemade lemon shikanji, jaljeera, aam panna and give up carbonated drinks."

The department has decided to chalk out a comprehensive plan for the rejuvenation of Beas Conservation Reserve.Pannu said aquatic life is coming back to affected areas in the river from upstream. Fish seedlings more than two inches long will be procured from government fish seed farms across the state to augment aquatic life in the river, he said.In line with expert advice, only indigenous herbivorous and omnivorous fish species will be released into the Beas under the supervision of wildlife experts, said Pannu, adding that no carnivorous and exotic fish such as common carp and malli would be released into the river at this stage.He said the irrigation department would be asked to release more water from Pong Dam into the Beas in the days to come to encourage more aquatic life from the mother source to flow to affected parts of Beas.The PPCB chairman said a comprehensive plan for the rejuvenation of Beas Conservation Reserve was being prepared in association with the wildlife department.The interim report of this plan will be submitted to the PPCB in the seven days so that steps for rejuvenation can be taken immediately, he said."

Stating that the spirit of Wuhan ""underpinned"" the Qingdao meeting, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale called Xi's acceptance of Modi's invite for another informal summit in 2019 in India as a significant takeaway from the meeting on Saturday.Another significant development was that Modi and Xi agreed to identify a project in ""capacity building"" in Afghanistan on which the two countries can work together. The idea that the two countries can work together in Afghanistan on economic projects had originated in the Wuhan summit. Significantly for India, China also agreed to renew an agreement which calls for sharing of hydrological data of the Brahmaputra river in flood season (from May 15 to October 15) with India.Modi and Xi, who have met on more than a dozen occasions in the past four years, have been for some time trying to rise above the historical and policy trappings that has held India-China relations in an unsettled state for decades. The announcement about Xi's visit is seen as a signal to the people of India and China that the two leaders have finally agreed on a plan to resolve past disputes to the extent possible.A plan is afoot to create a mechanism at the level of the two leaders to provide strategic guidance to the two militaries to keep peace on the border and take forward connectivity projects in third countries, starting in Afghanistan.The signal came on the sidelines of the SCO summit, which is being attended by Pakistan's President Mamnoon Hussain. The decision to take forward the system of informal summits is a message to Pakistan as well because Islamabad has been counting on India's support in its disputes with India.India and China also signed two bilateral agreements on continuing the sharing of hydrological data on the Brahmaputra river and on expanding rice exports to China.During his meeting with Xi, the Prime Minister highlighted the negative balance of trade arrangement for India and expressed the hope that China would buy a range of products like rice, sugar and pharmaceuticals from India. The decision on rice exports could be a starting point for sale of Indian farm produce and processed products like sugar to China in order to reduce the trade imbalance.Under an MoU between China's ministry of water resources and India's ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation, China has agreed to share flood season data with India from May 15 to October 15 every year. Data was not shared last year, with China citing landslides in Tibet and amid strained ties during the Doklam stand-off. China has now pledged to share data with India during the flood season, and to also provide data if the water levels exceed mutually agreed levels during the non-flood season.China's customs administration and India's department of agriculture on rice exports will enable India to now export non-basmati rice varieties, expanding an earlier 2006 protocol on rice exports. China's ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui said on Twitter that Saturday's meeting will discuss the blueprint of relations going forward and also the consensus reached in Wuhan last month."

Recently, they tested samples for some 10 brands of white bread available in Ahmedabad for quality and labelling. The test report revealed that most brands did not mention the values of sodium content on the nutritional information.According to the Food Safety and Standards Regulations (Packaging and Labelling) 2011, manufacturers need to mention nutritional information on energy, protein, carbohydrate, sugar and fat on the packaging but not sodium. It is important to mention this as excess sodium intake has several health hazards, said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, CERC.They should also mention manufacturing date as well as use by date for bread, which is a food product with a shelf life of not more than seven days, she added.A similar comparative test was carried out by CERC in 2004, when the sodium content in white bread was found to be significantly high. This has reduced significantly and is well within the permissible range, which is a great move by the bakeries in the interest of the consumer. However, we urge the manufacturers to be transparent and mention the sodium content per 100g on their packaging, said Shah."

The initiative is being taken under its smart ration card scheme, earlier known as the Atta-Dal (wheat flour and pluses) scheme.Also, the distribution of wheat flour and pluses would start by June 15 under the Aadhaar-enabled targeted public distribution system (TPDS). As many as 1.37 crore individuals from 35.26 lakh families across Punjab are covered under the TPDS.In its election manifesto, the Congress had promised the then Atta-Dal scheme would be reviewed to make it more comprehensive. The manifesto promised that along with Atta-Dal, sugar and tea would be provided to all those covered under the scheme.Director of the food, civil supply and consumer affairs department Anindita Mitra said soon a meeting would be held at the chief secretary-level to decide the quantity of sugar and tea leaves to be distributed to the eligible individuals under the scheme. She added by June 15, it would be ensured that Aadhaar numbers of all eligible individuals were seeded with the state government portal to avoid any probability of bogus beneficiaries.After a large number of bogus beneficiaries of the scheme were discovered, a decision was taken in the council of ministers meeting in November last year to engage Bharat Electronics Limited, Broadcasting Engineering Consultants Indian Limited, and Electronics Corporation of India Limited to implement TPDS computerization.The state government has ensured public distribution of ration through ePoS (electronic point of sale) devices using biometrics readers installed at fair price shops. In case of finger biometric failure due to any reason, the IRIS enabled identification would be done.There are around 16,738 fair price shops across Punjab and nearly 1,400 inspectors of the food and supplies department would use an ePoS machine on rotation basis for approximately 10-12 fair price shops falling in their domain.Under the scheme, the Punjab government procures wheat from the de-centralized procurement arrangement and distributes it through fair price shops under bi-annual distribution model. The beneficiaries get wheat in 30 kg sealed bags at Rs 2 per kilogram twice a year. Also, 500 gram of pulses are being distributed per person per month to eligible individuals at Rs 20 per kilogram."

He himself is a farmer growing cane across ten acres in U.P.s Sambhal district.He told The Hindu that the DSM sugar mill at Asmoli owes him about Rs. 3 lakh in payment arrears for his cane. Thats a fraction of the more than Rs. 22,000 crore in dues that sugar mills owe cane farmers, as record highs in production led to a crash in prices this year.Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan confirmed his ministry had forwarded the new proposal to the Cabinet and that it would come up for approval soon. Food Secretary Ravikant admitted that mills had not yet received any benefit from the previous subsidy announced on May 2. We have not got any claims yet, because sugar mill owners have not been able to fulfil the conditions, he said.Tough conditionsThe May 2 announcement stipulated that mills meet an export quota and supply at least 80% of their contract value for ethanol to oil firms. Industry sources said that with global sugar prices even lower than domestic prices, exports were not viable; only about 75,000 tonnes have been exported against the requirement of 20 lakh tonnes.The ethanol contract period only ends in November 2018, meaning that mills have not fulfilled that condition either. Mills were also required to maintain a reverse stockholding limit set by the government in February and March this year.In Feb.-March, several mills were under pressure to sell the sugar and pay cane farmers, so they breached that limit. About 40% of the industry is in default of that condition. Its a retrospective condition, so they dont even have the possibility of complying now, said Abinash Verma, general secretary of the Indian Sugar Mills Association.V.M. Singh, convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan which represents cane farmers, had no sympathy for the politics behind the bailout. This is a knee-jerk reaction after the Kairana bypoll, he said."

After a few minutes, he began speaking loudly saying that farmers were facing several problems, but their problems were not being discussed in the meeting.He said that farmers were not getting fair and remunerative prices for their produce. Government schemes are not reaching them properly. They are also at the mercy of monsoon which he said is erratic. They elected members to the zilla panchayat in the hope that they will address farmers grievances, but in vain, he complained. He said that sugar factories were not paying farmers in time and that crop insurance relief was not distributed in proportion to the losses suffered by farmers.He also raised questions about rural hospitals not having enough doctors.However, the members seemed bothered more about how and why a non-member was allowed to speak in the general body meeting, rather than the gravity of the issues he raised or his allegation that they were not representing farmers adequately.They asked zilla panchayat president Asha Aihole to throw him out of the meeting hall, before continuing with the discussions. Member Jitendra Madar said that Mr. Ainapur was not a genuine leader of the farmers. Shankar Madalagi, Janata Dal(S) member, said that he would not speak till the intruder was thrown out.

Between 2000 and 2015, this fell from 19.4% to 11.5%. By 2025, the report projected, it could drop to 8.5%, putting India well in line to meeting its 2025 target under a WHO global plan to tackle non-communicable diseases. While this is excellent news, it needs to be highlighted that smokeless tobacco is the bigger scourge in the country. The WHO report doesnt model usage trends in this segment because of the paucity of global data. Other data, however, suggest that India is lagging on this front. Even though there is a 2011 government ban on the sale of food items with tobacco or nicotine in them, the consumption of gutkha, khaini and zarda continues to be rampant. The Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2016, for example, found that 29.6% of Indian men and 12.8% of Indian women were users. Children are victims of this lethal addiction too. The WHO report noted that 7.9 million adolescents, between 13 and 15 years, used smokeless tobacco in the South-East Asian region. Given that 66% of the worlds smokeless-tobacco users are in India, a sizeable chunk of this number would be Indian teenagers. Against this background, the drop in cigarette smoking rates gives India little cause to celebrate.Gutkha and other chewable tobacco items are equally, if not more, harmful compared to cigarettes. Surveys show that these products are sometimes mixed with carcinogenic compounds called nitrosamines. This is why India banned their sale under the 2011 Food Safety and Standards Regulations. Why do they continue to be consumed, then? Experts blame their availability on loopholes in the law. The food safety rules target pre-mixed tobacco products, such as gutkha, which contains lime, sugar and other spices. This leaves unflavoured items, such as khaini or surthi, out of regulatory purview. Meanwhile, mislabelling of smokeless tobacco is common. Even when a product contains tobacco, it is passed off as being tobacco-free. Worse, one of the tactics of the tobacco industry is to use flavours such as cardamom and saffron to attract youngsters, triggering life-long addiction. The WHO report notes that as cigarette usage has fallen in high-income countries, the tobacco industry has targeted younger users to make up for the revenue shortfall. While this trend applies to smoking, there is evidence that children are also a target of the chewable tobacco industry. With its war against smoking seemingly on the right track, India must turn its focus to the smokeless tobacco segment. The challenge is bigger, but so will be the reward."

However, a decision was deferred as the GoM is awaiting a legal opinion from the Attorney General on the original proposal to levy a sugar cess.On Sunday, the five-member GoM, led by Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also explored a reduction in the GST on ethanol to 5% from the existing 18% levy and increasing the government subsidy for export of sugar.Kerala Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu that the possibility of a uniform 1% hike in GST across all slabs was discussed.Out of it, 0.5% can be kept with the Centre and rest with the State. That money can be used to fulfil the needs of all farmers, not only sugar cane, by respective States in the form of welfare fund and even the Centre can chip in when necessary. But imposing a cess would mean betraying the very principle of GST, Mr. Issac said. At present, the GST rate slabs are pegged at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, while certain goods are zero-rated.The fund would be to extend financial aid to farmers in case of situation that has arisen for sugar cane farmers and the States will have control over their share for disbursal .Sugar cess opposedKerala had already expressed dissent to the move to impose a sugar cess at the GST Councils meeting on May 4. Apart from Mr. Sarma and Mr. Isaac, the GoM includes Ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Maharashtra Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the GoM has decided to submit its report to the Council within a month, and is awaiting the Attorney Generals opinion on whether cess on GST can be imposed for welfare purposes, since it can only be imposed for compensation purposes.The Council will take a final call on the GoMs report."

Yet, the country has the second highest number of obese children in the world  15.3 million in China and 14.4 million in India. While tackling undernutrition through assurance of adequate nutrition (usually interpreted as dietary calories), we need to ensure that it is also about appropriate nutrition (the right balance of nutrients). Our policy response has to move from food security to nutrition security.New problemIndia must step up its efforts to fight overweight and obesity just as it has been doing with wasting and stunting. Between 1980and 2015, obesity doubled for children and tripled for adults; an additional 2.6 million children will be obese in India by 2025, a trend that will not reverse without action.Rising obesity is putting pressure on already fragile health systems in India by posing a high risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and some cancers (clubbed together as non-communicable diseases, or NCDs). Research shows that Indians have higher levels of body fat and lower levels of lean muscle when compared to many other populations. Therefore, the risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes operates even below global thresholds for defining overweight and obesity. Hence the urgency to take public health measures. Apart from a high burden of premature mortality, these threats are something that India can ill-afford to ignore as it looks ambitiously toward a universal health coverage system where everyone can access quality health services that are free of financial burden.The rise in obesity is deeply concerning because just as growing up underweight gives that person a lifetime of health problems so does a childhood of being overweight. The potent combination of Indian children eating more junk food while becoming increasingly sedentary puts them at an even greater risk. Research has shown that early warning signs for fatty liver disease can be found in children as young as eight if they had larger-than-advised waistlines when they were three.Fortunately, this year is an ideal opportunity to tackle obesity as global health decision-makers are focussing on how to garner the political will to drive best buys such as sugar taxes and mass media campaigns on healthy diets (proven ways of bringing down obesity) while continuing to vigorously pursue efforts to prevent undernutrition. A high-level commission and a UN General Assembly meeting on NCDs are giving new life to existing evidence-based yet largely unimplemented plans of action.Appropriate responsesPolicy responses should include agricultural systems that promote crop diversity (to enable dietary diversity) as well as regulatory and fiscal measures (to decrease the availability, affordability and promotion of unhealthy foods, while making healthy foods more accessible). For example, taking the lead from a directive by the Delhi High Court, India should ban the sale of junk food in and around schools. Legislators should also put into practice the results of a recent Lancet study on India. It showed that higher taxes on junk food can actually lead those on lower incomes to live healthier lives.Even in clinical settings, counselling and care are needed. Instead of being downgraded as ways of managing poor lifestyle choices, obesity management, prevention and treatment should be provided as essential health services targeted at a condition that undermines health in many ways. This would help reverse the stigma attached to obesity even by health professionals (which has also undermined the response to it).Further, India should link obesity and undernutrition and treat them as twinned challenges to be jointly addressed under the universal health coverage umbrella. Universal health coverage is encapsulated in the idea that no one should have to suffer financial hardship in order to access essential health care. By tackling obesity through prevention and early care, financially debilitating NCDs can be avoided.India will be in a better position to fulfil the promise of universal health coverage if it disrupts the cycle whereby poverty leads to NCDs and vice versa. There is compelling evidence that heart disease and diabetes impose high burdens of catastrophic health expenditure, result in a loss of livelihoods and crush people into poverty. With no insurance or personal savings, a heart disease diagnosis can compromise a persons wealth as well as health.By making connections to both under- and over-nutrition, health advocates should make economic and social arguments to spur a whole-of-government approach to these whole-of-society problems. Tackling obesity benefits the economy and the environment, as healthy and sustainable diets are good for productivity levels and the planet. It is now time to get ahead of this unfolding health crisis and save lives and money in the process.K. Srinath Reddy is President, Public Health Foundation of India. The views expressed are personal"

The move may boost private developers confidence.In a landmark judgment, the UPERC on Friday set aside the UPPCLs decision to exit from the power purchase agreements with regard to the BEPLs five thermal plants.The commission, however, ordered reduction of the tariff by around 50 paise per unit. The UPPCL will now purchase electricity from these five plants at this reduced rate of around Rs 7.13 per unit.However, the regulator has not allowed it the fixed and variable cost as well as the return of equity during the period when the plants were closed.The commission observed if bilateral contracts were allowed to be terminated at the sweet will of the government or the purchaser or seller, the entire trade and industry structure would collapse. If such an uncertainty is allowed to prevail, nobody will come for investment in industry, UPERC chairman SK Agrawal said in the order.The commission directed BEPL to resume the operation of all the five plants within seven days of receipt of the order.The BEPL had signed five PPAs with UPPCL to set up as many thermal power plants of 90 megawatt each at its five sugar mills in Barkhera, Khambarkhera, Utraula, Kundarkhi and Maqsoodpur to supply power to the state-owned distribution companies for 25 years.The plants became operational in March-April 2012 with the UPPCL, on behalf of the discoms, having purchased 11,414 million units of electricity worth over Rs 8,000 crore till termination of the PPAs.In a sudden move on August 8 last year, the UPPCL issued an exit notice to the BEPL stating that the average rate of power available from the latters plants was Rs 7.63 per unit which, it said, was among the highest. The corporation said this rate went against the governments policy of making affordable power available to consumers under the power for all vision.The BEPL moved the high court against the unilateral exit notice. On the courts advice, the company filed a petition in the UPERC for relief.Having heard a series of arguments and counter arguments from both the sides, the commission in its final order held that the PPAs signed on December 10, 2010 between the two parties had no provision allowing a unilateral exit from the contract. The regulators final order was supported by several Supreme Court rulings.The respondents (UPPCL) decision for exiting from the contract without giving the petitioner the opportunity of being heard cannot be legally justified and hence the five purchase agreements related to five different plants will be treated to have existed in continuity, the commission said in its judgment.The commission ruled that petitioner (Bajaj) will not be entitled to return of equity for the period from the date of exit notice and to the date of commissions order. It said the UPPCL will be entitled to deduct the fixed charges for the intervening period.Terming the order as a win-win situation for both the parties, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Awadhesh Kumar Verma demanded that the commission pass a supplementary order to ensure that the benefit of the tariff reduction must pass on to consumers.The tariff reduction should also come into effective retrospectively since the date of signing of the PPAs, he demanded."

Sometimes it is asked to even procure sunflower or maize, which disturbs its finances, and we want to draw the federation completely out of procurement, he said while talking to reporters. I will take up the matter with the chief minister, to ask the food and civil supplies department to take over the losses of Markfed.

So India has to find new markets for exports. Earlier, we exported to Africa and the Middle East, but China has been the market India has never tapped, Goel said.India is looking at exporting sugar to China - which imports it from Brazil, Thailand, Australia and Cuba - and Bangladesh.China is the largest importer of sugar in the world and thats why we are here to see if India and China can now become trade partners for sugar, Goel said. And this is the first time we all are here and we believe China can buy a large amount of sugar from India.China imports approximately 4 million tons to 5 million tons. Indias export of sugar to China has been very small. In 2007, Indias sugar exports to China was 200,000 tons, he added.ISMA officials said India hopes to export sugar to China under the 50% tariff category, though details are yet to be worked out. This will make the price competitive for the Chinese market.China usually charges 80% tariffs on sugar imports.The response from Chinese officials to Indias offer was mostly positive, Goel said. The response was extreme positive but also slightly sceptical because India hasnt really always supplied. Once India actually starts to supply, they will find Indian sugar far, far better than that of other countries, he said.India has also sought greater access to the worlds second-largest economy for products such as pharmaceuticals to reduce a trade deficit of more than $51.1 billion in bilateral trade worth more than $80 billion.Speaking at the meeting, the counsellor economic of the Indian embassy, Prashant Lokhande, noted the growing economic engagement between the two sides and assured Chinese firms that India would emerge as a major sugar trading partner with consistent policies and quality product."

Show me one automobile company started by a mechanic.He blamed the Modi government and RSS, saying our dhabawallahs or mechanics do not lack knowledge but doors of banks and politics are shut for our dhabawallahs, mechanics, dhobis and other backwards.Promising to give OBCs their due share in politics, Rahul attacked PM Modi for saying India lacks skills and requires skilling. He said the PMs remark was a lie as OBCs were highly skilled but were not being given opportunities.Rahul said BJPs backward MPs had complained to him that they helped Modi become PM but he allows them no voice in the party and all the power lies with RSS.India has become a slave of BJPs few leaders and RSS. It is good, and nobody can stop it, that the entire opposition, Congress or Janata Dal , is coming together. In six months or one year, Modi, Amit Shah and Mohan Bhagwat will see the power of India. They will understand that three people cannot run India. It will be run by its people, its youth, he said.The Congress President also said the Centre had waived loans to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh crore for 15 industrialists but had done nothing for dying farmers."

While ABKS has not lent support to the ongoing strike, they have planned an agitation from June 5 to June 10.The protests are likely to lead to a shortage of supplies of vegetables, fruits and milk to the city in the coming days. Though supplies in main whole sale markets are not yet hit, retailers have already started hiking prices of vegetables in the city. ABKS was part of the steering committee of farmers organisations that had held strike in June last year.The strike called by RKM is part of a nationwide protest across 130 cities to highlight the ongoing agrarian crisis and press for demands, including complete loan waiver and higher minimum support price. Apart from blocking supplies, our supporters also staged road blockades at several places. We have succeeded in affecting 40% supplies to the cities. The police have arrested four activists from Sangamner, said Sandeep Gidde Patil, core committee member, RKM.Ajit Nawale, general secretary, ABKS, said the BJP government has no sensitivity towards farmers issues.Despite high production, the Centre has imported tur from Mozambique, sugar from Pakistan and the state government is taking milk from Gujarat and Karnataka, which has hit the farmers here.We have decided to gift the chief minister imported tur, sugar and milk on June 5 apart from other forms of agitation. Dr Ashok Dhawale, president, ABKS said he has not seen such an anti-farmer and pro-corporate government in the last 70 years. Every time we get only an assurance whereas corporates like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi get away, Dhawale said.ABKS had also organised farmers long march from Nashik to Mumbai this year.On Friday too it held protests at more than 20 districts outside tehsildar offices. Dr Ashok Dhawale, president, ABKS said he has not seen such an anti-farmer and pro-corporate government in the last 70 years."

However, the SAD delegation which also included Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee chief Gobind Singh Longowal also made a number of demands of the government.He was very receptive to all the demands. It was a good meeting, she added.The other demands made by the SAD include release of Sikh prisoners who were detained during Operation Bluestar (in 1984), impressing upon Pakistan to grant Sikh pilgrims visas and creating a corridor for them to visit the Kartarpur Sahib gurudwara across the border, observing first Sikh Guru Nanak Devs 550 birthday in 2019 as a national event and declaring a new, higher MSP for paddy.The meeting came a day after Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah met SAD patron Parkash Singh Badal in Chandigarh and discussed unity within the National Democratic Alliance.The SAD is one of the oldest allies of the BJP. After Thursdays meeting, the two parties had formed a coordination committee to work on fighting the next Lok Sabha election together while Sukhbir Badal had also appealed to other NDA allies to stick together.While the Telegu Desam Party quit the NDA in March, other allies such as the Shiv Sena and the RLSP have also publicly aired their differences with the BJP in the recent past.Lok Sabha MP Prem Singh Chandumajra, who was part of the delegation, said the party wants the government to use the Swaminathan commissions formula for calculating input costs for farmers. This assigns a value to the cost of the land. which the formula currently used by the government doesnt.The commission had recommended that MSP for crops be fixed at 50 % above the input costs for farmers including notional rent for their land and labour costs."
5b22ee649855b7429b317c1b,Ekla Chalo Re Is No Longer a Stirring Song,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/for-nda-and-opposition-ekla-chalo-re-is-no-longer-a-stirring-song/story-NlCYGyB4dMrAFHBBcGBCiP.html,2018-06-08,"A by-election is a bit like a school monthly test: the marks dont count for anything during the final exam. Which is why, while the Oppositions celebrations after besting the BJP in another round of by-elections may be premature, Indias principal party cant any longer afford to take victory in the 2019 general elections for granted.This isnt just about a more united Opposition challenge: truth is, from Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh to Bhandara-Gondia in Maharashtra, the BJPs vote share is showing signs of decline, a first indication of creeping anti-incumbency. That the election setbacks have come in the north and west is also significant: it was, after all, a north-west India tidal wave that propelled the BJP to a famous win in 2014. Nor can the BJP claim that Narendra Modi did not campaign in the by-elections: a day before the polling in Kairana, the prime minister was in the neighbouring Baghpat district, flagging off a new expressway and promising achche din to the region. And the BJPs UP Hindutva mascot, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, was even more omnipresent, even raking up the communally-charged issue of removing a Jinnah portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University.As it turned out, May 2018 was not quite May 2014: then, against a backdrop of the Muzaffarnagar riots, the BJP succeeded in achieving an unprecedented communal polarisation and swept western UP. This time, the more prosaic issue of ganna  as exemplified by farmers demanding their sugarcane dues  defeated the divisive politics of Jinnah. So, are we seeing the revival of a fresh political narrative ahead of the 2019 general elections where local concerns trump the national issues that play out in TV studios? Well, yes and no.Local issues do matter at election time, especially when they play out through the prism of strategic alliances on the ground. This is exactly what happened in Kairana where the entire anti-BJP Opposition backed the Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate, giving them a strong arithmetical advantage that enabled them to play the ganna card with confidence. But amplifying the act local messaging over 543 constituencies spread across 29 states in a general election is a huge challenge: the competitive instincts of political parties mean that while they might be ready to cede space in a by-election, they are unlikely to be as generous in the ultimate parliamentary test.Moreover, the BJP will determinedly make the 2019 elections a made for TV presidential contest, posing the issue before the voter as Modi versus who? Besides, in a by-election, voter turnout tends to be low, but in a general election the sheer size and resources of the BJP-RSS election machine could give the momentum to the saffron brotherhood.And yet, as Karnataka and now Kairana have shown, the notion of political invincibility is also part of a myth-making factory. Modi and his lieutenant Amit Shah have built a larger than life image for themselves by convincing the Opposition that they are indestructible. But to draw a cricketing analogy, as Indias stunning 1983 World Cup win over the mighty West Indies and the magical turnaround in Kolkata against Australia in 2001 showed, even seemingly unbeatable rivals can be outplayed provided there is sufficient self-belief.From an Opposition that has been pummelled and outwitted at almost every stage for the last four years, we now at least have the emerging contours of a potential challenge. At the heart of it, is the ultimate political weapon: the netas survival instinct. Nothing else explains why the Congress has virtually surrendered to a HD Kumaraswamy while forming a government in Karnataka, or the fact that a Mayawati is ready to forget past animosities.Not that the dominant party is simply going to lie down and let the Opposition walk all over them. Within days of the by-poll setbacks, there are signs of the Modi-Shah duo getting into course correction mode. The massive aid package to the sugar industry is perhaps a belated recognition that post-Kairana the ganna farmer needs a break. Expect more such sops in the coming months as the NDA government prepares to dip into its petrol tax-rich coffers to share the booty with the aam aadmi. That Shah is now busily courting allies and even high-profile celebrities is another pointer to the future: in the run-up to 2019, the BJP will need to relearn the art of winning friends and influencing people. Ekla chalo re is a stirring song but it doesnt necessarily make for good politics.Post-script: A day after the Kairana results, a WhatsApp forward from a BJP supporters group was sent to me by a friend. It read: See what happened in Kairana: 35 per cent Muslims voted as a bloc while we Hindus are divided and fighting over petrol prices! In the months ahead, as the stakes get higher, expect the communal pitch to intensify further.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal"
5b22f04c9855b7429b317caf,"Did you know: A year can begin in April, May, June...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/did-you-know-a-year-can-begin-in-april-may-june-/articleshow/64534002.cms,2018-06-11,"MADURAI: The British calendar year which starts on January 1 is not the only way to define a year.There are different days on which a year commences, according to various acts enacted in the country. April 1 is when the year commences according to the Cantonment Act and the Electrical Supply Act. In the Coffee Act, the year begins on July 1. In the Sugar Export Promotion Act, the year starts from May 1 and for Sugar (regulation of production) Act, November 1 is the first day.Revenue assistants who challenged the governments seniority order with regard to their promotion learned this lesson when the Madurai bench of the Madras high court dismissed their petition and told them that there are different days on which a year could begin.The court also said that the government can adopt the panel year concept which it has been following.If one has a flair for hyperbole and exaggeration, one can say that there can be 365 ways to define a year, Justice GR Swaminathans order read, before it went on to explain a few ways in which a year can be defined.This particular case, the court observed, was another instance of the perennial battle between promotees and direct recruits in service law.The petitioners, who joined the revenue department as typists in the years 2009 and 2010, were promoted as revenue assistants in 2012 and 2013. Direct recruits were also taken in the same years. The district administration published a consolidated inter-seniority list in April 2017 following the ratio 2:1 (two from promotees and 1 from direct recruit).However, two months later, the commissioner of revenue administration set aside the final seniority list and asked the district revenue officials to re-draw the seniority list as per the panel year as against the calendar year concept, based on which the initial list was drawn.Panel year commences on March 15 while calendar year commences on January 1.The promotees contention was that the direct recruits of 2012 are placed in the seniority list of 2011 since they were recruited before March 15, 2012.Petitions from revenue officials of three districts- Pudukottai, Theni and Dindigul opposed the departments order placing the directly recruited revenue assistants in the seniority list prepared for the year previous to their appointment.They urged the court to quash the list as illegal.However, the counsel for the government said that in matters of promotion, only the panel year was adopted and the same should be followed for seniority too.Stating that the employer could always set the standard in the absence of a statutory provision, the court ruled that it was open to the authorities to take a stand and adopt the panel year concept while finalising seniority.The court further said that the revenue department could continue to adopt the panel year concept, as there was no specific mandate that the calendar year concept must be adopted."

The package is part of the governments efforts to address the ongoing agrarian crisis in the country and offset its political impact.According to a government official, the package includes three elements. A buffer stock of 30 LMT (lakh metric tonnes) of sugar will be created with Rs 1,200 crore.This money will be directly transferred to accounts of sugarcane farmers. Rs 4,400 crore will be used to increase ethanol production to divert sugarcane away from sugar mills which are unable to dispose of their inventories. The government has also decided to ensure a minimum sale price of Rs 29/kg for sugar.To be sure, a creation of buffer stock need not lead to the government buying sugar from the market, and might actually entail the government agreeing to bear a part of carrying cost of unsold inventories of sugar mills. A spokesperson of the Indian Sugar Mills Association declined to comment on the package citing lack of exact details.A crisis in the sugar industry shot into limelight after the BJPs defeat in the Kairana Lok Sabha bypoll.The region is dominated by sugarcane farmers who have been protesting against the non-payment of dues by sugar mills. According to media reports, pending arrears of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh alone are to the tune of more than Rs 12,000 crores.According to statistics from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, sugarcane production in 2017-18 was the third highest ever in the country at 35.5 million tonnes."

However, The Indian Express has learnt that no such directions have been received by the Environmental Engineer of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), Batala, to file any criminal complaint.A high-powered committee constituted by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh under the chairmanship of Environment Minister O P Soni to suggest measures for cleaning of the rivers in the state has also not submitted its report. The Committee, which was also tasked on May 24 with suggesting ways to ensure supply of clean potable water, had been asked to submit its report within 10 days.Speaking to The Indian Express, Environment Minister O P Soni said that the task of preparing a report of the committee was being undertaken by the Chairman PPCB, K S Pannu and that it will be ready for submission to the Chief Minister soon. On the question of the non-recovery of fine from Chadha Sugars and the non-registration of criminal complaint against the culpable officials of the mill, Soni said that the necessary orders had been passed by the government and it was upto the officials to implement them.When contacted, PPCB chairman said that the complaint against the mill officials would be filed very soon and that the proposal in this regard had been finalised. He also added that notice for the payment of Rs 5 crore fine had been issued to the mill but said that it had not yet been deposited. The mill has the option of challenging the fine imposed on them. The appeal against the orders of the PPCB will lies with the High Court or the National Green Tribunal (NGT). However, it will remain closed until they pay the fine, he said.Pannu also informed that he was in the process of finalising the report on the remedial measures which were to be suggested and had recently visited the mill in this regard. There are two aspects which had to be considered and two committees had been formed. One involved the remedial measures to rejuvenate the Beas river. This report will be submitted by the end of this week. The second committee was to making suggestions on how to avoid such incidents in future. This too shall be submitted soon, he said.In another development, Leader of Opposition Sukhpal Khaira Wednesday wrote a letter to the PPCB chief apprising him that he has been receiving alarming calls from different parts of the state with people complaining about contaminated water flowing in the canals and also dangerous levels of pollution in the ground water. We made a special spot visit to Khudian Pul in Lambi constituency to inspect the quality of water flowing in the two canals of Sirhind feeder and the Rajasthan feeder. To our utter surprise water in both the canals that is used for drinking purposes in the Malwa region as well as Rajasthan, was severely contaminated and blackish in colour, said Khaira.Contending that most of the distilleries and sugar mills are either owned directly by powerful politicians or are indirectly connected to them, Khaira said that it it has come to his partys notice that the government often dithers to take concrete action against them. For example, although the Chadha mill was fined Rs. 5 crore but no criminal action was initiated against them, as they are closely connected to the ruling dispensation of the state, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

He said quality control testing lab will help standardise the quality of honey produced, help in branding and attract more buyers to Uttarakhands Himalayan honey.The lab will be set up at a cost of around Rs 50 lakh. It will help check antibodies, sugar, trace elements like lead and other foreign materials that make their way into the honey during production, he said.Tiwari said that the presence of antibiotics in honey is not good for humans. When bees suffer from a disease, the beekeepers mix antibiotics in sugar solutions and feed them to the bees and the antibiotics finally make their way into the honey, he said.The sale of honey has a direct correlation with its quality. People, who want to buy honey, dont mind spending extra money to ensure that the honey is pure. If the honey is tested, it increases its commercial value and it can even be exported or send to other states.In 2010, traces of lead were found in consignments of honey that were sent from India to European Union. This emerged as a major concern for the quality of honey produced and sold, he said.There are 5,566 beekeepers in Uttarakhand who produce over 1400 metric tonnes of honey annually. Uttarakhand has a rich diversity of flowering plants which are good sources of nectar and pollen for bees.According to experts, there is a need to adopt modern beekeeping practices by traditional beekeepers in the state, especially in areas like bee management, better extraction, honey storage and quality control.The main honey extraction months are April (Chait), May (Baisakh), July-August (Ashaad) and in some areas October (Kartik). The honey extracted in April-May is considered to be the sweetest, while that extracted in July is less sweet."

On Tuesday, too, an undertrials body was found in the jail bathroom and the post-mortem report revealed strangulation or hanging as the cause of death.The deceased undertrial has been identified as Ajmer Singh, 65, who was arrested by the Samrala police in an NDPS Act case. According to officials, Ajmer Singh was lodged in the jail on May 24 and was a diabetic. Jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said, On Wednesday around 2pm, Ajmer Singh started feeling uneasy and was rushed to a hospital, but he died on the way. It seems his sugar level went low. In the past 20 days, Ajmer was admitted to hospital twice due to low sugar. However, the post-mortem report will confirm the cause of death.On Tuesday, 18-year-old Prakash Chand, who was moved to the central jail from juvenile home on June 1, was found dead. Dr Davinder Kumar of the civil hospital, who conducted his post-mortem examination, said the cause of death was either strangulation or hanging. Therefore, to check if Chand was given some kind of drug or intoxicant, the hospital has sent the viscera to Kharar and Patiala laboratories.Dr Kumar said there were some injury marks and bruises on his back, neck and head.Boparai said, I am yet to receive a copy of Chands post-mortem report. However, I dont think it was a murder or hanging. Chand was new here and in 12 days he could not have become an enemy of anyone. Moreover, there were no signs of hanging in the bathroom. The jail authorities will also investigate his death.The jail has been in the thick of controversies. On May 13, undertrial siblings, Harvinder Singh and Jasvir Singh, accused of burglary at Andhra Bank, Rasulra branch, Khanna, had escaped from the jail. The police investigation found that the accused scaled the jail wall by using thick cables of CCTV cameras and wall clips fixed on the administrative block. Four jail officials, including jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai, deputy superintendent Manjit Singh Tiwana, assistant superintendent Parwinder Singh and head warder Nishan Singh, were suspended for negligence. Later, suspension of Boparai was revoked."

(File) After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. (File)Even as it is struggling to get sugar mills to discharge over Rs 12,500 crore worth of cane dues to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP administration in Uttar Pradesh can take credit on another front: Procurement of wheat by government agencies in the state for the current 2018-19 rabi marketing season has almost touched 50 lakh tonnes (lt) and looks all set to surpass the all-time-high 50.63 lt achieved in 2012-13.We will be closing procurement operations on June 15. With two more days to go and also more updated information for the previous days, the total figure will cross the 2012-13 record, a senior official from the UP Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Indian Express.He said that the state and central agencies had procured the roughly 50 lt of wheat  from the 2017-18 crop, harvested and marketed after April  from over 10 lakh farmers. We opened 5,000-odd centres in 75 districts of the state and ensured that the farmers got the official minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,735 per quintal. In addition, we gave them a Rs 10/quintal incentive for grain that was brought to the centres after proper cleaning and drying, he added.After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat from UP had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. Even during the last marketing season, official procurement touched 37 lt, as against only 8 lt during 2016-17. This year, we set a target of procuring 50 lt out of the states total 350 lt wheat production. That target will be exceeded, the official pointed out.Meanwhile, wheat procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies across India had, based on information received as on Wednesday, reached 353.59 lt. This is again more than the original target of 320 lt, though below the 381.48 lt high of 2012-13. The higher-than-expected procurement this time comes in the wake of the countrys wheat output hitting a record 98.61 million tonnes (mt), surpassing the 2016-17 crop size of 98.51 mt.Besides wheat, government agencies had, as on June 11, also procured 356.81 lt of rice during the ongoing 2017-18 kharif marketing season (October-September). This is already the second highest procurement after the previous seasons 381.06 lt. For rice, too, the production of 111.62 mt in 2017-18 was the highest ever achieved by the country, ahead of the previous years 109.70 mt.Guaranteed MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy has made the two grains the preferred growing option for farmers, especially in a scenario where prices of other crops have been prone to extreme market fluctuations. With roughly 36 per cent of the countrys wheat and 33 per cent of paddy being bought by government agencies, the market for these crops has practically ceased to be significant. That, in turn, means putting more pressure on the already stretched storage capacities of FCI and other state-run agencies.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b2588f69855b722ac49b0f3,A not-so-sweet relief: Govt’s scheme for cane farmers benefits traders,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-not-so-sweet-relief-govts-scheme-for-cane-farmers-benefits-traders-5216375/,2018-06-14,"Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)How successful will the Narendra Modi governments recent package for cane farmers be, in helping clear payment dues to them by sugar mills, is open to question. Whats clear right now, though, is that it is neither mills nor farmers, but sugar traders who are laughing their way to the bank.Consider this: till May 19, ex-factory prices of S-30, the most-commonly traded grade of sugar in Maharashtra, averaged as low as Rs 2,515 per quintal. But precisely around that time, the sugar trade was abuzz with talk of the Union Cabinet considering four proposals, as part of a package to expedite payment of cane price arrears worth over Rs 22,000 crore to farmers during the current 2017-18 crushing season (October-September).The proposals included the creation of a 30 lakh tonnes (lt) buffer stock, imposition of a minimum ex-factory price, restoration of the earlier system of monthly mill-wise sugar sale quotas, and higher rates for ethanol procured by oil marketing companies under the 10% blending-with-petrol programme. The stories of the likely package, interestingly, came after a meeting that the former Union Agriculture Minister, Sharad Pawar, had with top officials at the Prime Ministers Office on May 15. The said proposals were reportedly discussed in that meeting the very day when counting for the Karnataka Assembly elections also took place.But as the news of an impending Cabinet decision gained currency  Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan himself confirmed the proposal to build a 30-lt sugar buffer on May 31  prices also began firming up. By the month-end, average ex-factory rates in Maharashtra had climbed to Rs 2,750 per quintal.On June 6, the day the Union Cabinet approved the package  which included the 30 lt buffer stock (to be held in mill godowns, but with the government bearing the interest, insurance and storage expenses), fixing of a minimum ex-factory price of Rs 29 per kg, and bringing back monthly sale quotas  the S-30 rates touched Rs 2,900 per quintal. They have since risen even further to Rs 3,175 per quintal (see chart).The above increase of about Rs 660 per quintal in just over three weeks  in Uttar Pradesh (UP), factories that had sold at Rs 2,500-2,520 are now realising Rs 3,300-3,350 per quintal  has, however, benefited neither mills nor farmers.The reason: The governments decision to fix artificially low sale quotas for mills, which has created a scarcity in the market and pushed up prices. But the high prices are of little use, as mills cannot sell more than the quotas allocated to them. Doing so will attract penal provisions under the Essential Commodities Act.On June 7, just a day after the Cabinet decision, the department of food & public distribution fixed the maximum quantity of sugar that mills could sell in the domestic market during June at 21.01 lt. By the time this was notified, many mills had already sold a lot of sugar and even exhausted a significant part of their quotas for the whole month. Today, you have a peculiar situation where prices have gone up and mills have sugar in their godowns, and yet they cannot sell, an industry source noted.According to him, the ones really making a killing now are traders, who had stocked up when rates were as low as Rs 2,400-2,450 per quintal in Maharashtra. They are benefiting hugely. Mills, on the other hand, can do nothing, except watch prices going up. And if they cannot sell sugar, it is not possible to pay farmers either, he added.A UP miller also questioned the manner in which the sale quota for June was distributed among individual factories. Out of the total 21.01 lt, as much as 8.14 lt has been allotted to mills in Maharashtra, followed by UP (6.25 lt), Karnataka (2.62 lt), Gujarat (0.87 lt), Punjab (0.53 lt), Bihar (0.50 lt), Haryana (0.47 lt), Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (0.41 lt each), Tamil Nadu (0.36 lt) and Uttarakhand (0.30 lt).Its not clear how Maharashtra has been given a higher quota, when we (UP) are producing 120 lt this season, as against their 107.08 lt. Also, while Maharashtra mills have to only pay the Centres FRP (fair and remunerative price) for cane, we are obliged to give the UP governments much higher SAP (state advised price). Our payment arrears, too, are more (at Rs 12,601.48 crore versus Maharashtras Rs 1,768.29 crore, as on end-May). So, we should have got a bigger sale quota, the miller argued.The industry source quoted earlier was also cynical regarding the sustainability of the current sugar prices. Artificially restricting sales through quotas cannot take care of the underlying surplus due to the total availability at 360 lt  from 320 lt production in 2017-18 and 40 lt opening stocks  far exceeding estimated domestic consumption of 250 lt. Even the 30 lt buffer stock created out of the surplus will eventually have to be released into the market, he noted.Farmer leader and Member of Parliament from Maharashtras Hatkanangle Lok Sabha constituency, Raju Shetti, alleged that the Centres sugarcane package has only enriched traders. The market is now with them. If there are sale quotas for mills, why shouldnt these apply for traders as well? In any case, how does high sugar prices help, if mills cannot sell at these rates?, he asked.The convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, said that the much-touted Rs 7,000-crore package for sugarcane growers was actually worth no more than Rs 1,175 crore. The so-called package includes Rs 4,440 crore of bank loans to mills for expanding their ethanol production capacities and Rs 1,500 crore as incentive for 20 lt of sugar exports. The first is subject to mills actually availing the loan facility (on which the Centre will provide interest subvention of Rs 1,332 crore over five years), and the second is conditional on mills exporting, which is not possible when global sugar prices are currently Rs 22-24/kg, compared to domestic ex-factory realisations of Rs 32-33, he stated.Singh claimed that the only substantial element in the package was the 30 lt buffer, on which the carrying cost of Rs 1,175 crore would be borne by the Centre. But even this money will provide additional liquidity of only Rs 2 crore per mill, as against their average cane dues of Rs 50 crore. Many mills in UP owe farmers more than Rs 200 crore each.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Chandrasekhar Rao had promised jobs to the unemployed after the formation of Telangana State, but failed. Instead, the CM has overseen the shut down of many small industries because of the governments incompetence and negligence.Mr. Rao made tall promises, stating that several industries would be revived once Telangana is formed. But what has happened? In the past four years, the Nizam sugar factory, Sirpur paper mill have not been revived. About 30,000 small businesses have been shut because of the construction of the ORR, he pointed out.The TDP leader pointed out that while the TRS government laid the red carpet for corporate companies and multi-national companies, several small entrepreneurs were neglected.Prior to 2014 elections, the CM said that setting up Bayyaram steel factory is his lifes mission. He said if the Centre does not come forward, the State will do it. The factory remains a non-starter even today. Is this not the failure of the government? Mr. Prakash Reddy sought to know.He alleged that to divert the peoples attention from the failures of the government, paid articles were being published praising the Kaleshwaram project, Mission Bhagiratha and Rythu Bandhu schemes.The State government must stop hoodwinking the people and commit to setting up Bayyaram steel factory, reviving the Rayons BILT factory, Sirpur paper mill and several other industries which require attention, he advised."

To make this point, he termed the founder of Coca-Cola a shikanji (lemonade) seller who made it big in the U.S. The analogy sparked off a Twitter storm.Opposition unityStating that the country has become slave to two-three people of the BJP and the RSS, Mr. Gandhi said, [But] No one can stop the entire Opposition from getting together in six-seven months to a year  whether it is Congress or the Janata Dal, you will see the entire Opposition standing together and Narendra Modi, Amit Shah or Mohan Bhagwat ji will see the strength of India ... They will know that India cannot be run by two or three people.He added that the country could be run by Indias people, Indias youth.The Congress outreach marks an effort to regain ground lost to powerful regional leaders like Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad, who built a dedicated OBC vote bank in the 1990s.The national party is keen to tap the section that makes up over 52% of the population.With an eye on the 2019 election, the Congress president promised better representation to the OBCs in the party as well as the Assemblies and Parliament.Dearth of financeBut Mr. Gandhis clear target was the BJPs top leadership including Mr. Modi. He said there was no dearth of skills in the country, especially among the OBC community, but finance was not made available to them.Rs. 2.5 lakh crore were given to 15 industrialists. But the farmer got nothing ... the loan waiver was for 15 people but not for the farmer who continues to commit suicide, the Congress leader alleged.People with skills are not rewarded in India ... farmers work hard but you don't see them in the office of Modi ji , the Congress chief added.Trolled for remarksTaking this argument further, Mr. Gandhi said, The person who started the Coca-Cola company was like a person who sells shikanji (lemonade). He used to sell shikanji in the U.S. by mixing sugar and water. His experience and skills paid dividends, made wealth and launched the company.He also said that McDonalds founder was running a dhaba (roadside eatery) before making it big. These excerpts were used to troll him and the hashtag #AccordingtoRahulGandhi had became a top trend by Monday evening.Modi, Shah and Bhagwat will see ... that India cannot be run by two or three people"

The governmental support for the installation of micro irrigation systems has come in handy for the pioneering players in Thanjavur district.When I decided to go in for maize and chillies instead of the regular sugarcane this year, without hesitation I approached the Agriculture Department officials for support to install drip irrigation for my fields. That was because I had seen the benefits of drip irrigation for my sugarcane field the previous two seasons. Though sugarcane did not fetch me the assured returns, the drip irrigation system is still helping me as I have raised irrigated hybrid maize there, points out a farmer S. Elangovan of Kurungulam village in Thanjavur district.Similar is the experience of some other farmers in his village where the Arignar Anna Cooperative Sugar Mills is located.The mills fortunes have waned a bit now but officials and cane suppliers are confident that once the plant modernisation is completed and power co-generation plant becomes operational, there will be a definite revival for the factory.These farmers have installed micro irrigation systems such as drip irrigation, rain gun and sprinkler system for crops such as groundnut, sugarcane as well.Some beneficiaries aver that drip irrigation in hybrid maize has reduced water consumption by at least 50% while productivity last year was up by 30 to 40 % depending on accompanying factors.Drip irrigation in groundnut has yielded fantastic results for me, says G. Sivamurugan of Thanjavur. Seeing the benefits of micro irrigation, I opted for it. Now with the groundwater table in my area sinking further and lack of water flow in the Grand Anicut Canal remaining unsure, only the micro irrigation system installed in my fields saved the day for me, he adds.There has been an increasing realisation among farmers that the traditional way of irrigation in the delta region has become almost a luxury in the current days and there are constantly probing means to address the irrigation requirements. The subsidies being extended by the Central and State governments for installing micro irrigation systems have been added attractions for them, explains Joint Director of Agriculture A. Mathialagan.A sum of Rs. 12.42 crore has been allocated to Thanjavur district for the current year to implement drip irrigation systems for sugarcane, coconut and oil palm, install rain guns and sprinklers for pulses and oilseeds, to cover 4,131 hectares.Last year, a sum of Rs. 9.40 crore was spent on installing micro irrigation systems on 3,319 hectares."

Other demands included sanction of double bedroom houses, three acre land to Dalits, 12% reservation each to Dalits, STs and religious minorities.Referring to the problems of peasants, Ramana also said that spurious seed supply companies were ruling the roost.Warangal Special Correspondent writes:Scores of TDP workers staged protest at the Collectorate demanding immediate payment to paddy farmers and rolling back of fuel prices in the State. A rally was led by party district president Gannoju Srinivasa Chary from Ekasila park to the Collectors on Monday. Mr. Chary said the State government had procured paddy worth Rs. 40 crore from farmers through 30 IKP centres across rural district but only made payment to the tune of Rs. 26 crore. Over Rs. 14 crore were pending with the State government and the farmers were in distress over delay in payment of dues."

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India needs to adopt a detailed framework to regulate ads of these items, said a release issued by the Centre for Science and Environment.The CSE also called for making the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018, more effective and stringent.The draft regulations had been released for comments by the FSSAI in April. The regulations mandate compulsory labelling of salt and introduction of front-of-pack labelling.A strict labelling law is important to combat obesity and non-communicable diseases plaguing our country. The draft regulations is a good beginning, but it has major gaps that need to be plugged to make it effective, said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, CSE.Significant gapsOne of the significant gaps that CSE has pointed out is that the draft regulations does not provide for labelling of crucial aspects like added sugar and dietary fibres.Public health and nutrition experts recommend that it is best to avoid added sugar in food items. It can be measured and controlled and therefore must be labelled. Also, dietary fibre is a key beneficial component of our diet and must also be labelled. This will help consumers make informed and healthy food choices, said Amit Khurana, programme director (food safety and toxins unit), CSE.The draft regulations state that HFSS (high in fat, sugar or salt) food items shall not be advertised to kids in any form. The CSE, however, said that this is not enough.Celebrities should not be allowed to endorse these food item and there should be no ads of certain food categories such as soft drinks. Broadcasting regulations should be developed to limit exposure of kids to food ads during TV prime-time, said Sonam Taneja, programme manager (food safety and toxins unit), CSE.The draft regulations emphasise on providing nutrition information for each serving of a food item. It also lays down rules that consumers should be made aware of the contribution of each serving to ones daily quota of salt, sugar or fat.However, it does not standardise serving sizes. Determination of serving sizes has been left to the industry, this is a big loophole, said Mr. Bhushan .The draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2018, is a good beginning, but it has major gapsCentre for Science and Environment"

While it was not immediately clear as to what transpired in the meeting, the development assumes significance in view of the unprecedented standoff. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him, with folded hands, to intervene and end the agitation of the IAS officers. He also listed a number of instances to make his case that the protests  following the alleged assault on Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash on February 20  had affected administrative work.This is the first strike by IAS officers in the history of India. People have started saying that the L-G and Centre are anchoring it Only you and L-G can end this strike.

It is learnt that the decision was prompted by the apprehension that Kejriwal and his three ministers, who are on a dharna in the visitors room of Raj Niwas, might walk in during the meeting.

He subsequently cancelled it and said he would attend the L-Gs meeting.AAP hit out, saying Baijals choice of time was reflective of the fact that he was trying to shield IAS officers as it will not force them to attend the ministers meeting, which would go against their ongoing strike.During the day, doctors checked the vitals of Jain and Sisodia, who are on an indefinite hunger strike.

MudurAmitabh BachchanNew Delhi: A public health consortium on Tuesday asked actor Amitabh Bachchan to break off his association with a campaign on childhood nutrition, launched last week by the makers of Horlicks citing malnourishment among Indian children.The Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, a non-government group made up of paediatricians and nutrition specialists, has said the campaign is ""misleading and undermines optimal nutrition"". It has said the campaign could influence families into buying Horlicks, assuming it is a nutritious product.""Horlicks is a high-sugar product, as 100 grams of a popularly advertised pack of Horlicks Delight contains 78 grams of carbohydrates, of which 32 grams is sucrose sugar,"" a 10-member executive body of the NAPI said in a letter to Bachchan.""This is harmful for children as it may contribute to childhood obesity and non-communicable disease in later life,"" the letter said, citing the World Health Organisation's recommendations to reduce daily free sugar intake to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake.GSK Consumer Healthcare had on May 31 announced the launch of its campaign ""Horlicks Mission Poshan"". It said this would focus, with Bachchan as ""campaign ambassador"", on the first 1,000 days of a child to address malnutrition, stunting and infant mortality.The company said Bachchan would be part of many activities planned round the year, including a 12-hour live ""Telethon"" and awareness camps across schools and villages.""Our initiative has a singular goal - to help promote the need for nutritional needs across rural and urban India,"" Navneet Saluja, managing director of GSK Consumer Healthcare, had said during the launch.""Horlicks Mission Poshan is a small step to support the National Nutrition Mission of the Government of India. We are committed to dialling up mass awareness around malnourishment and working with civil society towards its eradication.""#But NAPI has cited a 2016 resolution of the World Health Assembly that recommends ending inappropriate promotion of foods for children aged six to 36 months and refers to dietary guidelines from the WHO and the Food and Agricultural Organisation.In their letter to Bachchan, the NAPI experts have said they fear the campaign will influence families from poor households into buying Horlicks, assuming it is a nutritious product as Bachchan is behind it.""Horlicks is expensive, (and) may displace real family foods. Thus your association with Horlicks is unlikely to achieve the objective of curbing under-nutrition in India,"" the letter said.It reminded Bachchan that he had renounced his association with Pepsi in 2014 based on the health implications the soft drink has on children. The association with Horlicks is ""equally harmful for children's health"", the letter said.Several paediatricians have lent their support to NAPI's concerns. ""I fear this campaign may have serious adverse repercussions,"" Arti Maria, head of neonatology at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi, said.""Horlicks is expensive, it is likely to drain the pockets of marginalised families under the mistaken belief that it is a good, nutritious product endorsed by Bachchan.""""Celebrities should avoid lending their name and image to such products,"" said Harsh Pal Singh Sachdev, a senior paediatrician at the Sita Ram Bhartia Institute. Maria and Singh expressed their concerns through a media release issued by NAPI.GSK Consumer Healthcare had, while launching the campaign, cited reports that India had the largest number of malnourished children in the world and ranked 100th out of 119 countries on the global hunger index, behind Bangladesh, North Korea and Iraq.But paediatricians have described the campaign as misleading. ""Yes, India has a big malnutrition problem, but Horlicks is not the solution,"" Arun Gupta, a child health and nutrition advocate who is among the signatories to the letter, said."

But the poll panel refused to entertain her complaint.Modi on Sunday devoted as much time to opponent-bashing as to advertising his government's achievements, appearing to provide a foretaste of how the BJP campaign for the general election, due next summer, might unfold.""The people who are questioning me are known for worshiping a family. Those who worship a family cannot worship democracy,"" was his defence against accusations that his government was subverting democratic traditions.""They don't spare even a foreign guest if he praises the work done by my government,"" he said, without elaborating. ""For them, a family is their country but for me my country is my family.""Political symbols, such as BJP flags, made their presence felt at the road show. Subsequently, Modi reached Baghpat, 60km from Kairana where a Lok Sabha by-election is scheduled for Monday, to open the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The Supreme Court had said that the expressway must be opened by May 31. (PTI pictures)Modi stuck to his habit of avoiding burning issues, such as the rising fuel prices or a farmer's death from a heatstroke on Saturday while protesting against the state government at Baraut, 20km from the venue of Sunday's rally.Uday Veer Singh, 60, is said to have been part of a farmers' dharna against sugar mills' failure to pay their dues and the state government's decision to hike electricity rates for tube-wells.""We have increased the minimum support price of sugarcane by 11 per cent. The sugar mills have been made to pay the dues of the farmers. We are committed to solving the problems of the sugarcane growers,"" Modi said.But farmers across western Uttar Pradesh say that Rs 1,000 crore worth of dues remain unpaid - a key poll issue in Kairana that has queered the pitch for the BJP.Although the state government has announced a compensation of Rs 12 lakh for Uday Veer's family and promised to look into the farmers' problems, the dharna is being continued ""till all the promises are met"".State Congress president Raj Babbar, who has visited Uday Veer's home in village Jivana-Jivani, tweeted: ""The PM says the BJP is a well-wisher of farmers. But Uday Veer died during demonstration for payment. I realised after going to his house that the government was unaware of the anger of the farmers.""Samajwadi president Akhilesh Yadav has said that Uday Veer's death has started the countdown to the BJP government's downfall.Modi said his government was working to safeguard Dalits' interests.

""We can't let the death of one of us go in vain,"" Balroj said.Earlier, additional district magistrate Lokpal Singh met the protesters, announced Rs 12 lakh for Uday Veer's family and said he had applied to the state government to grant them another Rs 38 lakh. He said all the demands would be met.""The state government has raised electricity rates for tube-wells from Rs 100 per horsepower to Rs 150, whereas the rate is only Rs 35 per horsepower in Haryana,"" Jile Singh, a farmer leader, said.""The sugar mills in western Uttar Pradesh have refused to clear the Rs 1,000 crore worth of dues they owe the sugarcane growers anytime soon. Adityanath is ignoring farmers' interests.""Adityanath had repeatedly denied the farmers' allegation about unpaid dues over the past six months but is now trying to assuage them with assurances that few are willing to bank on.Arvind Dwivedi, subdivisional magistrate of Baraut, claimed Uday Veer ""had come from somewhere on some business and was not part of the dharna"".But Jile Singh said Uday Veer had been part of the dharna since it began and accused the administration of ""playing ugly politics against us"".On Monday, a by-election would be held also for the Noorpur Assembly seat in western Uttar Pradesh.

Sinha wangled a one-year extension on Tuesday.The bureaucratic dovecotes have been aflutter ever since Adhia went on a fortnight's leave last Saturday after a meeting of the GST Council that failed to hammer out a consensus on a controversial proposal to impose a sugar cess of Rs 3 a kilo that was widely regarded as a badly needed sop to sugarcane growers in election-bound Karnataka.Adhia has reportedly retreated to a yoga and meditation centre in Mysore run by Swami Visharadanand Saraswathy.A note from the department of personnel and training said expenditure secretary Ajay Narayan Jha would assume charge of Adhia's bailiwick - revenue - during his absence.Adhia's holiday is even more remarkable because finance minister Arun Jaitley has not been attending office for over a month as he waits for a kidney transplant.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: ""Dear FM (finance minister), as you are indisposed and finance secretary is on vacation with his guru on a quest for inner peace, I have decided to shut the finance ministry till further notice. The PMO will take all financial policy decisions as before. Prime Minister.""There was a strong buzz in Delhi's corridors of power that Adhia, a Gujarat-cadre IAS officer believed to be extremely close to Modi, was the clear frontrunner for the cabinet secretary's post after Sinha demitted office.Although petroleum secretary K.D. Tripathy is the senior-most bureaucrat in the Modi administration, most civil servants had expected Adhia to climb to the pinnacle.Last September, Adhia was designated as the finance secretary after the retirement of Ashok Lavasa.A topper from Ahmedabad's HR College in accountancy, a gold medallist from IIM Ahmedabad, and a doctorate in yoga from Swamy Vivekananda Yoga University, Bangalore, Adhia had served as principal secretary to Modi when he was Gujarat chief minister and additional chief secretary looking after finance in that state.After Modi's victory in the 2014 general election, he came to Delhi's North Block .But Adhia's luck appeared to have run out after a chain of events put him in a very tight spot, giving critics the opportunity to discredit him.The first sign of trouble came in mid-January when rogue diamantaire Nirav Modi fled India after perpetrating a Rs 14,000-crore fraud on state-run Punjab National Bank, leaving the Enforcement Directorate, which reports to Adhia, red-faced.Soon after, there were reports saying Adhia had in 2016 received two gold biscuits, a silver coin and an iPhone7 from unknown people, apparently worth Rs 1.74 lakh. On the advice of the cabinet secretary, Adhia had deposited these Diwali gifts with the government toshakhana run by the external affairs ministry, where public servants have to deposit all gifts worth more than a token sum received from foreign governments.But the final straw appears to have been the deep embarrassment the government suffered when it was persuaded to reverse a decision taken by Adhia to go along with the UPA's plan to retain the GSTN - a repository of sensitive tax data - as a private entity.The GSTN had been registered as a Chapter 8, non-profit company with 51 per cent shareholding in the hands of private entities like LIC Housing Finance, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and NSE Strategic Investment Co. The government held the remaining 49 per cent.Last Saturday, the GST Council decided to take control of the 51 per cent stake in GSTN held by the private entities and farm it out equally between the Centre and the states. The decision was taken after several lobbyists had red-flagged the risk of a potential data breach at a privately controlled GSTN.Recent data leaks from the Aadhaar portal had deepened concerns about housing critical data relating to citizens with a private organisation.The campaign against Adhia was spearheaded by maverick parliamentarian Subramanian Swamy who tweeted last Friday: ""I demand finance secretary Adhia be transferred to another ministry like textiles for his role in the GSTN scam.""""That was the first indication that Mr Aadhia was no longer the golden boy,"" said a top finance ministry official.A revolt in the GST Council against the sugar cess - meant to subsidise costs for sugar mills which have been struggling to stay afloat because of weakening market prices in the wake of a production glut - didn't help matters, either.As a result, the sugar mills have been unable to pay sugarcane farmers their arrears, which have crossed Rs 18,000 crore, igniting resentment against the Modi government before a crucial state election."

The way the Red Fort is being entrusted to Dalmia Bharat is still more troubling for the company has no claim to any experience in maintenance, conservation, preservation and interpretation of monuments,"" the IHC said in a statement.""There is ample room for the fear that in order to attract tourist traffic it may propagate false or unproven interpretations of particular structures in the complex. Once such claims are set afloat, especially when they are of a sectarian character, it is found extremely difficult to get rid of them,"" the statement added.The IHC demanded that the deal be suspended until a review by the Central Advisory Board of Archaeology or any other recognised body of experts.The Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) statement signed by several academics, artists and theatre persons raised fears that the Red Fort move was aimed at implementing a Hindutva agenda.""The present regime in power has an unsavoury past in regard to our heritage. It felt no compunction when its followers destroyed a 450-year-old monument of architectural importance in 1992 just because it was a mosque. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has long been propagating the cause of declaring all major medieval monuments, including the Taj Mahal and Delhi's Red Fort, as Hindu structures,"" the Sahmat statement said.""It is surely a slur on the Archaeological Survey of India, the legal guardian of all monuments, that it is held to be incapable of maintaining a major national monument like the Red Fort,"" it added."

Experience and experimentation in the initial two or three projects will make all the difference in planning for other future projects that the ministry will take up for development.""On Saturday, the Opposition slammed the government and O'Brien tweeted: "" Wah! So here is acche din. Red Fort being 'sold'? Now other national treasures ready to be auctioned to highest bidder. As chairman Parliament cmtee of transport tourism & culture, can say matter was still being 'discussed'. Pledge to stop this.""On Sunday, O'Brien did not respond to a call and messages from this newspaper for further clarification.The Trinamul later said in a statement: ""No one in the committee approved all this wholesale sale. Committee said it was open to exploring toilets and water. Government announced and signed MoU with Dalmia without consulting. Read the MoU. It is a virtual lease of the property and turning Red Fort into a Disneyland.""But a tourism ministry official claimed: ""It is only (about) access, and no handing over is involved. Adopt a Heritage is essentially a non-revenue-generating project. It is part of responsible tourism where the only benefit a private stakeholder can look for is limited, not prominent, visibility for the facilities created.""He added: ""The idea was that the government makes capital expenditure from time to time. For instance, when a washroom is put in place, usually no one takes the responsibility to operate and maintain it at the desired level. Here, the private stakeholder will pitch in and will take the responsibility to upgrade and maintain a certain standard of tourism amenities.""The Dalmias would be permitted to carry out ""semi-commercial activities"" like running a ""tourism facilitation centre with Wi-Fi, a small souvenir shop and a small cafeteria selling food cooked outside the premises, or battery-operated carts from (the) parking (lot) to (the) gates where reasonable fees would be charged by the company after approval by the inter-ministerial committee"", the official said.""To discourage profit-making, a separate account will be maintained by the company and any incidental profit has to be accounted for and has to be put back to make it a self-sustaining model.""In response to a question, Aashima Mehrotra, deputy director-general (tourism) in charge of the plan, told The Telegraph: ""Only the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will sell entry tickets to the Red Fort.

We are all newly-emerging markets as well as developing countries with big populations,"" Lu said.""So we believe that the two countries will continue to uphold globalisation so that it will be more inclusive. So we have lot of shared interests, concerns and propositions.""Lu said that while he could not make any prejudgement ahead of the meeting, ""it is sure that the two leaders will exchange views on these issues but I believe you will see and hear very positive voices"".At their recent Strategic Economic Dialogue here, India and China had displayed wider convergence on the threats to globalisation and rising protectionism.Niti Aayog vice-chairperson Rajiv Kumar had said in his address at the event on April 14 that the world economy was staging a synchronised recovery after a long time.But the ""recovery is marred and disrupted by unseemingly protectionist noises that are coming out from the Atlantic basin, from North America and Europe"", he had said.Kumar had also made a strong case for China to open its import market to India for soybean and sugar after Beijing imposed a 25 per cent tariff on a range of products, including these two, following the trade spat with the US.""I was noticing that there are some tariffs you imposed on farmers from Iowa and Ohio (in the US). Maybe India can be a substitute for soybean and sugar, if we could access those exports with all the due quality considerations to our farmers,"" Kumar had told the chairperson of China's National Development Reforms Commission, He Lifeng, at the meeting.Soybean is regarded as most important for US farmers as China is their largest importer.Trump is pressuring China to reduce America's $375 billion trade deficit with China to $100 billion.

(File)In a fresh trouble for Pakistan's ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, anti-corruption body National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has launched another inquiry against him on a journalist's complaint that over 56 million rupees were sent out of the country by his family between 1988 and 1991.The development assumes significance as Mr Sharif, his sons Hussain and Hassan, daughter Maryam and son-in-law former Muhammad Safdar are already facing three corruption charges for money laundering and illegal offshore holdings in the Panama Papers scandal.Mr Sharif, 68, is currently visiting his ailing wife Kulsoom Nawaz in London, despite the anti-graft body's request to put their names on the Exit Control List, fearing they may not return to face corruption cases in court.The fresh inquiry over money laundering allegations was launched by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on the complaint of a journalist, a NAB spokesperson was quoted as saying by Dawn.The complainant has provided details how Mr Sharif and his family members allegedly sent money to foreign countries illegallyHawala dealers from Peshawar, Khaista Khan and Jamshed Khan were engaged by the Mr Sharif's family to siphon-off large amounts of funds through their bank accounts, according to the complaint.It said the Sharif family illegally sent funds converted into foreign currencies abroad regularly.The complaint said Khalid Siraj, a first cousin and business partner of Mr Sharif, had disclosed in a statement recorded before the Federal Investigation Agency in the Panama Papers case, the Sharif family's misdeeds, including transfer of funds aboard and purchase of assets in foreign countries.""Between 1988 and 1991, Rupees 56.896 million was sent out of the country,"" the complaint said.The NAB was informed that in 1988, $758,000 was remitted from the Bank of Oman in Sharjah to the bank's Lahore branch and then this money was converted into Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates worth Rupees 145.06 million and distributed among close relatives of Sharif and partners of his family members, the report said.According to another allegation in the complaint, the Ramzan Sugar Mill owned by the Sharif family obtained $30 million from Faysal Bank in 1990 during Sharif's first tenure as prime ministerThe Supreme Court had disqualified Mr Sharif last year, forcing the three-time Prime Minister to resign. He, however, has dismissed as ""politically motivated"" the corruption charges linked to the Panama Papers case.The trial is in final stage as the Supreme Court has directed the trial court to conclude the case by July 10.The corruption references against Mr Sharif and his family were filed after his ouster. Mr Sharif had complained of not getting a ""fair trial"". He alleged the court had already decided to pass a verdict against him before the July 25 general election.The political future of Mr Sharif, who heads the country's most powerful political family and is the de-facto leader of the ruling PML-N, is uncertain and he could be jailed if convicted."
5b2722759855b72a6d18b5fc,Farmers’ stir sign of rising distress,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/farmers-stir-sign-rising-distress-673207.html,2018-06-03,"The 10-day agitation launched by farmers in seven states on Friday has intensified and is set to be extended to more states. The states where the farmers have started the stir include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, and those in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and other states may join them. The plan also includes a nationwide bandh on June 10. Farmers have resorted to protest actions like stopping the supply of produce to the mandis and it has started impacting the prices of vegetables, fruits and milk in cities and towns. The agitation is being organised by as many as 104 farmers bodies, led by the Rashtriya Kisan Sangh. It is unfortunate that farmers have to be in a perpetual mode of agitation, and it shows that their problems continue to remain unsolved. Farmers in Maharashtra made a long march to Mumbai in March. The Maharashtra government accepted their demands but the promises are yet to be implemented.The farmers have made a number of demands, including remunerative prices for their produce and waiver of farm loans. The agitation is mainly against the central government. The Narendra Modi government had promised to raise the minimum support prices to 150% of the cost of production, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, but it has not done that. It had promised to double farmers income by 2022, but most farmers are poorer now than they there a few years ago. Indebted farmers continue to commit suicide. The present plight in many places is not because of the failure of crops resulting from drought or other reasons but because of higher production and the consequent fall in prices. For example, the production of potatoes, tomatoes and garlic has increased but this has led to their prices falling below cost. Marketing of produce is a major problem because of the existence of intermediaries, and the farmer never gets the right price. Official policies often work against the interests of farmers. The government has decided to import sugar and tur dal when there is a glut of these in the country.The lack of facilities for preservation of perishable produce like fruits and vegetables and the absence of an efficient and transparent marketing mechanism are major problems. There is no system to give guidance to farmers on the crops to be cultivated on the basis of projections of demand and supply. Uncertainties caused by weather and government policies continue and the farm insurance system is very inadequate. The spreading agitation is another wake-up call and warning to the government. Effective policies and actions, and not promises and slogans, are needed to mitigate the rising distress."

MudurNew Delhi: India's food-safety regulator has proposed colour-coded rules to discourage certain ""red"" food, including samosas, French fries, ready-to-eat noodles and burgers, from school canteens and encourage ""green"" food such as wholegrain cereals, legumes, lean meat, fish and eggs.The Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has sought ""suggestions from stakeholders"" on proposed rules that will require school administrations to ensure their canteens operate through licences and adhere to a colour-coded scheme and curb sales of high fat, sugar and salt food.The rules discourage red-coded food from school canteens, hostel kitchens and from being sold within 50 metres of school premises. State food authorities will be tasked with surveillance and inspections to ensure schools comply with the rules that also specify safety and hygiene requirements - for premises, utensils, food handlers and raw materials.The proposals come amid concerns about growing prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents.A 2016 review published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research had found that prevalence of overweight adolescents had increased from about 10 per cent before 2001 to 14 per cent after 2010.""Controls on the food served in schools in our country has been long, long overdue,"" said Sitanshu Sekhar Kar, an additional professor of social and preventive medicine at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry.""Students may cite examples of what is served in schools to justify what they wish to consume outside school - parents trying to discourage children from certain food in a supermarket may find themselves told that the same food are available in school,"" he said.A senior FSSAI official said the proposed colour-coded scheme was drawn up on the basis of suggestions from an independent panel of experts in nutrition and health that the authority had constituted.The rules will also require food handlers in school canteens and kitchens to wear clean aprons, head gear and hand gloves, and undergo periodic medical tests to rule out infectious diseases. They will also need to refrain from eating, chewing, smoking, spitting or nose blowing while handling food.The canteen and kitchen staff would also need to ensure that the premises are free of insects and flies, the kitchen ceiling is free from flaking plaster, and utensils are not broken or cracked.The rules also say state food authorities should ""motivate schools"" to adopt a comprehensive health-promotion programme and adopt a rating system that would recognise schools with high health standards and encourage other schools to follow suit."

A month after special CBI judge Loya's death, Shah was acquitted.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the Maharashtra government, countered the doubts raised by Jaising.Rohatgi said that in the inquest report, the ""way of writing"" was such that December ""1"" appeared as ""7"".Jaising told the court that the name of judge Brijgopal Harkishan Loya had been incorrectly written as Brij Mohan Loya in at least 10 documents submitted by the Maharashtra government, which she said indicated that an attempt was being made to conceal certain truths.""The state has not produced the case diary. It is important to know the time at which the police station received a call that an accidental death had ensued. The diary would also provide a minute-by-minute account of the happenings,"" she said, urging the court to summon the case diary from the government for scrutiny by the bench.The senior counsel said Loya did not suffer from any cardiac, sugar or blood pressure problems and had led an active life, playing tennis for two hours a day, and that he was only 48 at the time of death. ""Statements of Loya's wife, sister, father and son that there is nothing suspicious as to the death have been procured under duress and are self-serving statements which should be ignored in view of their earlier statements,"" Jaising said.Advocate P.S.

PTI PhotoAhmedabad, Jan. 16 (PTI): Vishva Hindu Parishad leader Pravin Togadia, who briefly went missing on Monday, charged that some people were trying to stifle his voice and that he was not allowed to speak on issues like Ram Temple, farmers and cow slaughter.A tearful Togadia, 62, made the allegations at a press conference on Tuesday where he also said that he went into hiding as he feared police will kill him in an encounter.I am being targeted for a decade-old case, there is an attempt to suppress my voice. Rajasthan Police team came to arrest me. Someone told me plan was being made to kill me in an encounter, Togadia claimed.Togadia, who went missing on Monday after Rajasthan Police came to arrest him in a ten-year old case and was later found admitted to a hospital in an unconscious state, claimed that attempts were being made to silence him for raising the voice of the Hindu community.The VHP leader said he will surrender before the court in Rajasthan after he is discharged from hospital.Yesterday morning, I was performing pooja, when messages came that a large contingent of Rajasthan Police, along with Gujarat Police, was coming to encounter me (kill me in an encounter), Togadia claimed.After informing my security guards, I, along with a VHP worker, took an auto-rickshaw, and went to Theltej area of the city. I called up Rajasthan chief minister (Vasundhara Raje) and home minister (Gulabchand Kataria) but they denied their police had come to Gujarat to arrest me. This raised more suspicion and I switched off my mobile phones, he said.I contacted lawyers of Rajasthan and told them to get the arrest warrant cancelled. But they said that it was difficult as court issued it. So I decided to go to Jaipur by taking a flight and appear before the court (in Gangaput), he said.However, when I was going in the auto-rickshaw to the airport, I felt dizzy and asked the driver to take me to some hospital. Then I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I was at an unknown hospital, he said.I do not fear death, I do not fear encounter. But I had to protect myself while following the law of the land, he said.I have been raising my voice for Hindus. I am raising issues like Ram temple, national law to ban cow slaughter, re-settlement of Kashmiri Hindus in that state, giving farmers fair price for their crops. But an attempt is being made to silence my voice, he said.Old cases are being reopened, so that I can be arrested. An attempt is being made to stifle my voice by arresting me in different states, he said.To a query, Togadia said he would reveal the names of those behind the plot to silence his voice, at the right time.Rajasthan Police had come to arrest me, but the chief minister and home minister of that state were not aware about it. Same way it happened in Gujarat. When Gujarat court issued a warrant against me, the chief minister (Vijay Rupani) here, or home minster (Pradeepsinh Jadeja) were not aware about it, he said.On whose orders are police is taking such action will be revealed by me at an appropriate time and with evidence, Togadia said.An arrest warrant was issued by Ahmedabad court recently against Togadia and he had appeared in the court on January 6 to get it cancelled.He also claimed that the Central Bureau of Investigation was threatening doctors associated with VHP.The mystery over Togadia's disappearance on Monday has deepened, with a senior police officer maintaining that neither the local Sola police nor Rajasthan Police had arrested him.The VHP had on Monday claimed that Togadia was detained by Rajasthan Police in connection with the case, but the latter denied this.Sola police station officials said a team of Rajasthan Police visited them on Monday to execute an arrest warrant against Togadia under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, but could not find him at his residence.According to a statement issued on Monday by the VHP in Delhi after Togadia was found, Togadia, who suffered from low blood sugar levels, was found in an unconscious state in Shahibaug area and was taken to Chandramani Hospital located in the same area.VHP workers had taken to the streets on Monday and halted traffic and held demonstrations after their leader was untraceable."

The case is related to alleged disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant.The police are still to unravel how Togadia reached the park, about 15km from the VHP office where he stayed, but is believed to have taken an auto-rickshaw after stepping out.Togadia said he was not bothered about his life and would continue to raise his voice for the rights of Hindus and that nobody should try to suppress it.""For years I have been raising my voice for the Hindus and for a Ram temple, banning of cow slaughter and doubling the income of farmers.

""New project announcements have declined, fresh investment is low, informal sector is still reeling under the ill-effects of demonetisation, job creation is abysmal, exports are plunging, manufacturing sector growth has slowed down, agriculture sector has been hit hard and rural despair is abundant.""Giving details of sector-wise figures, which too confirmed the downward slide, Chidambaram said: ""The recent social discontent therefore can be a direct manifestation of this economic slowdown, which the government was conveniently hiding.

We cant announce the new welfare schemes in just a supplementary budget. We have formed a panel to prepare the common minimum programme of the coalition government and have sought a report in 10 days, the chief minister said.The next session will be convened in the first week of next month, during which we plan to present the budget, he added. Earlier, in the day former chief minister and Chairman of the Coordination Committee Siddaramaiah told reporters in Bengaluru that the new government need not present a full budget since he had already presented a budget before elections and taken a vote an account.Countering this, Kumaraswamy said, I can recall that Siddaramaiah himself had said that once a new government headed by him returns to power, he might have to present a full budget.A full-fledged budget has been tabled already, Siddaramaiah said referring to the last budget he presented as chief minister in February. We have a vote on account for that budget till the end of July. All ongoing programmes and new programmes announced in the budget will continue. If Kumaraswamy wants to have additional programmes or schemes, he can do it through a supplementary budget.Siddaramaiahs remark comes a day after Kumaraswamy revealed that he was under pressure to present a supplementary budget instead of a new one. It is now learnt that when the matter came up for discussion in the first meeting of the coordination committee on June 14, Kumaraswamy disagreed with the Congress suggestion of presenting a supplementary budget. The coordination committee resolved that programmes announced by the previous administration, including even those Siddaramaiah announced in his last budget, would continue in the Congress-JD(S) coalition government.The alliance partners are also at loggerheads over waiving farmers loans. While Siddaramaiah said he was not against it, he said loan waiver will be discussed by the five-member committee tasked with drafting a common minimum programme. Im not against the loan waiver. Loan waiver among many other things will be discussed by the committee, Siddaramaiah said. Amid this, Siddaramaiah will nestle away for 12 days at a nature cure centre in Dharmasthala. He will leave on Sunday and return by the end of this month. Theres fluctuation in my sugar and blood pressure levels. Ive to get ready for the Parliamentary election.Govt stable: HDKIn Delhi, asked about his statement that nobody can touch him for one year, Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said, I have no worries about my government stability. It is the media who are facing uncertainty. You people keep running programmes after programme about the future of my government. Let there be an end to this and give us at least one year to implement welfare schemes. Kumaraswamy is said to have sought an appointment with Congress president Rahul Gandhi to discuss state-related issues. He is likely to broach the subject of a full budget with him."

""But this win gives out the message that when the Opposition is united, the BJP and its communal agenda can be defeated.""Hasan is wary of the BJP's ""communal agenda"". She has witnessed it in her own constituency. In 2013, a year before the BJP came to power at the Centre, 62 people died in communal violence in Shamli, the area under her jurisdiction, and neighbouring Muzaffarnagar. BJP leaders, including the late Hukum Singh, Sanjeev Balyan, Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana, were booked for instigating violence. After the riots, came the issue of mass Hindu exodus from Kairana. Singh blamed the Muslims for it, though much later, questions were raised about the authenticity of such claims.In these bypolls, the BJP played the Jat vs Muslim card. But Hasan claims she got over 80 per cent of the Jat votes. ""These Jats are Hindus. Why do you think they supported me? Ram, Krishna, Allah, all were with me,"" says Hasan, who won by 50,000 votes.Shortly before the bypolls last month, the BJP and Bajrang Dal also raked up the issue of ""reverse"" love jihad. Earlier, they had alleged that Hindu girls were being lured away by Muslim men and dubbed the phenomenon ""love jihad"". This time round, they alleged that Hindu men were being made to join Islam with the promise of a job and marriage with a Muslim girl.Hasan laughs at this. ""The biggest love jihads have happened in the homes of BJP leaders. The party's national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain's wife, Renu, and minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's wife, Seema, are both Hindus. Who will talk about them?"" she asks, and then adds indignantly, ""Is this even an issue?""The BJP never talks about issues that matter, she lashes out. She points out how around the time of the Kairana bypolls, the party created much hullabaloo over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah that has been in Aligarh Muslim University for decades. Opposing the BJP's attempt to divert from real issues, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary coined the slogan, ""Jinnah nahin, ganna chalega... Not Jinnah, sugarcane is the real issue here"". It was a nod to the statewide problem of non-payment of dues to sugarcane farmers by sugar mills.Currently, the unpaid dues stand at Rs 1,000 crore. Hasan says, ""Plus, the price of compost has gone up, the power tariff for tube wells has increased and soaring diesel prices are also taking a toll on farmers. Why doesn't the BJP talk about all this?""She seems to believe that no attempt by the Hindutva brigade to resurrect the Hindu versus Muslim debate can help the BJP anymore. ""The fact that I am sitting in front of you as an elected MP is the biggest proof of that. Our strategy is to keep a direct connect with the people, raise real issues in Parliament, solve people's problems. That's the only way to defeat the BJP in 2019,"" she says, as she pulls her white embroidered dupatta to cover her head. ""Dhul chatayenge in sabko... We will make them bite the dust.""In this hour-long meeting, for the first time, Hasan speaks with so much aggression. She is otherwise not much of a talker; one has to prod her for detailed answers. And she is very soft-spoken, too. I cannot help but ask how she hopes to survive in the male-dominated Parliament. ""Don't go by this side of mine,"" she says. ""I can be tough if need be.""In a resolute voice she tells me she doesn't really want anyone to project her success as a triumph of woman power. In fact, she clearly says, she doesn't want to play the woman card for her political gains. ""I won not because I am a woman. My opponent, Mriganka Singh, daughter of Hukum Singh, is also a woman. The fight was equal.""Hasan grew up in a family of wealthy farmers at Saharanpur in west UP. She and her two sisters enjoyed absolute freedom at home. Her younger brother, Mansoor, tells me, ""All important decisions were and are still taken by our sisters. Our parents never listened to the sons much.""Her maternal grandfather, Shafquat Jung, was a Congress MP from Kairana between 1971 and 1977. Her father, Akhtar Hasan, was the pradhan, or chief, of the Sarsawa block in Saharanpur. Hasan tells me she had watched both of them at work closely and understood the tricks of the trade well before she took the plunge. She was also aware of the risks one takes in elections. She learnt how to garner the support of grassroots workers, too. ""A lot of women don't understand politics even if they join it. They cannot even decide whom to vote for; they do as the men in their family want them to do. That never happened in my case.""The political training continued even after marriage. Her father-in-law, also Akhtar Hasan, was a Congress MP from Kairana between 1984 and 1989. ""He was an astute politician,"" says Hasan. She adds that while the older generations in both families were Congress loyalists, she and her husband, Munawwar Hasan, were closer to the SP.Munawwar was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kairana in 1996 and Muzaffarnagar in 2004 on an SP ticket. Later, he joined the BSP. All through his political career, Tabassum sat through political meetings, played an active role in a lot of inner party decision-making and co-ordinated with party workers at the ground level. When Munawwar died in an accident, she assumed charge and fought the 2009 elections on a BSP ticket. ""I had to take his legacy forward,"" says Munawwar's widow, who has since joined the RLD.I tell her she has the reputation of being quite the party-hopper, to which she replies, ""I always changed parties for the welfare of the people.""Since her victory, Hasan has been targeted by various pro-BJP sites on social media. In those posts, certain controversial statements have been falsely attributed to her. A Facebook page titled ""Yogi Adityanath-True Indian"" quoted her as having said, ""This is the victory of Allah and the defeat of Ram."" This post was shared over 3,700 times. Hasan finally lodged a police complaint and an investigation is currently underway.She says, ""I would like to ask the BJP, if you are fighting so much for Muslim women and their issues of triple talaq and talking about ""sabka saath, sabka vikas"", then why are you so worried about a Muslim woman going to Parliament."""

Apparently quite a lot, as I have learnt over the last few weeks.Friends have been dropping by, all carrying baked and roasted namkeen and biscuits. One friend got us a delicious roasted chicken, about which I shall write later, and two other friends came with a hamper of yummy food from Noshi.Noshi is a delivery outlet of the Yum Yum Cha group and serves sushi, Thai and other Asian delights. They have a wide array of dimsums, soups (pho, tom yum), sushi and sashimi, curries (red, green) and meals in a bowl (rice or noodles with your favoured flavours  spicy garlic, basil and chilli and three-pepper  with your choice of toppings.I like sushi, but asked for steamed dimsums instead. They brought us various kinds  with edamame and truffle, chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, basil chicken, prawn cheung fun (with chillies, soy sauce and garlic) and prawn har gao, which consisted of prawns, dill leaves and asparagus. Then there was a lemongrass tofu dish, sliced garlic chicken and Thai lemon fish with basmati rice.Wholesome mealThis was, obviously, the best meal Id had after my stint in the hospital (where the food was so bad that it encouraged me to get well soon and get discharged at the earliest). The food from Noshi was light, yet delicious. I did not have the sauces or the prawn (high in cholesterol, alas), but really enjoyed some of the dimsums and the main dishes.The chicken and chestnut dimsum had just the right crunchy and soft texture that I wanted, and the basil chicken had a nice flavour. I loved my Thai steamed fish, which had a mild lemony sauce, and I thought the lemongrass tofu was excellent. I didnt much like the edamame and truffle dimsum for I didnt get the flavour of truffle in it. But I must say it looked good!I later found out that most of the dimsums are for Rs. 345 or so for a plate of four, as are the sushis (of various kinds such as tuna nigiri, unagi nigiri, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon, crab salad, cucumber blossom and enoki and truffle) for three or four rolls. The curries or wok stacks are for Rs. 485. Zomato says a meal for two costs Rs. 1000.I loved the food from Noshi. It was light, yet delicious and flavourful. And like all of owner Varun Tulis creations, it looks beautiful. My only problem  and this I heard another day when some other Noshi-loving friends came over  is the packaging. It is beautifully packed, but there is too much packaging. The dimsums, for instance, came in small boxes, with smaller boxes of the sauce or the oil, and these were than all placed in a large and beautiful cardboard container. Now that I am a man who believes in safeguarding nature (and health), I thought there was no need for the carton, however elegant.Noshi, which is in GK 1, delivers to a radius of 10 km from there, but has plans to deliver in Gurugram soon.I am off sugar (well, mostly off, I should say) but if you order from Noshi, do have some of their mochi ice cream. Like most things Japanese it is beautiful  and healthy.Readers are going to get to hear more on healthy food from me. After all, health is wealth, as Baba WhatsApp says."

MudurEmpagliflozin diabetes drug molecule's skeletal formula. Picture credit: ShutterstockNew Delhi: A clinical study in India has shown that an anti-diabetes medicine called empagliflozin can help reduce liver fat in diabetes patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a disorder that raises the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.The trial has found that empagliflozin lowers liver fat levels among diabetes patients with NAFLD from an average 16 per cent to 11 per cent after 20 weeks of taking the drug as a single daily 10mg tablet.Fifty diabetes patients who had volunteered for the trial were randomly classified into two groups. Those who received empagliflozin as an add-on to standard diabetes treatment had on an average about four per cent lower liver fat than those who received only the standard diabetes treatment.Doctors estimate that nearly half of diabetes patients also have NAFLD, which can progress to a severe form of the disorder and then to fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver or to liver cancer.Besides, NAFLD is by itself an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease.""People have tried various medications to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but drug regulators have not approved any specific medicine to treat this condition so far,"" said Ambrish Mithal, a senior consultant and chair of endocrinology at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon, who led the study.Empagliflozin, while helping regulate blood sugar, has also been found to promote weight loss in high-risk diabetes patients by burning away fat and to reduce the rates of cardiovascular events.""It was melting fat away from other parts of the body. We decided to test its effect on the liver,"" Mithal told The Telegraph. The findings were published in the research journal Diabetes Care this week.The doctors say the 10mg daily dose of empagliflozin, if adopted into clinical practice, is likely to cost patients about Rs 50 extra per day.They say they did not find any correlation between sugar control and liver fat reduction, nor between body weight loss and liver fat reduction, suggesting the effect on liver fat was independent of the drug's other effects.According to the doctors, their findings need to be validated through larger trials that should also examine the long-term clinical relevance of the lowered fat levels.Other clinicians view the findings as significant but caution that the drug should be used only in diabetes patients.""Diet, exercise and weight loss help reduce fat levels to some extent, but there's no medication yet,"" said Naval Vikram, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, who was not associated with the study.""So this could be a significant advance. But empagliflozin is approved only for use in diabetes; people should not begin to think it could be used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients without diabetes.""The other doctors who helped conduct the trial were Mohammad Shafi Kuchay, Sonal Krishnan, Sunil Mishra, Khalid Jamal Farooqui, Manish Kumar Singh, Jasjeet Singh Wasir, Beena Bansal, Parjeet Kaur, Ganesh Jevalikar, Harmendeep Kaur Gill and Narendra Singh Chaudhary."
5b27f2c69855b72445d1fa46,Sweet nothing,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sweet-nothing/article24176717.ece,2018-06-16,"A little over a month after the Centre proposed a special cess under the GST to help alleviate distress among sugarcane farmers, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a Rs. 7,000- crore package for the sugar sector last week. This package, with a mix of assured minimum pricing and special incentives for increasing molasses and ethanol production to gainfully mop up the glut of sugar in the country, is independent of the cess proposal that was expected to raise Rs. 6,700 crore. To put this in perspective, sugar mills dues to farmers stand at Rs. 22,000 crore. Under the proposed bailout scheme, the government will procure sugar from mills at a fixed minimum price to help them clear dues to farmers, and also offer them other financial assistance. Only about Rs. 1,175 crore, however, will be used towards procurement of refined sugar from mills to create a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes. This is a fraction of the 63.5 million tonnes output expected in the two sugar seasons from October 2017 to September 2019. With the record output, sugar prices have dropped from an average of Rs. 37 a kg in the previous season to Rs. 26 in the current season. The bailout plan promises to pay Rs. 29 a kg. Sugar mills say this is below their production cost of Rs. 35 a kg, though it may dissipate their immediate liquidity problems to an extent.Rating agency Crisil reckons that the fixed price for sugar at mill gates and the buffer stock will at best help mitigate about 40% of the outstanding arrears to sugarcane farmers. And as production will rise again in the coming season, so will the extent of arrears. The rest of the package will take time to materialise, with Rs. 4,440 crore of loans and Rs. 1,332 crore of interest subsidies for greenfield and brownfield distillery capacities. Over time, this could help to use excess sugar for the manufacture of alcohol or ethanol, but it will not be soon enough to address the present crisis. All said and done, the Centres sweetener for the sector does little to address structural problems and sticks to old-style pricing and stock-holding interventions instead of signalling a shift to market-driven cropping decisions. The political compulsions driving the bailout are obvious, given that the sugarcane crisis was a rallying cry in the by-election in Kairana in Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP lost. But that is no excuse for not thinking the package through. Perpetuating the complex web of state controls in a politically-sensitive sector is no solution. The best way to address the problem of excess supply in the long run is to ensure some linkage between the price paid for sugarcane and the end-products it is used for; and encouraging the feedback from market prices to inform farmers future cropping decisions. The current sops-driven solution could distort the agriculture sector further."

Roadside vendors are selling colourful glass and lacquer bangles, assorted fruits, mounds of dry fruits and bags filled with sewai or vermicelli.There is a faint aroma of ghee that clings to the air. Bundles upon bundles of uncooked sewai lie on tabletops of makeshift stalls. Off-white, paper white, yellow, light brown. Men and women carrying huge shopping bags haggle with the vendors for their dose of this season's sweetness. Indeed, in the grand Eid spread of sheermal paratha, galauti kababs, biryani, mutton chaanp, sewai is the lone sweet note.The scene at Zakaria Street is no different from Mullickbazar that evening. There is still a week to go before Eid. Shop owner Mohamad Eiyaz is taking an iftar break. His son, Shahnawaz, a college student, is filling in for his father. The shop that sells stationery all year also sells sewai during this time.Shahnawaz tells us that they source it from a factory in Metiabruz on the outskirts of the city. And not just them, the paanwala, the man frying samosas, another manning a bag shop, all jump onto the sewai bandwagon at this time.Qudimi Karkhana Sewai is different in that it sells sewai throughout the year. ""What do you want - bhuna, mota, Banarasi, lachcha,"" asks Syed Feroze, who works at the 200-year-old shop, in between measuring a heap of lachcha for a customer. The lachcha is very fine of texture, looks like a heap of hay. It is basically made of rice or refined flour or semolina kneaded with ghee.""The mota sewai comes from Lucknow, the Banarasi one from Benaras and the lachcha is made right here in the city,"" says Feroze, as he stashes the payment into a tin tiffin box. The finest and the most expensive of the lot is the Banarasi sewai. ""What Basmati is to rice, Banarasi is to sewai,"" explains Shahanshah Mirza, a food connoisseur. He adds, ""An Eid without sewai is considered incomplete.""Athar Ali, the 25-year-old owner of a garment shop in Chitpur, says that most people start to stack up sewai before the beginning of Ramzan, and consume it intermittently that whole month. Mirza says, ""Chand raat marks the end of Ramzan and a lot of people buy sewai especially then because the next day is Eid.""The menu at most Mughlai eateries comprises firni and shaahi tukda and not sewai; it is the preserve of home kitchens and makes an appearance only on special occasions.There is no one way of preparing sewai, we are given to understand. The lachcha is usually doused in a bowl of milk and had with a sprinkling of sugar. ""A lot of people have it thus during sehri. It is filling and keeps one going all through the day,"" says Athar Ali.We learn from homemaker Shagufta Bano, a resident of Howrah, that every family has its own version of the sewai, most of them going back several generations. ""You could boil it in milk, cook it in chashni or sugar syrup, or deep fry it in ghee..."" she rattles away.Shagufta adds a generous pinch of jafran (saffron) to her version. First, she adds sugar in desi ghee, then water and, thereafter, some jafran for an orange tinge. Then she adds the raw sewai to this mix, throws in kaju, kishmish, pista, badaam and khoa. And a drop or two of meetha attar.What Shagufta prepares is called the qimami sewai. There is also the sheer khurma, a sweet pudding made of milk, sewai, dried dates and sugar. Be it meethi sewai, sheer khurma or rumali sewai, the slight variations are most likely in the DNA of the dish - place of origin and consequent availability of ingredients.Manzilat Fatima, a preserver of royal Awadhi family cuisine and a food curator, tells us about a sewai dish called muzaffar. ""It is an age-old preparation, not so common in every home. One needs considerable expertise to achieve the balance of moisture in the sewai and at the same time maintain the individual strands of vermicelli,"" says Fatima.Vermicelli does not have much of a flavour of its own, and so it readily absorbs the flavours of the ingredients it is cooked with. That is why it can be added to dishes sweet and savoury alike.Chef Deepak Raj Srivastava of Pukhtaan, a restaurant in Patna specialising in Awadhi cuisine, tells The Telegraph over phone that sewai is also used to make savoury items, cutlets and potato rolls. In these cases, the vermicelli acts as a coating, lending a certain texture to the dish.A dessert usually comes at the end of a meal. But in a manner, the sewai is an exception. Something sweet is partaken of before namaaz on Eid. Says Athar, ""Having something sweet before the Eid prayers is sunnat, which means respecting the Prophet. Some households have dry dates and milk without sugar and some prefer sewai."" It is also among the first few dishes offered to guests on Eid day, we are told - to sweeten relations."

(Express photo by Oinam Anand/File) A miller in Kolhapur said the reduction in prices was adopted to enable them to pay the farmers whose cane will come for crushing in the last few weeks of the season.  (Express photo by Oinam Anand/File)Sugar millers and traders have called for long term policy-level decisions to maintain healthy sugar prices to enable them to pay cane growers. While the recent decision of controlled sales have firmed up the price of sugar, millers fear a slide once the moratorium of sales ends in April. On Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSC) Bank had revised its valuation of sugar by Rs 130 per quintal from the earlier valuation of Rs 2,970. This would be the sixth time the apex bank has changed the valuation of sugar since the start of the season in November. In the earlier five instances, the bank had reduced the valuations of sugar.Millers have been complaining of low sugar prices which have compromised their financial health and had subsequently led to default in payment to growers. Most of the mills have also slashed the first installment payment announced at the start of the season in view of the low sugar prices.The decision of the sugar millers to reduce the first installment payment had naturally not gone down well with growers with farmers organisations such as the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana taking to the streets against it. Sanghatana head MP Raju Shetti has also warned of further protests if mills did not revert to the promised payment. It might be remembered that even mills in Kolhapur, known for handsome payments to the growers, have reduced the first installment announced and are now paying Rs 2,500 per tonne.Since the imposition of controlled sales, which mandates sale of only 17 and 14 per cent of stock with mills for the months of February and March, respectively, sugar prices have firmed up by Rs 200-250 per quintal. Mukesh Kuvadia, secretary of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association, said ex mill price in Maharashtra is between Rs 3,100 and Rs 3,200 at present. This price is solely due to the artificial stoppage created in the market due to the sales restrictions. Once the restrictions are removed, prices might come tumbling down, he said.This short-time price hike, the industry says, is not strong enough to let the mills pay the growers higher prices. Most millers have adopted a wait- and-watch policy in terms of payment as they fear a slide in the sugar prices. A miller in Kolhapur said the reduction in prices was adopted to enable them to pay the farmers whose cane will come for crushing in the last few weeks of the season. If we continue to pay the first installment payment as declared at the start of the season, we will not be in a position to pay the later farmers, he said.Both traders and millers now say a long term solution is necessary to deal this years crisis. Rohit Pawar, vice-president of the India Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), called for incentive for exports to deal with the glut. But Kuvadia was of the opinion that instead of export subsidy the government should incentivise sugar consuming industries to increase the domestic consumption of sugar. That will be a permanent solution to the problem, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Activists alleged that the administration and the police were intimated about the marriages, yet no action was taken.Last week, an NGO Lek Ladki Abhiyan had conducted a grievance hearing about the issues minor girls face at Shirur Kasar tehsil in Beed district. During the hearing, school-going girls narrated the difficulties they faced. Lack of proper roads and public transportation were among the top complaints. Girls said they had to walk 4-5 kms every day to reach schools and they didnt feel safe on their way back home. Poor quality of education and unsafe school buildings were among other complaints.Most of the residents of Shirur Kasar are seasonal labourers, who migrate to Western Maharashtra to work in sugarcane fields in the production season of sugar factories. Almost 80 per cent couples in the area are away from homes for at least 5 to 6 months every year. As they are worried about the safety of their girls, unwanted marriages at the age of 13-17 and the early pregnancies are common, Advocate Varsha Deshpande, founder of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, stated in press release issued on Tuesday.In their report to the CRC, Deshpande, along with other activists of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, claimed to have informed the local administration and the police about the 13 child marriages that took place in the tehsil between 2017 and 2018. Police officers, however, claimed that the marriages were performed secretly and the facts were latter denied.Meanwhile, CRC Chairperson Pravin Ghuge, along with other members Santosh Shinde and Dr Shalini Karad, said the commission has taken serious note of the matter and has decided to conduct a suo motu hearing in all 13 incidents. They also directed the officials of the state transport corporation and the health and education department to act on the grievances the girls had shared.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The state government has handed over 28.44 acres from the main campus of the college to the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Ltd for a maintenance depot.One of the biggest green spaces in the heart of the city  the College of Agriculture campus  has shrunk by 119.72 acres in the last three and half decades, according to data obtained by The Indian Express under the Right To Information (RTI) Act. (One acre equals 43,560 sqft). The lost green space has been used variously for widening roads, building subways and offices, agriculture-related schemes and, most recently, for building a maintenance depot for the Pune Metro.The College of Agriculture was set up in 1879 as a department linked to the College of Science (now the College of Engineering, Pune) and, later in 1907, became a separate institute. Back then, the campus sprawled over 150 acres.In later years, as activities expanded, the campus grew to 569.91 acres  this included land at the colleges Shivajinagar campus, farms in the Ganeshkhind area, the dairy department in Khadki and research plots in Manjari on Solapur Road. Data shows since the eighties, the college has relinquished land for various projects of the state government, the Centre and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) but was rarely given land in compensation by government agencies.The lush green college campus is not only popular with students who come here to study but is also a popular destination for nature lovers. The old stone college building is one of the most beautiful edifices in the city and the location for many a film shoots.Documents show the college received no land in return for a 35,000-sqft land it gave for construction of a subway on the Pune-Mumbai Highway, a 12,670-sqft land for the widening of Mula Road, a 1,23,202-sqft land for further expansion of the road, a 52,267-sqft land for widening of the Pune-Mumbai Highway, a 25,220-sqft land for the widening of University Road, a 1,549-sqft land for shifting the Mhasoba Mandir following the construction of a flyover on University Road and a 26,900-sqft land for a pumping station.In December 2000, the college gave 8.46 acres to Sakhar Sankul, the office of the sugar commissioner, but received no land in compensation. Besides, the college gave 30.66 hectares for setting up the Directorate of Floriculture, which comes under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In the most recent instance, the college provided land for a maintenance depot of the Pune Metro, work on which started last year. The state government handed over 28.44 acres from the main campus of the college to the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) although the move was opposed by the college authorities.Communications sent by the college authorities to the Maha Metro as well as the state government, obtained under the RTI Act, show that the college argued if the land was handed over to the Maha Metro, it would hamper expansion plans of the college as well as affect its current academic and research activities.Agricultural education involves experimental learning modules, which require practicals on the fields. Also, availability of land is one of the criteria for grant of funds by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research. If we lose a major chunk of land, then these prospects will take a beating. shrinking of the area will affect the agricultural education model in the entire state, states another communication sent to the principal secretary (agriculture) on March 24 last year.The institutes administration had also pointed out that a whopping 6,133 trees, part of the genetically pure mother plant orchards, would be felled to clear the land for the project. The state government, however, went ahead with the land acquisition, asking the Maha Metro to transplant the orchards elsewhere on the campus.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Seventeen officers from the Army and two from the Air Force were part of the course, which included field visits to the Kolhapur Sugar Factory and also a meeting with Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar.It is a known fact that defence personnel retire early. Since all our time is devoted in defence-related work, such programmes offer a good exposure to the ways in which the corporate world works and provide information about the opportunities available there, said Group Captain Tarun Singha of the Air Force. The programme is aimed at introducing the participants to the nuances and technicalities of the corporate world. Around 30 such programmes are arranged and sponsored by the DGR in several government-run institutes, including IIMs.Speaking about the programmes arranged by the DGR, the senior-most participant of the course, Brigadier Narendar Khajuria, said, It surely does create opportunities for a second career for retired Army, Navy and Air Force officers who are not trained from the industry point of view.

(PTI)Lucknow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll-eve rally and chief minister Yogi Adityanath's invocation of Muhammad Ali Jinnah couldn't save the BJP from a nearly 50,000-vote drubbing in the Kairana parliamentary by-election, which a jubilant Opposition portrayed as ""a prologue to the general election"".Rashtriya Lok Dal nominee Tabassum Hasan, who had the support of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, secured 401,464 votes against BJP candidate Mriganka Singh's 352,173, prevailing by 49,291 votes.The BJP suffered a double blow, losing the Assembly by-election in nearby Noorpur too. Samajwadi candidate Naeemul Hasan, supported by the RLD, Congress and the BSP, polled 94,631 votes to the 88,420 secured by BJP nominee Awani Singh, winning by 6,211 votes.Modi, who does not campaign in by-elections, had ignored Opposition protests to hold a rally in Baghpat, barely 60km from Kairana, a day before the polling to inaugurate the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The Election Commission had ignored Tabassum's complaint that this was virtually a poll rally that violated the model code of conduct's ban on any campaigning 48 hours before the end of polling.The day before Modi's rally, 60-year-old farmer Uday Veer Singh had died of a heatstroke some 20km from the venue while protesting against the state government over sugar mills' failure to clear farmers' dues and against the hiked power tariffs for tube-wells - both key issues at Kairana.In his speech, Modi had tried to placate the farmers saying his government was serious about addressing their issues.The previous week, Adityanath had played on the rhyme between "" ganna"" (sugarcane) and ""Jinnah"" to say: ""Sugarcane is our priority but we won't allow anybody to hang Jinnah's picture.""It now appears that his assurance on ganna did nothing to assuage Kairana's 1.5 lakh sugarcane farmers and his bid to drag Jinnah into the campaign, seen as an attempt to polarise the voters, paid no dividends, either.RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary said: ""The Prime Minister failed to influence the by-election although he went out of his way to hold a rally in Baghpat. I also want to say that the ganna won even though the BJP (tried to stoke) anti-Jinnah sentiments. We hope our alliance will continue.""Senior Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP boss Mayawati didn't campaign in the by-elections.Akhilesh jeered at Adityanath on Thursday. ""I was terrorised hearing the chief minister's statement and couldn't muster the courage to campaign in the by-elections,"" he told a news conference, implying Adityanath was looking to stoke sectarian violence.He added: ""It is the defeat of the government, which cheated the farmers and tried to divide society on communal lines. This is the beginning of the BJP's final exit.""Naeemul, the victorious Noorpur candidate, said Modi and Adityanath had lost both communities as the Muslims felt ""isolated"" and the Hindus felt ""cheated"".""Speak on issues, what use is speaking drivel? They used to say there was no alternative to them, God has brought the alternative before us.... We'll make them bite the dust next year,"" Tabassum said.Om Prakash Rajbhar, backward class welfare minister in Adityanath's government and president of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, outlined the danger that Opposition unity posed to the NDA.""There are nine lakh voters of the RLD, Samajwadis, BSP and the Congress and seven lakh of the BJP. Obviously we had to lose,"" he said.""I hope the government soon implements a sub-quota within the OBC quota to prevent the most backward castes from going over to the rival camp.""Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma put a brave face on the twin defeats. ""Caste politics and local issues dominated the by-elections, but there will be national issues in the general election, and we shall repeat the 2014 victory.""The BJP office in Lucknow wore a deserted look. But in Dehradun, Uttarakhand BJP chief Ajay Bhatt distributed sweets after party candidate Munni Devi defeated the Congress's Jeet Ram by 1,921 votes. The alliance of the RLD, Samajwadis, BSP and the Congress was limited to Uttar Pradesh."

And in that context Xi told Modi that China is looking at enhancing agricultural exports from India including non-Basmati rice and sugar,"" Gokhale said.An agreement was signed between China's General Administration of Customs and India's Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare on Phytosanitary requirements for exporting rice from India to China, one of the world's biggest rice markets.The 2006 Protocol on Phytosanitary Requirements for Exporting Rice from India to China has been amended to include the export of non-Basmati varieties of rice from India.At present, India can only export Basmati rice to China.A couple of business delegations from India and the department of commerce have visited China in the recent months and it is hoped that this will lead to additional imports from India this year, he said.""The Chinese side also said that it will encourage our pharmaceutical companies to register for high-quality Indian pharma products in the Chinese market. This was an important aspect from our perspective because we have been pressing for greater pharma exports into the country,"" the foreign secretary said.In response to the president's suggestion for enhancing financial cooperation between the two countries and also helping trade, the Prime Minister conveyed to President Xi India's readiness to permit the Bank of China to establish its branch in Mumbai,"" Gokhale said.China has been promising to address the issue of trade deficit with India which has been seeking a greater market access for its goods and services in China.Trade deficit with China stood at USD 36.73 billion during April-October this fiscal.India's trade deficit with China has marginally dipped to USD 51 billion in 2016-17 from USD 52.69 billion in the previous fiscal.India has been pressing China to open the IT and pharmaceutical sectors for Indian firms to reduce the massive trade deficit."

But the predominant source is industrially produced and contained in baked and fried food such as fries and doughnuts, snacks and partially hydrogenated cooking oils and fats often used by restaurants and street vendors.In explicit new advice, WHO said excessive amounts of saturated fat and trans fat should be replaced by polyunsaturated fats, such as fish, canola and olive oils.""Reduced intake of saturated fatty acids have been associated with a significant reduction in risk of coronary heart disease when replaced with polyunsaturated fatty acids or carbohydrates from whole grains,"" it said.Total fat consumption should not exceed 30 per cent of total energy intake to avoid unhealthy weight gain, it added.The recommendations complement other WHO guidelines including limiting intake of free sugar and sodium.

It is a conspiracy to endanger my health. I am being shifted to a place where there are no facilities,"" the 69-year-old jailed leader said as he was wheeled out of the Delhi hospital in the afternoon amid a ruckus by party supporters.The hospital said Lalu Prasad's health was stable and he was fit to travel but advised ""regular follow-up and management at RIMS Ranchi"".Rahul spent around 30 minutes with Lalu Prasad but did not tweet any picture of the meeting or express support for the RJD protest against shifting the former Bihar chief minister out of AIIMS.The RJD, however, sought to play up what sources said was a politically significant gesture.

5b280be69855b72a21251ba8,Biofuels policy serves many goals,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/biofuels-policy-serves-many-goals-673521.html,2018-06-05,"The new national biofuels policy, approved by the Union cabinet recently, has an economic rationale and an environmental dimension. The policy is aimed at expanding the sources of biofuels and increasing their production when conventional fuels like oil are becoming costly. The policy will help to boost the production of biofuels like ethanol by allowing their production from a wider range of raw materials. Till now, only molasses derived from sugarcane could be used for ethanol production. The new policy allows it to be produced from sugar beet, corn, damaged food grains, vegetables like potatoes and crop residue such as wheat and rice stubble and urban and rural solid waste. Farmers can sell their excess produce to ethanol-making units with permission from a committee specially set up for the purpose. Ethanol is blended with petrol so that the consumption of petrol can be reduced. Biodiesel is also produced to cut down on the use of diesel.Most of the raw material that can be used as feedstock for biofuels is going waste now. Farmers can gain additional income by selling them to biofuel producers. Biofuels can also be produced at less cost than now. At present, oil companies find it difficult to get ethanol at economical prices because sugar factories sell it to alcohol producers at higher prices. The use of solid waste and crop stubble for biofuel production will benefit the environment as it will reduce pollution. The hazards of burning crop stubble and the problems of solid waste management are well-known. It is estimated that the availability of ethanol, which is about 2 billion litres now, can be increased to over 40 billion litres in a few years if production is scaled up with multiple feedstock. There is a plan to set up 12 major biofuel refineries which will sell ethanol to oil companies.While the policy and the plans based on it are welcome, they may face major challenges. The technology to make ethanol from feedstock other than sugar molasses is still under development. High investments are needed for setting up biofuel refineries. The logistics of and the infrastructure for collection of feedstock from farms, homes and other places are formidable. There is also the likelihood of misuse of the policy. Sugarcane may be diverted for production of ethanol instead of sugar when sugar prices are low. Similarly, food grains may be used for ethanol production instead of surplus or damaged food grains. The same possibility exists with vegetables also. This will have serious consequences on food security. So, the implementation of the policy should be monitored to avoid unintended and undesirable consequences."

The effluents from the mill leaked into the river last week and the water still remains polluted. Molasses is a by-product in the manufacturing of sugar. It is suspected that the chemical overflowed from a tank and got mixed with the water in the river. There are charges that the storage facilities were poor and the mill took in more sugarcane than it could handle. Pollution control norms were, in any case, violated. There was no proper supervision of the processes by the officials of the factory. The state pollution control officials were lax or negligent.Water from the Beas is used for drinking and agriculture in many districts of Punjab. The molasses leakage has polluted the river and the water cannot be used for these purposes till the river is cleaned up and freed of pollution. A 30-35 km stretch of the river has been flushed with water from an upstream dam, but it will take days and weeks to fully decontaminate the water. People have been warned against drinking the water, serving it to cattle, bathing in the river or eating the fish. Fish, water birds and other life forms in the river have died in very large numbers. It was thought that the molasses leak had killed the blind Indus dolphins, a rare species on the verge of extinction, which live in the river. There were only 5-11 dolphins in a 185-km stretch of the river in India and they had disappeared after the leak. But one of them has been sighted after some days and there may be hope for others. The river had 47 gharials, another rare species. Some of them have also been sighted now. Just over 200 of them exist in India and the world. But there are concerns about the health of these endangered species. It will take a long time for all the aquatic life, including fish, to be restored in the river.Such environmental disasters happen regularly but those who cause them are rarely brought to book. Officials who are complicit in the crime also escape punishment. Most of those who own the establishments that cause pollution, like the Gurdaspur mill owners, are politically connected and influential. Unless they are punished and made to pay compensation for the losses, the fight against pollution cannot succeed. Some damage is irreversible. Can a dead dolphin be replaced?"
5b28698c9855b715bfda7973,Gained in Translation: Smell the coffee,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/smell-the-coffee-5085045/,2018-03-04,"South Bengaluru has a cafe culture of great significance. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar) South Bengaluru has a cafe culture of great significance. (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)Once a photographer friend visited me in Bengaluru. He wanted to capture city life, and so I took him around. We visited various cafes during the day but at the end of it, at the last restaurant, he showed me a photo at the cash counter and commented, This man seems to own most of the cafes and restaurants in the city. Not only me, but the cashier and bystanders burst out laughing. For, the picture he pointed to was that of Raghavendra Swamy, a saint god from the 14th century. Most of the cafes and restaurants happen to display his photo near the cash counter.Why Raghavendra Swamy? Simple, the earliest cafes and restaurants were run by Brahmins and most of them had boards that simply said Brahmins Tiffin or Brahmins Coffee Bar. South Bengaluru has a cafe culture of great significance. A large number of morning walkers unfailingly meet up at these cafes, have their daily dose, chat and disperse. They are from all walks of life, cutting across class, creed, caste, religion and even gender. To understand this phenomenon it is necessary to know the history of the coffee cafes.The British first started hotels and restaurants exclusively for themselves in Bengaluru. The first that came up was the Cubbon Hotel at the Cantonment area in 1863. It was typically British in architecture, food and culture. Close on its heel, began the Brownson-Westend in 1887, which continues to run to this day as The Taj West End. Inspired by the British hotels, one Avani Narasingarao started a Brahmin hotel, the Avani Narasingarayara Hotel, in Chikpet. By 1897, there were several hotels run by Brahmins at Chikpet and Balepet.In 1898, a plague struck the city killing 3,000 people in a month. This prompted a mass exodus from Bengaluru. When it subsided, men began returning one by one. To facilitate these men, who were coming back without their families, several hotels sprung up. K T Appanna started the Hindu Coffee Club in 1898. He later shifted it to Chikpet, changed its name to Krishna Bhojana Vilas and began supplying lunch, tiffin and coffee to employees of Athara Kutcheri (court) in horse-driven coaches.By the end of the 20th century, there were several coffee clubs in Bengaluru. While the Cantonment area boasted of several hotels catering to the British, the old Bengaluru area had Hindu Brahmin restaurants that worked in a very traditional manner. Venkannas hotel at Balepet circle had three sections for three different categories  traditional Brahmins, casual Brahmins and one for non-Brahmins. Venkanna would inquire if a person was a Brahmin and even comment on why he had not applied vibhuthi and would provide it himself. It was compulsory for patrons to drink coffee from a height without the lips touching the tumbler. If anyone placed their lips on the tumbler, Venkanna would throw it away.It was Appanna who first introduced tables, chairs and spoons, at his new Krishna Bhijana Vilas at Chikpet in 1908. It attracted several eminent personalities and gradually turned into a cultural centre, becoming a meeting place for writers.In 1913, Iyengars Coffee Club, Gundappa Hotel, Kuntappa Hotel, Annayyappa Hotel became very popular. The Lalbhagh Hotel was started in 1914, also by Appanna. In 1916, a notice issued by the then dewan of Mysore, Sir M Visvesvaraya, stating that subsidies could be offered to start hotels in Bengaluru and Mysuru, attracting many to the hospitality. In 1920, B T Ramayya was the first non-Brahmin to start a hotel; he named it Union Restaurant. He also established six other cafes and was the first to introduce the buffet system. There were around a hundred hotels during this time in Bengaluru and The Hindu Hotels Association also came into existence. It was only in 1951 that it was changed to Bangalore Hotels Association and hoteliers from different religions were inducted as members.By 1977 there were over 3,500 hotels in Bengaluru. In 1980, the Darshini hotels revolutionised the hotel industry, by allowing people to stand and eat. The idea of an open kitchen came into existence.In the last decade, the citys hotel industry has undergone a revolutionary change. Global chains such as McDonalds, Subway, Cafe Coffee Day, Barista and Hard Rock Cafe brands have now taken over the cafe scene. However, none of this has changed the citys early morning by-two coffee culture. The by-two service has been replaced by mini-coffee and the jargon one less, one plus to indicate without sugar and with sugar is common place now. The early morning walkers gather around such cafes, chat, drink coffee and disperse. The heated cultural arguments of yesteryears have been replaced by debates on scams and breaking news.Translated from Kannada by the writer, a well-known poet and translatorFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Has the problem of filing returns been solved?In the initial days, filing of returns was a major issue for the micro and small industries. The portal was slow and even the tax consultants were not sure of what to do. Glitches in the system had become quite a pain for us while filing quarterly returns. A year since its implementation, most of the glitches have been eased out and we are able to file returns regularly.The One Nation One Tax policy has benefited players like us. Thanks to the single tax system, we are able to compete with players outside Maharashtra. Also, currently around 85 per cent of the industries come under the 18 per cent tax slab as against the 28 per cent we had to pay in the past. This has helped us better our bottom line.On the flip side, we want some changes in the present system, which, if they come into effect, will ease our business a lot. The present law holds the buyer responsible if the seller fails to file returns on time. This poses a big risk for us and we want this to be changed. Also, micro industries should be allowed to file quarterly returns.Have you seen a rise in the business of micro, small and medium scale industries? Where do you see business coming from?On an average, we have seen a rise of 25 per cent in our business. This year, most of the members have reported steady booking from April. The year has started on a positive note for us and we hope to see steady growth.The growth is mainly coming from the automobile, infrastructure and power sector. Earlier, the sugar industry had also given a lot of traction to us, but of late, it has slowed down a bit. Most of the automobile OEMs have launched newer variants, which has boosted our business. Similarly, increased investment in infrastructure and captive power plants has helped our members bag newer business. Most of us are looking for expansion, but are unable to do so due to land constraints.How chronic is the land constraint in the MIDC region? Is institutional finance easily available for the MSME sector?In Pimpri Chinchwad, there is hardly any area for expansion for us while Chakan and other regions have become non-viable. The land constraint is a major problem for us. We have sent a memorandum to the industry minister to clear the MIDC area of the unauthorised slums and rehabilitate all the slums in a separate land parcel. If that is done, then we will have enough area to expand.Historically, the MSME sector has a very good credit history as we know that without proper credit history we will not be able to increase our business. The NPA problem is mostly with the bigger players. At a time when our sector is witnessing growth, access to institutional finance is becoming a problem for us, with banks asking for extra collateral etc. We want the banks to lend to us, based on our good credit history.Another issue that we want to be looked into is the rising cost of raw material. There should be a regulatory body to keep a watch on the prices of raw material, which is rising exorbitantly.One of the complaints of the sector was the unavailability of skilled manpower. Has the Skill India initiative solved the problem?The problem of skilled manpower still persists. Traditionally, we like to recruit from the ITIs as they have credibility. However, in Pimpri Chinchwad, there are only two ITIs and thus they are not able to meet our growing demands. We want two more ITIs to be set up here . Also, the ITIs should upgrade their syllabus and introduce modern machinery for their students.While the skill centres have come up, we still feel they are not up to the mark. The government should be more stringent in who is allowed to set up these centres. There should be a quality check on them so that they produce quality resources.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
