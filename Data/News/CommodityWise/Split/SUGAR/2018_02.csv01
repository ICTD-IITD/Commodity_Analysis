(Representational) Centre should announce MSP for dairy farmers: Fadnavis. (Representational)To ensure higher remuneration to dairy farmers, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday urged the Centre to announce a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for them under the Essential Commodities Act. Fadnavis raised the demand at the Niti Aayogs fourth governing council meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Sunday.Highlighting the exploitation of dairy farmers by milk companies and cooperatives, he said, The Centre should announce an MSP for milk procured from dairy farmers by private players and cooperatives, which run the dairies across the country and Maharashtra, under the Essential Commodities Act.In Maharashtra, the state government has fixed a minimum Rs 27 per litre of milk. However, dairy farmers often complain of rampant exploitation by dairies, which refuse to pay more than Rs 17 to 20 per litre.To raise the milk demand and promote milk processing units for skimmed milk powder, the state government has announced a Rs 3 subsidy. To help the dairy farmers and make milk processing economically feasible and generate more demand in the market, the chief minister suggested the Centre should provide a 10 per cent subsidy.In the wake of surplus sugar production in the state and across the country, the chief minister demanded restructuring and extension of tenure for repayment of the soft loans availed by the mill owners. Of the total 31.7 million tonne sugar production, Maharashtra accounts for 10.7 million tonne.Fadnavis also pitched for higher Budget allocations to modernise 3,500 gramin haats (rural markets) across Maharashtra. For this, the Centre should make provisions from the Agro-Infra Fund, he said. Gramin haats are important centres for boosting the rural economy. It is a platform where farmers can market their farm produce. It would help in better remuneration to the farmers and villagers, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(File) EPF benefits should be extended to sugar factory labourers: Federation. (File)Following a recent notice issued by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) office in Solapur, asking sugar factories to extend EPF benefits to labourers engaged in sugarcane cutting and transportation, the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation has written to the Union labour minister requesting him to direct EPF officials in Maharashtra to stop insistence of EPF for cane labourers and not to initiate any coercive action against the sugar factories.Last December, the regional EPF commissioner of Solapur had issued notices to 61 sugar factories in Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur asking them to start remittance of EPF dues. In all, there are eight lakh sugarcane labourers across the state. The notices were issued under the provision of Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.According to sources in the federation, the issue was deliberated at the highest level by the Union government in 2003. However, it has reached an impasse and no action was taken by the EPF authorities then due to alleged pressure from the sugar factory lobby in the state, sources claim. The state has leaders across the political spectrum who are sugar barons and reign control over the federation.The bylaws of sugar factories under the Maharashtra State Cooperative Societies Act,1960 which was subsequently amended, clearly states that it is the responsibility of the sugarcane growers/suppliers/producers to supply the cane up to the factory gate, stated Shivajirao Nagavade, chairman of the federation, an apex body of sugar factories in the state, in his letter to the Union labour minister.He further writes that the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane paid to farmers is inclusive of harvesting and transportation cost. The sugar factories are mere nodal points facilitating the transaction between the farmers and sugarcane harvesting and transport contractor/labour by way of agreeing to request of the farmers to cut the cost of harvesting and transportation and release it to such contractors/labour on their behalf, wrote Nagavade.He has also mentioned that such contractors or labourers are never engaged in any work within factory premises of sugar factories. Their place of work is purely and exclusively in the fields of the farmers and roads culminating at the factory gate, he added.Any insistence of payment of PF for such contractors/labour is not only legally void but gives rise to other dimensions regarding additional burden upon the farmers to bear the cost of the same, timely operation of harvesting and transportation, consequential damage to farmers, he said.Nagavade was not available for comment while Hemant Tirpude, Regional Employees Provident Fund Commissioner in Solapur, refused to comment on the issue. However, EPF officials maintained that action initiated by the Solapur office is based on the directives issued by EPF Delhi office in 2002 that was communicated in 2003. The action is initiated based on letters sent by the EPF office in Delhi in 2003 directing that an employer and employee relationship exists between sugar factories and cane labourers, said an official, requesting anonymity.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

For instance, former telecommunications minister A Raja claims in his newly released book 2G Saga Unfolds that Karti had approached him to meet the owner of a leading telecom service provider and he had obliged Karti, since he was the son of a ministerial colleague.Troubles with difficult guestsWhen Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Agra to see the Taj Mahal, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was not present to receive him, nor did he organise an official function in his honour. Most assumed that Adityanath was simply cool towards the Trudeaus because of instructions from New Delhi. But insiders in Lucknow suggest that it is more likely that the Chief Minister acted on his own volition because of his unhappy experience with the earlier State visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, whom Prime Minister Modi had requested him to look after. The chief minister was irritated that the Israeli couple did not keep to the programme schedule and he had to cool his heels for over an hour. First, Sara Netanyahu took her own time to come down from her hotel room, holding up the visit to the Taj. At lunch,Ms Netanyahu abruptly left the dining table where Yogi was hosting a vegetarian non-alcoholic meal, and said she would prefer to sit outside. A short while later, her husband decided to join her, leaving his host red-faced.For this actress, a ministerial fanMinister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju is clearly a fan of Bollywood actor Huma Qureshi, as seen from his Twitter handle. Recently, Qureshi posted on Twitter asking for a translation of the label for a Japanese spread called Macha, to find out if it had sugar content. The minister, who should have been preoccupied with the Northeast, considering that elections were on there, responded promptly with a tweet saying he would have tried to translate it for her but he was busy in the campaign. He added another explanatory tweet, I am messaging you from a chopper while campaigning. Qureshis name finds an occasional mention in the ministers tweets such as clubbing her name with major stars like Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar and announcing that these actors are looking to do projects in the Northeast. Last year, Rijiju hosted the premiere for the movie Partition 1947 at the government auditorium in Delhi. Qureshi was the movies heroine.On poll tie-up query, ask RahulA journalist who met Sonia Gandhi in Parliament enquired whether the Congress would be joining the BSP in backing the Samajwadi Party for the two by-elections in Uttar Pradesh. Sonia suggested that the scribe speak to Rahul, since she was not the party chief. Even when the newsman reminded her that she continued to be the chairperson of the UPA, Sonia declined to comment. The partys younger generation believes the old guard is responsible for bringing the Congress to its present sorry state. As an example, they cite C P Joshi, who is general secretary in charge of 11 states, including the Northeast, Bihar and the Andaman Islands. During the recent campaign in the Northeast, Joshi was not present in the region for more than a fortnight. The selection of candidates for the Rajya Sabha seats will provide the first clue as to whether there is to be a generational shift in out-look. Rahuls long-time mentor Sam Pitroda is rumoured to be a possible Rajya Sabha candidate. Though he has taken Indian citizenship and has sold off his businesses, his friends say Pitroda is not interested as he prefers acting on his own, not as a team.In party in flux, drifting MLAsIt is difficult to keep track of equations in the AIADMK. E Palaniswami (EPS) is Chief Minister and O Panneerselvam (OPS) Deputy CM, so many assume that EPS is the boss. But in national politics, OPS is superior as he is party coordinator and EPS only co-coordinator. The general secretarys post remains vacant since Jayalalithaas death. Last week in Parliament, among the 37 AIADMK MPs, the only topic of conversation was actor Rajinikanths speech saying he had decided to enter politics because of the vacuum left by Jayalalithaa and ailing DMK leader M Karunanidhi in state politics. Judging from the mood, several rudderless AIADMK legislators are hoping to join Rajinikanth eventually.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Pests like Gram pod borer or Helicoverpa and other diseases have struck the gram crop in as many as 11 villages across Dhule, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon. The incidence of pests and diseases on gram has also crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) here. Crops like wheat, gram, jowar, maize have been affected by diseases and pests in this division.An economic threshold is the insects population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.In Pune division, gram crop in 32 villages across Ahmednagar and Solapur has been attacked by such pests currently. Here too, the incidence has crossed the economic threshold level. Crops such as wheat, gram, sugar cane and maize are expected to cause financial losses to growers due to pest attacks, the report said.Various rabi crops in as many as 19 villages in Latur, seven in Amravati and 41 in Nagpur, among others, are facing a similar situation due to the rain and hailstorm, with the incidence of pests and diseases crossing the threshold at these locations as well.Director of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited Amit Naphade , told TOI that whenever there is a variation in weather  sudden change from cold to warm, unseasonal rain, or no rain in the monsoon months  the incidence of pests and diseases on crops increases.Such changes are ideal for pests and diseases to flourish, since the crops weaken at these times and become susceptible to pest attacks. Most districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and some in north Maharashtra, are facing increased pest attacks following the recent unseasonal rain, with between 30% and 60% wheat crop getting destroyed not just because of rain but pest attack and diseases, said Naphde.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district of Akola said that had the unseasonal rain and hail not affected the region, crop health and production would have been 100% this rabi season. But now, various pests are hounding the crops, he said.Buldhana farmer Milind Pachpande said that between 25% to 50% of onion crop in his field is facing pest attacks. The onion crop is close to rotting in many areas, he said."

Playing on Prime Minister Narendra Modis slogan, he said achhe din were on the cards for the Congress as its party chief, Rahul Gandhi, was showing an inclination to learn and understand the issues facing the nation.Pawar was replying to a barrage of questions posed by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray during a two-hour marathon public interview held here. He ruled out dealings with the BJP when he said he will prefer an alliance with the Congress.Pawar lauded the PM for being a hardworking person and said he was successful as chief minister of Gujarat as he understood the issues there. But when you are running the country, you need to work with a team that understands issues across various regions. I doubt Modi has that team and inclination for building it (the nation).Pawar, who had once said he would never work under Rahul Gandhi, recalled the Congress chiefs visit to the Vasantdada Sugar Institute (VSI) in Pune a couple of years ago. I was there and I saw him (Rahul) asking questions about cane farming and the sugar industry. He exhibited an enthusiasm to learn new things. Any person who has such an urge can improve and do better. He is ready to travel across the country and learn and understand issues, he said.The Maratha strongman referred to the BJP governments demonetization move and said it had caused huge losses for cooperative banks which have a strong presence in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. He produced a letter recently issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the Pune District Central Cooperative Bank, in which it has been said that the old currency notes with PDCC will not be exchanged and that it should show the money as losses in its books of accounts. The issue is serious but Modi is not ready to address it, he said.Pawar questioned the necessity of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. I am not opposed to the project per se. However, it should run between Mumbai and Delhi or Mumbai and Nagpur. Nobody will travel in a bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad, he said.When Thackeray asked him how he viewed the bullet train project and similar such efforts by Gujarati businessmen and politicians to penetrate into Mumbai, Pawar said, Yes, there will be efforts to take control of Mumbai as it is the financial centre (of the country). But these (attempts) will not be successful. Both, you (Thackeray) and I will not allow Mumbai to be separated from Maharashtra.To another question, Pawar said that the local people of Vidarbha do not wish to separate from Maharashtra. Those calling for a referendum on a separate Vidarbha should know that the local people do not support this demand, he added."

He sought legal permission to be shifted to Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital the same day. The court had directed that he remain present before the medical board on Tuesday for evaluation of his health.As per the courts directive, DSK appeared before the medical board at 8am on Tuesday. The board comprised doctors from medicine, surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, cardiology, radiology, chest medicine, psychiatry, orthopaedics and the Sassoon hospitals medical superintendent.These experts examined him independently. Based upon their individual clinical examination and medical investigation reports carried out at our hospital and at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, we have confirmed that Kulkarni suffered acute tiny infarct in the left posterior parietal lobe of the brain, a senior doctor from Sassoon General Hospital said.Sassoon authorities admitted him in the hospitals general ward for treatment around 11.30am.We admitted him as per the directives of the police. He is not being given any special facilities. He is treated as any other patient in the hospital. We will reassess his medical condition after two days, a senior doctor added.Meanwhile, DSKs lawyers moved a plea before the special court that the developer be kept under observation at the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital for 48 hours as advised by the medical board, instead of Sassoon.Special public prosecutor Pravin Chavan told TOI, We strongly opposed the plea, arguing that he (DSK) was required to be under observation primarily for the monitoring of his blood pressure and sugar parameters. The report by Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, while discharging him for attendance before the Sassoon medical board, did not say that his condition was critical. He walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.Chavan said, The report by the medical board showed his condition as normal but, for supervision and observation of his blood and sugar parameters. We brought this fact to the courts notice. The court took a humanitarian view and observed that it was a matter of 48 hours and whether he remained under observation at Deenanath Hospital or Sassoon wont be an issue."

Presently, 32.4% women and 28.5% men are obese, showed the National Family Health Survey-IV (2015-16).In contrast, NFHS-III survey (2005-06) showed that 28% women and 18% men were obese. Most illness is due to lifestyle diseases yet we are not willing to improve our lifestyle. There is a real problem with our attitude, said Travancore Cochin Medical Council vice-president Dr VG Pradeep Kumar.In Alappuzha 37.7% women and 22.1% men were obese, while in Ernakulam it was 34.5% and 38.9% respectively. In Kannur, the figure was equal at 30% each. Idukki had less obese persons with 28.9% women and 26.2% men. Even in Kasaragod, 27.5% women were obese, compared to 24.4% men.

Approaching exams set students off on a stress and panic regime, who end up losing sleep and appetite. While some manage to sail through, others find it difficult to handle. While it may seem beyond your control at time, there are things you can do to keep calm and approach exams with a positive mindset.Take time off to recharge. You could hit the jogging trail, stretch, go for a walk or play an outdoor sport for half an hour. It helps improve blood circulation and get you re-energized. You could also listen to music.While cutting off contact with the outside world may seem like be the right thing to do, you may want to think again. It is important to meet and talk to people just to maintain a balanced perspective on things and keep up your self-esteem.Another mistake students often make is skipping meals and not eating right. Whether it's anxiety or just wanting not to waste time, many students end up paying little attention to their diets during exam season. It's the last thing you want to do. With erratic meals, blood sugar levels can drop and increase anxiety. What you could do is snack on healthy food - like fruits, nuts, cereal, eggs, sprouts, curd - at regular intervals. Keep yourself hydrated, drinking at least 1-1.5 litres of water to flush out toxins the body produces due to stress.A myth that is prevalent among students is that by sacrificing their sleep, they can spend more time on quality study. What they ignore is that good sleep is essential to recover from the day's weariness and to regain the ability to concentrate. Sleep for at least six to eight hours, particularly on the nights prior to exams.You could ditch studies sometimes and choose your favourite room in the house, your local neighbourhood cafe or that special bench in the park for a change.When exams are upon you, its difficult to think about anything else. Place your examination in perspective - the world will not end if you don't do well. Trust yourself and stay positive. Good luck!(The writer is a life coach)"
5b2d6dde9855b723c6f4609e,A Republic of Inhospitality,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/republic-day-muslims-intolerance-beef-ban-bjp-dalits-hamid-ansari-5040847/,2018-01-30,"Dalit protest in Mumbai (Express Photo/Arul Horizon) Dalit protest in Mumbai (Express Photo/Arul Horizon)As India celebrates Republic Day, and the chests of millions of Indians swell with pride at the thought of our immense diversity and imagined military prowess, it is well to reflect on what kind of Republic the country has become. A republican form of government is not merely one in which the head of state is not a hereditary monarch; rather, the modern republic rests on the idea that sovereignty resides in the people, and that the will of the people, as expressed through their representatives, is supreme.What has, however, been critical to the idea of the republic everywhere is the notion of inclusiveness. In this respect, the stories that have been coming out of India in recent years tell a tale that is chilling to the bones, a tale which leaves behind a stench that no amount of sloganeering about Swachh Bharat or even something more than a symbolic wielding of the broom can eradicate.If inclusiveness is the touchstone of a Republic, what is characteristic of India today is how increasingly large constituencies are being excluded from the nation. Muslims and Dalits have been hounded, garroted, and lynched; the working class is being trampled upon; the Adivasi is nothing more than an obstacle course for a mining company. None of this is news, some might argue; perhaps things have only become worse. Such a view is profoundly mistaken because whatever India may have been in the past, it has never been, certainly not to the extent it is today, a Republic of Inhospitality.There are other ways, too, of understanding the pass at which we have arrived. On his last day of office some months ago, the Vice President, Hamid Ansari, warned that Muslims were feeling increasingly insecure in India and that there was a corrosion of Indian values. His successor, Venkaiah Naidu, was dismissive of these remarks and shot back, Some people are saying minorities are insecure. It is a political propaganda. Compared to the entire world, minorities are more safe and secure in India and they get their due. What Naidu, and the Prime Minister, who likewise took a dig at the departing Vice President, failed to understand was Ansaris unease at the fact that India no longer seemed a hospitable place to him. India does not even remotely feel like a hospitable place to the Africans who have been set upon by mobs or to those from the Northeast who have been humiliated and killed since they seem too much like the Chinesealiens all.More than anything else, India has long been a land of hospitality. I use the word hospitality with deliberation and with the awareness that our present crop of middle-class Indians who study hotel management and business administration with gusto will assume that I am speaking of the hospitality industry. There is a different story to be told here about how some of the richest words in the English language have been hijacked for the narrowest purposes. I use hospitality in the place of tolerance since both the right and the left have demonstrated their intolerance for tolerance. To liberals and the left in India, all discussion of Hindu tolerance is merely a conceit and at worst a license to browbeat others into submission. Surprisingly, but perhaps not, the advocates of Hindutva are equally unenthusiastic about proclaiming the virtues of Hindu tolerance. It was Hindu tolerance that, in their view, made the Hindus vulnerable to the depredations of foreign invaders. Hindu tolerance is only for the weak and the effete.What, then, does it mean to speak of the culture of hospitality that has long characterized India and that is eroding before our very eyes, turning this ancient land into a most inhospitable place not only for foreign tourists, African students, and the various people of northeast India but even for the greater majority of its own citizens?We may take as illustrative of this culture of hospitality three narratives that are humbling in their complex simplicity. There is a story that is often told about the coming of the Parsis to India, although some doubt its veracity. As they fled Iran, so the story goes, they were stopped on the border as they sought to make their way into India. The Indian king already had far too many people in his dominions and could not accommodate any more refugees. The cup was full. The Parsis are said to have responded, We shall be like the sugar that sweetens the cup of milk.Those who wish to make the story plausible will offer dates and there may be mention of the political dynasty that prevailed in Western India in the 8th century with whom the first batch of Parsis would have come into contact. The story may well be apocryphal, though if that is the case it is wholly immaterial: its persistence suggests something not only about the tenor of those times but the continuing attractiveness of the idea that those who came to India have each, in their own fashion, sweetened the pot and added something to the country.But there may have been many other registers of hospitality in India, as Tagore sought to explain to his audience on a visit to China. The Mahsud, a Pathan tribe inhabiting the South Waziristan Agency in what is now the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) in Pakistan, were being bombed from the air. A plane crash-landed in one of the villages; the pilot was trying, not very successfully, to lift himself out of the plane which was already on fire. Though the villagers had been plummeted by this very pilot, they ran to the plane and lifted him out of the cockpit; he was wounded, but they nursed him back to health, and some weeks later he made his way back to England.It was a culture indeed an ideal of hospitality, and their notion of dharma, that made the villagers act as they did; however, as Tagore tellingly adds, their behavior was the product of centuries of culture and was difficult of imitation.Though Nehru shepherded the country after independence, it was Mohandas Gandhi more than anyone else who was committed to the constituent idea of the Republic, that is inclusivity and what I have described as hospitality. It is, therefore, fitting that my last story should end with him.Gandhi was a staunch vegetarian, but he often had visitors to the ashram who were accustomed to having meat at nearly every meal.

The project will be executed with an estimated expenditure of Rs 218 crore.Work on the first phase of Ganga riverfront development project in Patna is in the final stages. It entails development of 5.7km-long and 15ft-wide walkway along 20 ghats in the city which will have amenities like decorative street lamps, public lavatories, 500 seating benches and green cover. The project was initially slated to be completed by June 2016, but the deadline was later extended to June this year.Talking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a review meeting on Namami Gange and other schemes with Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and other senior officials, Gadkari said the Narendra Modi-led government has targeted to make 80% of Ganga clean by 2019 by executing numerous schemes under Namami Gange programme.Gadkari said 10 cities have been identified which contribute the most in the pollution of Ganga with Kanpur topping the chart. We have asked UP government to ensure zero discharge from sugar factories, paper mills and other industrial units, which lead to high discharge of pollutants in the Ganga, Gadkari said.He added, Namami Gange is a challenging task as the river flows through multiple states and the level of pollution also varies. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 22,000 crore for different schemes under Namami Gange. The schemes were conceptualised after studying the river pollution mitigation measures in European countries, US and Japan. The best minds and best technologies have been involved in conceptualising and executing Namami Gange programme.On construction of barrages in Ganga under Inland Waterways schemes, Gadkari said, We are not constructing any barrage in Ganga between Varansi and Haldia.Asked about of possibility of running sea planes in the country, Gadkari said, The Centre will formulate a new law for operation of sea planes in the country. The sea planes will land not only on water, but also on ground. If Bihar government requests, we will launch this service here as well."

(Photo: Daniel Stephen) A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen)Sugar mills in Maharashtra are in their third month of crushing, but the Javali unit of the Kisan Veer Satara Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana is yet to start operations for the current 2017-18 season (October-September). The reason: An acute shortage of cane harvesting labourers or oosh thodni kamgar, as they are called in Marathi.Their supply is down 50 per cent this season. Even our mills at Wai and Khandala were, till recently, running at below capacity. We have never faced such a serious labour crisis, complains Madan Prataprao Bhosale, chairman of the cooperative combine, whose all three units are in Satara district.The 2016-17 sugar season in Maharashtra was marked by low availability of cane following two consecutive droughts. Factories could crush just 373.13 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produce 42 lt of sugar, the lowest since 2004-05. This time, there is no dearth of cane, with mills already crushing 525.21 lt and producing 55.68 lt of sugar as on January 22. They may end up crushing over 680 lt, resulting in sugar output rebounding to 72-73 lt.But the current season has also witnessed a significant shortage of harvesting labourers, drawn mostly from Marathwada (especially Beed, Jalna and Osmanabad districts) and North Maharashtra (Nandurbar, Dhule and Jalgaon). The former belong mainly to the OBC (other backward class) Vanjari community, while the latter are predominantly Adivasi tribals. The regions from where they come are drought-prone. The income from harvesting of cane grown in the irrigated lands of western and southern Maharashtra is what sustains them.While cane harvesting usually begins after Diwali, mills negotiate with muqaddams (contractors) for supply of labourers  an estimated 7-8 lakh of them are engaged during the season  well ahead of crushing. The muqaddams, many of whom are erstwhile labourers themselves, are paid a booking amount during June-July. That is when the mills would have made an assessment of their requirement based on the availability of cane. The booking cost, interestingly, depends on the vehicle that the labourers would use to transport the harvested cane from the field to the mill. Thus, booking a bullock cart that can accommodate two labourers  usually a husband-wife team  may cost Rs 50,000. It would be more, around Rs 90,000, for a tractor-trailer capable of bringing 6-8 labourer pairs. The bullock carts are usually owned by the labourers, while the tractor-trailer belongs to the muqaddam.A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen) A mechanised sugarcane harvest at a field in Sangurdi village of Punes Khed taluka. (Photo: Daniel Stephen)The above time-honoured arrangement has, however, taken a huge knock in the current season. Maharashtra mills are reporting an average 15-20 per cent drop in the normal supply of cane harvesting labourers, with some pegging it even higher. The Kisan Veer Satara cooperative reckons that only 3,000-4,000 labourers  out of the 7,000-8,000 necessary for the full-capacity running of its three mills  have joined duty this time.Suryakant Patil, managing director of the Mohanrao Shinde cooperative sugar mill at Miraj in neighbouring Sangli district, estimates a shortfall of over 1,000 kamgars relative to his factorys requirement of 5,000. Our crushing capacity is 4,000 tonnes per day, whereas we are now doing only 3,200-3,600 tonnes. Even that we are managing by getting the existing cane harvesting labourers to work double shifts, as against a normal single 6-8 hour shift. But that will become difficult after February, when temperatures rise and doing two shifts gets difficult, admits Patil.The unprecedented labour shortfall is being attributed to two factors. The first is good monsoon rains (both southwest and northeast) in Marathwada and North Maharashtra, which has spurred local agricultural activity and reduced the incentive to seek seasonal migration work. I had tied up with 15 bullock-cart labourer teams. Four of them returned the booking amount and decided to stay back to tend to their wheat and chana (chickpea) crops. Theres enough water for rabi plantings this time, says Bharat Dongre, a muqaddam attached to the Sahyadri cooperative mill at Karad in Satara and who sources kamgars from Ahmednagar districts Jamkhed taluka.The second reason has to do with the migration of labour to Karnataka and Gujarat, where mills are learnt to be paying more. Maharashtra factories are currently giving Rs 198 for harvesting every tonne of cane to bullock-cart labour teams and Rs 228 per tonne to those working on tractor-trailers, with these adjusted against the initial booking amount. There is a separate 18.5 per cent commission for the muqaddam, payable on the harvesting charge. The muqaddam or tractor-trailer owner also charges (depending upon the distance) an average Rs 650 per tonne for taking the harvested cane to the mill. In case of transport by bullock cart, there is no payment in cash and the labourer only gets the green tops (leaves) that remain after the sugarcane is harvested. The cane tops, which are fed to his animals, are given free of cost.Gujarat and Karnataka mills are paying Rs 30-40 per tonne more. The current agreement (signed in 2014 between Maharashtras sugar industry and the Todni Vahatuk Sanghatana representing cane harvesting labourers) provides for just a 20 per cent rate increase over five years, alleges D L Karad, president of the Maharashtra Sugarcane Cutting and Transport Workers Union. His union, affiliated to the CPM-backed Centre of Indian Trade Unions, has given a notice for termination of the existing agreement. We have called for a strike in the next (2018-19) season demanding better pay, he adds.The threat from labour shortage is, nevertheless, turning into an opportunity for mechanised sugarcane harvester makers. The Kisan Veer Satara cooperative has, in the current season, deployed 15 such machines that would harvest roughly a tenth of the cane supplied to its Wai and Khandala mills. We will add another 26 machines by the next season. These are either our own or procured by entrepreneurs/farmer groups against bank loans, for which we would provide collateral in the form of guaranteed work. Mechanisation is the only way out of labour troubles, states Bhosale.His enthusiasm isnt shared, though, by others. Suryakant Patil notes that while his mill has invested in two mechanised harvesters, they are not being used. These machines need large unbroken tracts of cane. In contrast, most of our cane holdings are small and fragmented, he points out. But Bhosale feels this isnt an insurmountable problem. The equipment manufacturers have made changes to the machines to adapt them to our field conditions. We, in turn, have induced farmers to effect changes to their planting practices, such as maintaining a 4-4.5 feet distance between cane rows, as opposed to the prevalent 3-3.5 feet norm. It does not affect cane yields, even while allowing the machines to easily operate in the fields, he explains.All this is obviously music to the likes of New Holland Agriculture. The Italian agricultural machinery major, which assembles Case IH sugarcane harvesters at its facility in Chakan (Pune), has sold 270-plus machines in Maharashtra since 2010. The machinery owners are charging Rs 338-400 per tonne, more than the Rs 198-228 rate for manual harvesting. But the machines have the capacity to harvest 15-20 tonnes of cane per hour. That would translate into covering an acre in four hours time, which takes two days for a 6-8 labourer-pair team.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He also said sand crisis in the state would be over by the next 15 days.Modi was addressing a pre-budget consultative exercise meeting in which representatives of industry and trade circles, including those from Bihar Industries Association , Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Bihar Builders Association, Retail Foodgrain Traders Association and Motor Transporters Association were present.Of the 15 closed sugar mills in the state, seven have already been handed over to the investors for their revival. However, the repeated efforts of the state government to invite prospective investors for the remaining eight closed sugar mills have not yielded any desired result so far.Modi told the representatives of the industry and trade bodies that the states financial position was strong, as its income receipts is to the tune of Rs 65,000 crore from the devolution of central taxes and another chunk of Rs 37,000 crore from the Centre against grants. He said overall receipts of the state government from its own sources and taxes would be Rs 32,000 crore, including Rs 25,000 crore from the taxes collected by the commercial taxes department.The industry and trade representatives demanded rationalisation of minimum value rate of urban land and lowering of land registration duty from 10% to 6%, as well as amnesty scheme for the realtors involved in disputes arising from violation of building bylaws and other required measures to revive the ailing real estate sector.They also demanded simplification of the filing of returns under GST and exclusion of the sarrafa bazaar (bullion trade) from the GST by bringing it under the handicrafts sector."

Sugar prices (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) declined to Rs 33,000-Rs 33,500 per tonne in January from Rs 36,000-Rs 36,500 in November. They were ruling at Rs 37,000-Rs 37,500 per tonne in September-October last year.Based on the current cane-crushing trends, we estimate domestic sugar production at around 26 million MT (metric tonnes) against an earlier estimate of 25 million MT in December 2017, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice-president & group head, ICRA Ratings.This will translate into an increase in sugar production by 28% in SY (sugar year) 2018 from 20.3 million MT in SY 2017, mainly driven by an expected recovery in production in the key sugar-producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka, supported by relatively better monsoons during 2016 and 2017, he said.Further, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is also expected to touch an all-time high of around 10.2 million MT in SY 2018, supported by higher acreage and better cane variety, resulting in higher yields and recovery rates, Majumdar added.Upward revision in sugar production estimate along with most mills liquidating the produce to repay cane payments resulted in correction in sugar prices in January, he said.While short-term pressure is likely to remain on sugar prices during this quarter, ICRA anticipates prices to stabilise in the coming quarter, although at somewhat lower levels than those anticipated earlier. Closing stocks are likely to remain comfortable at around 5-5.5 million MT, the agency said."

Out of this, Rs 12,690.43 crore is the amount due within 14 days of cane delivery. But as per official data, mills have so far paid only Rs 10,582.34 crore, translating into arrears of Rs 2,108.09 crore.Mills in the state started crushing operations this time on October 25. Significantly, till about a month ago, the unpaid dues werent much. In fact, cane arrears on December 1 were minus Rs 141.01 crore, as mills paid more than what was due before 14 days. The arrears rose to Rs 304.09 crore on December 15 and Rs 851.20 crore by December 29, before spiraling to over Rs 2,100 crore.These would only mount further because we have crushed only 485.93 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produced 49.73 lt sugar till now. Sugar output will top 100 lt this season and we are still barely halfway, said a Bijnor-based miller.Also Read | A new supply problem: Harvesting labour shortage adds to Maharashtra mill woesHe attributed the rising arrears to ex-factory sugar prices in UP crashing from over Rs 37 per kg at the seasons start to Rs 31.50-31.75 now. They were ruling at Rs 34 even in December-end, but have since plunged below Rs 32, which makes paying the SAP near-impossible, he claimed.But the problem isnt limited to UP. Maharashtra mills have also run up arrears of Rs 1,843.80 crore, based on latest data till January 15: Out of the Rs 8,342.20 crore due to growers at the Centres fair and remunerative price (FRP), they have collectively paid only Rs 6,632.93 crore, with some mills paying more than the FRP. On Wednesday, ex-factory rates of S-30 grade sugar from Maharashtra, at Rs 28.5-29 per kg, were even lower than for UP.A miller from Sangli blamed the situation entirely on traders manipulating the market. The 2017-18 season began with sugar stocks of 40 lt. That, together with projected production of 261 lt, translates into total availability of 301 lt. After deducting domestic consumption of 250 lt, the ending stocks on September 30 would be 51 lt.That is equal to 2.5 months of consumption, which is also the prescribed normative opening stock requirement. Given this fine supply-demand balance, how are prices being driven down like this?, the miller pointed out.However, Praful Vithalani, president of the All India Sugar Trade Association, attributed competition among millers to sell as the main reason for prices sliding. Mills believe that sugar output would go up significantly in 2018-19 and, hence, want to sell more now. And when prices are falling like this, traders obviously want to buy less, he noted.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Some of the top athletes such as Olympian Garry Hall have T1DM.Disability rights activist Dr Satendra Singh said some specific reasonable concessions were needed to help such people.

Fixed deposits of farmers are kept with the district cooperative banks. If 30 per cent I-T is demanded on the interest earned on them, it will break the backbone of cooperative movement in the region. The demand for about Rs 50 crore tax from milk cooperatives in Surat district means that I-T department would soon start sending notices to other district cooperatives too, Gujarat Khedut Samaj president Jayesh Patel said.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail has been allowed by the government, but in Gujarat where the cooperatives are strong, foreign retailers would not succeed until the cooperatives are finished.

The Congress and AAP, on the other hand, preferred to stay away.Akali leaders repeatedly raised the issue of truncated farm loan waiver and claimed that the Congress government had wooed farmers with lofty slogans but deceived them on getting power and gave only peanuts to them in the name of farm loan waiver. Party president Sukhbir Badal claimed that in the last 10 months of Congress rule in Punjab farm suicides had increased manifold.Sukhbir while addressing the rally said that there were 20 lakh farm families in the state but Punjab government had provided loan waiver to only 47,000 farmers and now has claimed to extend the waiver to 1.15 lakh families by mopping up Rs 800 crore through increased market fee on crops. On the other hand, the SAD-BJP government during the last 10 years had been providing power subsidy of Rs 6,000 crore per year and much more facilities were being provided to farmers and other sections of society, which the Congress government was taking back.Meanwhile, only finance minister Manpreet Badal paid obeisance at the gurdwara in Muktsar and later accused SAD of not acting as per a directive of Akal Takht by organizing a rally. The Akal Takht at the time of Jor mela in last week of December had asked political parties not to hold conferences at religious functions. Akali leaders, however, justified the holding of conference, saying that religion and politics were inseparable in Akali polity.The Akali Dal and BJP announced to take the core issue of deceiving farmers to the peasantry through poll khol rallies in February. Sukhbir called on the people to give SAD-BJP all 13 seats in the next parliamentary elections so that we could take on Congressmen. Punjab BJP president and Union minister Vijay Sampla too accused the Congress government of meting out injustice to farmers and every section of society.Muktsar MLA Kanwarjit Singh Barkandi claimed that, The Congress during assembly elections had promised sugar and tea, along with atta and dal, but now even flour and pulses are not reaching people.Sidhu-Manpreet as Bunty aur Bubly Former minister Bikram Singh Majithia while taking pot-shots at local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and finance minister Manpreet Badal said both were acting as Bunty and Bubly. This government with Manpreet at the helm instead of making Punjab debt free is making it farmer free, he said.Box: Chandumajra gives slogans against AmarinderPrem Singh Chandumajra, MP, gave slogans like jawana, kisana te mazdooran di lalkar, captain deve saada hisab (Youth, farmers and labourers want Captain to give what he promised), and Punjabia di hun uthi awaz, captain deve sanu hisab (Punjabis, now raise voice for justice)."

She said the technology uses the biological material (ribonucleic acid and locked nucleic acid bases) to directly help healing of the skin without any side effects.Elaborating on the research, Durba said high blood glucose level in diabetic patients was detrimental to the healing of wounds. However, following injury, a transient down regulation of miR200b, which is a specific non-coding RNA (ribonucleic acid which is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes) can be used as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic wound healing that can help in hastening the restorative process.She said the high expression of miR200b in diabetic wound endothelial cells cause for its dysfunction, leading to healing impairment. The research carried out at the IIT shows that diabetic wound can be healed by delivering anti-miR200b locked nucleic acid bases (LNA) at the wound edge. This is the first evidence showing miR200b as a potential therapeutic target for diabetic wound healing, Durba said.Durba said undergoing surgeries can poses problems for sugar patients as well as for the medical professionals conducting these procedures. But once her research is approved following clinical trials, it would bring down the medical complications arising from delayed healing of wounds in the diabetic patients.Recent statistics mention that more than 500 million people across the world suffer from diabetes. Approximately 25% of these diabetic patients develop foot ulcers during their lifetime. Thus, huge diabetic population can benefit from faster wound healing using targeted delivery of anti-miR200b at the wound edge by TNT technology."

This is the most common liver disease among people all over the world. NAFLD includes a spectrum of liver disorders ranging from fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) where there is inflammation of the liver in addition to excess fat. NASH may result in fibrosis or cirrhosis of liver or even liver cancer.According to a study conducted by the Kalinga Gastroenterology Foundation (KGF), ""one in every three persons in Odisha has NAFLD and one in six has NASH"".Gastroenterologist and KGF chairman Shivaram Prasad Singh said on Tuesday that NAFLD was ""very common"" in the state.""A study conducted 15 years ago had shown that at least one fourth of the population in the state had fatty liver disease and one fourth of these patients had developed NASH. The prevalence has gone up further in recent times,"" Singh said. ""The figures are a cause enough for worry as it means that one in six persons in the state are at risk of developing advanced liver diseases,"" said Singh, who is also chairman of Indian National Association for Study on Liver.The study, which was conducted initially on 600 odd patients, has now increased its sample database to 3,500.Those detected with fatty liver were predominantly middle aged males.Most of them were heavy and were already suffering from some sort of bowel problems. The foundation was observing the International NASH Day on Tuesday. The day is being observed world over for the first time on June 12 this year to spread awareness among people on fatty liver.Singh said fatty liver mostly occurred due to an imbalance between the calorie consumption and calorie burning. But, he said that fatty liver was both ""preventable and reversible"". ""Fatty liver can be prevented by avoiding overeating and sedentary lifestyle, limiting junk and fatty food and fizzy drinks and doing regular exercises. Besides, one should keep risk factors, such as diabetes and blood pressure, on check,"" Singh said.""Patients of NASH should control food intake, do regular exercise and avoid fatty food, junk food and cola drinks.

Efforts and discussions have to be persistent,"" said another investor, pointing out that Nitish's delegation this time comprised ""too many officials and too few industrialists"".""While officials and politicians go on tax-payers' money, industrialists have to pay from their own pockets. That Bihar has very few successful industrialists to be showcased is another drawback. Investment from outside comes only after industrialists of the state are shown to be prospering,"" said a local industrialist.Investments in Lalu's time were dismal.After his spectacular victory in 1995, Lalu went to Singapore, London and US and came with 35 MoUs. After that he followed it up with holding a NRIs meet in Patna. He claimed investment proposals of Rs 35,000 crore had come but not a single MoU was taken to its logical conclusion and not a single proposal from the NRI meet reached the ground.During the 15 years of the Lalu-Rabri regime, total investment in Bihar was less than Rs 2,500 crore.Now, local industrialists say, the situation has improved. ""Investment has started to trickle in. Till November 2017 there were proposals of over Rs 5,000 crore. Besides, local industrialists stopped moving out and started investing in Bihar. Nearly all the private sugar mills have expanded. But till now investment proposals are small - from Rs 20 crore to Rs 50 crore. The decision to close down liquor manufacturing units has not helped,"" an industrialist said."

""Nitish Kumar ji sent my father to jail through a conspiracy and now he is tapping my phone calls to put me behind bars,"" Tejashwi said while addressing around 60,000 people at Shri Krishna Yadav High School, Barhi, in Phulparas. He began his speech speaking in Maithili, saying paan (betel leaves), makhana (Gordon nut) and maach (fish) are from the Mithilanchal region were the most popular. He greeted people in Maithili, drawing public applause.He then launched the attack, alleging that central investigative agencies were behind his father, brother, sister and brothers in-law. ""After filing fake case against my family members and relatives, Nitish ji wants to fix me as well,"" Tejashwi said. ""He is tapping my phone calls. But I must say I am not scared of anyone because I am the son of a lion (Lalu). My father never compromised with his ideology.

""Nitish ji had promised smoke from the sugar mill but there is smoke coming from his face after he went with the BJP,"" Tejashwi said. ""Let me assure you that sugar mills will start once the RJD comes to power."" He said the people of Madhubani were his lord and he had come into the people's court where there is no hearing or dates, but direct judgment.The former deputy chief minister said his father Lalu had made Nitish chief minister but, in return, Nitish backstabbed him.He also took a dig at the new BJP office in New Delhi. ""Earlier, we used to hear about five-star hotels, but now five star party offices are coming up. From where is the money coming, Narendra Modi must give an explanation.""He also mocked the Prime Minister on his pakoda remark, saying Modi should at least provide commercial place to start their business.

Agrawal raised the issue pertaining to non-availability of land with the Bihar Industrial Area Development Agency, which causes problems for industrialists willing to set up their units in the state.""The process for making effective use of the land of closed sugar factories has been started and soon these plots will be made available to set up industrial units,"" Modi informed the participants.He said futile attempts to revive closed sugar factories had led to the decision. Sources in the sugarcane industry department said around 2000 acres will become available.During the pre-budget consultation process Bihar Industries Association (BIA) president KPS Keshari urged Sushil, who also heads the finance department, to create a Rs 1,000-crore corpus fund for industrial development in the state of which Rs 250 crore could be allocated in the coming budget itself.Keshari urged that steps be taken to reduce the minimum value register (MVR) for plots on which industries are to be set up, as under the present system, these plots have very high MVR, which leads to high percentage of land cost in the aggregate project cost.MVR is the rate fixed by the government to decide the minimum price of land in different areas and registration of land is done either on MVR or at a higher rate.On behalf of realtors, Building Association of India Patna chapter chairman Bhavesh Kumar urged Sushil to reduce registration rate of flats from 10 per cent to six per cent and he cited the example of other states, where registration rates were in the range of 4 to 6 per cent of the flat value."

The petitioners have claimed that according to the Bihar Minor Mineral Rules, the government does not have right to fix the price of sand. The petitioner's counsel Mrigank Mauli told the court that fixing of price has adversely affected the sale of sand, hampering construction activities in the state.Justice Saran observed that due to shortage of sand unemployment has increased and labourers are forced to migrate from the state.""Earlier there was rationing on sugar also,"" he observed. ""At that time people had to face more difficulties in buying sugar. However, with sugar now being openly sold in the market, it is easily available without any constraint.""Naresh Dikshit, counsel of the state's mines and geology department, told the court that fixing the price was necessary to keep tabs on sand mafia flourishing in the state. Though there has been some problem in procuring sand, things will be alright in due time, he added.Dikshit further told the bench that according to Section 48 of the new Bihar Minor Mineral Rules, 2017, fixing price of sand is legal.The court then directed the state government to reply on all these issues by February 2.On November 27 last year a division bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Anil Kumar Upadhyay, while hearing a petition filed by Puspa Singh and nine others challenging the new sand policy of the Bihar government which came into effect from December 1, 2017, put a stay on the new rules of sand sale and mineral policy (the Bihar Minor Mineral Rules, 2017).The government had framed the new rules under the power conferred upon the state as per Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, to regulate the mining and selling of sand and stone chips in Bihar. The new rules triggered protests from a number of firms and individuals engaged in mining and sale of minor minerals."

Those days, a few brands such as Kwality Walls, Vadilal, Amul, Arun, and Joy held sway, but opportunities were aplenty. Having worked across the Southern states as part of his previous job, helped Jaganath expand his young company's network. The same year, Dairy Classic Ice Creams moved to its own place.Market meltGradually, the company grew from a tiny entrepreneurial venture, to a sizeable ice cream enterprise, all along trying to break the puzzles that the Indian market threw at it.While India has seen its fair share of ice cream demand, the market is still nascent at Rs 10,000 crore, which includes both organised and unorganised players at a 35:65 ratio.India has amongst the lowest annual per capita consumption of ice creams globally at 300 ml. This compares to a measly amount, when compared with the US at 22 litres, or even China at 8 litres.Balaraju lists certain critical factors. ""Power shortage and outage is beyond our control. 'No electricity' impacts temperature maintenance of ice cream freezers. Also, lack of efficient cold chain systems in Tier-II cities, and even refrigerated trucks for transportation have posed a challenge,"" he says.However, over the past five years, India's ice cream sales volume has increased at a CAGR of nearly 13%, the fastest in the world, and is expected to nearly double from 334.4 million litres in 2016, to 657.2 million litres by 2021. And the market is likely to be worth over $1.6 billion by then, according to market research firm Mintel's Ice Cream Global Annual Review 2017.Meanwhile, in a bid to safely foray in this market, Dairy Classic Ice Creams has successfully been able to use different conventional methods such as insulated boxes with chill pads and eutectic freezers, which initially enabled it to make a mark in Tier-II cities, before actually tapping Bengaluru.Another challenge that the Indian market is prone to, is battling low off-season sales, due to misconceptions surrounding consumption of ice creams during cold and wet seasons.""During winters, ice cream, with its rich source of protein and fats drawn from milk, offers energy and nourishment that could keep one warm,"" informs Balaraju, adding that the company has also worked towards sensitising dealer-partners about de-icing techniques to maintain the freshness and quality of their products.With urbanisation, better per-capita income, and cold chain infrastructure development, the Indian market is improving. Even eating habits around ice creams are on the up.Breaking the industry iceThe industry across the globe has three generic ice cream flavours, namely vanilla, chocolate and strawberry, with vanilla contributing for maximum consumption; then follow the other flavours. All these are sold as variants  cups, sticks, and take-home packs, among others.Dairy Classic Ice Creams began selling Dairy Day with 3-4 variants in each category  cups, tubs, take-home packs, sticks, cones, and so on.""Those days, we had 20 SKUs, while today we have 150 SKUs, with around 30 flavours. Within that we create different shapes, formats, packs, and combinations. Around 10-12 new SKUs may be rolled out every year,"" says Jaganath.But what's different, one might ask. ""While differentiators in terms of flavours may not be much, the strength of ingredients, taste, quality, packaging, and pricing, have been the turning point of our business. Our proposition is value for money and mass (in the Rs 5-Rs 50 range),"" he says.Unique flavours such as black currant, and offering traditionally prepared 'Matka Kulfi', packed with a stainless steel spoon, '2-in-1' slices, and a 'No Sugar Added' range, have been runaway successes.So while Amul and Kwality Walls reign supreme as national players, Dairy Day has been able to hold some fort in its regional playground of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, achieving Rs 30 crore in its tenth year of operation, in a largely capital-intensive industry.From the beginning, the company has operated via retail sales, selling through general trade, modern trade, and a little bit through ecommerce. Today, it partners with 25,000 retailers.""Designing our expansion plan according to our borrowing power is what dictated growth along our ten-year journey,"" Jaganath says.In 2013, the company set up a new plant of around 65,000 sq feet, over 1 lakh sq feet of land, at Harohalli, Kanakpura, investingRs 30 crore through a mix of finance and own funds, which helped it to achieve Rs 100 crore turnover in 2015-16. ""We were on fast-track mode. We had production capacity and selling ability. With more scope, we had to add more infrastructure in order to cater to our expansion plans, and also to grow inside of the factory and outside  for instance, we provide retailers with reefer freezers,"" he says.In October 2016, the company went for private equity funding, with Motilal Oswal Private Equity investing around Rs 110 crore, and holding a minority stake. With that investment, Dairy Classic Ice Creams added another 30,000 sq feet facility at Harohalli in April 2017, taking its total capacity to 1,25,000 litres a day.Cream of the industryKeeping quality high with value, and the drive to grow has kept Dairy Classic Ice Creams refreshed on its march. Even in terms of sourcing, it has taken a practical approach, assured of quality. For instance, it sources milk from the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and a private company in Bengaluru. In a few months, it plans to set up two centres for milk collection directly from farmers. Also, it uses purees and pulps of seasoned fruits, directly sourced from known companies in those businesses.""We take care of the total knowledge of ice cream manufacturing  from formulation of a product's specifications and requirement of the best machinery, to buying the latest technologies and updating each day's requirement  on our own,"" Balaraju says.Today, the company's turnover stands at Rs 150 crore, growing at 40% CAGR. It is aiming at Rs 500 crore in turnover by 2021. Meanwhile, it also plans to tap all the South Indian states, with some share of Maharasthra too, with a focus on over 50,000 outlets. Dairy Classic Ice Creams is enjoying its success slowly, yet enthusiastically, just like a child would his or her ice cream."

The strength of Indus Dolphins in Pakistan is estimated be around 1,800, said Kumar.Meanwhile, gharials remained unaffected after the spill, the official said.""Gharials are safe. We have spotted around 16 of them in upstream of Beas river,"" said Kumar, adding that the strength of Gharials is estimated to be 47.""There has been considerable damage to aquatic fauna because of molasses getting spilled into the river,"" said Kumar.Tonnes of fish died because of reduced oxygen level in the water, he said. ""Even the fish seeds (fertilised eggs) have also damaged in this incident,"" he said.As many as eight to ten varieties of fish, including catfish, common carp, died because of pollutants in the river, he said.Meanwhile, fish continued to die as water containing pollutants reached Tarn Taran and Ferozepur districts, he said.""Yesterday, water mixed with molasses reached Rajasthan feeder canal. An alert was issued to villagers not to use canal water for drinking purposes,"" Kumar said.However, he said the situation has improved to a large extent in Beas following the release of fresh water.The Punjab government on Friday ordered the seizure of security deposit worth Rs 25 lakh of the sugar factory.It had ordered the sealing of the Chaddha Sugar Mill of Kirri Afgana in Gurdaspur from where molasses leaked into the Beas and caused the death of fish.A probe was ordered into the incident and the report of which would be submitted within three days."

There are nearly 17 lakh voters in the constituency with a significant number of Muslims, Jats and Dalit voters.RLD party worker Abdul Hakeem Khan said he had never seen an election in which the ruling party was being challenged by a joint opposition.""This is the beauty of our democracy,"" he said.The constituency fell vacant after the death of BJP MP Hukum Singh, whose daughter Mriganka Singh is now the party's candidate for the bypoll. She is fighting Rashtriya Lok Dal's (RLD) Tabassum Hasan, who is supported by the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.The opposition hopes that by consolidating anti-BJP votes, they will repeat the success of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections, where the ruling party suffered an unexpected defeat.The withdrawal of candidature of Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan from the fray and his joining of the RLD has only added to the opposition's confidence.The ruling BJP, on the other hand, is making extra efforts to retain the seat to try and send a strong message to voters, party cadres as well as the opposition parties -- that the drubbing in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections was an aberration, and that it was still strong in western UP.""The results of the May 28 bypoll may set the tone and tenor for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" Rajesh Kumar Saini, manager of a hotel on the busy Shamli-Panipat road, said.Khan exuded confidence that ""Kairana's daughter-in-law Tabassum Hasan will defeat Kairana's daughter (Mriganka Singh).""The Yogi Adityanath-led state government has left no stone unturned in campaigning for the bypoll. He along with his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya campaigned in Saharanpur and Shamli.Apart from them, the BJP has thrown in at least five state ministers into the 'fight for Kairana'. They include Dharam Singh Saini (minister of state for Ayush), Suresh Rana (sugarcane development minister), Anupama Jaiswal (basic education minister) Surya Pratap Shahi (agriculture minister) and Laxmi Narayan (religious affairs, culture, minority welfare, waqf and Haj minister).Of these, Saini and Rana are MLAs from Nakur and Thana Bhawan assembly segments, respectively of the constituency. Jaiswal is the minister in charge of Shamli district, while Surya Pratap Shahi is the minister in charge of Saharanpur.""Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has been roped in since he hails from a farming background,"" a senior UP BJP leader said.BJP MPs Sanjiv Baliyan, Raghav Lakhan Pal, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar and Kanta Kardam have also actively campaigned for Mriganka Singh.The SP and Congress, however, termed the line-up of UP ministers as a sign of ""party jitters"".According to the locals, the major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers.RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan had accused the BJP-led state government of resorting to divisive politics.""Sugarcane growers in the region are feeling the maximum amount of pain, as no payments have been made to them by the state government,"" she told PTI, rejecting the official claim that the dues from sugar mills were being cleared.The issue was also raised during an election meeting of state minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, who said that the dues accumulated from the time of the past governments had been paid out, and the rest would be settled soon.""In Uttar Pradesh, 10,828.59 lakh quintals of sugarcane were purchased by sugar mills from farmers during the BJP government in 2017-18, as compared to 6443.41 lakh quintals under the Samajwadi Party government in 2015-16. Similarly, Rs 21,186.56 crore payments were made during the BJP government in the state in 2017-18, in comparison to Rs 11,841.34 crore made during the SP government in 2015-16,"" BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said.Divergent views also emerged on the reported 2016 exodus of Hindu families from Kairana.""The area is adjacent to Panipat district in Haryana. The labourers (both Hindus and Muslims) from the area go to the neighbouring state to work in the industries there. They go in the morning and return in the evening,"" Hasan said while rejecting the claims of any such exodus.The RLD leader said the locked houses, even of Muslims who had gone to Panipat for work, were photographed and used as a ""propaganda"".""In Kairana, both Hindus and Muslims live in peace,"" she added.BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, on the other hand, said, ""The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped now. But hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment before the 2017 UP Assembly elections"".Apart from Kairana, bypoll to Noorpur assembly constituency in the state will also be held tomorrow."
5b2e76329855b74d9fcd4ef8,"Still bright, in the forest of the night",https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/still-bright-in-the-forest-of-the-night-211105?ref=west-bengal-new-stry,2018-02-25,"Arghya MannaCat-astrophe: While locals in the Sunderbans devise methods (above) to keep the tiger away, the big cat learns to see through them over timeTo the southeast corner of the Sunderbans, on the banks of the Vidyadhari river, lies Jharkhali village. In recent times, the mangrove islands that constitute the Sunderbans - most of which lies in Bangladesh and part in Bengal - have be-come a huge hit with tourists and research-ers. Jharkhali's real claim to fame, rather infamy, is its tigers.And so we set out for Jharkhali to check for ourselves.The chhoto haati or tempo from Canning takes two hours. By the time we reach, it is afternoon. After checking into a desolate looking lodge, we step out to explore. We know nothing of the place save the name of a contact's contact. Quick to spot an outsider, one of the locals, a middle-aged man, starts chatting, volunteers to accompany us to the jetty - ""jettyghat"" in local parlance - and in exchange, bums a smoke.There are trees growing on either side of a raised road. Would those be... Before we complete the sentence, our self-appointed guide replies cheekily, ""Yes. Mangroves. The ones to your right are natural. Those to the left are man-made."" A closer look reveals a difference in growth pattern. Also, on either side of the road are contiguous nylon nets.And where do the tigers come from? Between puffs, the man points to a biggish tear in the net. Seeing our incredulity, he explains how wild animals have an aversion to the net. The Royal Bengal tiger is not scared of it, but because it is something that impedes free movement, chances are it might decide to change direction when the net comes in its way. ""And then again, it may not - as the hole is proof,"" he says, points jettywards and walks away.At the jettyghat we are told to come back later - it is off-season and there are no boats around at the moment. With time on our hands and no big cat in sight, we invoke the contact's contact - Ratan Biswas.Ratan is well known in the area, even wields some clout. It is from him that we learn about the Dobanki Camp, a watchtower manned by forest department officials. First, they have to prevent indiscriminate felling of mangroves. It is a different matter that the government has cleared miles of it to build a hotel, a park and whatnot. Second, everyone venturing out into the islands to fish or collect honey has to register with the authorities here and procure a licence. The number of licences granted comprises only a fraction of the total applications, a step taken to protect the natural habitat. In the last 5-10 years, construction of mobile towers has led to the destruction of countless hives, but that's different. Finally, should a tiger enter the human habitat, it is the job of the Dobanki officials to monitor its movement.Thus, chatting, we step into a boat that will take us into the backwaters. Bikram, the chap ferrying us, is no more than 16 and leers fixedly at the packet of cigarettes.The entire waterway is covered on either side with more nylon net. We are inching close to the ocean, the waves are towering... We ask Bikram if he isn't scared of the rough waves or the maneaters lurking. He shrugs and empties half a packet of gutka into his mouth, and suddenly we realise we can count every rib of his copper body. This is someone who has lived with hunger for so long that he has learnt to be unafraid of all else.We learn from him that most of his friends catch fish and work as boatmen to support their families. Ratan confirms, in hushed tones, how the girls of the region doggedly pursue higher education. The boys, he says, almost always go astray, some even turn smugglers. In fact, that's what happened with him as well, but that's another story.There is no tiger in sight yet. We ask Ratan if he has ever seen one. He laughs and starts to tell us about what is apparently one of many such experiences.""A few of us were at Dobanki when a tiger pounced on us. One swift movement of its foreleg and one of our mates went flying. Then it came to face me."" He continues, ""I had an axe in my hand but I did not strike.""According to Ratan, he remembered the words of village elders. They always said that when faced with a tiger, striking first was never a wise move. After all, most humans would not have strength enough to wound a tiger fatally. So what would happen is, the creature would gauge from the nature of the blow the strength or lack of strength of its adversary and launch a ferocious attack.Were they not wearing tiger masks as precautionary measure? Ratan nods. The masks, he says, were once considered a worthy safety measure, but over time and with close human interaction, tigers had learnt to see through them. ""They possibly considered it an insult to their intelligence even,"" he says.As Bikram rows on, we look outwards at the land, the aerial roots pushing out of the ground like stalagmites. Ratan tells us that the tigers in these parts have very developed leg muscles. Mother Nature created them thus to negotiate the hardy undergrowth of the region.We have deviated from the Dobanki story. So how did Ratan save his skin that day? ""I screamed my lungs out. I had been told it annoys the tiger."" Or it could be luck. It could, he agrees.But had he ever witnessed a tiger kill? Ratan draws a deep breath and starts again.""One time we were at the local sugar mill when a woman came and told us that her husband had been carried away by a tiger. He had been exploring one particular stretch of the backwaters. It had yielded a good catch of fish the last couple of days and he had gone back for more.""Even when death is certain, in case of licence holders, it is imperative that the body be found. Reason: no body, no compensation. The next of kin have to go back to the site of kill and retrieve either blood-stained clothes or the body or a body part to prove the killing and claim the money.Continues Ratan, ""Typically a search party comprises 30-40 people. This is because after a kill, a tiger becomes particularly excited and ready to rampage. There is no truth in the claim that after a kill it is satiated and is, therefore, relatively harmless. There were only six of us, so we started getting more people on board.""But why would so many people risk their lives knowingly for others? Ratan explains that is how the village set-up functions. Economic interdependence prompts social connectedness.By the time the search party reached the spot - just opposite the Jharkhali jettyghat - it was twilight. Says Ratan, ""We spied half the body, face down in the mud. We had barely taken in the scene when one of us fell to the ground and another yelped in pain as he had one eye gouged out. The tiger had found us. At this point, two others took up sticks and started to hit the tiger. The tiger pounced on both and killed them. The others started retreating but not before the tiger had swooped on one and made away with him. So there we were with three bodies, when we had gone to fetch one.""Boatride over, we headed for Dobanki on Ratan's bike. There is a tiger rehabilitation centre there; nothing scientific, we are told. The state fisheries department is building fishery and agricultural training camps here.At the camp, we meet junior forest officer Swapan Kumar Mondol. More tiger stories tumble out of his kitty. He points to the spot where we are standing and says, ""Last year, Poila Baisakh, a tiger was standing here."" Now, forest officials are not allowed to shoot or even tranquillise the animal if it does not strike. Says Mondol, ""It kept roaming around and I had to follow it around."" Once it was dark, someone turned on the generator and just like that, the tiger fled.But the best tiger story is from the 2016 Assembly election day. Election means fear of rigging, which means extra vigil. An IPS officer from Delhi, two Election Commission officials, police - Jharkhali was swarming that day. Says Mondol, ""We were alert to any kind of political chaos and agitation, but two tigresses stole the show. They chose that very day to amble out. Ballot box was forgotten, rigging was forgotten. All day, all attention was on those two ladies."""

Ball-tampering will exist as long as the most thrilling part of fast bowlingreverse swingexists. There are no two ways about it. From using rough band-aids to sugar candies, players have only got smarter to keep hard-to-dissect craft intact. What made the Cape Town incident receive worldwide outrage was the manner in which Smith admitted to hatching a plan during lunch break and got a junior player to do the dirty job of applying a foreign object on the ball.What about the desperation? Was it just a team throwing whatever it could to keep intact its unbeaten in South Africa? Or did it have something to do with incidents that happened during the first two Tests?At the centre of the controversy is David Warner, the designated vice-captain, who received no penalty from the International Cricket Council for what happened in Cape Town. It has been widely reported that the opener was the chief orchestrator, who sold this idea to the leadership group which Smith is part of, and let Cameron Bancroft carry out an offence that put the integrity of the entire team in question.Australians are known to start the process of mental disintegration even before a ball is bowled. Steve Waugh, who started this practice of targeting the oppositions main player under pressure by aggressive talking, now says that Smith & Co have failed our culture.They say there is this supposed linewhich only Australians claim to seethat cannot be crossed. And this is where it gets interesting.Sometime during South Africas series against India, their captain Faf du Plessisa repeat offender of ball-tamperingwas asked if he had received any congratulatory message from Australia for defeating the No 1 ranked Test team. In the stone-faced humorous tone of his he had said, Unfortunately, there are not many friends for me from that part of the world. And you knew what was coming. Two top-quality sides, packed with world-class bowlers, each chasing historyit had to be high-voltage.From the moment Australia landed in South Africa, they havent shied away from using the media to unsettle the opponents. They spoke about how to unsettle Kagiso Rabada so that he does something which earns him enough demerit points from the ICC and he misses a Test. In Port Elizabeth, the plan almost came to fruition, when the pacer ran into Smith and the ICC gave him three demerit points to rule him out of Cape Town. Rabadas successful appeal against the ban actually highlighted the loopholes and inconsistencies in the ICCs process of dealing with these cases.You have to understand that the Code of Conduct is devised by board members and with each one part of their respective boards, there is always space for power lobbies to be in play. In this case, the match referee had given his verdict, but it was his judgment. What appears to be a deliberate attempt to one can seem to be casual to another. It has happened in the past and will happen in the future too, if we dont find a consistent level to deal with behaviours, says an ICC official.Of course, Warner wasnt the only one on the prowl. Though his reputation as a serious sledger was well known, in Durban he was provoked by South Africas Quinton de Kock. The wicket-keeper brought up Warners wifes old relationship with a former rugby player, which made the Australian lose his cool and engage in a quarrel. It could easily have resulted in a brawl had Tim Paine not intervened.In Port Elizabeth, a couple of Cricket South Africa officials posed with a mask that made fun of Warners wife Candice and were subsequently suspended. And with the crowd too chanting her name to provoke Warner, those present there revealed how the tension between the sides was getting higher by the minute. It is unusual for an Australian side to be subjected to a behaviour that they dont experience often. At times, things were getting very personal, and the umpires were constantly reminding the sides of the responsibility they have on their shoulders. But these days, it takes little takers, says an ICC official who was present at the spot.It is with this background that Warner entered Cape Town. Pushed by the opponent, ridiculed and jeered by the crowd, it is moments like these when the competition is intense that athletes are pushed to the limits. Some savour such moments, some sulk and some hate losing. Australians over the years have always hated when they are pushed to the brink and there is no way back. Perhaps, this is what drove them to madness. Off the field incidents may not be reason enough to indulge in ball-tampering, but when things get personal, players might lose the ability to judge what is right and what is wrong.The ICC for various reasons hasnt really showed enough courage when it comes to punishing players on behaviour issues.The Rabada verdict would have stayed had events in Colombo too received similar punishment. But despite Bangladeshs Shakib al Hasan bringing the game to disrepute, the ICC didnt hand him a punishment that could be a lesson. After a level, because these are bilateral series, the relationship between boards, broadcast factors all come in. And with huge money coming from TV rights, those in charge think twice before handing punishments, especially if big names are involved."

We suspect illegal sale of other items like rice, flour and sugar also,"" another resident said.The police have assured steps but people were not ready to relent and demanded Burman's arrest, sources said.As policemen visited the dealer's house, it was learnt that he has gone into hiding since morning.""Burman's cell phone was switched off and he has fled the village. It seems he had apprehended some trouble,"" said a source.Puchukutu claimed that he was not involved in the case. ""The ration dealer had hired my auto. I have no idea where he was planning to take the kerosene oil,"" he said.The police have started an investigation. ""If necessary, we will also speak with the officials of the food and supplies department to obtain more information about the ration dealer,"" said a police officer."
5b2e7ab49855b72640115e10,Men and threat of thyroid troubles,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/655389/men-threat-thyroid-troubles.html,2018-01-23,"If you're a man dealing with sudden weight gain, forgetfulness, fatigue, hair loss, unexplained infertility, have your thyroid checked out to see where you stand.Thyroid diseases - be it hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism - although commonly seen in women, are frequently being diagnosed in men, too. Statistics reveal that women are eight times more at risk of developing a thyroid disorder, but the fact is that we cannot rule out the threat it poses to men. It is a myth that men do not suffer from thyroid and one that needs to be busted.Your thyroid gland is shaped like a butterfly that sits low in the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. The thyroid gland makes and stores hormones that help regulate metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and the rate at which our food is converted into energy. The hormones produced by the thyroid gland are essential for the proper functioning of virtually every cell in the body.Although it is a disease that is easy to detect and less expensive to treat, the symptoms go unnoticed especially by men, which impacts their overall health and well-being. Typically, Indian men tend to brush off fatigue and hair loss as signs of stress, while dry skin and lethargy are dismissed as not so important.People who have a history of thyroid problems in their family would be at greater risk of thyroid abnormalities. Genetics play a role to help detect the level of thyroid hormones. If men show such signs, it's time to check their thyroid levels.Hypothyroidism - meaning a low thyroid function - is a common disorder where the thyroid gland releases inadequate amounts of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 into the body. Generally, thyroid diseases are seen in elderly men but there are exceptions to the norm. A few symptoms like hair loss, decrease in muscular strength, even erectile dysfunction and decrease in sex drive are more frequently seen in men.Hypothyroidism in men is linked to reduced sperm volume and motility. It can also cause low libido and erection problems. Hyperthyroidism in men (Graves' disease) is linked to fertility issues, as well.To diagnose hypothyroidism, your endocrinologist will check your thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone levels with a blood test.Thyroid requires care and an early diagnosis. Subclinical hypothyroidism is silent as a disease. In it, thyroid level falls below normal and is being increasingly diagnosed in the Indian population.The corrective treatment usually involves thyroid hormone replacement. It is an effective treatment that can avoid complications.Corrective measures Find an integrative and functional doctor who understands the nuances of the thyroid, uses comprehensive testing and practices personalised medicine. Don't suffer in silence. Talk to your doctor about all of your symptoms, and don't be afraid to discuss what you are going through. Your symptoms are not all in your head. Take the doctor/endocrinologist recommended tests. Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet, get proper sleep and make changes that will create a lifetime of good health. Consuming the recommended iodine amount as a part of a balanced diet of nutritious fruit and vegetables is a first step towards maintaining your thyroid health. Avoiding smoking and limiting your alcohol intake can have a positive effect. Follow a regular exercise system to maintain sound body functions and compliment your medication regime.While testing is important, you can resort to a more natural approach (besides the medicinal dosage). The natural approach can support the thyroid gland and fertility. Start with diet changes.Foods such as cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and okra (ladies' finger) should not be consumed raw. Cooking destroys the goitrogens. Take soy products preferably in the night if you are on thyroid medications.Studies have shown that frequent endogenous insulin spikes can damage the thyroid gland. Sugar spikes cause the adrenal glands to secrete excess cortisol which suppresses the pituitary function and that can affect the thyroid gland.Don't let the thyroid function create a dysfunction in your life. Make sure to keep a regular check of your thyroid levels, stay healthy, stay conscious!(The writer is Consulting Endocrinologist, St John's Medical College & Hospital, Bengaluru)"

Apart from the physical problems that obesity brings with it, there are a number of medical problems that occur which lead to decrease in quality of life and ultimately reduced our lifespan. In fact, the WHO has officially classified obesity as a disease.What we need to understand is that our weight is controlled by our hormones, which is why most people maintain the same weight for years. People who are affected by this disease have a genetic propensity for obesity.Then there are environmental triggers like stress, disordered sleep or untimely meals, pregnancy, ageing and many drugs or medicines which act upon the patient and cause weight gain. Once weight gain happens, the fat cells itself act like a hormone-secreting organ and sustain obesity.Once we understand that obesity is a result of hormonal disturbances, we will realise that reducing weight is not a simple arithmetic of calories in and calories out. It is true that diet modification, exercise and medicines can help in weight reduction but the total weight loss is usually only 10-15%. For somebody who is only 10-15 kg overweight this is more than enough.But for someone who needs to lose around 40-50 kgs, an external intervention like bariatric surgery is necessary as hormonal disturbances are more in such patients.The other thing that to understand is that obesity gives rise to many other medical problems. The main diseases that are a direct result of obesity and hormonal disturbances are Type 2 diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, high BP, sleep apnea, excessive snoring, fatty liver and later on cirrhosis, PCOD and infertility, knee and back problems.When obesity is treated, these diseases come under check and in a majority of the patients, disappear. Diabetes is one big example.Diabetes disappears in a majority of obese patients who are treated with bariatric surgery. In fact, the need for medicines and insulin to control blood sugar goes down in the first few days after surgery. Even before significant weight loss occurs and in appropriate patients, the benefit is long lasting - more than 10-15 years.There is a large body of research which has shown that to achieve considerable control over diabetes, bariatric surgery is better than optimum medical treatment and intensive lifestyle modification under professional supervision.Similarly, sleep apnea or OSA is completely cured in 95% of patients after bariatric surgery. Most patients see improvement in a week after the operation. Likewise, high BP, high cholesterol, PCOD and all other problems experience improvement after surgery and the effect is sustained.Safe procedureIt is believed that this surgery is extremely complex. Well, any operation carries a certain amount of risk, no matter how small it is. Part of the risk is related to anaesthesia, mostly due to the patient's weight and other medical problems like diabetes, sleep apnea etc and the other is related to the operation itself.Bariatric surgery, if conducted in a well-equipped centre by a good surgeon is extremely safe. In fact, patients who have diabetes or sleep apnea due to obesity are the ones who need this operation the most and they are the ones who will gain the best results.In conclusion, it is important to understand that obesity is not a self-afflicted condition and the affected person is not to be blamed - it is a complex disease caused due to hormonal imbalance.Mild overweight and obesity can be effectively managed with diet and lifestyle modifications alone if maintained for a long period of time, whereas, severe obesity, especially with other diseases like diabetes, OSA, high BP, PCOD etc. is more effectively managed with bariatric surgery.Scientific bodies dealing with guidelines about treating diabetes now recommend that bariatric surgery should be considered early for the treatment of the condition in appropriate patients because it gives better results than lifestyle changes and medication.Effective treatment of obesity through bariatric surgery leads to improvement in all these diseases, often even before there is sizable weight loss. This leads to massive improvement in the quality of life and in the long term, an increase in the lifespan by 5-10 years.(The writer is Chairman, Bariatric Division, Manipal Hospitals)"
5b2e7c179855b72640115e56,"Vegetarians, here are your proteins",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/669889/vegetarians-here-your-proteins.html,2018-04-13,"One of the most frequent questions that vegetarians face is, ""You're vegetarian, but where do you get your protein from?"" In spite of there being a wide variety of sources other than meat, from which one can add protein to a vegetarian diet, the lack of awareness around it often takes a toll on one's nutritional input.Proteins are essential for building lean mass, boosting metabolism, getting those curves and cuts, hormonal balance and staying disease free, as 80% of your body works on protein. Lack of consumption for the body's basic requirements of this vital compound can cause serious complications.Only when a protein contains all nine of these essential amino acids, it can be considered a ""complete"" protein. It's an established fact that food derived from animals such as meat, milk, and eggs have complete protein structures, while plant-based foods such as nuts, beans, grains, lentils, vegetables, and seeds have incomplete structures. However, just because they are incomplete, that doesn't make them inferior, though, they need to be combined with other food items to provide the right balance of essential amino acids.Here are some tips for vegetarians to take into consideration, in order to meet their body's basic protein requirements:Dal is a good source of protein, especially when paired alongside generous portions of rice.Curd-rice is a lesser known source of protein, it also helps to replenish the bacteria in the gut.Every vegetarian diet should include at least one kind of bean or lentil, at least once in a day combined with generous portions of grains. Beans are a great source of protein with low levels of glycemic carbs.Paneer is a delicious, versatile source of protein, particularly Casein. The slow digestion of this type of protein elicits protein synthesis during the period between meals.Low-fat dairy products are a good source of protein for vegetarians who are also looking to control their fat intake. They are easily accessible and fun to incorporate into various meals and snacks.Soy either in the form of bean, milk or tofu is the saving grace for vegans, and an excellent source of protein. Despite the considerable fears about its effects on human beings, there's no reason to be alarmed as the anti-nutrients are destroyed when cooked. In fact, soy is the only plant based source of protein that is complete all by itself.Edamame beans (which are a type of immature soybean) are very nutritious choice for snacks.Cheese, apart from being practically everyone's favourite food, just so happens to be a very good source of protein. Make sure you keep the portion sensible as its high in fat.Eating foods with the right amounts of protein are just one side of the equation, the other side, which is often overlooked, concerns the rate at which one's body absorbs protein. Here are three ways to ensure that your body's capacity to absorb the proteins you eat is most efficient.Creating a gut environment that facilitates absorption: This can be achieved by including fermented foods, garlic, green bananas, barley, rice, and vegetables in one's diet, while cutting down on unnatural sugar intakes and low glycaemic carbs.Include nutrients that support assimilation and absorption: Vitamin B6, a primary nutrient that helps enzymes break down protein and deliver it to your blood is essential to get the most from one's protein intake. While nuts, seeds, beans, legumes and whole grains are good sources of B6, they are highly susceptible to degradation upon cooking; therefore it's always advisable to use B vitamin supplements.Spaced out protein consumption: The human body can only absorb certain amounts of protein per meal, which varies from person to person, therefore eating one's daily quota in a single sitting is redundant. What truly helps is to space out one's consumption over the course of the day to facilitate more optimal amounts of protein absorption.Vegetarians have long suffered from the ill effects of a protein deficit diet. Fortunately, dietary science has evolved to the point where we can address this serious issue with simple changes to one's food intake, without significantly infringing on anyone's beliefs.(The writer is head nutritionist at The Food Analysts)"
5b2e81fd9855b7264011602f,The chef’s line,http://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-middle/chefs-line-668812.html,2018-05-12,"My husband is a well seasoned chef in a five-star hotel. However, he seldom enters the kitchen at home. My cajoling for a cook-date on his off-days always elicits a negative response.On the other hand, our five-year-old daughter Prema, the youngest of the brood, loves to potter around the kitchen with me. The result is: a pencil stub here in my spice box or a hair clip there in the sugar jar and so on.Recently, a day dawned when I had to leave home early for a family emergency, which meant that my husband was forced to use his culinary skills at home. He decided to make a spicy Mysore Rasam for the family. Out came the blender. In went all the ingredients for his special rasam powder spice mix, for the lip smacking, cockle warming, aromatic concoction he is well known for.Lesser mortals have to check for salt by tasting, but our master chef prides himself on being able to season the food just by taking in a whiff of the aroma. When he grinds the spices, there is no visual checking required, no rubbing the powder between fingers. The sound of the blade crackling at the spices is his yardstick to get the right consistency.As soon as he switched on the blender he could hear a rough rattling sound, very different from the usual smooth sound of the spices blending. Our chef decided to turn the speed one notch up to drown out the rogue noise. After a brief rattle, the sound gave way to the comfortable crackling he was familiar with, which indicated that the spices have been powdered to just the right texture he desired.Lunch was a major success. The children lavished praise on Appa and the good fortune of his employers to have such a skilled chef in their kitchen.When I got back home that evening, I was assured that everything was under control. Appa had even saved some of that super delicious rasam for me. During dinner I noticed Premas ears were bare and asked her where her little gold studs were. She ran to the kitchen and came back a few minutes later with the pepper corn jar in her hand and a puzzled expression, I only see one ear ring in here. The other one is missing.Realisation dawned on my husband as to what had caused the rattling sound earlier when he was making the spice mix, which included black pepper corns as a key ingredient.It did not require a rocket scientist to determine the value of that rasam. We brought out a filter and analyzed the left-over rasam and found the most expensive ingredient coarsely ground to the correct specification of the master chef. Undaunted, my husband served the same in a bowl with a flourish, Now its fit for the Queen!"
5b2e8ef29855b7264011626a,Karnataka politics: where are the women?,http://www.deccanherald.com/edit/perspective/karnataka-politics-where-are-women-665358.html,2018-04-18,"Karnataka has had several women ministers, namely Margaret Alva, Basavarajeshwari and Taradevi Siddharth in the Union cabinet, and Nafees Fazal, Manorama Madhvaraj, Rani Satish, etc., in the state cabinet. The late KS Nagarathnamma was the only woman MLA to become the Speaker and the opposition leader in the assembly, while Motamma was the only woman to become the opposition leader in the council.Lately, Shobha Karandlaje was rural development minister. Ramya is the national head of Congress digital team. However, the total number of women who have been elected to parliament or state legislature is very low. And the situation is unlikely to improve in the forthcoming assembly elections as very few women are contesting. Karnataka pioneered the reservation of 25% seats for women in panchayats when Ramakrishna Hegde was chief minister in 1983, even before the passage of the legislation that mandated representation for women in these bodies. This was commendable, as at that juncture no powerful womens lobby had emerged in Karnataka to press for this move.Today, with the 73rd and 74th Amendments, which call for the reservation of a third of seats for women in Panchayat Raj institutions and urban bodies, the percentage representation of women in the three levels of Panchayat Raj institutions in Karnataka  gram panchayat, taluk panchayat and zilla panchayat are 51.14%, 55.15% and 53.21%, respectively. Despite enormous challenges and obstacles, women have started to play an important role in panchayats in Karnataka and accelerate social development.Today, women are change agents who transform the development agenda and address health, education, nutrition, sanitation and empowerment. But still, women have not been given due space and representation in the state assembly and parliament. In the assembly, the situation is abysmal. A cursory study of the 2013 election reveals that womens political representation is nowhere comparable to that of men. According to the Election Commission, out of the total 224 assembly constituencies in Karnataka, out of 175 women candidates who contested in 113 constituencies, only six women won the elections. The six constituencies are Nippani, Terdal, Kumta, Shimoga Rural (SC), Kolar Gold Field (SC), Puttur. Out of the 169 women who lost the election, 159 forfeited their deposits. The situation in parliament is no better. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 21 women contested in Karnataka. Only one woman won.The Bill introduced in parliament in September 1996 to reserve a third of the seats in parliament and state legislatures has evoked a great deal of resistance. This is despite the fact that all the parties - BJP, Congress, JD(S)  support the legislation only theoretically. The reality is that the legislation has not been passed till date.Womens participation will transform the political landscape of Karnataka and bring in many positive benefits. Women introduce new perspectives and promote gender-friendly policies. Women are more capable of networking across party lines work to accomplish social welfare objectives. For instance, in the 2008 Rwandan parliament, 56% of the members of parliament were women, who dealt with controversial issues like land rights and food security. Women MPs in Britain have informally worked together across party lines on societal issues like employment law, equal pay and violence against women.The Karnataka Vision 2025 document states that the main aim is for the state to be a leader in human development and offer a minimum quality of life that is at least the national average in every region of the state.However, the impediments are many: high levels of corruption  Transparency International ranked Karnataka as the fourth most corrupt state in a recent survey  and a phase of political instability. The participation of women and men together can bring about positive political culture to make the vision a reality. A critical mass of women in power can affect a transformation in leadership.There is no denying the fact that greater participation of women in the political process would be a pre-condition for sustainable development and their economic and social upliftment. Even though a significantly large number of women vote in the country, women have held positions like President and prime minister as well as chief ministers of various states, yet in Karnataka, there has been no woman chief minister. In the last five years, the state has had only two women ministers in a male-dominated cabinet: Women and Child Welfare and Kannada and Culture minister Umashree and Cooperation and Sugar minister Geeta Mahadeva Prasad.Today, women encounter many problems and challenges to gain access to political power and empowerment in Karnataka. Socio-economic obstacles are lack of adequate financial resources, limited access to education and health. Psychological barriers include womens low self-esteem and self-confidence, endorsed by certain cultural patterns that do not facilitate womens access to political careers. Political obstacles are lack of party support. It is necessary to increase womens representation in the parties and legislature. The political leadership of women is of crucial significance in the present political landscape to ensure empowerment of women, gender justice and gender equality in Karnataka.(The writer is a former Professor of Sociology, Christ Deemed to be University, Bengaluru)"

The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters,"" the SP chief told reporters here.He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said.Yadav demanded Rs 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a ""fake cow slaughter case"" was registered, and claimed that Gujjar was tortured to death in custody by the police in Meerut.""It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of the state of justice?"" he posed.As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in the past over one year in the state, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters.Yadav also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody.""The BJP says that we used to give Rs 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) is not helping the Hindu. We do not believe in taking advantage by creating a rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactic,"" the SP leader said.He also blamed the UP police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. ""If the government had wanted, then the situation would not have worsened,"" Akhilesh said.On reports of CBI probe into the sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind.Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said, ""These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly.""Yadav contested the government's claim that it was taking care of sugarcane growers in the stateHe also demanded that the government should provide Rs 10 lakh assistance to families of Sitapur dog-bite victims. A total of 12 children have fallen prey to dog attacks so far.Referring to the investors' summit in UP and the follow-up visit to the US by senior UP minister Sidharthnath Singh, the former chief minister said, ""The companies with which the UP government has inked MoUs, do not have any balance sheet. The proposed defence corridor is a work to divert the attention of the people. This government will never be able to build the Jewar airport or the defence corridor.""He attacked Singh, who is UP health minister, saying that people in the US know about the health scenario of the state. The ambulances must be repaired first, he said.Yadav also accused the UP government of stalling the proposed mango wholesale market in Malihabad and perfumery park and museum in Kannauj. ""We want to know the quantum of investment in UP during the four years of Narendra Modi government,"" he said.Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, ""The UP CM is not bothered about improving the law and order in UP. He is more bothered about the law and order of Karnataka (where he was campaigning for the Assembly elections).""When his attention was drawn to reports on Congress president Rahul Gandhi's ambition to become the prime minister, Yadav said, ""These are post-poll matters. I have good relation with the Congress chief.""The SP had forged an electoral alliance with the Congress during the 2017 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh."

The workers of the Congress, SP and BSP have been actively involved in campaigning, says Mohammed Ahmed, a local Congress leader in Shamli, an Assembly segment of Kairana LS constituency.Local scribe Sachin Tyagi says that a success for the RLD in Kairana will certainly expedite the grand alliance in UP. An opposition victory will reflect coming together of the Dalits and Muslims, who are deciding factors in many constituencies in the western UP, Sachin told DH.A reversal, however, could derail the efforts to bring all the opposition parties on one platform, he added. Shifting of votes will be a big problem for the Opposition, Sachin said.The victory in the Monday bypoll is crucial for the RLD, which had drawn a blank in the 2014 LS polls and even its president Ajit Singh had lost in its stronghold of Jat-dominated Baghpat.Both Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary have been toiling hard to woo the members of Jat community and the farmers.Non-payment of sugarcane arrears has also been made a big issue in the poll here by the Opposition though Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath tried to blunt the same by recommending a CBI probe into the reported irregularities in the sale of state-owned sugar mills by the then Mayawati regime."
