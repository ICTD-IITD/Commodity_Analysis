It will be extra special as Huddersfield will join the chanting in the 22nd minute to highlight Wengers 22 years at the club. It is not hard to envisage why the 68-year-old, who has endured his worst league campaign to date, still commands that sort of respect on a football field. In a way, he showed English football the light.The bespectacled Frenchman, who was compared to Jacques Clouseau upon his arrival in 1996, was greeted with extreme parochialism but he won over an entire country. The Evening Standard had this headline on their billboard. Arsene Who? Nick Hornby (the author who wrote Fever Pitch), reacted with typical angst. I remember when Bruch Rioch was sacked, one of the papers had three or four names. It was Terry Venables, Johan Cruyff and then, at the end, Arsene Wenger. I remember thinking as a fan, I bet its f****** Arsene Wenger because I have not heard of him and I have heard of the other two. Trust Arsenal to appoint the boring one that you havent heard of.Club captain Tony Adams was no different. At first, I thought, what does this Frenchman know about football? He wears glasses and looks like a schoolteacher. Does he even speak English properly? To be fair, the only experiments with appointing foreign coaches had gone belly up (Dr Jozef Venglos lasted less than a year at Aston Villa (he almost relegated them) while Osvaldo Ardiles time at Tottenham ended in similar circumstances.Those assessments were all airbrushed rather quickly as the former Monaco manager started implementing futuristic training methodologies. Mars bars were gone, the drinking culture  alcohol was very much used as a bonding agent  was wiped out, fitness was the new king as broccoli replaced burgers on the cafeteria menu. The attention to detail was staggering. The then 47-year-old even changed how the Arsenal players consumed tea. He took a dim view of his players adding sugar but allowed them to continue using it with a caveat. Stir till it absorbs all the granules.Wenger picked up all these traits while coaching Nagoya Grampus Eight in Japan. He saw firsthand the effect of fitness on the human body and knew that was the first thing he had to implement at Arsenal. Its something that changed me profoundly as well. The vision I have of life changed in Japan. It was absolutely a deep, profound and very, very positive experience. Im very grateful that I went, he had once told the official club website. He even oversaw the construction of a state-of-the-art training complex intended to give them marginal gains over their rivals. The marginal gain was such that Sir Alex Ferguson, got worried. So Manchester United-based England players kept an eye on what the Arsenal-based England players were doing during international training.A change was also taking place in boardrooms as chairmen up and down the Premier League began to appoint foreigners. On May 11, 1997, there were only two non-British managers in the top tier. (Ruud Gullit of Chelsea being the other). On May 11, 2018, only five of the 20 were English. He also had a seismic effect on Arsenal. Chants of Boring boring Arsenal and 1-0 to The Arsenal quickly became relics of a bygone era as Wenger created a team that wouldnt have been out of place at Hogwarts. Their fans recognised it and coined a new term for the sport. Wengerball.****While a clear divide had already formed between the Arsenal faithful and Wenger  the #ArseneOutBrigade made its presence felt as early as 2012  there was still a level of respect. That umbilical cord was cut in sensational fashion after a 2-3 loss at Stoke on December 7, 2014. Even as the squad boarded a train at the Stoke-on-Trent railway station, the fans heckled Wenger. There were shouts of f*** off and leave. The video went viral and there were renewed calls to sack the manager.They had lost thrice in five matches as another league campaign derailed.The squad was stale and crying out for help as former players openly questioned the level of coaching taking place. The defenders were making the same mistakes, there were no leaders in midfield, transfers were shunned to give perennially injured players another chance while the forward line lacked the oomph factor. Worse still, the big-money signings of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez had failed to galvanise a flawed manager.Arsenal, in essence, was the living, breathing embodiment of groundhog day. The Frenchman did not prepare his team based on the oppositions strengths and weaknesses and that was the beginning of the end. Coaches like Manuel Pellegrini, Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp knew what to expect.If the 2-8 at Man United in 2011 was an outlier, big defeats against elite opposition are the norm in 2018. 1-4, 1-3, 0-2 against Barcelona. 1-5, 1-5, 1-5 against Bayern Munich. 3-6, 0-3, 1-3, 1-2 against Man City. 1-5, 0-4, 1-3, 3-4 against Liverpool. 0-6, 0-2, 1-3, 0-2 against Chelsea. 1-2, 0-2, 1-3 against Tottenham. The one genuine theme of the later Wenger years  from the 2012-13 season  was his abominable record against the fellow members of the top six away from home. Three wins, eight draws and 19 losses. Lose once, its perhaps hard luck. Do it 19 times in the last six years and Benjamin Franklin had the perfect explanation. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail.****Wenger is a deeply philosophical man and some of his best quips came in a revealing LEquipe interview in November 2015. To a question on whether he believed he has a mystical power over his players when he is preparing them for a match, he replied:I have not created anything. I am a facilitator of what is beautiful in man. I define myself as an optimist. My constant battle in this business is to get out there what is beautiful in man. We can at this level portray me as naive. At the same time, it allows me to believe it and it often gives me reason.Those beliefs stood him in good stead for the first part of his reign as artists and artisans in a remote corner of North London came together to make art on a football field. The greatest proof of that will live in the pages of history long into the future. Played: 38. Won: 26. Drawn: 12. Lost: 0."

But Im incorrigible and continue to look for new plants wherever I go. Theres no joy like watching a flower bloom!I like growing seasonal flowers like Phlox, Petunias and Calendulas, leafy varieties like Money Plants and Snake Plants and fragrant flowers like Jui, Belle and Gandharaj. One of my favourite plants is this one I have on my staircase. It bears clusters of white flowers from pods in winter and releases a thick nectar thats nothing short of sugar syrup.In the balcony, I have cacti and succulents in pots and hanging baskets. Among bonsais, I have a Japanese Banyan and a 15-year-old Tamarind that the gardener and I are pruning, tying and toiling over to give shape to.I dont grow too many fruits and vegetables as they take up a lot of space. Still, we have Lemons, Clementines, Capsicums, Tomatoes, Chillis and Pui Shak.Our building lies on the Metro channel and of late the pollution here has increased manifold.

""It is steadily rising every year,"" he said.A person is said to be suffering from fatty liver if more than five per cent of the liver cells are filled with fat, he added.Urbanisation and associated dietary habits are to blame for a spurt in the disease in India, Ghosh said on the eve of the first International NASH Day on June 12, supported by the American Liver Foundation, Global Liver Institute and Fatty Liver Foundation.Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), if unchecked, can lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which in turn can cause cirrhosis.Diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatty liver, doctors said. So do a family history of liver ailments and a sedentary lifestyle. Over-dependence on junk food - especially excess of fries and sugar - is another familiar villain.""Walking, swimming and running help in checking fatty liver. A brisk walk of 5km in 45 minutes five days a week is one of the best workouts to prevent fatty liver,"" Ghosh said.The first stages of fatty liver involve accumulation of fat in the liver. In the second, there is inflammation. If the condition keeps worsening, fatty liver may even lead to cirrhosis and liver transplant may be needed. ""The disease is reversible in the initial stages. But the key is early detection. People with bloating and acidity should go for an ultrasonography to find out if they have fatty liver,"" Ghosh said."

(Shubham Paul)It began with a dip in the pool and ended with a mouthful of pie. In between they played, pranced and made new friends, both canine and human. Nawab Dastan, the FD Block pet clinic, had thrown a pool party for dogs on Sunday that everyone enjoyed.We had read about this doggie pool in The Telegraph Salt Lake and wanted to bring our Labrador Cleopatra to it. It was her first time in a pool and she was curious, said Nabonita Bose Mukherjee of Purbachal 4RA. Its rare to have occasions centred around pets and we want Cleo to enjoy herself.Urbashi, an Indian dog, made an appearance in a bathrobe specially designed for dogs. It had a belt to tie around the waist and velcro to fasten the hood. We bought it online, smiled guardian Ashima Dutta Roy, who also runs the pool.Urbashi is 11 years of age and so to help her swim, Dutta Roy has also got a canine life jacket. Rottweiler Bubulu tried out the jacket and loved it. Bubulu got hip dysplasia as a puppy and the doctor said she must swim, said Suparna Ghosh. We have been getting her to this pool for the last three months and she looks forward to every visit. She doesnt need a life jacket but she liked swimming with it today.Bubulu in her first lap in a life jacket in the poolAfter all that exercise, it was time for a snack and Dutta Roy had baked a dog pie for the furry guests. It has quail eggs, fish, chicken and herbs that are essential for dogs. There is absolutely no oil or sugar and just a pinch of salt, she said. Even when partying, one should never compromise on diet.Shonamoni, an Indian dog brought in by Jaidip Banerjee, did the honours of cutting the pie along with Dutta Roy. Several dogs had by then surrounded the pie hungrily. Our GSD, Dogtor Dre, is fussy with food, said Arijit Sett as his mother Sujata tried in vain to feed him. Sujata couldnt help but notice Bubulu, who had come up close, smacking his lips. Would you like a bite? began Sujata and Bubulu had engulfed the entire slice before she could finish her sentence!"

(Sanat Kr Sinha)Esplanade: Inhalers and pills could give children suffering from diabetes freedom from daily insulin injections, if research succeeds, doctors from British universities said at a conference in the city on Sunday.Patients can be fitted with automatic glucometers that take readings round the clock and send a message to the user's mobile phone if the blood sugar level reaches a point where insulin intervention becomes necessary.Children suffering from type 1 or paediatric diabetes, whose bodies stop producing insulin, have to take insulin injections every time they have a major meal.Inhalers and pills could help this group.Type 1 diabetes is usually detected in children aged 10 to 15.""It is stressful for children as needles have to be pricked before every meal. It would improve their quality of life greatly if they could switch to inhalers or tablets,"" Richard Holt, professor of diabetes and endocrinology at the University of Southampton, said at Diabetes Update 2018, Kolkata, a conference hosted by Diabetes and Endocrinology Forum in Calcutta.""The problem with inhalers that scientists are now trying to get around is that the rate of absorption varies from one person to another, making it difficult to fix a dose. Researchers are also looking into possible side effects of the diabetes inhaler,"" said Holt, chief editor of the International Textbook of Diabetes as well as Diabetic Medicine.Advancements in technology now allow type 1 diabetes patients to wear ""insulin pumps"" that can be adjusted to send a fixed dose of the drug into the body. The use of the pump ensures that the patient has to be pricked once in three days, when the channel has to be changed, and not three to four times daily.Holt spoke of ongoing research to develop a weekly injection for patients of type 2 diabetes, who are usually detected with the disease much later and in whose case the body does not produce enough insulin.In India, there are over 62 million people with diabetes and the number is projected to go up to 79 million by 2030. About 90 per cent of them are estimated to be patients of type 2 diabetes.Andrew Boulton, an endocrinologist from the University of Manchester, said diabetes could well turn out to be the ""cancer of the 21st century"" unless there is greater awareness and the condition is detected early.Tirthankar Chaudhury, the president of Diabetes and Endocrinology Forum, said an agreement had been signed with drug manufacturer Sanofi under which type 1 diabetes patients from economically backward sections of society would be provided free insulin round the year."

Most children of elderly residents have moved out of the city or country and do not intend to return. So after their parents demise they simply sell the family house and the neighbourhoods character changes with properties changing hands. But Snehodiyas character will remain the same as it will only be available to those above the age of 55, said chairman cum managing director, Debashis Sen.Snehodiya can take in 204 inmates.

If one decides to move out or passes away, three-fourth of the deposit is returned, in case of the inmates death, to the legal heir, an official said. The monthly rent is Rs 16,000 payable by the 7th of the month.There would be a garden on the verandah on every floor for residents to lounge on. The central kitchen downstairs would serve food. Each unit would be equipped with a microwave oven, a 60 litre refrigerator and a wall-mounted 32 inch TV set. There would also be a pantry on each floor with a common dining area.

Prevention is better than cure and its advisable to go for periodical screening, said Pattanaik. ""We are using a remote-like device to touch the breast. In case there is a lump or abnormality the device shall start beeping. We are also handing out a booklet with information and showing women how they can do a basic test at home, she added.But not everyone seemed comfortable getting themselves physically checked. I dont need it, said 61-year-old Rina Biswas of GD Block, who walked out after her blood pressure and sugar tests and orthopaedic consultation.Most women skipped the test  someone claimed she had a doctor at home if needed, another said she had undergone this test recently and many simply overlooked the option.Sangeeta Bhattacharya and Dipa Ghosh of FE Block were among the rare women who had no reservations in getting themselves checked. We come for health camps whenever the block conducts one and would not skip this test, said Bhattacharya. It is always better to be safe than sorry, added Dipa.One of the reasons for holding the breast cancer screening today was to raise awareness about it, said Pallab Bhattacharya, convenor of health committee of Salt Lake FE Block Residents Association.We conducted several tests today, which would cost about Rs 5,000 for someone getting it done on their own. We are happy to have celebrated Womens Day this way, added secretary Basab Basak.POINTERS ON BEING SAFEBreast cancer is a malignant tumour that develops in the breast cells and it has beaten cervical, ovarian and uterine cancers to become the most common cancer among women in India, said Koustav Mazumder, consultant clinical oncologist at a seminar in FE Block a few weeks before the screening.As per 2014 data, over 1,44,000 women were newly diagnosed with it in the year and more than 70,000 died of it, said the doctor and proceeded to informing women about how to protect against it.Risk factors beyond your control Gender- Men can get breast cancer too but women are more prone to it Age - Risk increases with age Race- Caucasians, for instance, are more prone to it than those of African origin Family history- One has to be very careful if ones first-degree relative ie. mother, sister or daughter, has had breast cancerRisk factors in your control Weight- Being overweight increases the risk of cancer, especially post menopause Diet- Reduce the intake of red and processed meat and have more fruits and vegetables Alcohol- Reduce its intake Exercise- It reduces the riskDetect breast cancer Breast cancer screening must be done at a time when there are no symptoms. In case it is detected in the early stage treatment would be more effective. There are two ways of breast cancer screening  self-examination and mammogram.Self-examination This is to be done every month, five days after the last day of your period. All women above the age of 20 should do this. Perform it in the shower while bathing, before a mirror and while lying down. Use your left hand to check your right breast and vice versa. Check for any lump, depression, discharge, redness, inverted nipple, itching around the nipple or ulcer. Also check armpits.Mammogram- This test is like an X-ray; it produces pictures of the breast tissues. Women over 45 years need to get a mammogram done once a year, over and above the monthly self-examination at home. The test is simple, non-invasive and costs about as much as an X-ray."

Now, people have accepted it as a way of life,"" said Ram Narayan Nandy, 76, the president of the Laughing Academy of Eastern India, an umbrella association that counts some 50 clubs as members.The association recently held its annual get-together at an auditorium in Paikpara, in north Calcutta, with more than 800 participants from the city and outskirts.But improved health is not the only reason a bunch of middle-aged and elderly men and women gather in parks in the morning and produce bouts of fake but frenzied laughter.A chance to spend some time with others is another reason. Laughing clubs across Calcutta and on its fringes are gradually becoming a melting pot for people from different walks of life.Mallika Shome, 55, has been been a member of a laughing club in Uttarpara, in Hooghly district, for more than 10 years. Her son passed away in 2011, aged 24. ""The association has given me the strength I needed to cope with the loss. The club members are far dearer to me than my relatives,"" said Mallika.A typical session includes loud laughter with an open mouth, silent laughter with an open mouth and laughter with a closed mouth. As soon as a person starts laughing, others join in. People warm up before and practise deep breathing at the end of the session.Pranab Chowdhury, 64, a supplier of medical appliances to retail stores, is a member of the College Square Laughing Club, one of the oldest is Calcutta. ""Apart from daily laughter sessions, we organise plays, picnics and music festivals throughout the year,"" said Chowdhury.The first laughing club in Calcutta was founded way back in 1996, at Rabindra Sarobar, said Nandy.The man behind it was the late L.N. Daga, who was in turn inspired by Madan Kataria, the founder of the Laughter Club of India."

(Saradindu Chaudhury)SALT LAKE SANSKRIT SANSADJust when everyone was smearing the reds and pinks on one anothers faces and raising toasts with clay cups of thandai the sound box merrily went Tohfa tohfa, laya laya. And suddenly the festivities doubled as a tribute to Sridevi, the just-deceased actress who had danced her way to the nations heart in the film in the 1984 film Tohfa. Revellers at the Salt Lake Sanskrit Sansad event broke into signature steps from the song.The Sansads Holi bash was at BF ground on March 2 but a Holika dahan had been performed the night before at BC ground. Wood, cow dung etc go into the pyre and many people make wishes by tying threads around it while offering prayers, said Kamal Agarwal of the group.When the pyre is all lit up, people hold up sugarcane sticks with gram (chhola) saplings tied at the top. They hold it above the flames so the sapling just about roasts in the fire, without actually catching fire.We then offer pranam to our elders and offer a gram each to them. This is an omen of good luck. The smoke is supposed to be auspicious and we believe it would rid us of all negative energies, said Savitri Gupta of the groups ladies wing.A band had been flown in from Rajasthan to perform Holi songs as the men circled the pyre and played a beat on the daff.Over the last three or four years many youngsters have started taking interest in this ritual and thats a good sign, said Suresh Gupta, another member.On Day 2, there were colours, rain dance, music and lots of fun. Mayor Sabyasachi Dutta and MLA Sujit Bose dropped by and smeared each other with abir, shook a leg to Rang Barse and embraced revellers with open arms.I have been a councillor in this ward for about 25 years and almost 62 per cent of my voter base here is non-Bengali. I come to celebrate Holi, Diwali and Dussehra with my friends here, who are now my family, said Dutta in Hindi.Sujit Bose, in broken Hindi, said the organisers do a lot of good work. The Sansad invites me for all the programmes and Im very happy to be here, he said.Showli ChakrabortyMayor Sabyasachi Dutta prepares to light the festive pyre.The Holika pyre ablaze at FE ParkAE PART 2Not only did residents of AE Part 2 celebrate Dol and Holika on two consecutive days, but they also lit pyres to celebrate nyarapora and Holika dahan on the eve of the respective occasions.We have been celebrating nyarapora for long but included Holika to the list of our festivities 10 years ago, said block president Monimoy Saha. We gather dried leaves, branches, cow dung cake etc and divide the provisions such that they can be burnt over two nights, added secretary Tapas Sengupta.Residents were excited to participate in the rituals. We are to circle the pyre seven times and tie threads around it before setting it on fire, said Kavita Sharma, a resident who had come for Holika dahan. The timing is important and the priests have said that this year the pyre should be lit at 7.42pm, she added.The block also felicitated residents above the age of 75 that evening. One of them, Bharati Banerjee, recalled Holi memories of her childhood. We lived in Delhi back then. We would start the day by applying abir on the feet of elders and seek their blessings. Then wed leave to play and not return before 1pm. We would eat home-made Murir Moa, Gujiya, Malpoa and my favourite Elo Jhelo  a fried crisp dipped in sugar syrup. Now-a-days we dont get to meet neighbours as much so we look forward to such festivities to enjoy, she said.Shatadipa Bhattacharya"

The place is Achipur, named after Chinese trader Yang Dazhao (nicknamed Atchew) who arrived on the banks of the Hooghly in 1778 and has a temple worshipping him.Park Street: A lecture on a Chinese migrant community on Wednesday took the audience at Indian Museum a couple of hundred years back.Tansen Sen, the director of the Center for Global Asia in New York University, Shanghai, traced the history of Chinese migration in India. In a pictorial presentation, he showed how the migrant community carried its faith to the places it went to and localised it according to the existing culture.Atchew arrived during the time of Warren Hastings. The trader had brought a huge quantity of tea and the governor general, a tea lover, offered him a piece of land to settle in, Sen said.The Chinese trader set up a sugar mill on the banks of the Hooghly, south of Budge Budge. The tiny settlement around the mill - it drew several workers from mainland China - soon became a Chinese colony. The settlement was christened Achipur after the trader. The community grew and spread to Bowbazaar and, much later, to Tangra.Unrest in south China forced many to seek livelihood in foreign lands. Cantonese migrants started coming in the mid-18th Century and those from the Sihui County near Guangzhao (Canton) migrated to Malaya and British India in the mid-19th century. Migrants from Siyi and Hakka also came to Calcutta in large numbers.Sen's presentation showed how temples from Sihui County travelled thousands of miles to Calcutta. Ruan Ziyu and Liang Cineng - followers of the sixth Chan/Zen patriarch Huineng (638-713) - have separate temples in Sihui County but are found together in a temple off Blackburn Lane near Tiretta Bazaar. The Ruan-Liang temple, built in 1908, has two other deities - Lu Ban, the Chinese god of carpentry, and Atchew.""The temples were not just places of worship, they played an important role in preserving the sub-dialect community's identity and in the mingling of Chinese and local ideas,"" Sen said.Only nine families that descend from the original migrants from the Sihui County remain in Calcutta. ""But they still see the Ruan-Liang Temple as a community space that connects their current homeland to the ancestral home,"" the professor signed off."

It also granted soft loans worth 44.4 billion rupees to help millers expand ethanol output capacity.""These moves suddenly changed sentiments. Despite the government order, mills are now not interested in exporting their allocated quota,"" said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.SURPLUS SUGAR AHEAD?In March, India asked mills to export 2 million tonnes of sugar and fixed a mandatory export quota for each mill.With only a few mills signing new contracts, the country could export only 500,000 tonnes of sugar in the current marketing year ending on Sept. 30, two dealers said.That includes 175,000 tonnes that Indian traders have contracted to sell to Myanmar, Sri Lanka and African countries, said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.While the government measures are boosting local sugar prices, they could plunge again unless the national inventory drops, said a sugar miller based in Pune in the western Maharashtra state.India is likely to produce 32 million tonnes of sugar in the current year, compared to domestic consumption of around 25 million tonnes. Output is expected to rise further as farmers are spurred by the better returns.That could bring the South Asian country's stocks to around 10 million tonnes on Oct. 1, making exports much more necessary in the next season, said Verma of ISMA.""The major problem the industry is facing is surplus sugar. That could be addressed only by disposing stocks through exports,"" he said."

The fiscal maths are getting challenging on rising fuel prices, a weakening rupee and subdued investments.""This could be the worst year for us, as budget calculations are under stress,"" a senior finance ministry official, who declined to be named, told Reuters, adding there was a worry of at least one more rate hike by December.""The rising crude oil prices are already giving sleepless nights as the government may have to cut tax on fuel products sooner rather than later,"" the official added.India's economy grew at 7.7 percent in the first three months of the year, the fastest pace in nearly two years. That would be an impressive clip for most countries, but more is needed to create enough new jobs for the 1 million young people entering the country's workforce each month.FEELING THE PRESSUREThe government's spending plans have already been threatened by setbacks to flagship reforms.An estimated $1.2 billion-$1.5 billion Air India privatisation plan flopped when the stake it was selling in the flag carrier failed to attract a single bid by last week's deadline, putting at risk its 800 billion rupees ($11.93 billion) divestment target.Meanwhile, the sovereign 10-year bond yield has risen by 60 basis points since start of the fiscal year in April, and is near a three-year high due to a lack of investors. Similarly top-rated corporates, including National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, Small Industries Development Bank of India and National Housing Bank, have deferred their bond issuance plans due to a lack of buyers.To top this, foreign holders have sold a net $4.3 billion of Indian debt so far this year as investors have grown wary of emerging economies facing twin fiscal and current account deficits and higher inflation that could pose overheating risks.The stock market has held up so far, but some analysts caution that concerns over a loosening of fiscal discipline ahead of the election could trigger equity outflows as well.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its key repo rate on Wednesday by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent - the first change since a cut of the same size in August last year - as higher oil prices, a sharp fall in the rupee and potential stronger consumer spending threatened to spur inflation beyond its 4 percent medium term target.""The rate hike will push up the government's interest financing cost and add to the fiscal deficit pressure on one hand,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India. ""And on the other hand, the nascent recovery in growth on the back of consumption demand will also slow down as retail lending rates will go up sooner than later.""MODI'S ELECTION BUGLEAfter a setback at a by-election in India's most populous state last week showed Modi's waning popularity in the countryside, where most Indians still live, the government has stepped up its so-called populist spending to please the voters.Already the government has unveiled a support package for sugar farmers to put a floor under prices that could cost about 40 billion rupees ($597 million) outside the budget.Further measures, including loan waivers to farmers by regional governments, higher minimum purchase prices for grains, fuel subsidies to prevent pump prices from rising sharply and higher than budgeted rural wage payouts could blow a big hole in the fiscal deficit.That could set up the RBI for a face-off with the government and also prompt further rate increases after it warned in its monetary policy statement that moving away from the fiscal deficit roadmap could push up inflation risks.""India's combined fiscal deficit is already quite high and since this is an election year, both state and central governments are coming up with populist spending steps which will push up the fiscal deficit and add to inflation pressures,"" said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. ""This increases the probability of further rate hikes."""

China imports about 4.5 million tonnes of surplus stocks mostly from Brazil, Thailand and Cuba, Abinash Verma MD, CEO of Indian Sugar Exim Corporation said.This is the first-time India is making a strong bid to export to China though India has exported about two lakh tonnes in 2007, he said.Besides East Africa and Sri Lanka, India is making a strong pitch for export of sugar to China and Bangladesh to cut losses due to surplus sugar stocks, he said.Today's meeting took place following the informal summit during which Prime Minister Modi had urged Xi to import Indian sugar, rice and pharmaceuticals, official sources here said.Modi was expected to have follow up discussions during his visit to Chinese city Qingdao to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to be held on June 9 and 10, Verma said.Today's meeting was organised by the Indian Embassy here.Speaking at the meeting, Counsellor Economic of Indian Embassy, Prashant Lokhande elaborated on the growing economic engagement between India and China and assured Chinese firms that India would emerge as a major sugar trading partner for China with consistent policies and quality product.ISMA officials said India hopes to export its sugars to China under the 50 per cent tariff category, though details are yet to be worked out.China charges 80 per cent tariffs on sugar imports. The response from the Chinese officials for India's offer of exports is extremely positive, Goel said.There were also inquiries whether the Indian firms could supply and match the quality, he said, adding that an invitation has been extended for the Chinese officials to visit Indian mills which have the most modern facilities.Those who attended the meeting included officials from China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, (CCPIT), China Sugar Association (CSA) and COFCO.The ISMA officials also called on Indian Ambassador, Gautam Bambawale, who informed them that exports of sugar was discussed during Modi-Xi meeting. He offered the embassy's full support to push Indian sugar exports to China.Earlier, India has made strong bid to export Soybean and rice to China to address the trade imbalance between the two countries which now amounted to USD 51 billion in over USD 80 billion trade last year."

Currently the average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg, below cost of production, resulting in huge financial loss for sugar mills. As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues.

Even in Maharashtra, dues worth Rs 2,000 crore were pending.Sugarcane price was an important poll issues in bypolls especially in Noorpur and Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh where the ruling BJP lost both seats. Now, with an eye on the 2019 general elections, the relief package aims to regain the confidence of sugarcane farmers and mill owners in Western Maharashtra and Western UP which forms a large voter bank.Earlier the Centre had doubled import duty on sugar import duty to 100 per cent and scrapped export duty to check sliding domestic prices.

Cabinet will take a decision.According to sources, the bailout package will come just days after the BJP lost Lok Sabha bypoll in Kairana constituency in Uttar Pradesh, the countrys largest sugarcane producing state. The anger of unpaid sugarcane farmers is attributed as a major reason for the ruling BJP having lost the by-election in a state where it had won the assembly polls handily as early as 2017.However Paswan refuted any links between the package and the by-poll loss. The Rs 8,000-crore package will include provisions for the creation of a sugar buffer stock of 3 million tonnes, interest subsidy on Rs 4,500 crore loan to mills for expansion and creation of new ethanol capacity among others.Just last month, the government had announced a Rs 1,500 crore production-linked subsidy for sugarcane farmers to help millers pay cane payments.The current crisis in the sugar sector is primarily due to a substantial glut in the domestic market, which in turn has brought mill prices of sugar below the cost of production resulting in massive losses. Currently, the average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg.The current package will be in addition to the measure she government had already taken, like doubling the import duty for sugar to 100 per cent and removed export duties.

The GST Network currently is 24.5 per cent owned by the Central government, 24.5 per cent held by state governments collectively, and the remaining 51 per cent is with HDFC Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, NSE Strategic Investment Co and LIC Housing Finance Ltd.After the proposed change in shareholding pattern, the Centre will own a 50 per cent stake and the rest will be held collectively by the states. Another important outcome of the meeting was that the Council was able to finalise a road map for introduction of simplified return filing. The new simplified return would require a taxpayer to file only one return every month. The new system will be functional in six months. It will take about six months for GSTN to prepare for it, so for that period the current arrangement of GSTR3B and GSTR 1 will continue.This will be the first phase of transition, where the current system will continue for the next six months, said Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia. However, the Council postponed a decision on incentivising the digital payment system. While most states were in favour of giving a 2 per cent incentive if all payments are made digitally or through cheques, some wanted a small negative list, and so the issue will be referred to a five-member group of state finance ministers, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who chaired the meeting via video conferencing.Another group of ministers (GoM) would look at the issue of levy of cess on sugar beyond the GST tax rates. The proposal was opposed by most states. According to Y Ramakrishnudu, Finance Minister of Andhra Pradesh, levy of cess by the government is against the spirit of GST. Any additional cess on sugar will increase the subsidy burden on the state, he said.Agenda and outcomeConverting GSTN into government body: Council agreedCess on sugar: Referred to fivemember councilIncentivizing digital payments: Referred to five-member councilSimplifying returns: After six months, only one monthly return has to be filed"
5b2f3e789855b70eb7de7877,India will not take sides in US-China trade spat: NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/apr/15/india-will-not-take-sides-in-us-china-trade-spat-niti-aayog-vice-chairman-rajiv-kumar-1801954.html,2018-04-15,"By PTIBEIJING: India today said it would not take sides in the ongoing trade spat between US and China amid differences with Beijing over its controversial Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Remarks by NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar came as he held the fifth Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) dialogue with his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng, the chairman of China's top planning body the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) here yesterday.During the talks, the BRI also came up for discussion.""India suo motu has been the supporter of the rule-based multilateral trading order. In that sense, we don't have to take sides either one-way or the other,"" Kumar told the media when asked about India's stand on the current trade spat between China and US.The SED, a key platform between India and China to discuss trade and economic issues, was resumed this year after last year's disruption amid Dokalam standoff.The meeting took place amid growing rapprochement between the two countries after the standoff.""India has always taken independent position on trade issues,"" Kumar told the Indian media.His remarks came as the US and China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's products.US President Trump is ramping up pressure on China to cut the USD 375 bilateral billion trade deficit.""While India does not like any measures that harm the rule based international trade regime, there is no reason to take sides in this,"" he said.""We are not that level of player inf the market. Our shares are much smaller. We are the takers of the rules than makers,"" he said.Kumar mentioned the US and Japanese trade war in late 1980 when Washington successfully pressured Japan to cut the trade deficit.""That is what the US is still expecting. If you notice, both sides have announced their position (to cut tariffs) but they have not given the dates. This is posturing,"" he said.""I don't think anybody is interested in trade war trade crisis,"" he said.In his address at the SED yesterday, Kumar made a strong pitch for China to allow India's exports of soybean and sugar.Soybean is regarded as most important for US farmers and China is the largest importer.China has threatened to impose 25 per cent tariffs on its imports if Trump went ahead with his tariff plan for China.Elaborating on his stand in asking China to import soybean and sugar from India, he said, ""My hint was much more towards agricultural tariffs in China than anything else"".China's agricultural tariffs are high and India's agricultural exports suffer as a result of it.Asked whether the US-China trade spat is advantageous to India, he said, ""If war happens, elephants fight and grass gets affected. We are part of the grass. We don't want that,"" Kumar said, adding that the US and China being the world's top two economies are giants.""We are not there yet,"" he said.Apparently, China has raised the BRI at the SED for which India responded raising its concerns over the sovereignty issue regarding the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Kumar said Chinese brought up the BRI issue and the Indian delegation responded by saying it is a matter of sovereignty which cannot be compromised.The Chinese side ""extolled"" the BRI virtue and emphasised how it is ""completely nonconflictual and respectful of sovereignty and independence"", he said.""After hearing India's response they chose to ignore it,"" he said. But at the same time there was no reference to the CPEC and it is covered in the sovereignty-related concerns raised by India,"" Kumar said.""Both sides recognise the differences over the issue. But there is sufficient scope within the defined redlines to take the development cooperation forward,"" he said.There was a discussion at the SED about the Bangladesh, China, India, Myanmar (BCIM) corridor.While China says it is a part of the BRI, India says the project predates that. Kumar said the main focus for India is Asian trilateral highway. The BCIM is work in progress.Currently Bangladesh and Myanmar are not interested in it in view of the Rohingya refugee crisis, Kumar said.China for its part appreciated India's Act East Policy to improve connectivity in the north-eastern states.He said the core message from the SED was that ""we must focus incessantly and unremittingly on the development cooperation possibilities despite differences"".""Major take away for India was that China has expressed interest in joining the International Solar Alliance mooted by India,"" Kumar said.""It seems we have an opening. If that happens it can be a big shot the arm,"" he said.There were some ""positive noises"" from China on investing in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheme for housing for all Indians by 2022.Kumar yesterday said that there was immense potential to set up special clusters for Chinese investments like textiles, leather, food processing, electronic components and pharmaceuticals."
5b2f3fa39855b70eb7de78dd,The great bank robbery,http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/2018/apr/07/the-great-bank-robbery-1797532.html,2018-04-07,"Ravi Shankar ByThe Great Famine of 1866 that killed millions of people in Bengal Presidency prompted Dadabhai Naoroji, known as the father of Indian nationalism, to formulate the Drain Theory. In 1867, he put forward the drain of wealth theory expostulating that Britain was economically draining Indiaan annual drain of 200-300 million pounds of revenue to Britain at the time he wrote the book in the 1870s. Ironically, the CAG of England in a 2013 audit was horrified that Britain could have raised more money from colonial India. Huge, huge notional loss! said the British CAG that estimated the total value of exploitation as Rs 1 trillion, that amount to around Rs 91 lakh crore at current rates over 300 years. After 70 years of Independence, India continues to be lootedthis time by Indians.Absence of credit discipline led to years of reckless lending among public sector banks (PSBs), which the government and regulator now want to contain.Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of all banks aggregated Rs 8.41 lakh crore as on December 2017; slated to rise to Rs 9 lakh crore this year. The State Bank of India (SBI) leads as the largest lender, topping the list with highest amount of gross NPAs at Rs 2 lakh crore, followed by Punjab National Bank (PNB), IDBI Bank, and Bank of India. But bank chiefs say they are scraping the bottom of the barrel to reduce the toxic pile.The SBI has a two-fold strategy to avoid fresh slippages and at the same time resolve existing NPAs. Apart from the RBIs (Reserve Bank of India) list of 12 large accounts last June for resolution, we have been consciously working on accounts internally identified. Several cases are being referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), says Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI.CaptionIn fact, all other 21 PSBs too are knocking on the doors of the NCLT, which has seen a sudden surge in cases. As many as 8,457 cases were pending in the NCLT as on December 2017 and 264 in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal. The idea is to recover dues as quickly as possible, adds Kumar, downplaying fears that chances of insolvency could be higher. In the absence of a resolution (which includes either roping in a new management, or finding new investors, or raising capital by selling non-core assets to repay existing debt), more accounts could become insolvent. Such a move will spell trouble for lenders, who manage to recover just about Rs 25 of every Rs 100 that turns sour.The newly issued Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework by the RBI brought Dena Bank, Central Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, UCO Bank, IDBI Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Indian Overseas Bank, Corporation Bank, Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, and United Bank of India under the framework. Collusion between bank officials, rampant nepotism and powerful political connections has allowed big business to loot Indias banking system.The RBI classifies bank frauds into three broad categories: deposits-related frauds, advances-related frauds and services-related frauds. The year 2018 opened the lid on a Pandoras box of bank scams. Indian banks reported a staggering 12,533 frauds, aggregating to Rs 18,170 crore in financial year 2017-18, largely due to weak internal controls. Data collated by Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a shareholder advisory service, Bank of Maharashtra reported the highest number of frauds at 3,893, followed by ICICI Bank (3,359) and HDFC Bank (2,319). In some banks, while the aggregate quantum is low, the average fraud size is high, indicating that the sector needs to urgently revisit and strengthen its internal financial controls.The Nirav Modi scam broke on February 14 when PNB informed the Bombay Stock Exchange of having detected around $1,771.69 million worth fraudulent and unauthorised transactions in a Mumbai branch. PNB also complained to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against billionaire diamantaire Modi cheating it of about Rs 11,400 crore after Diamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds together approached PNB on January 16 with import documents and requested for Buyers Credit to pay their overseas suppliers.Nirav, brother Nishal, Niravs wife Ami, and Gitanjali Gems owner Mehul Chinubhai Choksi are partners of the firms. The bank realised that the firms were availing of credit using fake documentation and started an investigation that revealed the makings of a Rs 1,140-crore scam. After further investigations, officials estimated the amount of the Nirav Modi fraud at Rs 12,686 crore in the first two FIRs for misusing legitimate loans and bank guarantees. This is when Modis personal fortune was around Rs 116 billion in 2017.Before Modi, PNB had lost Rs 28 billion thanks to various frauds in 2017 alone. Even before the bank launched the complaint, it seems Modi had got a whiff of what was in store for him after the scam was revealed. As the New Years dawn broke, he quietly escaped India with his family. Along with him were wife Ami, brother Nishal and relative Choksi, who would be wanted in connection with the fraud. Sources say he was tipped off by someone powerful in banking circles.There is no way he would have known unless he knew PNB would file a case and he would be arrested, says an Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer. This was confirmed by one of the CBI officers aware of the case. Modi has high-level contacts in the banking circles, he says. Modi had been getting investors to put money in his companies by promising to open 100 stores in major international cities by 2020. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal reportedly said that his client had assets worth Rs 5,000-6,000 crore in India alone.Unlike many other financial fugitives, Modis wherabaouts are unknown, and hence extradition proceedings cannot be launched against him. According to various reports, he has been sighted in Switzerland and New York. Modi blamed PNB for having acted in a premature fashion, inhibiting his repayment ability. Then why did he flee in January when the case was registered only in mid-February? asks the ED official. Choksis location is also unknown, though he issued a statement refusing to come back on the grounds of bad health. He alleged political conspiracy, media witch hunt and threats to his familys safety and animosity from employees, creditors and customers who have not been paid.Following the PNB incident, based on the government and regulators insistence, all PSBs have internally scanned their respective LoU/LoC-related transactions, besides assessing, genuine and accounted LoUs. Further, banks have also put in place controls including creating an additional layer of approvals for all outward SWIFT messages. Those banks where integration of SWIFT with CBS is not yet done are expected to do so by April, besides deploying time restrictions for such transactionsbetween 9 am and 8 pm only.Even as the PNB-Modi storm continued, Indias pre-eminent female banking icon Chanda Kochhars reputation began to face heat. The CBI registered a preliminary inquiry to probe an alleged deal between Kochhars husband, Deepak, and Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot, though she herself is not named. The CBI is investigating whether Deepak received crores from Dhoot for NuPower Renewables promoted by him, six months after Videocon received a Rs 3,250-crore loan from ICICI Bank in 2012. But on March 28, the ICICI Board issued a statement reposing its confidence in Kochhars governance and integrity. Dhoot said the allegations were unfounded. Personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts, he reportedly said.Another high-profile case is that of Vikram Kothari, chairman and MD of Kanpur-based Rotomac Global. Kothari is embroiled in a controversy for alleged loan default worth over Rs 3,695 crore taken from different state-owned banks. The CBI has registered an FIR against Kothari on the basis of a complaint by the Bank of Baroda.This decade alone has been a calendar of banking frauds. In 2011, CBI revealed that executives of Bank of Maharashtra, OBC and IDBI Bank created around 10,000 fictitious accounts in which loans worth Rs 1,500 crore were deposited. From massive scams to willful defaulters, the list is almost endless.* Mumbai Police filed nine FIRs against public sector firms for perpetrating Rs 600 crore fixed deposit fraud.* Electrotherm India defaulted on a payment of Rs 436 crore to the Central Bank of India.* Kolkata-based industrialist Bipin Vohra allegedly used forged documents to get `14 billion as a loan from the Central Bank of India.* Ex-chairman and MD of Syndicate Bank SK Jain was arrested for allegedly receiving bribes for sanctioning loans worth Rs 8,000 crore.* Vijay Mallya was declared a willful defaulter by Union Bank of India and SBI, and PNB followed suit in 2015.* As on September 30, 2017, Jatin Mehta-promoted Winsome Diamonds & Jewellery Ltd and Forever Precious Jewellery & Diamonds Ltd owed close to `6,712 crore to various banks.* Kolkata-based REI Agro, a company owned by Sandip Jhunjhunwala, owes Rs 3,871 crore* Reid & Taylor (India) Limited & S Kumars Nationwide Limited promoted by Nitin Kasliwal owe more than Rs 5,000 crore. In 2015, it was discovered that employees of Jain Infraprojects defrauded Central Bank of India for over Rs 2 billion. A foreign exchange scam in which Rs 60 billion was sent to a fake corporation in Hong Kong by bank employees surfaced. The year 2016 next topped the cake, when it was discovered that four people opened almost 380 accounts with Syndicate Bank and stole `10 billion using fake cheques, LoUs and insurance policies.In 2017, fugitive Mallyas debt rose Rs 9,500 crore to IDBI and other banks. The CBI had registered FIR against five PSBs and six chargesheets were filed against Deccan Chronicle Holdings for causing a loss of Rs 11.61 billion. The same year, CBI arrested Kolkata-based promoter of Shree Ganesh Jewellery House, Nilesh Parekh, for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 22.23 billion to 20 banks by diverting money from loans through shell companies in Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE.The CBI also filed a case against the former zonal head of the Bank of Maharashtra and a director of a Surat-based private logistics company for being involved in a Rs 8.36-billion scam.This year, a director of the Andhra Bank was arrested by ED for participating in a Rs 5-billion bank fraud involving a pharmaceuticals company. In February, CBI registered a case against Indias biggest sugar producer, Simbhaoli Sugars Ltd, chairman Gurmit Singh Mann, deputy managing director Gurpal Singh and others on a complaint by the OBC over a loan fraud of Rs 97.85 croreGurpal Singh is Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singhs son-in-law.A few days before, a Rs 3.9-billion fraud was exposed in OBC, which has incurred losses to the tune of Rs 5 billion. An IIM Bangalore study found banking scams cost PSBs at least Rs 22,743 crore between 2012 and 2016. RBI data shows over 25,600 cases of banking fraud, worth Rs 1.79 billion up to December 21 last yeararound 455 such cases of Rs 1,00,000 or above were detected at ICICI Bank; 429 at SBI, 244 at Standard Chartered Bank and 237 at HDFC Bank. The Central Vigilance Commission is supervising the CBI investigation into 10 big bank fraud cases.Meanwhile, the countrys cooperative banks are most vulnerable to scamsters. Their primary objective is to assist the agriculture sector to economically empower rural India by giving financial assistance to small and medium farmers. The Uttarakhand State Cooperative Bank Ltd (USCB) is in the eye of a storm for violating norms by financing liquor contracts and sugar mills, and sanctioning loans to relatives of board members without collateral; its NPAs amount to Rs 165 crore in 2018. The bank reportedly has not filed any recovery case in 2016-17 with the total recovery being just Rs 3.11 lakh.The system suffers due to collusion between politicians and pliable managements, which give credit to the well-connected and later would waive the repayment. Rural development lender Nabard has accused a Mumbai politician of gross financial irregularities at the Mumbai District Central Cooperative Bank involving dozens of credit cooperative societies. NPAs, bad loans and loan waiver schemes are burdening the sector. According to the National Federation of State Cooperative Banks, absolute NPAs of district central cooperative banks (DCCBs) at the end of March 31, 2016 was Rs 22,406 crore, and state cooperative banks lost Rs 5,147 crore. As of March 31, 2016, only 62,050 primary agricultural credit societies were viable out of nearly 93,367.The tragedy is that bad loans from these banks are passed on to large nationalised banks which are reeling under huge amounts of bad business loans. A multitude of co-op banks have collapsed over the years, and depositors mostly get only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of their money deposited after the liquidation process that could last for nearly a decade, or just `1 lakh each through the Deposit Insurance Guarantee Corporation. Fake IDs, proxy deposits and fake gold guarantees form a common pattern in such scams.After demonetisation, vested interests used many cooperative banks to launder money. In 2016, ED started a probe into high-value transactions, some of which involved over a dozen cooperative banks in Mumbai that received deposits of Rs 1,596 crore in old notes and 205 new bank accounts opened in Allahabad into which scrapped notes were deposited. The directorate is completing investigation into a group of two dozen DCCBs in four states for money laundering. The taxpayers money is ultimately used for bailouts; the government will revive 23 district co-operative banks on the verge of closure with an infusion of Rs 2,375 crore.Frauds, big or small, have financial implications. For instance, in Bank of Maharashtra, the fraud amount as a percentage of total assets were 1.02, shows IiAS data. Added to a gross NPA of 19 per cent, this means that more than one-fifth of the asset size is at risk every year due to weak controls and lack of adequate due diligence.In November 2017, Nabard sanctioned a special limit of Rs 21,000 crore to DCCBs for agricultural credits. An RTI reply revealed in early 2017 that the RBI had no details of any irregularities or scams in the exchange of the demonetised currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 by the cooperative banks.However, IIM Bangalore data revealed that more than 95 per cent of fraud cases and amounts are in commercial banks, where public sector banks account for just about 18 per cent of total number of fraud cases. But the subtext is that the amount involved comes up to 83 per cent. Scams in private sector banks which record around 55 per cent of fraud cases are only worth about 13 per cent of the total amount involved.The IIM paper noted that the frauds may be primarily due to lack of adequate supervision of top management, faulty incentive mechanism in place for employees; collusion between the staff, corporate borrowers and third party agencies; weak regulatory system; lack of appropriate tools and technologies in place to detect early warning signals of a fraud; lack of awareness of bank employees and customers; and lack of coordination among different banks across India and abroad. The delays in legal procedures for reporting, and various loopholes in system have been considered some of the major reasons of frauds and NPAs. Moreover, there is a difference in the assessment of NPA value between banks and the RBI. There was a difference of around Rs 23,239 crore between SBIs NPA divergence and the RBI at the end of March 2017.After the Nirav Modi scam broke, the Finance Ministry asked PSBs to check all NPAs amounting to over Rs 50 crore for fraud, identify willful defaulters and refer the cases to the CBI while keeping the ED and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in the loop with a 15-day deadline.IDBI Bank has initiated a quality assurance audit (QAA) and roped in an external expert, to strengthen its internal audit. The scope of QAA includes review of the internal audit framework (policies, processes, procedures, reporting structures, formats etc) and integration thereof with risk-based supervision. Besides, it will also review branch risk rating framework to ensure that various business risk assessment parameters, criticality, risk weightages and audit observations reflect the risk severity of the branches, in terms of business performance, adherence to procedures and regulatory compliances.This is expected to be completed by April and we will implement the suggestions of QAA immediately to strengthen and reinforce the internal audit system with our business goals, observes Mahesh Kumar Jain, MD & CEO, IDBI Bank.Others such as Bank of Baroda and Bank of India too have drawn up action plans to strengthen the controls in the areas of trade finance, SWIFT, credit risk, operational risk besides cyber and IT risk. We will be submitting our action plan with the board for approvals, following which it will be rolled out, says a senior official of Bank of India.The RBI has set up a panel to study rising cases of bank frauds and create a blueprint to curb them. India ranks fifth in bad loans in the world. However, as long as collusion between big business and top bankers continues in a growth-at-any-cost-fuelled economy, financial frauds are likely to continue.While we expect the framework is positive in the long-run, banks will see a spike in NPAs over the next couple of quarters, notes Mitul Budhbhatti, associate director, Care Ratings. Only strict vetting procedures, monitoring and early action will end the prevalent corruption in Indias banking sector.with inputs from Sunitha Natti"

Thombre, the president of WISMA, said on Monday.In the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest sugar producing region, output is forecast to rise to 10.8 million tonnes, said Thombre, up from 8.8 million the previous year.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the national industry association for the world's second-biggest sugar producer, in March forecast a surplus of 4.5 million tonnes following output of 29.5 million tonnes for the marketing season that started on Oct. 1.The higher-than-expected surplus could pressure local prices even lower even after they fell last week to their lowest since December 2015.Globally, prices are trading near their lowest in 2-1/2 years and an expected surge of Indian exports after the country revoked its export tax last month should mean prices may drop even further.WISMA is revising its production numbers as mills are still processing sugar cane in both Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra though the processing season typically ends in March.""Sugar cane yields are much better than last year. Still many mills are operational in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and they will continue crushing for a few more days,"" said Thombre.Last week, India mandated that mills must export 2 million tonnes of sugar to lower inventories and support local prices.On March 20, the country also scrapped its 20 percent sugar export tax as an added incentive for mills to export.Domestic sugar prices have fallen 16 percent in the past six months. In addition to the oversupply amid the rising production, mills were aggressively selling the sweetener to make payments to sugar cane farmers."

Currently, the company retails specific menu seasoning mix Hapima, which is available in fried rice mix-original, hot and spicy and masala.Declining to reveal figures, he said, the consumption of Hapima in India witnessed a 200 per cent increase last year.As part of diversifying the company's products apart from Aji-no-moto, he said, the company was also retailing Blendy-3-in-1 Masala Chai and Coffee for the Indian market.""Blendy can be consumed as an instant coffee by adding a cup of hot water,"" he said.The pre-mix powdered beverages market in India is estimated at 4,100 tonne and is growing at a rate of six per cent, every year, he said.Aji-no-moto currently has about 44,000 outlets in Tamil Nadu and plans to offer Blendy in 22,000 outlets by next year.He said Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has certified Aji-no-moto while US Food and Drug Administration has given MSG as ""generally recognised as safe"".Currently, MSG was widely used in China, Thailand, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, African markets, he said."

The highest GST rate in India, while only applying to a subset of goods and services traded, is 28 per cent, which is the second highest among a sample of 115 countries which have a GST (VAT) system and for which data is available,"" the World Bank said in a report.What makes the Indian GST system even more complex is the number of different GST rates applicable on different categories of goods and services.India currently has four non-zero rates: 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent. Apart from that, several items are taxed at zero per cent while gold is taxed at 3 per cent. To make things worse, petroleum products, power and real estate have been kept outside the GST ambit.According to the World Bank's biannual India Development Update report, most countries in the world have a single rate of GST: ""49 countries use a single rate, 28 use two rates and only five countries including India use four rates,"" it said.Apart from India, the countries that use four or more GST rates are Italy, Luxembourg, Pakistan and Ghana.While the government has said it would bring down the number of rates once the new taxation system stabilises, it has repeatedly ruled out a single GST rate.""Luxury goods, sin products, and products hazardous to the environment and health can't be taxed at the same rate as 'common-man products'. Wheat, rice, sugar can't be taxed at the same rate as a Mercedes car or a yacht or tobacco,"" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said while ruling out the possibility of a single GST rate.When reached for comment, a World Bank spokesperson said that India is unique in terms of its size and scale of implementation when compared to other counties that have introduced GST.""The difference with other countries in design is therefore to be expected,"" he said.But it is not just the tax rates that distinguish India's GST system from the rest of the world. According to the World Bank report, the fiscal threshold for businesses to fall under the full GST impact is also the highest among all comparable countries.In India, businesses having annual sales above a threshold of Rs 1.5 crore fall under the full GST, and are thus liable to remit GST and eligible to deduct input tax credit.India started with a threshold of Rs 75 lakh, but in a span of a few months doubled it to Rs 1.5 crore mainly to ease the cost of compliance of small and medium enterprises, it said. ""India's new threshold is the highest among all the 31 comparator countries.""The report also took note of the disruptions in the initial days of the introduction of tax reform, but added the introduction of GST should be considered as the start of a process -- not the end.""There have been reports of increased administrative tax compliance burden on firms and a locking-up of working capital due to slow tax refund processing. High compliance costs are also arising because the prevalence of multiple tax rates implies a need to classify inputs and outputs based on the applicable tax rate.""Along with the need to apply the correct rate, firms are required to match invoices between their outputs and inputs to be eligible for full input tax credit, which increases compliance costs further,"" it said.The World Bank spokesperson said the introduction of the GST is only the start of the process that government has undertaken to implement ""this bold reform"".""Drawing actively from user-feedback, the government has been very alert to implementation challenges and continues to take steps to make GST compliance more simple and efficient,"" he added.The World Bank said while international experience suggests that the adjustment process can affect economic activity for multiple months, ""the benefits of the GST are likely to outweigh its costs in the long run"".""Despite the initial hiccups, the introduction of GST is having a far-reaching impact on reducing tax-related barriers to trade barriers, which was one of the primary goals of the introduction,"" it said."

Traditionally, it is made with a distilled beverage called shochu and sparkling water, plus some flavouring.""We haven't experimented in the low alcohol category before, but it's an example of how we continue to explore opportunities outside our core areas.""He said the move was a ""modest experiment for a specific slice of our market"".The move came amid a difficult time for the soda industry. In 2016, soda consumption in the US fell to a 30-year low as people started turning to healthier alternatives, the Daily Mail reported.In order to cater to the health conscious younger consumers, Coca-Cola has been diversifying from fizzy drinks, including buying water and tea brands.At the beginning of 2018, Coca-Cola announced that it would sell smaller bottles at higher prices rather than tinker with its famous recipe in order to conform to the new sugar tax that comes into effect in April."

Earlier this week, Pepsi also reported weak quarterly sales of sodas and sugary drinks.To stem the decline, Coke relaunched its iconic low-calorie Diet Coke in four new flavours - ginger-lime, feisty cherry, blood orange and twisted mango - earlier this year, and has focused on its non-fizzy beverages such as Georgia coffee and Glaceau vitamin water.Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the new flavours and packaging were a step in the right direction and that sales of Coke Zero Sugar were picking up following a relaunch.Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier due to ongoing efforts to refranchise its bottling operations, but beat the average analyst estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.Global volume growth remained unchanged even as North America volumes increased 1 percent.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnnie Herzog said flat unit case volume growth was a concern but positive momentum in many international markets was encouraging.The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a $3.6 billion charge related to the new tax law.

The government buying will reduce availability in the market and prices could rise,"" said Subhash Deshmukh, the cooperation and marketing minister for the state government.India, the world's second-biggest sugar producer, requires mills to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. Last year, the mills agreed to pay farmers 11 percent more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year than in the previous year.But local sugar prices have fallen 17 percent since the start of the marketing year on Oct. 1, making it difficult for the mills to make payments.A few industry officials are sceptical about the plan, not least because of the cost to the state.Maharashtra's sugar output is expected to double to 8 million tonnes in the 2017/18 marketing year ending on Sep. 30, according to the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).That means the government would spend nearly 64 billion rupees - almost $1 billion - assuming it buys nearly 2 million tonnes from the mills, said WISMA President B.B. Thombre.""Government intervention is required, but I don't think the state can allocate such a huge amount for sugar buying,"" said another industry official, who declined to be named as the government's plan has not been approved yet.The mills have to store any sugar bought by the government in their warehouses until the state liquidates the stocks in the open market, Deshmukh said.""The government will not pay for storage and it would be the mills' responsibility to keep the stocks in good condition,"" he said.Some sugar dealers said Maharashtra's purchases could prop up sweetener prices across the country and help producers like Shree Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars."

It will be a fillip to this drive against tobacco,"" said government lawyer R. Balasubramanian, who is acting on behalf of the Ministry of Health in pursuing the designation.Balasubramanian, however, said the government is not discussing banning tobacco and the goal of invoking the Roman law doctrine was only to curtail the industry's legal rights.Curbs and RestrictionsWith an aim to curb tobacco consumption - which kills more than 900,000 people each year in India - the government has in recent years raised tobacco taxes, started smoking cessation campaigns and introduced laws requiring covering most of the package in health warnings.But a court in southern Karnataka state last month quashed those labelling rules after the tobacco industry successfully argued the measure was ""unreasonable"" and violated its right to trade.The government this month appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court which put on hold the Karnataka court order. The top court will next hear the case on March 12.In its filing, the government included ""res extra commercium"" because it wants to stop the industry from pursuing such arguments again, said Balasubramanian.Seeking to apply the doctrine to tobacco, the government argued it should have the power ""to regulate business and to mitigate evils"" to safeguard public health, the court filing showed.""Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well."" -Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarettemaker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc's Indianpartner, Godfrey Phillips. (Reuters)Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarette maker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc's Indian partner, Godfrey Phillips, said the industry's legal rights would be severely limited if the court applies the doctrine to tobacco.Poovayya said he would fight the government's argument ""tooth and nail"" and make a case that taking away the industry's right to trade would imperil millions of Indian farmers who depend on tobacco for their living. The industry estimates 45.7 million people in India depend on tobacco for their living.""India is a tobacco growing country and there's a need to look at the interest of those people who are already in the sector,"" Poovayya said.""Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well.""ITC and Godfrey Phillips, as well as India's health ministry, did not respond to requests for comment.Set a precedentIndia's tobacco labelling rules, which mandate 85 percent of a cigarette pack's surface be covered in health warnings, have been a sticking point between the government and the tobacco industry since they were enforced in 2016.That year, the industry briefly shut factories across the country in protest and filed dozens of legal cases challenging the rules.The federal health ministry says stringent health warnings on packages help reduce consumption of tobacco by making people aware of its ill-effects. A government survey last year found 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of warning labels on the packets.Mary Assunta, a long-time tobacco control advocate and a senior policy advisor at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, said she had never heard of a country applying the ""res extra commercium"" doctrine to tobacco, but hoped India would set a precedent.""Such a classification will help protect tobacco control measures from being challenged, particularly for developing countries where the bulk of the smokers are,"" Assunta said.The doctrine would open the door to an outright ban on tobacco sales if a state so wished, said Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates and a specialist in Indian constitutional law.""It gives the state autonomy to completely ban trade in tobacco,"" Jain said. ""It gives governments the constitutional cover that will protect future litigation. The industry will lose significant ground as your protection of right to trade is gone."""

A record increase in sugar production during the current season has steadily depressed prices in the domestic market, with analysts observing that initial moves from the government like removing stock limits have had no effect in firming up prices.According to food ministry sources, the government is actually mulling an import duty hike from the current 50 per cent to as much as 80 per cent to protect domestic prices from falling further.Figures from the Indian Sugar Mills Association show that the countrys sugar output increased by a sharp 26 per cent to 10.33 million tonnes in the October-December period of the current season compared to 8.19 million tonnes in the corresponding period of last year.The consequence has been a sharp fall in sugar prices. Domestic wholesale prices were trading 8-10 per cent lower than October-November 2017 average prices at Rs 34.5 a kg mainly due to higher availability of sugar in initial months of crushing against lower consumption demand during winter, JM Financials analyst wrote in a note. Industry sources say mill realisations currently stand at Rs 31-32 per kg. However, prices are expected to fall even further, threatening existing margins, wafer thin in some cases.The report also noted that there was no improvement in sugar prices after the removal existing stock limits by the government in December last year. Food ministry sources say that the government will begin getting feed back from stakeholders on whether to increase the import duty from 50 per cent to maybe as high as 80 per cent to protect domestic prices.While there are no sugar imports at the current duty level, the hike will have the added benefit of blocking Pakistans planned subsidised sugar exports.The government has pegged total sugar output at 24.9 million tonnes in the entire 2017-18 season, against 20.2 million tonnes last year.

And China, a big market for Cuban cigars, has huge potential.""The US represents 39 percent of the global market for premium rum. For political reasons, Havana Club is excluded from that market and yet despite that we are among the three leading rums in the world,"" marketing director Sergio Valdes told AFP.La noche empieza con sabor a toronja. #Havana7 pic.twitter.com/MENh7Zut0U  Havana Club Mxico (@HavanaClubMx) 21 May 2016According to the latest ranking by Drinks International magazine, Havana Club is among the top three in sales globally along with Plantation and Bacardi.Cuban from CubaSince 1993, the brand has been co-owned by the Cuban government's Cuba Ron SA, and French company Pernod Ricard, the number two spirits company in the world.But the family that owned Havana Club from 1934 until Fidel Castro's revolution expelled them from the country, kept the original recipe, and in 1994 the Arechabalas sold the recipe to Bacardi, another Cuban exile company.A year later Bacardi began selling its own version of Havana Club, produced in Puerto Rico and sold in the US market, with the slogan: ""Forced from home. Aged in Exile. Forever Cuban.""Pernod Ricard dismisses the Puerto Rican version as an upstart misleading consumers, and sued Bacardi for using the trademarked brand name -- litigation that continues.""You can't talk about Cuban rum if you don't have the soil, the temperature, the humidity that exists in Cuba,"" Morales said. The aging process ""is not comparable to anywhere else in the world. It's done naturally with no additives.""And Cuba ""has very little pollution,"" he said. ""This makes sugar cane grow more quickly, with a high sugar content and low amount of substances that degrade the molasses,"" the raw material for rum.Under former US President Barack Obama relations with Washington thawed, which led Cuba Ron to register the ""Havanista"" trademark in the United States in preparation to sell a seven-year-old version in the US market if the embargo were lifted.But that seems unlikely under President Donald Trump, so the rum will just keep aging while it waits.London-based rum expert Ian Burrell told AFP the three-year-old versions of the two Havana Clubs are very different, and he can pick out the Cuban style -- aged in Scotch and Irish whisky barrels -- in a blind taste test with its light woodiness and citrus notes.The Bacardi version -- aged in barrels used for American bourbon -- ""is lighter compared to the modern-day Cuban rums. So there is a really big difference between the two products,"" he told AFP.""To me as a bartender, both rums can be used in different ways as a base for cocktails that showcase their qualities. I find the Cuban version a little sweeter on the palate with the Puerto Rican version drier.""German tourist Curosch Zandi, 41, is a fan.""Cuban rum? I don't know, there is something special about the taste. Maybe it's about the country,"" he said after buying a bottle at the Rum Museum in Havana.Rum masterThe human touch is key to a rum's flavor.""The role the rum master plays, what he has in his mind, nose, throat, identify the profile of product he wants to obtain,"" Morales said.""Without the master who controls the process from the raw material to the finished product, it is impossible to make Cuban rum.""Burrell says a rum master is ""like an artist using a palette,"" blending rums from different distilling columns to create a final product that matches the desired flavor profile.In Cuba, there are eight rum masters -- including one woman -- who benefit from a tradition passed from generation to generation.And those old white oak barrels are critical. They have been used to age whisky, and are essential to the rich color and natural flavors of the rum.The master selects the specific barrel for each batch and decides how long to age it there. For example, vanilla notes become apparent after 10 years.The highest quality rums are aged in 60-year-old barrels, in which only oxygen, time and the wood contribute to the smooth liquor's flavor."

The survey counted people with a body mass index of 30 or more as obese, and those with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or more as severely obese, The New York Times reported.Most US public health experts expressed concerns by the continuing rise in obesity among adults and by the fact that efforts to educate people about the health risks of an unhealthy diet might have probably failed.Most people know that being overweight or obese is unhealthy and if you eat too much that contributes to being overweight. But just telling people theres a problem doesnt solve it, said Dr. James Krieger, clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington and executive director of Healthy Food America, an advocacy group.The latest data from the survey comes at a time when the American food industry is calling for stronger measures to combat obesity.In the recent NAFTA (North Atlantic Free Trade Organisation) negotiations, the Trump administration proposed rules favoured by major food companies that would limit the ability of the US, Mexico and Canada to require prominent labels on packaged foods warning about the health risks of foods high in sugar and fat.""While the latest survey data does not explain why Americans continue to get heavier, nutritionists and other experts cite lifestyle, genetics, and, most importantly, a poor diet as factors. Fast food sales in the United States has risen to 22.7 percent from 2012 to 2017, while packaged food sales rose 8.8 percent,"" according to Euromonitor.The latest survey data found that American youth are faring somewhat better than their adult counterparts.In the age group between 2 to 19, 18.5 percent were obese in the 2015 and 2016, while 5.6 percent were severely obese.The study also found that the percentage of youths who are obese and severely obese rose slightly from the period between 2007-2008, but not enough to be statistically significant.One group of youths are the youngest children ranging in the age group between 2 and 5, which has seen statistically significant weight gain.Here, obesity rates rose to 13.9 percent in 2015 and 2016 from 10.1 percent in 2007 and 2008 respectively.Scholars who study childhood obesity disagree about whether childhood obesity has 'plateaued or is increasing.'We havent turned the tide. If anything, rates are continuing to climb upwards, said Dr. David Ludwig, a nutrition professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health."
5b30d9809855b71aeea8ef49,Dead and disappeared: Syria workers say French firm Lafarge abandoned them,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/mar/21/dead-and-disappeared-syria-workers-say-french-firm-lafarge-abandoned-them-1790462.html,2018-03-21,"By AFPSYRIA: Syrian mechanic Yassin Ismail appeared to have an ideal job earning good money as a supervisor for French cement giant Lafarge at the company's remote plant in the deserts of his homeland.But after war broke out and the firm took a decision to keep operations open, his relatives say his sought-after position descended into a nightmare that would ultimately lead to his gruesome murder.The choice to cling on in Syria after other international firms fled the fighting has dragged Lafarge, which merged with Swiss firm Holcim in 2015, into a spiral of scandal and recriminations that has embroiled the French state.Three French judges are investigating allegations the firm funnelled some 13 million euros ($16 million) to armed fighters including Islamic State group jihadists to keep the factory working.Six former or current top Lafarge executives have been charged with financing a terrorist organisation.Those bosses could also face prosecution for endangering the lives of their local Syrian employees after 11 of them filed their own lawsuit alleging Lafarge put the prospect of profits rebuilding Syria after the war ahead of their safety.The firm and its executives insist they treated security as a ""priority"" but a string of former employees and their relatives in war-torn Syria have detailed to an AFP investigation what they say was deadly neglect.'No other options' -The home that Ismail was building for his family in the northern Syrian town of Ain Issa remains unfinished.The two-storey building would have looked impressive in the dusty neighbourhood on the fringes of the desert some 30 kilometres (20 miles) away from the Lafarge plant at Jalabiya.But in 2013, as armed rebels and Islamists tussled for the region, the father of three young sons was detained by jihadist fighters from a group that would later change its name to IS.After several months in captivity Ismail was executed, relatives and three former colleagues said.They were told by IS that his throat was slit and body thrown into a canyon in the desert where the jihadists dumped hundreds of victims.Ismail's cousin Mustafa Yassin said that like many other workers his relative had little choice but to keep working as he desperately needed the money.""He knew that it was dangerous, but he had no other options,"" Mustafa Yassin told AFP.""The factory was located in a Kurdish-held area and IS killed him after accusing him of being a spy for the Kurds,"" added his uncle, Yassin Yassin.Lafarge knew only too well about the perils facing its employees.Foreign staff were evacuated in 2012 and an internal report documented some 12 cases of its workers being kidnapped and held for ransom by armed groups from the start of that year.Former company officials have told French investigators they paid up and got all those taken released unharmed.But they claim not to know about Ismail.LafargeHolcim told AFP this week that it had ""no knowledge of a worker for Lafarge Syria dying after being abducted"".Ismail is not the only employee who former workers say disappeared.Another mechanic Abdul al-Homada, 35, was kidnapped in 2013 in the city of Aleppo -- and later very likely killed -- after heading there to pick up his salary, four former colleagues told AFP.Homada, who a top Lafarge official has claimed was close to the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad, had to make the 150-kilometre (95-mile) trip to collect his wage after Lafarge insisted no cash be kept at its vulnerable Jalabiya plant.At the time it was common for companies to request that employees receive their pay in larger cities given the instability in the regions around.""We told Lafarge that it could be dangerous to go to Aleppo, but they refused to pay the salaries at the factory,"" said former worker Jarir Yahyaalmullaali.""He was kidnapped as he left the bank.""For Lafarge, his colleague insisted, Homada did not count because they said he was taken by the Syrian regime due to his opposition ties.As part of the French probe it would emerge that the firm eventually sacked Homada for an ""unjustified absence"".""If any of us didn't show up at the factory because of security problems they were fired,"" Yahyaalmullaali said.'Nobody warned us' -Before the war came to Syria, many ex-Lafarge employees agree, the 680 million euros the firm ploughed into the factory brought much-needed investment to the region.But when the area became a fault line between warring Kurdish, jihadist and regime forces, some say, the situation went terribly wrong.Yahyaalmullaali points to one day above all -- September 19, 2014 -- the day IS finally came.""It was neighbours who told us that IS was going to attack, no one from the management warned us, the factory manager had fled with his family,"" he said, accusations echoed by other workers.""Lafarge did not care about our safety and did not make any evacuation plan, we piled up at 29 in the three vehicles we found, and if we had stayed we might all be dead.""The account starkly contradicts Lafarge's version of the incident.In an email a few days later, the factory director Frederic Jolibois, who is among those charged, wrote to colleagues that ""we managed to get our employees out of the factory safe and sound"".But in an earlier message sent just the day before the seizure by IS, Jolibois had simply instructed to ""prepare mattresses, food, water, sugar in the tunnels"" and ""move teams there in case of clashes"".""It seems that there has been a real blindness, voluntary or not, from management on the safety of employees,"" said Sandra Cossart, director of French rights group Sherpa, which lodged the lawsuit on behalf of the ex-employees.'Accept the consequences' -The scandal around Lafarge has engulfed not just the company but also the French authorities.Former CEO Bruno Lafont, along with former deputy chief executive Christian Herrault and Eric Olsen, who took over as CEO when Lafarge merged with Switzerland's Holcim, are among those charged.Herrault has alleged that French diplomats knew about the ""shakedown"" by armed groups and urged the firm to stay put in Syria.Sherpa has asked judges to question Laurent Fabius, foreign minister from 2012 to 2016 under the former Socialist government of president Francois Hollande.Under interrogation in December Bruno Pescheux, the head of the former Syria affiliate, who has also been charged, admitted they paid $20,000 a month to IS to facilitate the plant's work in 2013 and 2014.Ultimately those payments and the risk Lafarge took were in vain -- the plant in Jalabiya slipped from their control and, according to local authorities, is now a base for US, British and French special forces who have helped push back IS.In his testimony Pescheux appeared to sum

Its favourable location on trade routes has meant a distinct Arabian influence on the cuisine, particularly that of the Muslim population of the Malabar region.There is alisa, a porridge with meat, similar to harissa, popular in west Asia, and a sort of chappati  but made with rice flour, not wheat  called ari pathiri, and of course there is the Malabar biryani, which uses cashew nuts and dry fruit.Now, if theres one perennial, unresolvable, fun and quintessentially Indian debate that comes close to which variety of mango is best, it is about which kind of biryani is tastiest. The people of Malabar have no doubt that their version is the most delectable. So much so that a couple of competing brands have battled in the courts over owner- ship of the word.Recipe for conflictThe flames were first lit in the Calcutta HC in 2012, when Parakh Vanijya Private Limited alleged that Baroma Agro Products use of the mark Malabar Gold for its special biryani rice amounted to an infringement. Parakh claimed it was using the word Malabar since 2001, and Baromas biryani rice label was identical and deceptively similar to its own mark.The Calcutta HC found some similarity between the two labels, and restrained Baroma from using the mark for the time being. A Division Bench also agreed.Baroma kept the fire burning, moving the Calcutta High Court to vacate the 2012 order, alleging that Parakh was relying on fabricated documents and that the company could not claim exclusive right over the word Malabar.In 2016, the HC sought to douse the coals and balance the interests of both parties, considering their substantial turnovers; it allowed Baroma to use the label Malabar with an increase in type size of not more than 25% of the rest of the words or letters on the pack.Now, it was Parakhs turn to strike back: the company moved the Supreme Court.On July 12, a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and R. Banumathi noted that Amalgamated Bean Coffee Trading Company manufactured Malabar Monsoon, and Tropical Retreats used Malabar Coast for its range of coffee, tea, cocoa, sugar and other products, and that the rules of registration itself were against any company claiming exclusivity over the term Malabar.Justice Banumathi, who wrote the judgment for the Bench, concluded, Since there is a disclaimer to the exclusive use of the word Malabar, the appellant has no right over the exclusive use of the word."

Inventory is rising, but mills are not exporting sugar due to lower returns,"" said one Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.India has so far contracted to export 275,000 tonnes sugar from its record production of 32.25 million tonnes, dealers said.The glut is likely to swell in the 2018-19 season starting October 1, with Indian production expected to jump by almost a tenth from the current year to between 35 million tonnes and 35.5 million tonnes, the ISMA said.Uttar Pradesh, the biggest producer, could churn out 13-13.5 million tonnes of sugar in the next year, the association said.That would be up 12 per cent from the current year, with the ISMA saying farmers have devoted a bigger area to high-yielding varieties of sugar cane.Maharashtra's sugar output is estimated at 11-11.5 million tonnes in the new season, up from 10.71 million tonnes, the ISMA said.

With an 8% increase in acreage under sugarcane and adequate rainfall expected to lead to a bumper crop, the resultant production glut could hit farmers hard in an election year.Satellite images from the latter part of June show that the total acreage under sugarcane in the country is estimated to be around 54.35 lakh hectares this kharif season, an 8% increase from the previous year, according to a statement by the Indian Sugar Mills Association.High yieldWith farmers switching more of their acreage to a cane variety with a higher sugar yield, ISMA expects mills to produce a record 350-355 lakh tonnes of sugar next year, even higher than the 322 lakh tonnes produced this year.Next year, the conditions are likely to be tougher than ever before...We expect to produce at least 90 lakh tonnes more than needed for domestic consumption, ISMA general secretary Abinash Verma told The Hindu . And we will start the next marketing season [in October 2018] with at least 100 lakh tonnes carried over from this years record harvests.In May 2018, mills pending dues to farmers had crossed Rs. 22,000 crore, according to the Food Ministry. Soon after the ruling BJP lost a key by-poll in Kairana in the heart of Uttar Pradesh sugarcane country, a slew of relief measures including a sugar production subsidy were announced.By the end of June, the arrears had dropped to Rs. 18,000 crore and is likely to drop further, partly spurred by the Centres sugar relief package. However, as farmers start harvesting and selling this years kharif cane crop from October, and mills struggle with their bloated inventory, those dues are likely to rise again to at least Rs. 25,000 crore by the summer of 2019, according to industry sources.One way to reduce that inventory and increase cash flow to mills, and ultimately to farmers, is to increase exports.We will aim to export 60 lakh tonnes next year  a huge challenge  and we will still be left with 130 lakh tonnes, said Mr. Verma."

Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamys reported statement that he would visit the coastal districts and hold a meeting with the elected representatives and officers on the problems facing the region, was a welcome one. Such a meeting should include environmentalists and experts too.He said that fishermen faced the same problems which the farmers faced. Hence, they should be provided with interest-free loans. The quota of subsidised diesel provided to fishing boats should be increased.Houses for poor fishermen under the Matsyashraya Scheme had not been provided properly in the last couple of years. Hence, this scheme should be given a fillip. Sea erosion was a regular occurrence during monsoon. Hence, construction of sea walls was a necessity here.Arecanut, paddy, rubber and coconut growers were facing many problems. The agricultural sector, which was on a decline, should be encouraged. A few environment-friendly industries should be set up in the region to stop the migration of youth from here to big cities.The ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory near Udupi should be rejuvenated. Basic facilities should be provided to the four newly-formed taluks in Udupi district. The second phase work of the Varahi Irrigation Project should be expedited. Priority should be given to developing tourism in the region to attract more tourists.If Mr. Kumaraswamy did not visit Udupi within a fortnight, then an agitation would be launched to draw the attention of the State government to the problems of the coastal districts, Mr. Suvarna said.Ajit Shetty Kirady and Manjunath Salian were present."

Indian medicines, specially cancer curing ones, are in big demand in China as they are far cheaper than their western counterparts.""We have seen China and India have reached agreement on the reduction of tariffs on medicines. For specifics, I will refer you to relevant competent authorities,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing in Beijing.""We believe expansion of imports and slashing of tariffs on anti-cancer medicines will also usher in great opportunities for India and other countries in the region,"" she added without providing any further detail.In May, China had lifted tariffs on the import of cancer medicines. It was not clear whether Ms Hua was referring to that announcement.The May announcement had, however, failed to enthuse Indian companies as they cannot legally market their medicines in China as it requires license from the country's food and drug administration.India has been demanding opening of China's IT and pharmaceutical sectors as part of measures to reduce a $51 billion trade deficit in over $84 billion bilateral trade.While announcing the agreement, Ms Hua referred to a new Chinese film on the plight of a leukaemia patient, highlighting the pressing need for China to pave the way for import of cheap Indian cancer medicines.""There is a popular movie now in China called 'Dying to Survive'. That movie is about zero tariffs imposition on anti-cancer medicines in China,"" she said.Asked whether China would cut tariffs on Indian anti-cancer medicines, she said, ""As far as I know, the pharmaceutical trade between China and India is growing continuously, and the two sides have maintained sound communication on promoting the entry of Indian pharmaceuticals into the Chinese market and carrying out dialogue and exchanges and cooperation on the pharmaceutical industry between China and India"".""The relevant departments have formulated specific measures on promoting China-India pharmaceutical trade cooperation and granting greater access to drugs from India"", she said issuing a clarification to her earlier statement in the day that both sides have reached an agreement.""It is believed that expanding and deepening China-India pharmaceutical trade cooperation will further enhance the health and well-being of the two peoples,"" she said.About the general reduction of tariffs, Ms Hua said, ""We have decided to expand our imports as well as opening up. This is what China needs in order to uphold the free trade and against protectionism. This is also in keeping up with our own pace of development and opening up.""""On July 1, the outcome of the round of negotiations under the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement released a document and we have agreed to slash tariffs by 33 per cent. So according to my understanding the slashing of tariffs by the Indian side is also part of this negotiation...We will also impose a negotiated agreed tariff rate on relevant items in accordance with our regulations,"" she said.The six member states of the agreement - China, India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Laos - will cut tariffs on a total of 10,312 taxable items, she said.Ms Hua said China has announced a series of measures to expand its opening up to the outside world, actively expand imports, significantly reduce the automobile parts and consumer goods import tariffs, also zero tariff in anti-cancer medicines.""This is a positive measure China has taken based on its own development needs.

While global consumption is still rising, the pace of growth has slowed to an average 1.4 percent in recent seasons, down from 1.7 percent over the past decade, according to researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists.That's coming at a time when production is booming, especially in India, the world's No. 2 producer. Farmers in Thailand are also collecting massive crops. World stockpiles are set to swell to the highest ever this season and stay near the record next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sugar futures in New York have already slumped 25 percent in 2018. That's the biggest loss on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 components.""Unless there's a weather issue, it doesn't look that the bulls have any hope for a sustained rally,"" said Donald Selkin, a New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which oversees about $2 billion. ""Everybody is trying to do away with sugar and sugary products. You see that in supermarkets and grocery stores. Demand is going to remain less than what's been in recent years.

The move came as short holdings increased 15 percent, while long bets fell almost 7 percent.Global production will top demand by 19.6 million metric tons in the 12 months that end Sept. 30, the biggest overhang ever, Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool said in a report last month. The excess would be more than enough to meet annual demand in China, the world's top importer.After farmers collected a mammoth crop, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said July 3 that processors are seeking to increase export quotas to a record 6 million tons. The group estimates the country's output at as much as 32 million tons, a gain of 58 percent from a year earlier. Meanwhile in Brazil, surging ethanol stockpiles and tumbling prices for the biofuel mean cane millers could process more of the crop into sugar.Weather SurprisesOf course, crops can still fail, especially if the weather turns worse than expected. Dry conditions have hurt plants in Brazil's Center-South, the world's biggest producing region. The potential for an EL Nino weather pattern later this year could also mean some damage to Asian crops.But in a market where demand slowing, small supply shocks can often be absorbed. While health concerns and taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economies, Green Pool said that these factors are now being ""replicated"" in emerging markets.""All the bearish elements that had sugar pinned down initially are still in place, and some are even worse,"" said Frank Jenkins, the president of JSG Commodities in South Norwalk, Connecticut. ""We are looking for a long period of time with a very substantial surplus. We are in the fourth or fifth inning of this bear market."

What connects the two sugar bowls  one in western Uttar Pradesh and the other in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka  are people like Singh who earn a living by making jaggery out of sugar cane. Around Holi, he arrives in Mandya with a team of 10 people and takes charge of one of the many rural jaggery units in the district, some 100 km from Bengaluru. By Deepavali, he is back in Muzaffarnagar.But Singh is not a happy man these days. Many of Mandyas famed jaggery units have either closed down or suspended operations mainly because of the fluctuating prices of the sweet lumps. A severe labour shortage is another reason. Unreliable power supply has increased the production cost as the units have no option but to run on diesel. Add to these the lack of water to support the rain-fed sugar cane crop. Now with a good monsoon in the Cauvery basin, people hope the closed units will spring back to life.Singh, who has 30 years of experience in jaggery-making, works in a unit at Dodda Byadarahalli village in Pandavapura taluk. There are plenty of orders during festivals and the wedding season, he says. But the local labourers remain unskilled and are not interested in the work. Singh earns Rs. 1,000 and his team Rs. 800 each for making 1,500 kg, or 300 boxes, of jaggery  the minimum daily production.But the prospects are turning bitter by the day. Of the 530 registered units in seven taluks of Mandya, at least 65% are facing an acute shortage of sugar cane and over 50% have become non-functional in recent weeks, say officials at the District Industries Centre and the Agriculture Department. The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee used to collect 2,400 to 2,600 quintals of jaggery a day. But now, the arrivals have dipped to between 1,000 quintals and 1,300 quintals, forcing many traders to shut shop. The still-functioning units face complaints of excessive use of chemicals.

The authorities then told them that the engine was being shifted to the station only and persuaded them to cooperate,"" a source said.Mr Jain said the engine, made for a narrow-gauge track, is card a 'captive engine' as it was kept at one place for usage, as in the sugar mill.Photographer and local heritage activist Santosh Kumar, who was among the few people who had approached the railways, seeking rescuing of this rail heritage, said all the struggle has paid off.""This step will encourage heritage preservation in Darbhanga.

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

5b506f669855b710b170d140,One Year Of GST: When Over 200 Items Became Affordable,https://www.ndtv.com/business/one-year-of-gst-when-over-200-items-became-cheaper-1876040,2018-07-01,"One year of GST: Nearly 177 items were brought from tax rate of 28 percent to 18 percentSoon after the much-awaited indirect tax reform legislation Goods And Services Tax (GST) was rolled out on July 1 last year, several stakeholders, from tax payers to common citizens, raised their eyebrows, and even expressed outrage for prohibitively high rates of some of the items especially the ones that were put in the 28 percent tax bracket. The GST was rolled out with five different tax slabs: zero percent, 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent. Though GST was appreciated as a one-stop solution to all indirect tax related woes and the problem of spate of state taxes and levies, but it was condemned for keeping nearly 250 items in the highest tax bracket, which is 28 percent.Nearly four months after the GST was rolled out, the 23rd GST Council meet that took place in Guwahati on November 10 slashed the tax rates from 28 percent to the lower slabs on over 200 items. The highest tax slab was retained only on 50 'sinful and luxury items' while nearly 177 items were rationalised from the highest tax slab to 18 percent. One of the most lauded moves during the 23rd GST Council meet was to bring restaurant bills under the 5 percent bracket from the earlier 18 percent. Though a lot of items turned cheaper, and affordable, after the GST was rolled out, there are, however, calls to bring other items such as petrol, diesel under the indirect tax regime in a bid to make them cheaper amid crude price hikes that have lately taken the fuel prices in domestic market to unprecedented levels in May this year.These Items saw price cuts during the 23rd GST meeting. Five Things To Know1. The items on which GST was slashed from 28 percent to 18 percent included wire, cables, insulated conductors, electrical insulators, electrical plugs, switches, sockets, fuses, relays, electrical connectors, electrical boards, panels, consoles, cabinets etc for electric control or distribution, particle/fibre boards and ply wood, article of wood, wooden frame, paving block, furniture, mattress, bedding and similar furnishing, trunk, suitcase, vanity cases, brief cases, travelling bags and other hand bags, cases, detergents, washing and cleaning preparations, liquid or cream for washing the skin, shampoos; Hair cream, Hair dyes (natural, herbal or synthetic) and similar other goods; henna powder or paste, not mixed with any other ingredient; pre-shave, shaving or after-shave preparations, personal deodorants, bath preparations, perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations, perfumes and toilet waters, beauty or make-up preparations, fans, pumps, compressors, lamp and light fitting, primary cell and primary batteries, sanitary ware and parts thereof of all kind, articles of plastic, floor covering, baths, shower, sinks, washbasins, seats, sanitary ware of plastic, slabs of marbles and granite, goods of marble and granite such as tiles, ceramic tiles of all kinds of miscellaneous articles such as vacuum flasks, lighters and several other things.GST rate cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent: 1.

Those who are incapable of going to FPS should get ration at their doorsteps. Assign your staff for delivery. If you cannot carry out doorstep delivery, ask the beneficiaries to assign someone to receive the ration on their behalf.""An 11-year-old girl in Jharkhand's Simdega district had allegedly died of starvation last year as her family did not get foodgrain from the PDS shop as their ration card was not linked with the Aadhaar card.Mr Paswan said that about 81 crore persons in the country were getting foodgrain at subsidised rates -- rice at Rs 3 per kg, wheat at Rs 2 per kg and coarse grains at Re 1 per kg -- which will remained unchanged till 2019.""We have issued guidelines to the states. We have told them that there should not be any death due to starvation. The central government spends a huge sum of money to give up to 90 per cent subsidy on foodgrain,"" he told reporters later.Mr Paswan said that he welcomed the Delhi government's plan to deliver ration at the doorstep of intended beneficiaries but expressed concern about the FPS dealers.""It is a good thing that they want to deliver ration at the doorsteps. But what will happen to FPS dealers? If other states want to do it, it is welcome as we will be happy that the poor get ration at their homes,"" he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had this month held a protest at the Lieutenant Governor's office over the ""rejection"" of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme.Mr Paswan also said that sugarcane arrears had come down after the government took some measures, including a Rs 7,000 crore relief package to the sugar sector.Cane arrears had increased to Rs 22,654 crore as of June 1."

It will also provide incentive for those farmers whose recovery from sugarcane will be higher than 9.5 per cent.FRP for the current 2017-18 season is Rs 255 per quintal and the government's farm advisory body CACP has proposed Rs 20 per quintal hike for the next season.In the meeting, PM Modi apprised cane growers about the various decisions taken to clear sugarcane arrears.""In the last seven to ten days itself, more than Rs 4,000 crore of arrears have been given to the farmers as a result of new policy measures enforced,"" the Prime Minister said.He assured farmers that states have been asked to take effective measures for liquidation of cane arrears.Cane arrears stood at Rs 22,654 crore as on June 1 and now have come down to Rs 19,816 crore, as per official data.To boost farmers' income, PM Modi called for use of sprinkler and drip irrigation, latest farming techniques and solar pumps as well as solar panels in their farms.He emphasised on value addition of crops, judicious use of farm waste, and up to 10 per cent reduction in chemical fertilisers by 2022.Mentioning about his recent interactions with industries, the Prime Minister said corporates have been asked to invest more in value addition, warehousing, storage facilities, better quality seeds, and market linkages for improving income of farmers.PM Modi also highlighted the steps taken by his government during 2014-15 and 2015-16 season when cane arrears had crossed Rs 21,000 crore.Elaborating on the government's plan to ensure 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol, he said it would be a long-term solution for providing stability in the sugar industry.To help loss-making sugar mills pay sugarcane growers, the centre has taken various initiatives during the last five months. These include doubling of import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, scrapping of export duty and announcement of the Rs 8,500 crore package.The package includes creation of buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar, providing soft loan of Rs 4,500 crore with interest subsidy for expansion of ethanol capacity besides a production-linked subsidy worth Rs 1,500 crore to clear sugarcane arrears of the farmers.On Wednesday, the government hiked prices of ethanol extracted from final or C-molasses by Rs 2.85 per litre to Rs 43.70 per litre and also fixed for the first time the rate for ethanol produced from B-molasses (called intermediary molasses) at Rs 47.49 per litre for the 2018-19 season beginning December.This move will help boost production of ethanol, used in blending with petrol, and also enable mills to divert some of the sugarcane juice during the surplus crop year.Sugar production of India, the world's second largest producer but the biggest consumer, is estimated to touch a record 32 million tonnes in the 2017-18 marketing year (October-September), against 20.3 million tonnes output in the previous year.This year's expected production is much higher than the annual domestic demand of 25 million tonnes. The problem of plenty has led to crash in prices of sugar below the cost of production."

From the current 80, the number is likely to be pared down to 50, sources said. This was one of the key agendas of the meeting between the Chief Minister and the senior functionaries of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- the ideological mentor of the BJP -- which took place in Delhi yesterday, the sources added. The two-hour meeting in Delhi was attended by RSS executive head Bhaiyyaji Joshi.Reducing the number of ministries will involve substantial merging and scrapping and could lead to a reshuffle. A judicious trim, which would help the government improve efficiency. could be vital at this point, in view of next year's Lok Sabha elections.Yogi Adityanath -- who replaced the government of Akhilesh Yadav following a sweeping mandate in last year's assembly elections in the state -- had formed a 47-member cabinet. But he had inherited the huge number of departments from his predecessor. Currently, at least 30 ministers hold more than one department.Last year, Niti Aayog had suggested bringing down the number of departments in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's maxim of ""Minimum government and maximum governance"". The government's policy think tank had been tasked with helping the Yogi Adityanath's government to fulfill Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of development.After that, a committee was formed under a senior cabinet minister to give recommendations in this regard. The committee had recommended that number of departments be brought down to around 35.Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of lawmakers to parliament - 80, of which the BJP had won 71 seats. Party insiders said alarm bells had started ringing when the party lost three Lok Sabha seats this year to the united forces of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati.One of the seats was Gorakhpur - held for five consecutive terms by the Chief Minister. The other was Phulpur, held by his deputy Keshav Maurya. Last month, the party also lost Kairana - a seat in the heart of UP's sugar belt -- which was seen as signal from farmers unhappy with mounting cane arrears.Yesterday's meet also discussed the matter of next year's Kumbh mela in Allahabad. The BJP is making careful preparations for the religious gathering, attended by lakhs, in view of the next year's general elections."

The rally in Roza area is PM Modi's fifth public address in Uttar Pradesh in three weeks, indicating the importance of the state - which has 80 Lok Sabha seats - in BJP's calculations ahead of the 2019 general elections. Most of the farmers who have turned up to listen to PM Modi are sugarcane farmers. The farmers have been demanding better prices for their crop. PM Modi assured them that they will be given the best facilities.The BJP in the centre will ensure respect for all farmers. This is the reason why for the families of sugarcane farmers, many decisions have been made.You will get all the profit for the sugarcane you grow.A minimum price has been fixed for sugar so that there is no scam.We are resolving to break obstacles that the previous government had placed.We decided to deposit money directly to the bank accounts of farmers. Earlier, this was given to sugar mills, but we said no.Today, farmers don't have to worry about urea. They don't have to suffer lathis; they don't have to go to the market to buy urea. Earlier, urea was illegally diverted to factories. This has stopped now.In Shahjahanpur, there is a huge fertiliser factory. From here, urea goes throughout the country.In four years, look at how much progress has been made. Before us, only 40 crore litres of ethanol was made. After our government's decisions, 160 crore litres of ethanol will be refined.Farmers have the power to make gold from soil if they get water.When we electrified villages, it was very strange to see how some parties started holding meetings and speaking against us.

Among the issues they will discuss are exports of soya, sugar and non-basmati rice and they will also look at the possible import of urea from China,"" he said.Prime Minister Modi also mentioned about the pharma sector and cited a Chinese movie titled 'Dying to Survive' which is based loosely on the role that the Indian cancer drugs play in saving the life of the main character of the movie, Mr Gokhale said, adding that it was decided that an Indian pharmaceutical delegation will visit Shanghai, China on August 21 and 22 for talks.Xi said that as major emerging market economies, as well as vindicators and contributors of the current international order, China and India should strengthen bilateral cooperation, while exploring a new model for regional cooperation, upholding multilateralism, championing economic globalization and striving for a more just and rational international order, Xinhua reported.President Xi and Prime Minister Modi will meet again at the margins of the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this year."
5b5f33799855b708a7ccd6d5,Congress has a history of creating fake issues: Arun Jaitley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-has-a-history-of-creating-fake-issues-arun-jaitley/articleshow/65126021.cms,2018-07-25,"NEW DELHI: Congress 's attempts to raise allegations of corruption with regard to the Rafale deal was a desperate attempt to create a false equivalence between the Modi government and the corruption-ridden UPA record and borrowed a leaf from the Bofors scandal , senior minister Arun Jaitley said.Jaitley said Congress had a history of creating fake issues, as when it concocted the ""St Kitts"" scandal to counter revelations of graft surrounding the Bofors deal and its kickbacks. ""A bank account was created in the name of the son of VP Singh (Congress rebel who became PM in 1989) so that the party would have a face saving argument - if we are corrupt, so are you,"" he said.The minister said a similar attempt was made in 1999 when NDA under Atal Bihari Vajpayee was set to sweep the general elections and Congress ""manufactured"" the issue of sugar export to Pakistan. The truth was that a mid-level Chandni Chowk trader was exporting sugar under open general licence to Pakistan.The Congress's moves were driven by the party's fear that the approaching national elections would become a referendum on PM Narendra Modi 's performance, the minister said. Congress was either non-existent or a poor third or fourth in states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Tripura, Odisha and the north-east, he added.In the remaining 50% Lok Sabha seats, Congress may have to concede its share to allies and might end up effectively contesting just about 225 seats, Jaitley said, pointing out these would essentially be a Congress versus BJP clash. ""For Congress, the best case scenario is to become a tailender of the federal front and concede a large political space,"" he said.Jaitley suggested that ""mid level"" leaders in the age group 65-74 were unwilling to see the forthcoming elections as a lost cause as they could not wait till 2024. ""They know that 2019 is their last chance and they will probably be time barred by 2024. They are willing for a tailender's role,"" he said.Allegations against the Rafale deal would fail as it was a government-to-government deal and UPA ministers themselves never disclosed the cost break up of weaponry. Congress's competition with the federal front was seeing it use terms like ""Hindu Taliban"" as the majority community was as much a voter as the minorities."

Of the targeted 1.34 lakh hectares, only 90,000 hectares went for groundnut sowing during the Khariff season, of which less than 40,000 hectares saw harvesting. For the ongoing Rabi crop, the groundnut acreage dipped by about 80%.Paddy too fared badly, with even the eastern mandals that are known for their success stories doing poorly this year due to a prolonged dry spell. Though the target was set at 42,000 hectares in the eastern mandals, the acreage plummeted to half, with low yields.Sugarcane farming received a big jolt in the district due to adverse climate. Generally, the district used to have sugarcane farming in about one lakh hectares, but in 2018 it slipped to below 20,000 hectares. With closure of two cooperative sugar factories and non-remunerative prices for the tonnage, a majority of the farmers resorted to growing alternate crops.Tomato fares betterThe tomato sector fared slightly better, with profits being reported in August and September which took the pressure off an otherwise bleak year that saw yields staying low. During peak season, the Madanapalle tomato market yard receives stocks to the tune of 1,200 metric tonnes per day, with transactions crossing over Rs. 1.5 crore a day. However, the daily arrivals fell below 250 tonnes a day this year.Host of issuesOther predominant issues faced by the farmers this year were an unprecedented shortage of farm workers and a failure of alternative and intercrops. Some small-scale farmers reportedly took up NREGA works and temporarily migrated to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to make a living as workers in the construction industry.Joint Director of Agriculture Vijay Kumar admitted that the year was disappointing. The major problem was the minus 48% deficit rainfall in the district. However, we are happy that farmers slowly switched over to natural farming. We have reached a target of 1.59 lakh hectares in acreage. As the declaration of drought mandals took place early in June and July, it helped several farmers stay away from their fields or going in for alternative crops, he said."

TOI revisits various big events during the year that kept the state in news for good or bad reasons.After Pakistan announced plans for the initiative, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on November 26, laid the foundation stone for the Kartarpur Sahib corridor in Gurdaspur for facilitating easy access of Sikh pilgrims to the historic gurdwara in Pakistan. Two days later, Pakistan PM Imran Khan performed the ground-breaking ceremony across the border. Though the issue was related to the long pending demand of the Sikh community, it was marred by the creditwar between BJP-SAD on one side and the Congress on the other.Cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu remained in controversy through the year. He came under attack, even from his own CM Amarinder Singh, for the first time in August after he hugged Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa during the oath-taking ceremony of Pakistan PM Imran Khan. He again visited Pakistan for the Kartarpur corridor groundbreaking ceremony in November, giving more fuel to his opponents. Whats more, he returned with a stuffed black partridge received as a gift that he wanted to pass on to Capt Amarinder but came under fire for violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. Sidhu waded into yet another controversy with his remarks in Hyderabad that his captain was Rahul Gandhi, as his cabinet colleagues sought his resignation stating that Captain Amarinder was captain of all Punjab Congress leaders. The opposition parties also attack Sidhu after the Amritsar train tragedy , where his wife was chief guest during the Dussehra celebrations.Probe panel headed by Justice Ranjit Singh (retd) looked into the sacrilege cases across the state and the October 2015 police firing incidents in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan. It submitted its report to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on August 16, which caused political storm in Punjab as it indicted ex-CM Parkash Singh Badal and various other SAD leaders and police officers, including then DGP Sumedh Singh Saini. The commissions report made a big dent in SAD's image and also led to resignation of senior Akali (taksali) leaders. Based on the report, the state government constituted a SIT to probe further. Iy also questioned Badal, his son and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh, and the then DGP among others.After facing peoples anger for sacrilege incidents, death of two youth protesting against sacrilege in the October 2015 police firing incident at Behbal Kalan and pardon to Dera Sacha Sauda head rape-convict Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the SAD leaders chose to seek atonement at Harmandar Sahib. SAD leaders, led by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, performed sewa at the Golden Temple for three days, starting December 8, for mistakes committed knowingly or unknowingly during their 10-year rule.After raising various questions on their own central leadership and seeking autonomy for the state unit, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rebel MLAs Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Kanwar Sandhu were suspended for anti-party activities on November 3. They were part of the eight rebel AAP MLAs of Punjab. But on December 25, AAP managed to win back one of the dissenters  Garhshankar MLA Jai Kishan Rori. The other dissident MLAs, led by Khaira, have announced to form Punjab Democratic Alliance after joining hands with suspended AAP MP Dharamvira Gandhi, Lok Insaaf Partys Bains Brothers, Bahujan Samaj Party and others.The year started with positive sign for the Punjab Police when it was able to gun down the most dreaded gangsters of Punjab, Harjinder Singh alias Vicky Gounder, in an encounter along with his aide Prema Lahoria on January 26 near the Punjab-Rajasthan border in Rajasthans territory. However, the state police SIT is yet to solve the January 2017 Maur blast case, in which seven were killed and 12 injured. In addition, in a grenade attack on November 18 at Nirankari Bhawan in Amritsar, three people died and over 20 got injured. The state police cracked the case with the arrest of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) members. The police also remained successful in cracking the Maqsudan police station (Jalandhar) hand grenade blasts case of September 14, with the arrest of two college students linked to a Kashmir-based terrorist outfit.It was on May 17 that hundreds of fish were found floating dead in Beas river after the leakage of molasses from the Chadha Sugar Mills in Kiri Afgana village of Batala owned by Jasdeep Kaur Chadha. Though the Punjab Pollution Control Board had in May imposed Rs 5 crore fine on the mill, the state government has so far recovered only Rs 2 crore. SAD had attacked the Congress government stating it was extending preferential treatment and giving safe passage to the mill since it is owned by family members of Paramjit Singh Sarna, chief ministers religious adviser."

But as I have to take multiple injections a day, it is not possible for me to spend time like other children , said Fathima while attending the Sweet Stars meet organized by P Kesavadev Trust in association with Kerala Type-1 Diabetes Welfare Society (T1DWS) in Kochi on Saturday.Hundreds of children across the state, who have been affected with type-1 diabetes (also called juvenile diabetes), participated in the event held at Indian Medical Association hall here.People with this condition face drastic rise in blood sugar levels in their body with insulin production even coming to zero.There are about 5,000 children in the state who have been affected with type-1 diabetes. But there is little awareness about the severity of the disease among the public and the government, said T1DWS president Vijesh T R.The condition, which even affects infants, requires checking of blood sugar level multiple times a day.The situation of parents who witness their children taking multiple injections per day to check blood sugar level is heart-breaking. Even, a two-year-old children affected by the condition have to take injection three or four times a day, said Shihabudeen, vice-president of the society.With facilities like insulin pumps, people who are affected with the disease can lead a normal life, said Dr Jothydev Kesavadev, during inauguration of the event.As part of providing free treatments to children affected with juvenile diabetes, the state government had started a project called Mitayi last year.The government had promised to distribute insulin pumps for free, but no one has received it so far.Only if the government takes proactive measures, thousands of children who have to live with this disease condition throughout their life will have a better future, added Shihabudeen."

The collector emphasized that even government officials colluding with rice smugglers would not be spared.The smart cards of department have been divided into five catagories  priority households (PHH- all commodities including sugar ), PHH-AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) (all commodities including 35 kg rice), Non-PHH (all commodities including rice), NPHH-S (all commodities except rice- option for Sugar) and NPHH-NC (no-commodity).Each card in PHH and NPHH is entitled to 20 kg of rice every month while PHH-AAY card is eligible for 35 kg free rice. Collector warned the status of the card would be changed to NPHH-NC.In Trichy, around 1.2 crore kg of rice are distributed to around 7.24 lakhs cards out of 7.95 lakh cards every month. While majority of the poor families fully utilize the free rice for their own purpose, most of middle class people neglect them citing its poor quality. However, the officials maintained that the free rice is on a par with others available in the market.Officials said the rice provided free to priority households (PHH) cards are either sold to rice mills for making flour or to some poor people. On an average, one can gather around 100 kg a month. Though we seized some quantity of rice, we could not get the details of person who sold them. We can act only on information, said an official.Social worker S N Kamakodi Sundar said the several middle class people gave the free rice to their housemaid and poor people known to them. The poor people sell the rice to the Idly batter manufacturers for Rs 10 per kg, he said.The practice of feeding the milch cows with the gruel made out of PDS rice is rampant among the farmers in villages in the district for several years now.Though the cost escalation of cow feeds is said to be one of the reasons for adding the rice gruel to the menu, the soaked rice mixed rice water (vaicha kanji) dish was being offered to the cattle previously.Since the price of normal quality cooking rice has touched around Rs 35 and the best quality reached Rs 60, people have started going for PDS rice that is available at throwaway price."

There is over Rs. 600 crore pending dues payable to farmers who have supplied sugarcane to factories. Despite agitations by the growers, the factories have refused to clear the dues. The State government should book criminal cases against the errant mill owners and see that the payment is made to the farmers, he told a press conference here on Thursday.Criticising Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for pleading helplessness in the matter, the farmer leader said that the Chief Ministers inaction amounted to betraying farmers aspirations. The Chief Minister had a meeting with sugar mill owners on the issue where the latter expressed their inability to pay the dues on the grounds that they had suffered losses. The Chief Minister rightly countered them stating that they did not pay the extra amount to farmers when they got high profits. He told them to pay the dues immediately not taking into account the profits or losses, he said. After a couple of days, the Chief Minister made a U-turn expressing his inability to persuade sugar factories to pay the dues. It is a breach of trust that the people have in the Chief Minister. As the custodian of the State administration, he has to act when the people are in trouble, he said."

However, a plan is being prepared to pay salaries to the employees for three months only, settling the dues to sell away the valuable land of the mill, Mr. Narsinga Rao alleged.

This will be the first of seven such structures in the district.The Palar sees flow for just a month every year. However, according to the WRD, the river has enormous potential for groundwater recharge. The Lower Palar sub-basin has an anicut, constructed in 1868 near Kaveripakkam, and a sub-surface dyke in Palur village to augment groundwater. There is a great need for check dams across the river to conserve water. Such structures would help groundwater recharge and improve irrigation and sustain drinking water supply through wells during drought years, said an official.Storage potentialThese structures are expected to have a storage capacity of 5,000 million cubic feet and the potential to supply nearly 345 million litres a day (mld), the official added. The check dam at Esoor-Vallipuram in Madurantakam taluk would be 694 m long and 1.50 m high. Officials said the check dam, with a potential to store 740 million cubic feet of water, would sustain supply to a minimum of seven villages. It is expected to augment water supply by 30 mld. The Rs. 33.26 crore project would benefit 654 hectares of agricultural land. We have been demanding this check dam for a decade now.It would benefit nearly 25 villages where the water table is at a depth of 30 feet. If the structure was built before the 2015 floods, it would have catered to needs for five years. Surplus water from Kolavai lake must be diverted to the Palar, said R. Murali Mohan, secretary, Maduranthagam Cooperative Sugar Mills Farmers Association.Similarly, the nearly three-decade-old proposal for Vayalur check dam has also been revived.The project would also include Rs. 33 crore in funds from the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam.The check dam on the tail-end of the Palar river would not only address seawater intrusion but also also augment Chennais water supply by 100 mld.The other check dams would come up at Vengudi and Ullavur in Wallajahbad taluk, Pazhaveli in Chengalpattu taluk and Venkatapuram in Kancheepuram taluk."

In the upcoming days he will know the seriousness of this inquiry."" ""This is not Purana (old) Pakistan where the two big (players) make a deal.Now, each and every penny will be accounted for,"" he said, referring to Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairperson Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, who is in jail following his sentencing in a graft case.Zardari's PPP and Sharif's PML-N have been repeatedly in power when the powerful military was not ruling the country.Chaudhry said that the decision was taken because ""this money belongs to the people of Pakistan."" His announcement coincided with the 11th death anniversary of Zardari's wife and two-time former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in a suicide attack during an election rally in Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007.Shortly after Chaudhry's announcement, Zardari vowed to fight his political opponents ""in court and everywhere else"".""Today, the thugs of the ladla have challenged us. We are not afraid of their tactics.""As far as Bilawal [Bhutto] is concerned, he is the son of BB (Benazir Bhutto) and I: how can you scare him?"" he asked.Zardari, who mentioned his slain wife in a speech meant to mark her 11th death anniversary in Garhi Khuda Bukhsh, criticised the incumbent Imran Khan government and claimed that they pale in comparison to the performance of the PPP government.""They did nothing in their 100 days,"" he said. ""They will be unable to run the country despite foreign support by friendly countries."" PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, after paying homage to his late mother, echoed his father's words as he too promised to ""fight the lies and controversies"" against his family.""The country's rein has been handed to an inexperienced PM today,"" Bilawal said. ""He has drowned the public in a sea of inflation within his first 100 days.He has brought the economy to a point from where there is no return,"" he said, accusing ""the puppet"" prime minister of ""wanting to turn the country into one unit and establish a one-party unit."" Bilawal labelled the JIT's report as ""lies and sham"", and claimed that it would not hold in the court where it ""would be thrown in the trash can"".According to the JIT report submitted to the apex court, the Omni Group (allegedly owned by Zardari and his close aides) acquired four state-run entities -- Thatta Cement Factory, Thatta Sugar Mills, Naudero Sugar Mills and Dadu Sugar Mills -- in Sindh at throwaway prices.The report, a copy of which is with PTI, said the payments were also made from fake bank accounts in some cases.For example, the Thatta Cement was purchased for Rs 135 million and the amount was paid through fake bank accounts.The Naudero Sugar Mills was purchased by the Omni group in 2001 for Rs 68 million, whereas the market value of the entity at that time was Rs 142.89 million, it said. Similarly, the Thatta Sugar Mills was sold to the Omni Group for Rs 127.5 million in 2013, while its market value at that time was Rs 716.11 million.The Dadu Sugar Mills was acquired by the same group in 2008 at Rs 90 million against its original price of Rs 626.70 million.The Omni group not only bought the entities at cheaper prices but also embezzled Rs 7.19 billion subsidies given by the Sindh government to the four entities, according to the JIT report submitted to the Supreme Court on Monday.The probe team said the evidence shows that Zardari and Talpur used the Omni Group as ""front"" and ""influenced the financial institutions and regulators and misused"" the Sindh government authority on a very wide scale to amass a great fortune ""consigning the masses in Sindh to utter neglect and despair"".It also said Farook H Naek, the counsel of Zardari and Talpur, was also involved in money laundering.The Omni group mostly paid the expenses of Zardari and his family and the JIT found phenomenal growth in the business of the Omni group after 2008 when Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party formed the government in Sindh.The JIT comprise officials from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency.The probe team summoned 885 persons and examined in detail 767 individuals and witnesses. It explored 11,500 bank accounts of 924 individuals and companies and compiled the report. Zardari's party has strongly rejected the report, saying it was being used to defame the former president."

The cabinet had also revised the ethanol price derived from B heavy molasses/partial sugarcane juice and 100% sugarcane juice under Ethanol Blended Petrol Programme from the prevailing price of Rs. 47.13 to Rs. 52.43 per litre, for Ethanol Supply Year 2018-19 from December 1, 2018 to November 30, 2019.For those mills that intend to divert 100% of sugarcane juice for production of ethanol without producing sugar, the ex-mill price was fixed at Rs. 59.13 per litre.The revision in ethanol price was made by the Union Cabinet after it had approved measures for sugar mills to enhance their ethanol production capacity by facilitating soft loans worth Rs. 4,440 crore to them.According to industry sources, for the next ethanol supply year 2018-19, OMCs have indicated a requirement of 329 crore litres of ethanol  more than double that of this year  which will result in a blending rate of 10%.But not all mills in the region supply ethanol to oil marketing companies. Arignar Anna Sugar Mills at Kurungulam in Thanjavur district, for instance, does not have the paraphernalia for producing ethanol, according to an official of the company.Sugar mills also face the challenge of shrinkage in area of sugarcane cultivation due to insufficient rainfall for the past few years. Kothari Sugars and Chemicals Limited, that has its production unit at Kattur near Lalgudi in Tiruchi district, for instance, had to scale down operations during 2017-18 reflecting in underutilisation of capacity in sugar, power and alcohol production, it is learnt.According to an official of another private sugar mill, the financial difficulty caused by crash in sugar prices was compounded by the payment of cane arrears pertaining to sugar season 2013-14 to 2016-17 as one time settlement.While thanking the State government for allotting Rs. 200 crores in the Budget 2018-19, as production incentive directly to be paid to cultivators, members of cane farmers associations in Karur, Thanjavur and Tiruchi districts collectively opine that the government must facilitate the mills to ramp up production capacity for ethanol as a long-term solution to address the setback caused to the sector over the last few years due to fall in sugar prices caused by bumper production."
