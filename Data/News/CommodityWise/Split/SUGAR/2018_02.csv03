His statement has triggered speculation that he might join the BJP in the general elections.Mr. Sujay Vikhe-Patil said he has the right to choose his own political party. Even if my father is in the Congress, I can pick my own political party. I will stick to my decision even if my family is opposed to it, he said.Mr. Sujay Vikhe-Patil has set his eyes on contesting the Ahmednagar South Lok Sabha (LS) seat. Besides Ahmednagar South, Shirdi is the other LS constituency in Ahmednagar district.In addition, he is the chairman of Dr. Vitthal Rao Vikhe-Patil cooperative sugar factory while his father is one of the directors.In December 2017, BJP legislator Shivaji Kardile, who is on friendly terms with the Vikhe-Patil family, had lavished praise on the younger Vikhe-Patil at an event and had even issued an offer to him to join the saffron party.At the time Mr. Kardile, who was arrested in April this year in connection with the murders of two Shiv Sena leaders in Ahmednagar, had guaranteed Mr. Sujay Vikhe-Patil of a ticket from the Ahmednagar South LS constituency if he joined the BJP.In March 2017, at a press conference in Pune, Mr. Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patils estranged older brother, Ashok Vikhe-Patil, had accused the former of being in cahoots with the BJP and of illicitly grabbing an educational institute in Ahmednagar.Mr. Ashok Vikhe-Patil had even alleged that Mr. Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil could only become the LoP in the Assembly because of the blessings of the BJP."

The module called itself Harkat-ul-Harb-e-Islam.Top sources said the highly radicalised and motivated fundamentalist module with a handler based in Syria or Afghanistan was planning to carry out spectacular terror attacks. They said the accused had recced several places in Delhi, including the RSS office and the Delhi Police headquarters. BJP functionaries were also mentioned in their chats.The module was planning to strike very soon. Its focus was on triggering remote-controlled bomb blasts and, if the need arose, fidayeen attacks. Likely targets included vital installations, security establishments, important persons and crowded places, NIAs IG Alok Mittal said. He added that no link was found to any of the NIA modules detected earlier.While 10 accused, including the mastermind and emir of the module Mufti Mohd Suhail, a native of Amroha and resident of Jafrabad, were arrested on Wednesday, six more suspects are being examined. The accused and suspects, mostly aged 20-30 years and from the middle-income group, appeared to be highly radicalised, Mittal said.NIA sources added that while Suhail was in touch with a foreign-based Islamic State handler, who initially radicalised him by sharing literature on IS and extremist content through online resources, the other accused were motivated by Suhail who even gave them kunya (Arabic) names to confirm their allegiance to IS.The module had members like one Zubair who allegedly stole family gold to raise funds. A senior officer of UP police said Amroha and other areas like Shamli presented a tempting opportunity for those who sought to use the madrasa-mosque network to radicalise people.Importantly, those arrested included a civil engineer studying at a private university in Noida and a BA student in Delhi University, apart from a garments dealer, welding shop owners and an autorickshaw driver.The success spelt a big relief for the security establishment as well as the political leadership as a terror strike could have besmirched the Modi governments tough-on-terror credentials in the run-up to Lok Sabha polls.The IS handler, possibly based in Syria or Afghanistan  NIA sees the latter as more likely  first worked on Suhail over a month. After Suhail was convinced to embrace the IS ideology, the handler told him that if he wanted to carry out attacks within India, he would have to arrange like-minded people as well as funds, explosives and weapons.Sohail chose to work with young men known to him in Amroha and Jaffrabad, first motivating them for jihad and then directing them to arrange the resources for attacks. The foreign-based handler too kept directing Suhail on dos and donts. For instance, he asked Suhail to abandon his plan to make a suicide vest, saying it was too much of a risk, an investigator told TOI.The NIA hopes to retrieve WhatsApp and Telegram chats from phones seized from the accused. Thanks to the surprise elements of the raids, the accused did not get the opportunity to delete the data.Interestingly, two ISJK (IS-Jammu & Kashmir) terrorists arrested by Delhi Police in September 2018 had admitted to having sourced their weapons from Amroha.While this is not the first time an IS-inspired group has been busted, given the crackdown on a pan-India module in early 2016 and subsequent neutralisation of modules in Telangana and Kerala, the advanced stage of terror plotting is seen as cause for worry. It was planning not just a few but a huge number of bombs blasts, Mittal said, citing the recoveries.The seized items included 25 kg of explosive material, including potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, sulphur and sugar paste, 112 alarm clocks, 51 pipes, mobile phone circuits, remote control switches, steel containers and electric wires. Also, a dozen pistols, a country-made rocket launcher, bullet-proof vests in the making, over 90 mobile phones and 134 SIMs, mostly obtained with fake documents, Rs 7.5 lakh in cash and incriminating IS literature were seized.In Video: NIA raids 16 locations in UP, Delhi; 5 suspects held"

The Water Resources Department (WRD) is expected to begin work to build one at Esoor-Vallipuram in January. This will the first of seven such structures in the district.The Palar sees flows for just a month every year. However, according to WRD, the river has enormous potential for groundwater recharge. The Lower Palar sub-basin has an anicut, constructed in 1868 near Kaveripakkam, and a sub-surface dyke in Palur village to augment groundwater.There is great need for check dams across the river to conserve water. Such structures would help groundwater recharge and improve irrigation and sustain drinking water supply through wells during drought years, said an official.Storage potentialThese structures are expected to have a storage capacity of 5,000 million cubic feet and the potential to supply nearly 345 million litres a day (mld), the official added.The check dam at Esoor-Vallipuram in Madurantakam taluk would be 694 metres long and 1.50 metres high.Officials said the check dam, with a potential to store 740 million cubic feet of water, would sustain supply to a minimum of seven villages. It is expected to augment water supply by 30 mld. The Rs. 33.26 crore project would benefit 654 hectares of agricultural land.We have been demanding this check dam for a decade now. It would benefit nearly 25 villages where the water table is at a depth of 30 feet. If the structure was built before the 2015 floods, it would have catered to needs for five years.

Consequently, the 1934-established mill has been registered as a sick unit with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).Mysugar, one among the oldest operating mills in Asia and one on which farmers of 102 villages in the district are dependent for their livelihood, recently resorted to laying off employees through VRS.M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, managing director of Mysugar, said the management would initiate measures to increase the mills profitability. A proposal is being prepared to set up a distillery (with a capacity of at least 80 kilolitre a day), produce ethanol, generate power, and enhance the production capacity.Furthermore, an ambitious plan of generating power has remained idle for over a decade. Mysugar established a co-generation unit in 2007 with then aim of producing at least 13 MW of power a day. But, in spite of overhauling works on several occasions, the mill never produced power.We will take measures to establish the distillery and commence power generation, Mr. Nagabhushan told The Hindu on Tuesday.Quantity enhancementCurrently, the mill is crushing cane at an average quantity of 2,200 tonnes a day. It is expected to be increased by at least 40%, to five lakh tonnes a day, during the crushing season 2019-20.The reorganising and restructuring of all operational activities will commence shortly, and shall be completed before the beginning of next season. The mill will be revived on the lines of Central public sector units, Mr. Nagabhushan said.On privatising the mill, Mr. Nagabhushan said: Only cane harvesting and transportation processes will be outsourced from the crushing season 2019-2020 as one of the revival or reformative measures.To a query, another senior officer, on condition of anonymity, said: The laying off of regular employees will not affect sugar production. The newly installed crushing unit is capable of crushing six lakh tonnes of cane in a season. Merely 20 employees can operate it."

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited. DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat. The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages  all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.Apart from selling food thats high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy, said Prasad.The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

The cyclothon is aimed at inspiring people for leading a life free from diseases by cascading the message of Eat Right India to every corner of the country. In Jaipur, the cyclothon will reach on December 29. It is a national campaign for creating awareness on importance of right eating habits, said Dr Ravi Prakash Mathur, additional director (rural health), health department.During yatra in Jaipur, different activities will be held on food safety and healthy diets in the context of high burden of foodborne diseases, under-nutrition, micro-nutrient deficiencies and growing incidence of obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Eat right theme includes, eating healthy, eating safe, eating fortified, no food waste, cycling and brisk-walking.Under eating healthy, message will be sent to people for eating a balanced diet, reducing foods high in fat sugar and salt and eliminating trans-fats. Under safe food, the cyclothon will make people aware on personal and surrounding hygiene, safe food practices, combating food adulteration and repurposing of used cooking oil. Cooking oil should ideally be used for frying only once otherwise harmful particles may be formed that are hazardous to health. This oil can, instead, be repurposed and used as biodiesel, says one of the messages under safe food that will be promoted during cyclothon.Moreover, officials said that the emphasis will also be on fortification of food by adding useful supplements to tackle micronutrient deficiencies. Also, cyclothon will encourage people for cycling and brisk walking as cycling is an excellent method to reduce weight if combined with a healthy diet. The official said that the focus will be on cycling as it lowers the risk of diabetes. Regular cycling stimulates and improves the heart, lungs and circulation, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Regular cycling reduces the risk of breast and colon cancer. Brisk walking reduces blood pressure, lowers cholesterol and lowers the risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers."

The high court expressed surprise at the fact that the law department had not responded to a notice sent to it through registered post when the case was last heard on January 4, 2013.The division bench of chief justice K S Jhaveri and justice K R Mohapatra posted the matter in the last week of January 2019, giving the law department time till then to file a counter-affidavit to the PIL. The food supplies and consumer welfare department, however, had earlier filed a counter-affidavit to the PIL.The PIL  filed by high court lawyer Dillip Kumar Mohapatra in 2011  requests the court to direct the state government to grant stipend to young lawyers with an annual income of less than Rs 24,000 from the date of their enrolment. Most law students start their profession as lawyers after paying a huge amount (nearly Rs 23,000) towards registration fees for enrolment with the Orissa State Bar Council, incurring loans from their friends and relatives.The petition contends that it is difficult for young lawyers to survive after starting practice at the high court in Cuttack or the other district headquarters as most of them hail from poor families in rural areas. It urges the state government to provide essential commodities (wheat, rice , sugar, kerosene and so on) to junior lawyers at subsidized rates. In a counter-affidavit, the deputy secretary of the food supplies and consumer welfare department, Manjulata Swain, said, There is provision for establishment of retail shops in an area having at least 500 consumers in all gram panchayats/wards throughout the state. The advocates, if eligible, and bonafide Above Poverty Line (APL) consumers/card holders may get legitimate quota of essential commodities such as wheat and kerosene oil from the respective retail shop near their residence. She clarified that only Below Poverty Line (BPL) card holders were entitled to get rice, sugar and kerosene oil at subsidized rates.The PIL also urges the state government to build hostels for junior lawyers and law students in Cuttack and other districts."

Also, ponk, which was selling at Rs500 per kg until a few days ago, is now available for Rs400 per kg in the city. Ponk, tender grain of jowar, is plucked green to be consumed with pepper, green chili, garlic chutney and sugar balls.Alpesh Ponkwala, a ponk trader, said, Youngsters dont have that much interest in ponk. The major reason for this is its quality has been regularly deteriorating with each passing year. Jowar farmers like producing thick grains which do not taste good to the youngsters.Kanti Patel, another ponk trader, said, Youngsters like pizzas and burgers and ponk for them is a weird food.Tejshree Marfatiya, a college student, told TOI, When we were young, we ate lots of ponk as it tasted sweet then. Nowadays, it is tasteless and so we dont like it. However, we dont mind eating ponk pattice.Ponkwala said, We had good harvest of ponk and our stock will last up to January 15. However, we are managing on small profit margins because there is not much demand this season for it."

(Mysugar), the lone State-owned sugar mill, had hurriedly offered voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to employees by keeping the district administration and farmers leaders in the dark.The mill, established in 1934, is one of the oldest operating sugar mills in Asia. It is the lifeline of cane growers in 102 villages of Mandya, Srirangapatna, Pandavapura, and Maddur taluks.Around 35,000 families are directly or indirectly depending on it, as the cane cultivation area coming under its jurisdiction runs up to 49,000 hectares. Around 95,000 people, from cane growers to farm labourers, depend on Mysugar for their livelihood, and thus its closure is expected to hit the economy hard.Barring a few occasions, the mill had continuously produced sugar since 1934, crushing several crores of tonnes of cane. Its golden period was between 2002-03 and 2012-13, when it produced 23,87,695 tonnes of sugar, said an officer familiar with the production activities.Speaking to The Hindu on Monday on condition of anonymity, the officer added, Since 2002, the highest production  of 4,68,450 tonnes  was in 2006-07, while the lowest  of 26,754 tonnes  was in 2003-04.Privatisation moveClearly, the VRS offer is a step in an effort to privatise the mill, as the government is unable to face the huge financial losses. Of the 323 regular employees, nearly 70% opted for VRS, many unwillingly. The 30 contractual employees and 150 daily wage labourers remaining at the mill are less experiencedand cannot operate the mill. Hence, privatisation is the only option left before the management, the officer said.Currently, the mill has to settle dues to the tune of Rs. 18 crore to cane suppliers. Chances of the mill commencing crushing activities in 2019-20 are bleak given the number of regular employees who have been relieved on VRS, another officer said.ExtensionMeanwhile, following the instructions of Deputy Commissioner N. Manjushri, the mill has decided to extend the crushing period till December 31, sources said.Initially, it had decided to suspend cane crushing from Monday in spite of sugarcane on 26,000 hectares remaining unharvested. But Ms. Manjushri instructed the management to crush the produce waiting to be harvested, sources said.Since 2002, the highest production  of 4,68,450 tonnes  was in 2006-07, while the lowest  of 26,754 tonnes  was in 2003-04officer associated with Mysugar"

Singh, however, said he was not going to join any other party and that he had full faith in the CMs leadership.The administration (in Siwan district) is keeping quiet even as land belonging to a moribund sugar mill is being encroached upon by the mafia. When the people protested, the cops registered cases against 200 of them. They are being harassed, said the MLA. All my efforts to intervene on the peoples behalf have failed. I cannot show my face to the people of my constituency when this is the situation despite my party being in power, he added.JD(U) state president Vashistha Narayan Singh sought to downplay the MLAs resignation, which would further weaken the thin majority the states NDA government currently has. There is no question of the MLAs resignation being accepted. He has been a dedicated soldier of the party, and his concerns would be addressed, he said.The Opposition RJD and Congress attacked the Nitish Kumar-led government over the JD(U) legislators allegations. If an MLA of Bihars main ruling party faces such a sorry state of affairs because of the land mafias excesses, the general public can hardly hope for anything good from this government, said RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav.Nitish Kumar, who holds the home department, has utterly failed to maintain the rule of law in Bihar. He has no time for this department. It is time Bihar got a dedicated home minister, said senior Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra.JD(U) sources said the aggrieved MLA has sent his resignation to the partys state president and Governor Lalji Tandon. The MLA has no intention to quit. For an MLAs resignation to take effect, it has to be sent to the Assembly Speaker, said a JD(U) leader."

Park Street, the epicenter of the Boro Din (as Christmas is known in Bengal) has been decked up as even the state government has jumped into the celebrations, like it did in the Bijoya Dashami celebrations. Residents are lining up for music and cultural festivals mushrooming around the state. Although its in celebration mode, the government has also stepped up vigil and have placed human and mechanical measures to minimise incidents of drunk driving.Rosogolla fest to mark its 150 yearsA three-day rosogolla festival will be hosted to mark the 150 years of the invention of Bengals rosogolla by its inventor Nobin Chandra Das. The festival comes a year after the state received the Geographical Indication tag for Banglar rosogolla or Bengals variant of the sweetmeat. Sweetmeat traders from across the state will showcase their products in the Baghbazar O Rosogolla Utsab held with the state governments support. Das had invented the Bengal variant of the sweetmeat at his sweet shop in the northern part of the city in 1868 with fragmented crumbs of cottage cheese and sugar syrup. The origins of the sweetmeat led to a dispute between Odisha and Bengal last year with both states claiming the Geographical Indication tag for it.Kolkata air quality becomes severeAs the city braces for the festive season, the AQI of north Kolkatas Rabindra Bharati University touched the severe level of 411 PM 2.5 whereas that of Victoria Memorial read very poor with an AQI of 355. The air quality of the city has seen a sharp dip this year even beating Delhi during the Durga Puja to Kali Puja festive season. Environmentalists say the state government is doing too little to mitigate the problem. Though the administration had banned firecrackers during Diwali, revellers had ignored the ban and no steps are being taken to curb vehicular pollution.Sixth E-W metro train reaches cityThe sixth of the 14 metro rakes requisitioned from Bengaluru-based PSU Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) reached the city for operations in the Salt Lake to Howrah Maidan East West phase of Kolkata Metro.

Yogi, who unveiled a statue of former prime minister and farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh in Patla village on the occasion of Kisan Diwas, also said that directions have been issued to clear all pending dues of cane farmers by December 31.Weve received a proposal for investing Rs 5 lakh crore in UP. An investment of Rs 1 lakh crore will be made in January itself. This will be pumped into industries which will generate employment and job opportunities for the youth. Farmers will benefit. Cane farmers who have to run from pillar to post for getting their dues will have the money transferred directly to their homes, said Yogi.Earlier this year, the state government had held an investment summit in Lucknow where various companies had pledged crores as investments across various sectors.The chief minister said Rs 44,000 crore as dues of cane farmers have already been cleared till date by his government. All sugar mill owners have been directed to clear remaining total dues of Rs 1,000 crore by December 31. There will be two roads open for them. Either they clear the pending dues of cane farmers or they will have to land up in jail, said Yogi.Yogi recounted a slew of welfare measures undertaken by the state government as well as the BJP-led NDA government at the centre towards the welfare of farmers. He also harped on the job opportunities created by his government for the youth in UP.Our government has created 92,000 jobs in the police department. Out of this, 42,000 posts have already been filled. In the next phase, an additional 50,000 posts in the police department will be filled up. We have also created 79,000 posts for teachers in various categories. There will be no foul play in employment opportunities for the youth. Anyone trying to fiddle with job opportunities for the youth will land in jail and his property will also be confiscated, said Yogi.Yogi laid foundation stone for infrastructure projects worth Rs 168.68 crore in Ghaziabad, including a political training institute, to come up at a cost of Rs 130 crore. He also formally commissioned projects worth Rs 55 crore in the city that had already been completed. After the public meeting in Patla, the chief minister flew to Indirapuram on a chopper where he participated in the ongoing Uttarakhand Mahagothik Mela.The CM also laid the foundation stone of the new bridge over Hindon river on GT Road. It will be constructed at a cost of Rs 19.43 crore after dismantling the old British-era bridge that has been lying closed for the past one year.The project will be undertaken by UP State Bridge Corporation Limited. The Ghaziabad Development Authority has decided to provide funds for the project after the state public works department backed out."

Vijayendra, State BJP Yuva Morcha General Secretary, dismissed as false and baseless the reports appearing in a section of electronic media that he was meeting BJP State Vice-President B. Sriramulu to re-launch Operation Kamala.Responding to questions here on Sunday, Mr. Vijayendra said that he was currently touring the State to organise and strengthen the Yuva Morcha with an aim to win more number of seats for the party in the 2019 elections to the Lok Sabha and ensure that Narendra Modi becomes the Prime Minister again.He also made it clear that he had devoted himself to the role he was assigned by the party high command and had stuck to that. He also made it clear that the BJP did not want to deploy Operation Kamala as it was not required now. He reiterated that news about this in a section of electronic media was baseless and false.Mr. Vijayendra criticised the coalition Congress-Janata Dal (S) government for not responding positively to the problems being faced by the people and also farmers owing to severe drought condition and sugar factories not clearing their dues.Over 100 taluks have been declared drought-hit and more than 1,000 villages are facing severe drinking water crisis. Yet the governments response is lukewarm without taking adequate measures to tackle the problems which is unfortunate and painful, Mr. Vijayendra said.Taking a dig at the government for not giving priority to discussing the problems facing North Karnataka and finding solutions during the just concluded Legislature session in Belagavi, Mr. Vijayendra charged that the government with failure to give convincing reply on the steps taken to waive farm loans and also tackling drought.Later, Mr. Vijayendra addressed a party workers meeting."

Surprisingly, sugarcane growers and Deputy Commissioner N. Manjushri were not invited to it or consulted on the decisions.Mysugar managing director M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, chief administrative officer R. Aishwarya, accounts officer Somaiah, and three representatives of different employees associations had attended the meeting.Saying that the mill has been running on losses for years, the management decided to offer VRS to employees on payroll. In spite of their unwillingness, over 70% employees opted for it, said an officer.Speaking to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, the officer said, There are 323 regular employees and they were given merely five days to opt for VRS. Initially, they were told to apply before December 15. Later, the date was extended to December 17.The regular employees will get service/retirement benefits, and some additional amount ranging between Rs. 2 lakh to Rs. 8.5 lakh, based on service period. Others will not get anything. At present, the mill has 30 contract employees and 150 daily wage workers.Privatisation plan?Over Rs. 200 crore has been spent on the mill in the past decade for its revival. The State government is keen to privatise it because of heavy losses. Thus, it was decided that crushing activities would be stopped from December 24, the officer said.Mysugar is registered as a sick unit with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). The boards clearance is mandatory to shut it down. So far, the government has not approached the BIFR over this. But, according to the officer, it is likely to approach or search for a prospective private firm to operate the mill. There is no option other than closing the mill if the search does not yield results, the officer said.Mysugar is expected to make alternative arrangements to crush the unharvested cane at other mills.Meanwhile, the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) has expressed anguish over the mill suspending crushing activities and laying off employees.The mill has properties at prime locations, including near the BBMP headquarters in Bengaluru. Land-grabbers are eyeing them. Hence, a conspiracy has been hatched to close down Mysugar, alleged Shambhunahalli Suresh, president of KRRS, Mandya. He also asked how the Mysugar management could take such important decisions without consulting with the Deputy Commissioner, KRRS, and cane suppliers.Despite multiple attempts to reach him, Mr. Nagabhushanwas not available for comment."

Out of this, 114 applications for a loan amount of Rs 6,000 crore has been approved, the sources said.Sources further said the ministry is planning to seek a Cabinet approval for the balance 168 applications and sanction an additional soft loan of Rs 7,400 crore.The subsidy burden would be Rs 1,600 crore for the balance loan amount, they added.A proposal is being prepared to seek approval for additional soft loan under the scheme as well as amend the rules to allow even grain-based distilleries take the benefits, the sources added.Currently, molasses-based distilleries are allowed under the scheme. The entry of standard distilleries will help diversion of more cane during surplus season.Ethanol extracted from sugarcane will be used for blending in petrol and will provide cane farmers a remunerative price for their crop. Ethanol doping in petrol will also help the country cut its oil imports.India, the world's second biggest producer, is likely to produce 31.5 million tonnes (MT) of sugar in 2018-19 marketing year, slightly lower than 32.5 MT last year, according to industry body ISMA's forecast.

I have also written to the regional passport officer, Delhi, for forfeiting the passport of Umesh Modi as he may leave the country.Explained Just before CMs visit to Ghaziabad Sources said the Ghaziabad district administration was directed to initiate prompt action against the sugar mill and its owner as Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to arrive in Ghaziabad Sunday. There, he will be unveiling the statue of biggest farmer leader of western UP and former prime minister, Chaudhary Charan Singh. Adityanath will be addressing farmers (in western UP, majority do cane farming). During his speech, he is expected to announce the action taken against the sugar mill, and other such defaulters.On Friday, a team of Ghaziabad district administration began the process of attaching properties of Umesh Kumar against dues on his Modinagar mill.AdvertisingWe have so far attached around 7,000 quintal sugar and three offices of the mill including that of the finance officer and occupier officer.

The administration is looking for other properties of Modinagar Sugar Mill for attachment, said Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ritu Maheshwari.In his letter to Rana, sent on December 2, Satya Pal Singh, who is the BJP MP from Baghpat, said farmers are regularly taking up the issue of pending sugarcane dues and that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had announced twice that their demand must be looked into.His letter further said that in the 2017 manifesto, BJP had promised to pay the dues within 100 days. Speaking to The Indian Express, Singh said, I had come to know through media reports that the party had paid the price of losing Kairana bypoll following non-payment of dues.The Union minister also requested that lookout notices be issued against sugar mill owners with pending dues at every airport.The sugar industry and cane development department said recovery certificates have been issued against nine sugar mills  including two of Umeshs mills  having maximum outstanding cane dues.

The words describe this festival perfectly and the celebrations are in full swing in my house. The Christmas tree is up with blingy lights and lots of gifts are waiting to be unwrapped. At school, the kids are learning a new carol every day and belting it out proudly at the top of their voices just when I need a moment of peace. And, yes, most importantly, the mistletoe is ready for some loving kisses! For me, Christmas is about good food, wine and being with the people I love.Every person has his or her own way of expressing their love and gratitude. For me its all about cooking and sharing the pleasures of good food with my family and hosting dinner parties for friends.As you can imagine, my kitchen is super busy these days and the alluring aroma of whatever is baking in the oven fills the house, replacing the cold air with a cosy warmth. I have been doing a line-up of dinners in red, white and green. My favourite is this Portobello Mushroom, Baby Spinach And Roast Tomato Quiche in a light wholewheat crust. I serve it with a millet and greens salad for a healthy wholesome dinner.The Mexican Tortilla Lasagne is my take on the overdone Mexican fajitas and tacos. I make it just like a lasagne, but replace the pasta sheets with tortilla wraps and make multiple layers with Mexican black bean filling, fresh spicy salsa and grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Cover with foil and bake in the oven at 180C for 20 minutes and a further 10 minutes uncovered. Its delicious comfort food!Making mulled wine and stocking up bottles of it is an annual event at home. It is as simple as slow-cooking red wine with a bit of sugar, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, orange and lemon zest and some vanilla till the flavours have all come together. Aaah, cant you smell it already?Talking of mulled wine, I want to share with you my classic Berry Mulled Wine Sauce recipe. I make a jar of this goodness and keep it in the fridge. Just heat it up and serve over ice cream, cheesecake, panna cotta or simply sandwich it between two cookies for that little bite of indulgence. You can use strawberry, blueberry or any other berry, frozen or fresh.My Spiced Apple Cake is adapted from chef Ottolenghis recipe (you would have seen him on the popular MasterChef Australia last season). So easy to make but so delicious and good-looking. Ditch the classic apple pie and try making this, it definitely makes a humble apple look super glamorous in this glitzy season! Enjoy it as it is or heat it up and pair it with some vanilla ice cream.While we have sorted out the adults with some mulled wine, we need something special for the little elves to drink while hopping around the Christmas tree. Since strawberries are in season now, I created a fun Strawberry Mint Lemonade that is a big hit with my kids. Add in some fresh mint and green lime slices and you have a beautiful pop of colours to fit into the festive spirit. And if you spike it with a dash of vodka or white rum, you have the perfect cocktail.I hope you enjoy making and sharing these goodies. As for me, I am off to southern Italy to celebrate Christmas with my husbands family. And what is it all about? You guessed it, eating, drinking and more eating! Seasons greetings and happy holidays from me to you!Spiced Apple Cake Image credit: Natasha CelmiSpiced Apple CakeIngredients130g salted butter at room temperature150g castor sugar3 eggs, whisked2tsp vanilla essence300g all purpose flour1tsp baking sodatsp salt200g plain yogurtFor the apple mix3 large apples, cut in wedges100g brown sugartsp cinnamontsp cardamom, crushedtsp lemon zestMethodPreheat the oven to 160C.

Santhanam, president of A. Karisalkulam Farmers Association in Thiruvenkatam taluk, said agriculturists of A. Karisalkulam, Azhagapuri, Kuruvikulam, Melaneelithanallur and the surrounding villages had cultivated maize on over 7,000 acres as this region would not get sufficient rains even during the northeast monsoon. When the FAW attack was noticed, the farmers applied two rounds of pesticides, but in vain.The FAW attack cannot be controlled with the pesticides now available in the market. We, after getting the prescription of the Agriculture Department officials applied the pest, but of no use. We used to harvest 30 bags of maize per acre and would have got Rs. 1,400 per bag. Since the pest attack has caused huge loss to the farmers, the government should bail us out with adequate compensation, said Mr. Santhanam while displaying the maize suffered FAW attack.He said the each maize farmer, who had suffered 70% to 100% loss, should be given a compensation of at least Rs. 10,000 per acre from the government and the insurance benefits from the insurance company.Ms. Shilpa said the officials had already started surveying the affected ranches and hence the report on the quantum of crop loss due to FAW attack would be forwarded to the government.Its up to the government to take a policy decision on giving compensation for maize farmers, she said while urging the farmers to insure their crop for getting insurance benefits.When the farmers complained that most of them, who had insured their crop in 2016  2017, were yet to get the insurance benefits, Ms. Shilpa said the details about the farmers who were waiting for the insurance benefits had been compiled and sent to the insurance firm.A team of insurance firm officials from Delhi recently visited the district to get the details and hence the insurance benefits for 2016  2017 will be disbursed shortly. Moreover, list of the farmers who are yet to receive get the benefits for the year 2017  2018 even after insuring the crop has been prepared. Since were constantly in touch with the insurance firm officials, the farmers will get the benefits, Ms. Shilpa assured.When the farmers including P. Perumbadaiyar of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam, urged the officials to snap their ties with private insurance firms and rope in a public sector undertaking for insuring the crops for the timely disbursal of benefits, officials did not give any reply.On the non-availability of adequate numbers of paddy harvesters with the Department of Agricultural Engineering, the officials replied that proposal in this connection would be forwarded to the government.The involvement of brokers in the paddy direct procurement centres (DPC) and delayed disbursal of money for the paddy procured at DPCs were also raised in the meeting by affected farmers.The sugarcane growers also could not get any proper reply for their long pending grievance of the whopping arrears to be settled by a sugar factory at Vasudevanallur for the sugarcane it had procured."

Paul turned up armed with a High Court order allowing his entry into the church to offer the holy mass. The priest stayed put in his car in front of the church for well over 24 hours by the time he was moved to the Medical College Hospital, Kolencherry, following an order issued by the District Collector .With the car running short of fuel, Fr. Paul had to switch off the air-conditioner and keep the doors open to escape the heat. A medical team found his blood sugar levels and blood pressure alarming and recommended immediate hospitalisation.Fr. Paul, alleging a police drama to shift him, declined to cooperate with the doctor unless he was shown the Collectors order. He agreed to follow the medical instructions only after seeing the order around 5 p.m.Despite having a court order I have been forced to remain out while those violating the court order are having a free run inside. Either the police should facilitate my entry into the church as per the court order or they should give me in writing to return. Till then I will remain here, Fr. Paul told The Hindu over the phone on Friday morning.His shifting was celebrated by the Jacobites who had formed a human wall to prevent the priest from entering the church. There will be no change in our stance even if the Ramban is to return later as this remains our church, a Jacobite faction office-bearer said.The police are responsible for protecting the life no matter whether that is of a priest or not. He had high blood pressure and we could not have risked letting him stay there without medical treatment, K. Bijumon, Muvattupuzha DySP, said denying Fr. Pauls charge."

On specific requests, a few homes and traditional bakeries also bake yule logs and stollen loaves. The stress is on offering them sans trans fats, preservatives or additives.Traditional bakeries in the city have begun to make their special plum cakes with the year-aged plum compote. The very method of aging the plum compote has been kept traditional by soaking dry fruits and nuts in spices and alcohol, so it is marinated and plumped up. It is marinated for at least six months. The more aged, the better, said Praveena Balaji, founder Bakeroe.The more aged the compote, the better the flavour. This way, the cake gets its colour from dates and black rum, flavour from the spices and fruits and is preserved by honey, liquor and brown sugar . We dont use trans fats, preservatives or any colouring agent, Praveena said.A good aged plum cake is still the favourite when it comes to gifting, despite the presence of so many newer bakery items. We have stopped making Christmas hampers, because we realized that most of our customers still prefer only the traditional plum cake, said Krishnan Ananthan, of La Madeleine patisserie. They like it attractively packaged.Plum puddings, stollen loaves and chocolate-based desserts are also among popular gifts. We have plum puddings which are popular, said Anbuchelvan of Chocko Chozha. Besides this, we offer brownies, macaroons, tarts, healthy cakes and fudge, which are popular orders for Christmas parties and corporate gifting options. To add a festive touch, we make a Santa Claus deliver the orders at peoples doorsteps."
5ce564aae8e3fc56af40bb52,From the Granny’s kitchen,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/from-the-grannys-kitchen/article25803972.ece,2018-12-22,"I first heard about Sly Granny from a young friend some weeks ago. She had gone to the Khan Market eatery, and enjoyed her chorizo and baby potatoes with wilted spinach and poached egg so much that she had a second helping of the same dish. I am, at present, not on speaking terms with chorizos and other porky products, but still thought Sly Granny deserved a dekko. Then, just a few days ago, we got a call from a dear friend. Were we free to have lunch with her and her daughter (our much loved niece)? The answer to that was pithy: Yes, we said.So there we were in Khan Market one sunny afternoon, looking for Sly Granny. I asked around, and was told to take the middle lane, turning left if we were approaching it from Bahrisons. Sly Granny is on the left, on the first floor. The address is 4, Khan Market, and the phone number for booking your tables (which you should do, because it was rather busy on a weekday, too) is 011-4905 8941.The dcor is pleasing, with nice old-style posters on the staircase and the walls. And on the window sills they have lots of fresh herbs growing, which are added to salads and other dishes, we were told by the helpful servers. Sly Granny, which has a branch in Bangalore, opened in Delhi in August.We asked for chicken salad with walnut and celery  from the small plates section. Our friend wanted fish moilee with curry leave rice and kasundi jhal muri, and the niece, mushroom and black olive tortellini. My wife asked for the roast chicken with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus and I, the grilled fish. Mine was a Calcutta betki, which is a fish that I enjoy, and the friends moilee was sole. And for dessert, since we were told brie en croute would take some time, we asked for lava cake and affogato.Crispy textureEvery dish was superb. The walnuts in the salad were crunchy, and the chicken had infused in the flavours of celery. The moilee was a bit different, and we had been told that the fish would be crumb fried. So the dish consisted of a little mound of flavoured rice with two pieces of golden fried fish on top, and some sauces on the side. The friend loved it. My fish was delicious, too. It was firm within with a crispy texture and came with a lemon-garlic butter sauce on a bed of lip-smacking buttered and mashed potatoes and topped with micro greens (from the window sill!). I squeezed a piece of lemon over it, and it was like nirvana.The mushroom and black olive tortellini was nice and rich, and had a sauce prepared with basil cream and brown butter and flavoured with sage and toasted pine nuts. I had a bit of the chicken (with garlic mash, asparagus, green beans and win jus)  and thought it was amazing. It had a crispy skin, while the flesh was juicy and tender. We ended our meal with a rich lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream, and the affogato, a nice mix of bitter and sweet tastes.This is a place that is known for its food  its Salmon Gravalax (salmon cured with salt, sugar and dill), pulled chicken tacos with tomato chutney and pickled onions, duck ragout tagliatelle and black pepper salmon. But I know what I am going to go back for once pigs and I resume our happy relationship (happy for me, that is, alas not so happy for the poor pigs). I will have their biscuits and gravy  buttermilk biscuits, pork sausages, sage and bacon gravy.I am counting the days. 10, 9, 8..."

5ce56649e8e3fc56af40bc2e,The many myths about psychiatric pills,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/the-many-myths-about-psychiatric-pills/cid/1679619,2018-12-22,"Please check this article out, although I wouldnt question your expertise was the one-line WhatsApp message I had received from a concerned father whose son I had seen a few days earlier and had started on an antidepressant. He had sent me a link to a New York Times article (April 2018) which reframed a mental health success story into a conspiracy theory. Ironically, the article appeared only a week after a high-quality research, published by Cipriani and colleagues which demonstrated, once again, that antidepressants are consistently superior to placebo (dummy treatments). The finding was based on research evidence from about 100,000 patients. Despite a lot of robust scientific evidence to the contrary, media accounts still routinely treat antidepressant efficacy as an open question and toxicity as a near certainty.For any psychiatrist worth his/her salt, these kind of exchanges are a routine part of our lives. We not only have to deal with the stigma of mental illness but also the stigma and reluctance to use medicines to treat mental illness.There are many who flatly refuse to use medicines for treatment and request for therapy/ counselling/ lifestyle advice to tackle the problem. Some start on it and then stop, after reading articles on the Internet or on the advice of well-wishers.The stigma against the use of medicines for mental illnesses is not difficult to understand. Psychiatric treatments, down the ages, have been vilified. Use of leeches to suck out blood, flagellation, cold water baths, lobotomy (surgical removal of parts of the brain) have been used historically to treat patients with mental illness and, unfortunately, these images are stuck in public consciousness. The misuse of psychiatric treatments to imprison political dissidents, use of conversion therapy to torture the gay and lesbian population and dumping of people with chronic mental illness in asylums have justifiably cast the critical lens of civil society, on treatment methods used by us.The retaliatory voices  critical of treatment modalities in psychiatry  have had unfortunate outcomes. Modified ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy) is one of the most effective treatments for depression and some other specific conditions in psychiatry. When treatments such as medication and therapy are not able to relieve the symptoms of depression or other specific mental illnesses, modified ECT is one of the brain stimulation techniques available. Without a doubt, ECT is one of the most effective and life-saving treatments.However, very few psychiatrists in West Bengal are willing to provide it because they feel the risk of becoming vulnerable to unnecessary scrutiny and criticism. In the public eye, the mention of ECT conjures fearful images, as vividly portrayed by the iconic Hollywood film One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.Once called electroshock therapy, ECT still has many negative associations. When it was first used in the 1940s, it was very primitive. The reality today is completely different. People are asleep during the procedure and wake up five to 10 minutes after it has finished. They are able to resume normal activity in about an hour.The use of ECT being curtailed, purely due to stigma and lack of dissemination of hard scientific facts, is a valid but an extreme example. A lot more common is the prolongation of morbidity and suffering when psychiatric medications are withheld.Myths around psychiatric drugsAs a practitioner who is qualified to treat mental illnesses and prescribe medicines for it, I have realised that prescribing medicines for knee pain, headache or, for that matter, heart, lungs and kidneys is far easier than prescribing medicines for the maladies of the mind. When I tell someone that you have knee pain and you need to take painkillers, it is easier to accept than when I tell the same person that there is something wrong with their mind and I need to treat it with a psychotropic drug (drugs used to treat psychiatric illnesses).It is far more difficult to accept that there could be something wrong with our mind and the notion of taking a pill to cure it often signifies to us that our minds are broken. It is a lot easier to accept that you have osteoarthritis of the knees than depression. It can cause a deeply personal sense of loss and shame. Hence, we try everything else to fix it, but take a medicine. Visiting astrologers and faith healers is culturally more acceptable. A vast proportion of those who visit us have done this before seeking treatment from us. This leads to needless suffering and, occasionally, loss of lives.Many narratives within easy access to all of us, portrays the medical/ psychiatric/ scientific establishment as some shadowy monolithic organisation, in thrall to the drug industry and unwilling to consider the social and lifestyle issues which are important factors in causing mental illnesses.The explicit impact of this narrative is that many who are ill feel derided if they take medicines for their mental illness. I often ask my patients whether they would feel guilty about taking a pill for high blood sugar and virtually all of them reply in the negative. So why feel guilty for taking a medicine for mental illnesses which are ultimately brain disorders with complex causes?Taking a pill for depression or anxiety does not negate lifestyle modification and therapy when needed. The informative analogy might be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. While diet and exercise have a substantial impact on the disease course (notably, results far more compelling than those in depression), it is hard to envision front-page articles in the New York Times about the dangers of long-term diabetes treatment with anti-diabetic drugs. Societal ambivalence perpetuates the theory that psychiatric diseases are a failing of character, best addressed through clean living or perhaps cleansed with redemptive suffering.To round up, some hard facts which can dispel the myths of taking psychiatric medicines are...Medicines are effective for a substantial proportion of patients.One does not have to take medicines indefinitely.There can be side effects, like any other medicine used in other diseases, but they can be managed. Careful monitoring always balances the positive effects against the side effects, if and when they arise.Medicines are not dished out to everyone who walks in through the doors of a psychiatrist. It is only given if the condition of the person warrants it.The undeniable truth of mental health service delivery in a low-resource country such as ours is that support services like counselling/ therapy/ social care/ community outreach have been grossly neglected and underfunded for patients with mental illness.If one adds to that the sheer paucity of actual number of psychiatrists working in India, the difficulty of accessing care for those with mental illness can perhaps be envisioned. For this simple reason we need to remove the stigma around effective treatment with medicines for mental illness, otherwise many who can benefit would needlessly be deprived and suffer.Dr Jai Ranjan Ram is a senior consultant psychiatrist and co-founder of Mental Health Foundation (www.mhfkolkata.com).

On its part, the government set a precedent by getting four Ministers and the Chief Minister give an elaborate reply to the debate on drought. The last two days, however, were completely stormy. The change in game plan was, perhaps, part of an effort by political parties to use the legislature session as a platform to build a tempo for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.The stalling of the proceedings  with the BJP starting a protest against Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamys remark that the party was in touch with nationalised banks which are delaying the loan waiver process  came in the way of the government replying to discussion on the backwardness of north Karnataka. The BJP demanded an apology from Mr. Kumaraswamy for his comment and sought clarity on the completion of the waiver process. Given the impasse, there was no discussion on crucial issues such as ongoing irrigation projects, especially those in the northern region. Even the issues of sand shortage and illegal sand extraction were not discussed.The only solace for the northern region was the green signal given by the State Cabinet to shift various government offices to the Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi.Thin attendanceHowever, thin attendance of members continued to haunt the Assembly even in the Belagavi session. The fact that the session was being held just ahead of the Cabinet expansion also added to this as several ministerial aspirants were busy lobbying for berths in Bengaluru.Another important area of concern was the quality of debates which caught the attention of Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar who advised both Ministers as well as Opposition members to raise the bar. The Ministers should come well prepared and the Opposition members too should abide by the rules and norms of the House, he said."

And now Saina Nehwal and Parupalli Kashyap too.We are not talking about Sabyasachi. We are talking about a Sabyasachi-ready body on your wedding-day.A Calcutta-based fitness studio promises relevant advice. Prosenjit Biswas, fitness manager, SKULPT, has come up with a 30-day fitness regimen, a special pre-wedding workout routine that will make you picture perfect  for Instagram, and the wedding album. Says Divya Himatsingka, director, SKULPT: Healthy eating and a regular gym workout are essential during this time. Wedding rituals and ceremonies can be physically draining, so the pre-wedding workout routine maintains fitness levels and keeps you refreshed.Biswas says that most of the workout for the bride can be done at home, but the groom is advised to go to a gym.For the bride:The workout for the bride is designed to make her look toned and slender.Duration: Five to six days every week for four weeks.Start with a few dynamic stretches, which help increase the synovial fluid (jelly-like substance between the joints that acts as a shock-absorber) and prepare the body for the workout. Stretching is the best way to deal with D.O.M.S (Delay Onset Muscle Soreness). It prevents muscle pain andkeeps the body flexible.Week 1:Start with 20-30 minutes of cardio followed by basic abdominal exercises. Following that, go for basic strength training exercises using body weight as resistance, such as:Squats/ Split SquatsPush-ups/ ModifiedPush-upsInverted Row /Pull DownTricep DipsPlankNote: Peform two sets of each with 10-12 repetitions. Pause for 45 seconds  1 minute between sets. Alternate between strength training one day and cardio workout the next day.Week 2:Add weights to the routine and increase the cardio workout to 30-40 minutes. Exercises:Goblet SquatsAlternate LungeDumbbell Chest PressSeated RowDumbbell AlternateCurl + Tricep Press DownPlank and Side PlankNote: Perform three sets of each with 12-15 repetitions. Pause for 45 secs  1 minute between sets.Alternate between strength training one day and cardio workout the next.Weeks 3 & 4:In the last two weeks, women can do Circuit Training (targeting different body parts with seven-eight movements back-to-back)Leg Press + DumbbellShoulder Press + Alternate Lunge + Bent-over Dumbbell Row +Swiss-ball Hip Extension + Push-ups + Step-up + Alternate Dumbbell Curl + Calf Raises + Dumbbell Overhead Extension + Russian TwistNote: Perform threefour circuits of each with 15-20 repetitions. Pause for1 minute between sets.For the groom:For grooms, it is important to look lean. Biswas points out the regimen differs from that for the brides in intensity and postures.Duration: Five to six days every week for four weeks. Start with dynamic stretches and prepare the body for the workout.Week 1:Start with 10-15 minutes cardio training. Grooms can do some basic strength training exercises using body weight as resistance, such as:Basic Squats / Push Ups / Inverted RowSwiss Ball Hip ExtensionsPlankTricep DipsNote: Perform four sets of each with 10 repetitions. Pause for 45 seconds between sets.

Pause for 1 minute between sets.Diet tips for him and her:Eat clean. Avoid fried food, food with high sugar levels or processed food, especially with flour.Ban extra salt, as it causes higher levels of water retention. Also white sugar, as it is high on calories and cuts out the nutritional value of food.Eat more fresh vegetables and fruits as they are high on vitamins and fibres, which accelerates detoxification.Focus more on protein, complex carbs and good fat.Protein is the building block for muscles and develops lean mass. To change body composition (like losing inches/ reducing fat mass and increasing lean mass), protein is essential. Protein intake needs to be increased to support the intensive workout on the floor.Complex carbs such as whole grains like brown rice, oats, whole wheat bread work as storage. When the body needs energy, it breaks down slowly and keeps the energy levels high.Good fats such as nuts or Omega 3 improve the internal functioning of the body. Good news: have dark chocolate. It has good fat.But dont eat too much!Consume lot of water through the day as water normally is high on anti-oxidants which increases metabolic rate and allows flushing out of the body toxins. Hence, one cup of water (200ml) every 30-60 min is suggested.It will give you the pre-wedding glow."
5ce56d39e8e3fc56af40bfb7,"Santa Claws: For modern mosquitoes, it's Merry Christmas all year round",https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/santa-claws-for-modern-mosquitoes-it-s-merry-christmas-all-year-round/cid/1679625,2018-12-22,"Gunga Din sits in one corner of a cemetery in central Calcutta and watches the youthful swarm attack the honeysuckle bushes lustily. Though in reality the December chill cannot touch Gunga, he shivers out of habit. Today is a chilly day by Calcutta standards  18 Celsius. It has been drizzling too since morning. In the olden days, by now temperatures would have plummeted to 7 or 8C. Gunga and the boys wouldnt last two seconds in such weather. MyDear and the girls would go to sleep for a couple of weeks. The girls today are more ferocious, even more hardy, Gunga notes, chuckling to himself.Gunga Din is an Anopheles mosquito from the Raj days. Or was  for now he is just a benign phantom watching over his kind prosper. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, in 2015 malaria alone caused 4,38,000 deaths worldwide. Recent studies have identified patients in India infected with malarial parasites resistant to a key last-line drug; all of them are in Bengal. Between September and November this year, over 280 cases of Zika virus infection were reported from three states alone. And here in Calcutta, when the new mayor took charge some weeks ago, Gunga and his ilk were part of his mission statement, rather a claim to their annihilation was. Firhad Hakim had thundered: To control dengue outbreak, we have to launch a massive awareness campaign among citizens. We have to make them aware to not keep places unhygienic and dirty, as such places become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The same WHO report states that the worldwide incidence of dengue has risen 30-fold in the past 30 years. Malaria, Zika and dengue are all mosquito-borne diseases. They are caused by Anopheles, Aedes and Aedes aegypti, respectively. Chikungunya is caused by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. And these apart, there are more than 3,000 species of mosquitoes.Gunga got his name from a young British journalist by the name of Rudyard Kipling. Sometime in the late 1880s, Kipling was visiting the city, when he stopped by at this cemetery too. Later, in the City of Dreadful Night he wrote: The tombs are small houses... men must have been afraid of their friends rising up before the due time...As Kipling explored the cemetery grounds, a brattish young anopheles got his ear and attention. Zzzzzz, zzzzzZ he kept going in a loop  dodging the sahibs white fingers as he tried to swat him, tickling his nose, getting beneath his spectacles. The male of the Anopheles doesnt bite humans, a job best left to the female of the species, but it does make a lot of din as its powerful little wings beat 450 to 600 times per second. At one point, the sahib cried out exasperatedly  Din. Din. Din. Jottings done, when he turned to go, addressing the air behind him, Kipling said crisply: Twas nice meeting you, Gunga Din.Now, male mosquitoes live for a maximum of 10 days. The females, for about six to eight weeks. Gunga Din died within days of Kiplings departure, but the act of nomenclature, no matter how casual, tinkered with some karmic routine and Gunga Din found himself confined to earth.Today, Gunga Din cannot remember what those initial years of ghosthood were like, until he met Ronald Ross. In the interim years, the cemetery had come to be a bit more crowded. In her paper, Death in India, 1871-1921, researcher Ira Klein observes that the period between the late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a woeful crescendo of death. She writes, Malaria was the greatest destroyer of lives; according to the most reliable figures it accounted for almost one death in every five. From the mid-1890s to 1921 it probably took twenty million lives. Medically unsophisticated village constables and clerks, however, listed most such deaths as caused by fever.Bengal was one of the worst affected geographies. In another paper, Malaria and Mortality in Bengal, Klein notes that by the 1840s the British had started to try and pin down the cause of the fever. T.E. Dempster, a surgeon with the Horse Artillery and a member of the canal committee, cited the astonishing difference between the number of fever cases belonging to the irrigated and unirrigated parts of the region of the West Jumna canal. It was observed that where soil conditions and drainage were favourable, malaria had not taken hold. Others perceived a link between road construction and malaria. An inquiry committee was set up in 1863 and the Indian member, Raja Digamber Mitter, pointed out how in a continuous line of villages, a severe type of fever broke out exactly at the same time the railway embankment progressed and passed along the eastern borders. Klein explains what was happening was that developmental work tended to multiply conditions favourable for breeding malarial mosquitoes  stagnant pools of water  and in the engaged labour force, the mosquitoes found a vast susceptible population. And when the workers dispersed, they carried the infection with them into the heartland.But malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases were not peculiar to Bengal or India, nor typical of the 19th and 20th centuries. They had existed possibly since the beginning of creation. The oldest known mosquito with an anatomy similar to modern species was found in a 79-million-year-old Canadian amber from the Cretaceous  the last phase of the Mesozoic era, post the Jurassic. In Mosquito: A Natural History Of Our Most Persistent And Deadly Foe, Andrew Spielman and Michael DAntonio write about Pope Gregory the Great (590-604 AD) and his musings about the mosquito problem and how many later pontiffs refused to sit in Rome for this reason. In the Middle Ages, entire armies were laid low by Italian mosquitoes. Dante wrote about its symptoms. Alexander the Great was felled by it and mosquitoes, in all likelihood, prevented Genghis Khan from invading western Europe.Gunga Din, of course, was not aware of the magnitude his lot was wreaking and had wreaked on mankind. Not then, at least. It was from the whispers of the new inmates of the cemetery that he heard of the British doctor working at the Presidency General Hospital (present day SSKM). The whisper was that he was slightly touched in the head, moved about in odd places with a man and an empty bottle looking to catch mosquitoes. To this day, Gunga Din does not know what possessed him to venture out of the cemetery in search of the doctor, but he did. Every day for the next many months he tailed Ross. Ross working out of Surgeon-Lieutenant-General Cunninghams laboratory. Ross with his man, Mahomed Bux, releasing dappled mosquitoes and birds inside holeless mosquito nets.It is known from Rosss Memoirs that it was in 1883 that he got interested in mosquitoes. He wrote: I messed at first with the 4th Madras Pioneers [in Bangalore] That was the first time that I became interested in mosquitoes. They devoured me in our bungalow until I discovered that they were breeding in a tub just outside my window, when I rid myself of nearly all of them simply by upsetting the tub When Ross suggested to the military officer that this seemed like a good way to clear out all mosquitoes, the latter was scornful. Ross writes, I did not know then that this type of fool is very common indeed.Gunga Din had taught himself the English alphabet at the cemetery from browsing the many epitaphs. The experience now came in handy as he pored over Rosss correspondences and diary entries. He gathered that even before he had arrived in Calcutta, when he was in Secunderabad, Ross had established a connect between malaria and the mosquito.On August 20, 1897, he confirmed the presence of the malarial parasite inside the gut of the mosquito. During his stay in Calcutta, he discovered the method of malaria transmission. He was now sure that the salivary gland of the mosquito was the storage site of the parasites and these were released during the act of biting.Gunga Din remembered a poem Ross wrote to his wife the day he had his eureka moment. It had been composed when Ross was in Secunderabad but Gunga Din found it among his journals. This day relenting God/Hath placed within my hand/A wondrous thing; and God/Be praised. At His command,/Seeking His secret deeds/ With tears and toiling breath,/I find thy cunning seeds,/O million-murdering Death The recantation of the poem reminded Gunga Din of MyDear once again.In mosquitoes, it is the females that prey on human blood. Not on whim, but to fuel production of eggs. Most other mosquitoes feed on nectar or other sugar sources. MyDear had been an exception; she did not like the taste of blood. And that is how she and Gunga Din had met and gotten to know each other, instead of the usual mechanical mating and leaving so typical of the species. Of course, he did not have a name for her then. It was much later while buzzing around Rosss papers that Gunga Din discovered that his wife was called MyDear. There were all those letters addressed to her. Mosquitoes dont marry, they mate. But Gunga Din told himself if he had a wife it would have been MyDear and he would have liked to call her that.Gunga Din and MyDear didnt have any children. A female mosquito can lay a set of up to 100 eggs about every third night after mating only once. She can lay as many as three sets before dying. But MyDear was of a different sensibility. To what purpose, she had asked Gunga, when they discussed raising a family and then deliberately oviposited on a dry patch, where the eggs had next to no chance of survival.Depending on which species they belong to, mosquitoes bite at a certain time of the day. The malaria-inducing Anopheles is active post sundown and indoors. The dengue transmitting Aedes aegypti is active primarily during the day. Depending on the species, mosquitoes attack a certain part of the body and not others. Spielman and DAntonio write in 2001: Aedes aegypti is a very sneaky mosquito that prefers to come in low and bite people on the ankles or calves. This attack mode explains a habit called the Babu Bounce that is practiced by so many secretaries in India. They jiggle their legs up and down almost continually to ward off this little mosquito. One I.H.T. Roberdeau, who was the assistant collector of Mymensingh, has written about the Indian mosquito, each of which was the size of a gnat, and attacked the face to deformity. what a visage!!  a plum pudding stuck full of red berries, he wrote in an essay titled A Young Civilian in Bengal in 1805.In the 1855 Reminiscences of an Indian Journalist, a William Knighton writes, if you have the misfortune to wear shoes, they [mosquitoes] will soon discover the fact and settle accordingly on the instep and by the side of your foot  they prefer the fleshy portion. By skilful manoeuvring of your feet, however, you easily detach them or prevent their settling effectually, that is by gliding one foot over the other, softly and leisurely, as if you meant nothing in particularAll these years later, humans still cannot fathom how to tackle the mosquito or give it the slip, Gunga Din thinks and chuckles. He remembers those photographs of mosquito nets from army and navy catalogues in 1905. Quinine was widely used and thereafter, around the time of World War II, chloroquine and DDT emerged, then came pyrimethamine, mefloquine, artemisinin. The weaponry changed from spray to coil to mat to dispensers. On an even larger scale, there are talks of gene editing  something to stem procreation of mosquitoes. Gunga Din knows all this and more. A smartphone a cemetery visitor forgot behind one of the tombstones has opened new vistas, turned him into an expert.A simple Google search reveals that even as political parties and nations train their guns on each other, globally the common war being fought is that against the mosquito  Muscat, Miami Dade County, Burkina Faso, Phuket, Calcutta, Rajasthan. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has prioritised malaria in its commitment to fight infectious disease in developing countries. Googles parent company, Alphabet Inc., is working to eradicate diseases spread by mosquitoes. Verily Life Sciences, a subsidiary, is reportedly releasing swarms of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with a bacterium that causes their offspring to never hatch.Thinks Gunga Din, not for nothing did that Kipling fellow write that famous line  Youre a better man than I am, Gunga Din!Better, stronger, definitely stronger."

The farmers are also agitated with the mill owners over non-payment of their dues.Speaking to The Hindu over phone, sugar cane farmers of West Champaran, the district where most of the sugar mills are located, said five mills in the district alone owe Rs. 231.98 crore to them. Sugar cane payment dues for the current season of 2018-19 by the mills of Bagaha, Harinagar, Narkatiaganj, Majhaulia and Lauria have gone up to the tune of Rs. 231.98 crore. We are in deep distress but there is no one to address our problem, rued Nandeshwar Pandey, a young farmer from Pathakauli village. Bihar has a total of 12 sugar mills.The farmers of West Champaran further said that they have supplied about 74.75 lakh quintals of sugar cane to these five sugar mills till December 8 this year, spending Rs. 57.93 crore in the process. We expected to be paid after a fortnight of the supply as it is mandatory for the sugar mills under the Sugar cane Purchase and Supply Act to make the payment and any delay invites interest at the current bank rate, said Pramod Singh, another farmer. However, till date, not a single penny has been paid, he added.Most of the farmers had taken loan from banks through Kisan Credit Card and now they say they are being chased by the certificate officers of the banks for repayment of the loan.Living in penuryThe government at the Centre had announced that farmers' income would double by 2022, but the sugar cane farmers in Bihar have stopped celebrating social and religious functions due to lack of funds. We are unable to pay even the tuition fees of our children we are on the verge of starvation, said Rajan Giri, a farmer.He added that the farmers are not being able to go for the kharif cultivation as they dont have money to buy seeds and fertilizers.The sugar cane farmers of West Champaran particularly angry with State Sugar Cane Development Minister Khurshid alias Firoz Ahmad who represents Sikta Assembly constituency from the same district.The government is serious on the issue and I have asked the principal secretary of the department to announce the sugarcane price soon. It will be announced in a day or two. The Chief Minister himself had a meeting with officials to address the issue, the Minister told The Hindu. His assurance, however, has failed to pacify the farmers who burnt his effigy near the Bhimrao Ambedkar statue at Bagaha on December 15."

This includes a stipulation on placing 10% of the orders through reverse auction on the government e-marketplace.The order follows the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act (JPM), which was enacted in 1987 to protect the jute sector from the plastic packaging segment.While West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh are the two largest jute goods producers, Punjab is the largest procuring State . It plans to initiate the procurement on a trial basis for 10% of the indents.Gunny bags now account for about 63% of raw jute consumption, according to official statistics.

The decades old mill, one of the oldest in Asia, has not been producing sugar up to capacity. Consequently, hundreds of tonnes of cane is lying on the premises. Moreover, following Mysugars inability in terms of crushing cane, many farmers are hesitating to harvest their standing crop.Sugarcane on several hundreds of hectares in the district has been drying up in the fields, the agitators said. They said they have been waiting outside the mill for the past 4 days with their produce anticipating it would crush them.Local cable operators in the district took out a rally before staging a dharna near the Deputy Commissioners office, to protest against the Centre and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) for its new Tariff Order.The new order will increase cable TV subscription charges by at least 500%. According to that, customers must choose from 100 free-to-air channels, including the mandatory 26 Doordarshan channels, at a fixed price of Rs. 130 plus GST. For every additional channel, viewers will have to pay as per rates fixed by the broadcasters. The broadcasters have already been displaying their rates on cable TV for a few day now. The rate ranges from as little as 50 paisa to Rs. 19, the agitators said.Grameen Dak Sevaks (GDS), extra-departmental employees of India Posts serving in rural areas, from different parts of the district participated in an agitation staged by the All India Gramin Dak Sevak Union, Mandya division, outside the Head Post Office. They said the protest was to urge the Centre to implement the recommendations of the Kamalesh Chandra committee on pay revision.The Centre was also urged to revise their wage structure, regularise their service, treat the GDS at par with the regular employees of the department and to provide other social security benefits."

Despite advent of technology, production activities, except for extracting juice from sugarcane, other process including boiling, continuous stirring, filtering the brownish foams and moulding into shapes using hands were manually done in all these years.One tonne of cane is required to get 100 kg of jaggery and the entire process will take around three hours, said K. Rajamaniyan (66), who was involved in the production activity at a unit in Mullamparappu for over 40 years. He said that 15 years ago, 120 kg of jaggery is made from one tonne sugarcane whereas it had dropped to 90 kg to 100 kg now. The quality of the cane has dropped and also there is a change in the varieties, he added.Earlier, sugarcane was grown widely in the district and the availability is also good. But due to severe drought and water shortage, the cultivable area has reduced in the district. Workers said that the demand for jaggery has also dropped as people depend more on white sugar and brown sugar. But people have become health conscious and are turning into jaggery once again, said another worker Perumayee (55).She said that cane is purchased from Bhavani area and bulk orders were received from traders for Pongal, Deepavali and other festivals.Jaggery produced in the district is mainly marketed at Coimbatore, Madurai, Kovilpatti, and Srivilliputhur and also in Kerala. The wholesale price of jaggery varies from Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 per kg. Traders insist the product to be bright yellow colour for which we need to add more chemicals that were banned. But, we supply in its natural colour at a low price, she added.Most of the unit owners said that since traders insist for bright colours, they were forced to add the banned chemicals. We are concerned about the consumers and hence, adulteration in jaggery should be curtailed, said a unit owner."

The BJP alone secured 36 seats while the IPFT, a tribal-oriented party, won eight seats. The CPI-M won the remaining 16.Before the 2018 polls, neither the BJP nor the IPFT had won a seat in the assembly and their vote share was less than two or three per cent.ALSO READ: Former Tripura CM Manik Sarkar accuses BJP for rising violence in stateThe 2018 polls were also a major setback for the Congress, which had ruled the state for 23 years (1959-1977 and 1988-1993). For the first time in 40 years, the key opposition party remained unrepresented in the assembly.""The CPI-M's tally (16 seats) would have much less if they had not got the support of the minorities, specially the Muslims,"" renowned political analyst and writer Sekhar Datta told IANS.Large-scale migration from the Congress to the BJP and numerous other political developments in Tripura in 2016 and 2017 set the stage for the first face-to-face battle between the BJP and the Left.In October, the BJP swept the local bodies' by-polls, winning 3,386 seats in different Panchayati Raj institutions. The CPI-M and Congress alleged that through intimidation, attacks and arson, BJP candidates had won 96 per cent of the unopposed seats and the remaining through large-scale rigging.ALSO READ: No lynching in Tripura in 25 years of Left government, says Manik SarkarOn the welfare front, the BJP-led government, in October, hiked the salaries and allowances of 219,454 government employees and pensioners in line with the 7th Central Pay Commission recommendations, fulfilling the saffron party's pre-poll promise.Hoever, the burning issue of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam is gradually spreading in Tripura as well, with several tribal-based parties, including alliance partner IPFT, agitating for an NRC update, with 1951 as the cut-off year.And, in a major breather, the Supreme Court last month extended the services of 10,323 Tripura government teachers by two more years, as the state government had appealed for.ALSO READ: Tripura government attacking democratic acts, says Manik SarkarThe year 2018 also saw a crusade against the drug menaces in Tripura.Immediately after the BJP-IPFT government headed by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb coming to power, the security agencies comprising state and central para-military forces, along with district administrations, began a war against the cultivation, trade and smuggling of drugs, especially cannabis (ganja).Various security agencies in the last nine months have seized huge quantities of numerous drugs valued at over Rs 40 crore.""Different security agencies in the past nine months have seized 65,000 kg of dry cannabis (ganja), over two crore ganja plants, one lakh bottles of various types of cough syrups (that serve as intoxicans), 1.65 lakh habit-forming tablets, 2,626 grams of brown sugar and heroin in Tripura,"" officials of Tripura's home and revenue departments said.ALSO READ: Tripura CM Biplab Kumar Deb maintains his stand on Indians inventing internet during Mahabharata era, blasts criticsDeb, who pledged to make Tripura a ""drug-free state"", said : ""During the short period of nine months, over 200 people who are involved in the drug menace had to go to jail. As the drug related activities were reduced, 40 per cent atrocities on women and 10 per cent incidents of rape of young girls have been decreased.""On the security front, there were no incidents of militancy for the fourth consecutive year in a state once devastated by terrorism. However, various crimes, specially rioting have moderately increased.According to an official document of Tripura police, there were 78 and 124 instances of rioting in 2016 and 2017 respectively but this shot up to 245 in 2018.Former Chief Minister and CPI-M politburo member Manik Sarkar, while evaluating the governance of the coalition government, said that its dictatorial and illegal acts, like bulldozing of hundreds of opposition party offices, houses and assets belonging to Left party members and supporters are creating ""total unprecedented anarchy"" in the state.""There is a huge crisis of food and jobs in Tripura specially in the hilly and interior areas. The state's economy is entirely shattered. Without dealing with the basic crisis, the BJP government is only bulldozing opposition party offices and continuing with its undemocratic activities,"" Sarkar told IANS."

We need to change our thinking and shift to sustainable planning, said Chitale.Delivering the presidential address, Chitale said that places like Nasik, Shiroor and Lankani, by creating water consciousness in people, have managed to lessen their problems to a great extent. He also spoke about how despite receiving regular rainfall, Nagpur is unable to retain it due to the high evaporation rate.In the olden days to store water people used kalash which had a wide base. The advantage of kalash was that due to its narrow opening the rate of evaporation was fairly low.Delivering the keynote address, Satyajit Bhatkal, CEO of Paani Foundation, said, Dams have cost the country an exorbitant amount, displaced millions of people as well as reduced rivers to barely flowing water bodies. In fact, even after housing 40% of the countrys dams, only 25% cultivable land in Maharashtra get regular supply of water.He brought to the forefront the fact how Earth, also known as the Blue Planet, is the only life source in the wide galaxy due to two major factors  its atmosphere and flowing water. He also pointed out how dams, states, districts are also fighting each other for the same water, and many of them have even taken matters to the Supreme Court for the same.Bhatkal called social fracture as well as climate change as the two reasons why there are so many water problems and why the solutions do not spread faster.The chief guest of the programme was Pramod Yeole, pro-VC of Nagpur University. The programme aims to educate people about wide topics like the actions of Supreme Court on water pollution in India, water issues from a socio-economic aspect along with subjects closer to home like a comparative study on Ambazari Lake and Futala Lake."

The availability of cane led to flourishing of more than 200 jaggery manufacturing units.The farmers said that they have been raising the cane varieties which suited the jaggery production. As the cane is raised mainly for the jaggery units, the farmers said that they did not supply the crop to the sugar mills.During last year, the farmers got a price ranging between Rs. 3,500 and Rs. 5,000 for per tonne. The cane raised in about 500 acres in these villages are ready for harvesting with Pongal festival fast approaching.They alleged that the jaggery units mix 90 % sugar due to which the factories avoid procuring the cane. As such, the price has dropped to Rs. 1,400 per tonne.The fall in the price has badly hit the livelihood of cane farmers and due to absence of demand the standing crop was not being harvested.The petition demanded the Food Safety Department to take steps to put an end to adulteration practices.Erode Staff Reporter adds:800kg seizedMeanwhile, officials of the Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administration Department seized 800 kg of adulterated jaggery from a manufacturing unit at Bhavani on Monday. To produce bright yellow jaggery, manufacturers use white sugar, super phosphate, chemical dye and soda powder which are banned under the Food Safety and Standards Act.On Monday, a 12-member team inspected 19 units at Kadappanallur, Anandampalayam, Kuthiraikalmedu, Umareddiyur, Sundarampalayam and Sottaiyanoor and found adulterated jaggery being produced.

His statement also comes after the BJP lost in three state elections to the Congress.Rahul Gandhi, the president of the Congress, had, in May, said if his party came to power, there would be only one slab of the GST and that the party was against the 28 per cent slab.Incidentally, the GST Council is set to meet on December 22.

In many countries, including India, the likelihood of developing high blood pressure increases with age.The study, led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, US, found that the Yanomami people, an Amazonian tribe living in near-total isolation and with no Western dietary influences, showed no increase in average blood pressure from age one to age 60. In comparison, the Yekwanas, a nearby tribe whose diet includes some processed foods and salt, showed higher blood pressure in late middle age.The Yanomamis live as hunter-gatherers and gardeners in the rainforests of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela in South America. Their diet is low in fat and salt and high in fruits and fibre. Studies of adult Yanomamis since the 1980s have shown that atherosclerosis and obesity are virtually unknown among them. They have extraordinarily low blood pressure on average, with no apparent increase as they age.Dr Punyabrata Gun, a doctor involved with Shramajibi Swasthya Udyog  an organisation of doctors and health workers trying to reach healthcare to the poor and marginalised  has been associated with the treatment of tribals for several years. When I was in Chhattisgarh 30 years ago, the tribal people didnt suffer from any lifestyle disorder  high blood pressure, diabetes or cholesterol. Their diet was frugal yet more or less balanced, he recalls. In those days, there was little salt, sugar or oil in their cooked food. For protein, they depended on the fish found in plenty in streams and ponds. Wild fruits were abundant in the jungle. However, they didnt have access to enough rice or staples, Gun explains.For their study, the Johns Hopkins researchers took blood pressure measurements of 72 members of the Yanomami tribe aged between one and 60. They found that the blood pressure measurements averaged 95 (mm Hg) systolic over 63 diastolic. (In US adults, the average systolic is 122 and diastolic 71.) While this low figure is consistent with prior studies in Yanomami adults, the researchers measured roughly the same blood pressure among Yanomami children too. In fact, the data suggest that blood pressure in this population remains close to the same low level from age one through age 60, with no trend towards an increase or decrease.The Johns Hopkins study also reveals that this age-stability of blood pressure among the Yanomamis starts in early childhood. It is the first to compare the Yanomamis to the geographically co-located Yekwanas, who have been influenced by a Western diet and lifestyle. The researchers measured blood pressure in 83 members of the Yekwana tribe.That rising blood pressure is a result of ageing is a widely held belief in cardiology, but our findings add to evidence that rising blood pressure may be an avoidable consequence of a Western diet and lifestyle rather than ageing itself, says Noel Mueller, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School and member of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research.Dr Guns observations in the Indian tribal population reflect a somewhat similar pattern. He says, I no longer work with tribals in Chhattisgarh, but often visit tribal hamlets in the tea gardens of North Bengal. The dietary pattern here has a strong Western influence with more salt, sugar and oil. But they dont have enough protein and the diet is not balanced at all. There is malnutrition and a new type of diabetes  nutritional diabetes. This is accompanied by high blood pressure.In comparison among the Yekwanas, blood pressure readings at the youngest ages were virtually the same as those for their Yanomami peers but there was a statistically clear trend towards rising levels with advancing age  roughly 0.25mm Hg per year  such that the Yekwanas had levels averaging 5.8mm Hg higher by age 10, and 15.9mm Hg higher by age 50. This age-related rise in blood pressure begins in early childhood  which suggests that early childhood may be a window of opportunity for lifestyle interventions to prevent later rises in blood pressure, Mueller says.Mueller and his colleagues plan to follow up this study with one on the gut bacteria in Yanomamis and Yekwanas  to determine if the gut microbiome accounts for the two tribes differences in blood pressure with advancing age.The lesson here? Adhere to the Yanomami tribal diet as closely as possible to avoid hypertension and other lifestyle diseases."

As there was no demand for cane from the jaggery units, the cane farmers were suffering heavy financial loss, they said.The jaggery unit owners refuted the allegation and said they were manufacturing the jaggery as per the government norms.They said the jaggery was being manufactured using the cane stock available with them.Heated exchangesThis led to heated exchanges between both the groups.As tension mounted, police personnel rushed to the spot to maintain law and order.A section of the cane farmers said that the 300 and odd jaggery manufacturing units functioning across the district produced more than 100 tonnes of jaggery.PriceDue to adulteration in jaggery production, the price of cane had fallen from Rs. 2,500 per tonne to Rs. 1,500. They urged the jaggery units to shun adulteration.The farmers also demanded the Food Safety Department to check adulteration at the production stage itself.The jaggery unit owners said that they had been creating awareness on the production of jaggery without mixing sugar.The units would take all initiative for the production of jaggery strictly adhering to government norms."

The aim is to reduce waiting time and out-of-pocket expenditure, officials said.The unit works like a cash-vending machine. The medicine dispensing unit is proposed to be placed at government medical college hospitals and urban primary health centres in the pilot phase. It will be programmed to read barcoded prescriptions and dispense medicines, said health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan. The biggest advantage is that it allows us to keep track of patients with chronic ailments. Patients who need long-term therapy are asked to meet their doctors once in three months. The hospitals give them drugs for one month and ask them to come back for supplies for next two months. The third time, they meet the doctor, he said. It will help the government tide over staff crunch in state pharmacies, ensure follow ups on patients and allow people from other sections of the society to avail the free services at the government hospitals.Earlier this month, officials saw a demo of similar machines installed in states like Rajasthan and were impressed by its potential. The machine can detect repeat prescriptions and recommend doctor visits to patients, said state nodal officer for NCDs Dr Jerard Selvam. If they scan a prescription twice and the patient is due for doctors visit, it will not dispense the drugs, he said. It will also maintain data on the number of people taking medications and those who skip it, he said.With increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases, Tamil Nadu boasts the largest treatment program in the world, with lakhs of people receiving free drugs that keep sugar and blood pressure levels under check and prevent strokes or heart attacks. Treatment of diseases like tuberculosis also may have a better outcome as the government will be able to track people who drop out of treatment.Senior officials are also hoping to attract people from middle income groups towards using the facility. Out-of-pocket expenditure is huge and many patients drop out of medications. If government hospitals offer such facilities more people will make use of them, said Dr Selvam."

Those who retain arrears will face action as per the Karnataka Sugar (regulation of purchase and supply) Act and sugar control orders.Sugarcane growers have been alleging that factories owe them a total of Rs. 300 crore since 6-7 years. Factory managements have denied this. Factory owners and managers who met the Chief Minister in Bengaluru told him they had paid the fair and remunerative price mandated by law and there were no arrears on this basis.Farmers contest this. Factories have neither paid the FRP nor any higher price promised by them. They have been surviving only by harassing us, says Jayashree Giriyannanavar, farmers leader. She also rebuts the claim by factories that they are facing financial difficulties. If that is so, why are sugar factories increasing, she wonders.Farmers complain that all the 24 factories in the district owe them arrears. But three are closed and nothing can be done to collect arrears from them, officials told the DC at the meeting.Farmers leader Sidagouda Motagi alleged that representatives of the factories owned by Municipal Administration Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and former Minister Umesh Katti had not attended the meeting. Our biggest problem is that politicians run sugar factories. They control the government and evade all legal action. They also frame policies in such a way as to benefit them and not the farmers, he said.Mr. Bommanhalli told presspersons after the meeting that some managers may not have attended the meeting due to communication problems. Notices will be issued to them. But decisions taken in Saturdays meeting apply to them, he said."

ShutterstockThe trade truce between the US and China is expected to boost Indias shipment and help achieve the $350-billion export target set for this fiscal.The temporary truce between the US and China is good for world economy and trade as it has reduced the uncertainties, which will help in further growth of global trade, Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of Fieo, said.He said the existing tariff on a large number of products provide opportunity to other countries in their exports to the US and China.The two countries have decided to halt the imposition of fresh tariff for 90 days beginning January. The US imposed a 25 per cent tariff on steel and aluminium and proposed another 25 per cent tariff on $200-billion imports from China, beginning January 2019.Both sides have imposed tariffs on goods worth billions of dollars. The US has hit Chinese goods worth $250 billion with tariffs since July and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110-billion American products. Exporters said the current level of tariff by both the US and China provides a competitive advantage for the country but what is hampering is the requisite capacity to meet the space vacated by both.What has been agreed is not to levy fresh tariff. The trade war has opened a door for products from India to enter those countries. The existing capacities cannot meet the demand there, but it provides an opportunity to understand the market, Ajay Sahai, director general of Fieo, said.Sahai said, Traders can take advantage of the situation and sell their products. However, they cannot take a long-term view and invest in the manufacturing of products as they face the uncertainty of how long will the trade war last.Exporters said the government should focus on improving bilateral trade, which would help the shipments in the longer term.Addressing market access issues for agriculture and processed food products would help to increase Indias exports to China. So far, China is ready to buy products such as fish oil and fish meal, pomegranates, chikoo, soyameal, bovine meat, tobacco, okra, sugar and non-basmati rice."

We have developed technology to separate the fibre from the dung and make paper out of it, said T.K. Ramachandran, Principal Secretary and Commissioner of the HR&CE Department.Feasible processThe Department conducted a feasibility study and trials before venturing into mass production. The result was good and we decided to go ahead with the plan, said Mr. Ramachandran. While the dung generated in the previous camps was given away as manure for farmers, the dung from the 11th edition of the camp which started on Friday will be used for paper manufacturing. As many as 28 elephants attached to temples and mutts in the State are currently attending the camp.A large chunk of fodder, approximately 250 kg a day, given to the participating elephants of the camp comprises leaves of palms and coconut, sugar cane, and maize straws that are rich sources of natural fibre.The dung will be collected every day and transported to a nearby location where the machinery has been set up.A useful undertakingThe dung will be washed first to separate the fibre. It will be boiled at the next level to destroy microbial action. The fibre will be then mixed with 20% of waste cotton to make pulp for the paper. The remains of the dung after extracting the fibre can be used as compost, said P.R. Ashok, Joint Commissioner (Legal), HR&CE Department.This is the first time we are going to manufacture paper out of elephant dung in a large scale. The paper can be used for various purposes in HR&CE and other Departments, said Mr. Ashok."

Kumaraswamy will focus on remunerative prices for farmers through market reforms in the next budget, to be presented in February.The efforts towards welfare of farmers, which we started this year with loan waiver, will not end here. The next budget will focus on getting scientific prices for farm produce in Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yards, he told The Hindu .The government is focussing on APMCs as a large number of farmers sell their produce through them, he said, adding that already efforts were on to find how the marketing system can be improved.He expressed concern about sugarcane farmers, particularly those from Belagavi, Bagalkot and Vijayapura districts who are facing the problem of sugar factories not paying dues almost every year. This has led to their taking up protests in Belagavi whenever the winter session of the legislature begins. I am working towards finding a permanent solution to the woes of sugarcane farmers, the Chief Minister said.Accusing the Opposition BJP of indulging in false propaganda that his government was facing political instability, he appealed to farmers to understand the consequences of such a propaganda. It will be difficult for any government to get the cooperation of bureaucracy if there is a feeling of political instability. My opponents are trying to pose such a problem to prevent the government from taking up major development works, he said. However, claiming that this had not cowed him, he said, But I can say that I am four steps ahead of where a single-party Chief Minister would have been in my place.On the northRecalling that it was he who decided to introduce the system of holding the legislature session in Belagavi in 2006, during his first tenure as CM, Mr. Kumaraswamy said it had helped in the development of Belagavi. Nearly Rs. 2,000 crore has been sanctioned to the district since 2006 for various infrastructure development works, he said.However, he admitted that there was a dire need to give a push to the industrial sector in Belagavi.

Narasimhulu Goud and his friends sit in the bus stop adjacent to the main road sipping tea and discussing the latest on State elections.Enagandla village is in Kulcharam mandal and lies on the way to Medak from Chitkul in Narsapur constituency. After travelling a kilometre or so next to Chitkul bridge, one has to travel for about four-km. on a kuchha road. Speed limit? Not over 20 kmph owing to the roads condition.Accustomed to apathyIt baffles visitors but locals got accustomed to it, that too for the last five years. This road connects Medak town but many of us are unable to travel on this. One must be careful while travelling on a two- wheeler, points out N. Narasimhulu, a local teacher sitting in the same bus stop.Why this apathy? Have they not taken it up with the officials and local MLA Ch. Madan Reddy?Several times, but was of no use, say locals.We were informed that a contractor who took up the job passed away. Later, it was awarded to another contractor but he has also not completed it, comments Mr. Goud even as he is clueless as to when the road would be repaired.Bridge or barrier?To add insult to injury, the village is connected to Chitkul by a bridge which is not properly aligned with the road. One has to drive in first gear to climb the bridge as it has been built in a near 70 degree steep approach. Even if a bus approaches the bridge, someone coming from other side will not be able to see it.This bridge is hindering transport of sugarcane to Ganapathi Sugar Mill in Sangareddy, about 50 km. from here. Because of its faulty design, we are forced to take sugarcane to Kamareddy, about 85 km. away. At present, there is about Rs. 1 crore worth of sugarcane that needs to be transported, commented Mr. Goud.The villagers are suffering for the past six months since the bridge was constructed. Recently when the villagers tried to drive a sugarcane-loaded tractor over the bridge, it almost slipped down and rolled back but managed to crossover due to the drivers skill and control, added Mr. Goud.Many people have approached officials and public representatives, but the response is vague."

The queen then passes the immunity to her offspring, spreading it through the bee community.As well as working on vaccines against further diseases, the team has also begun trying to raise funding to make the vaccine commercially available, with very positive feedback so far, according to Ms. Freitak.There are many regulatory hurdles. Four to five years until reaching the market is an optimistic estimate, she said."

Even though it is no longer an every-year thing, many Christian families in the city still experiment with grapes. Nowadays families are relying on local clubs or youth associations to get hold of some indigenously produced wine while some like Lissy takes the help of the internet to do it themselves.Mother was not sure of how much sugar to add. Also, mom wanted to boil sugar and grapes in water, while Google suggested mixing sugar, grapes and yeast to boiled water once its cooled. Except for the quantity, mom went along with her own idea. Now, Christmas time would be the time of truth for us when we try out the wine, says Princy Joseph, Lissys daughter.Meanwhile, Staine, a Kochi native who supplies wine bottles to friends, say many who are busy orders a bottle or two from him.It is a simple process: water, sugar, grapes, cinnamon and cloves are boiled together. It is wrapped and kept for fermentation. If some old wine and wheat are mixed, wine would be ready within 10 days, otherwise it will take around 15 days, Staine says.He says some practices are observed while making wine for Christmas. It is done only in association with the fest. Those who are involved in the preparations should clean themselves and the utensil before preparing it. Earlier, the practice was observed like a ritual, Staine says.Wine making remains a sneaky business as the excise department doesnt entertain its preparation.

There are 24 working sugar mills in Belagavi district and they began sugarcane crushing in October. However, only four of them have made partial payment to the farmers.In a meeting with the MDs of sugar mills, the DC said the law over payment is stringent and all the violators will fall in trouble if it is brought into effect. If you have started crushing sugarcane, why not make the payment simultaneously. Dont take farmers as granted, he warned.Do you want farmers to continue staging protests and dharnas, attack government offices and sugar mills? Think about their plight and gain goodwill of the farmers, he advised the sugar mills.Bommanhalli said every sugar mill which commenced functioning 14 days ago must make payment to the farmers on Monday. In case of delay, the district administration will begin issuing legal notices from Tuesday. He also said the CM has clearly instructed to take action against the mills having dues of last year.Meanwhile, he said the weight and measurement department officials are watching for different weighing machines at the mills. Many complaints about fraud in weighing have been received by the administration and officers will inspect the weighing machines once a week.

I ran my hand along the leg and found that there was a very tender lump. There is agonising pain whenever I touch it.This is probably a trigger point  an area where the muscles and nerves have tangled up. It needs to be released. You can do this yourself by massaging it with your thumb. You can also apply ice for 10 minutes, rubbing it in a circular motion. You can use a foam roller to massage out the pain.You can go to a physical therapist who will use a non-invasive device like an ultrasound to remove the trigger. Triggers tend to reform. Stretch the muscles regularly to prevent this.Diet woesI am overweight and feel guilty about it. I diet and exercise. I do manage to lose some weight, only to regain it all and then some more.When you diet and starve your body of calories, the brain signals that you are hungry. Immediately, you crave simple carbohydrate snacks, sweets and chocolates. The blood sugar level spikes and you feel satiated. Unfortunately the tendency is to do this repeatedly at ever shorter intervals. That contributes to the weight gain.You could eat a fruit, a carrot or a raw tomato if you are hungry and steer clear of the carbohydrates. That way your hunger pangs may be temporarily satisfied.How much exercise?I am 60 years old and I retired a few months ago. I walk 30 minutes a day. Is that enough?It is good that you are walking. Try to reach your target heart rate. This is calculated as 80 per cent of 220 minus age. Muscles tend to waste as you grow older, so you also need to do weight training at least three times a week using light weights (2-kilo dumbbells). Stretches and yoga prevent stiffness brought on by increasing age. If you do all this, your balance will remain good, muscle and bones will be healthy and falls will be prevented.Stubborn babyMy one-month-old baby refuses to feed at my wifes breast. Should we start bottle feeds?Babies have a rooting reflex. If you touch the side of the cheek with the nipple or the tip of your finger, the baby turns its head and latches on. If you try to force the nipple into the mouth, the baby will reject it.Avoid beansI feel bloated, my stomach hurts, and I pass embarrassing amounts of gas.This may be due to your diet. You may be able to reduce it if you eat fewer beans and carbohydrates. Also, avoid aerated beverages. Drink plenty of plain water, at least three litres a day. Eat at least 2-3 fruits per day and cultivate regular bowel habits.Morning sicknessMy daughter is pregnant, and she vomits eight to 10 times a day. It is tough to watch.Vomiting during pregnancy may occur because of a urinary tract infection or for no reason. The obstetrician will be able to sort this out. There are a few simple manoeuvres to help. She could walk for a half hour morning and evening in the fresh air on level ground. She could leave the kitchen area when food is being fried. She could have acupressure performed on her wrists for 20 minutes every morning and evening. She could also give up food and eat only vanilla ice cream for a day. For some mysterious reason, it helps some women end vomiting. If all this fails then tablets may be required.The writer is a paediatrician with a family practice at Vellore and author of Staying Healthy in Modern India.

As of now, the daily arrival is around 7,000 to 8,000 lumps, much less compared to 15,000 to 20,000 in a normal season, says Korukonda Butchiraju, a senior trader of Anakapalle.It is estimated that against a good season bringing jaggery up to May/June, arrival may close by March/April.Deficit rainfallThe reason for the lower output is the prolonged dry spell in October and November. The deficit in rainfall during the two months was as high as 73 %. Against the normal of 292 mm, 62.2 mm was received. Even from June to September, the rainfall received was 681 mm against the normal of 712 mm. The adverse conditions will affect crop in 10 mandals of the district where sugarcane is grown and sugar factories are located. The normal extent is 35,108 hectares and during the current crop season it is 31,859 hectares, lower than the 32,153 ha in the last season, according to officials of the Agriculture Department. The crop is raised from June to February/March. To maximise returns on investment, farmers make jaggery and sell it at the Anakapalle market with an average turnover of Rs. 110 crore.Dead caneWith the lack of rain, the stressed sugarcane is hit by wilt disease resulting in dead cane. The cane turns hollow, loses weight and as a result, tonnage comes down, says M. Bharata Lakshmi, Principal Scientist (Sugarcane) of the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Anakapalle. In Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts, 50 % of sugarcane crop area is rain-dependent.In low-lying areas where the crop is grown, the available water dries up and for lack of irrigation it also faces the same plight, she explains, adding the conditions lead to reduced juice output and in recovery rate that is the benchmark for quality."

Against the demand, the board has approved only around Rs 1.50 crore.The board also accorded approval to the plans of the Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) and the Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) of around Rs 50 lakh each for restoration of the ecosystem.Of total amount, the forest department had sought Rs 28 lakh for field monitoring, including water-based survey for assessing and mapping species population and its habitat, by expert agency like WWF India over period of five years. A total of Rs 50 lakh was sought for habitat improvement, which include restocking of around 20 tonne of fish in Pathankot, Phillaur, Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur divisions in first three years. Restocking will help in replenishment of prey base of the endangered gharials and Indus Dolphins. After the incident, the prey base had come down to 55kg to 20kg per day from 140kg to 150 kg per day.Another Rs 50 lakh was sought for infrastructure and equipment which included three patrolling-cum-transport vehicles fitted with GPS, inflatable boats, range finder, depth finder, water quality testing kits and flow meter. Funds in tune of Rs 16 lakh were sought for revitalisation and cleaning of Beas conservation reserve and Harike Wildlife Sanctuary by removing plastic, polythene and other waste including weeds by engaging Beas Rakshak, people from local riparian communities.The forest department also has a plan for development eco-tourism spots and construction of Beas Interpretation Centre at Dhilwan for which Rs 35 lakh was sought. An official termed the cut as a setback to rejuvenation plan of River Beas.Chairman of PPCB S S Marwaha , said that the amount of Rs 1.50 crore has been approved on recommendation of an expert committee constituted for scrutinising the plans. He further said that first installment will be released shortly.The board had imposed a fine of Rs 5 crore on sugar mill from where the molasses had leaked into the river. The fine money is to be used for restoration of the Beas. So far, the department had been provided only Rs 25 lakh which was utilised to put small fish back in the river.BOX:About the disasterIn May, around 75,000 kilolitres of molasses had spilled into the river which had a severe impact on more than 120km of the river stretch. According to the report, more than 31 tonnes of fish were killed and drifted on to the banks of the river, while equivalent amount of dead fish either sunk in water or were found floating downstream at Harike and Rajasthan."

Later, addressing a rally of farmers protesting against the alleged anti-farmer policies of the government, Mr. Yeddyurappa reiterated his claim that the government would not last long. The CM retorted with, I welcome it.The BJP leader accused Mr. Kumaraswamy of running a transfer business from a starhotel while claiming to be accessible to the public.

About 250 km away from Colombo, people feel the crisis intimately, in the abrupt halt to financial assistance, subsidies and childrens free school uniforms.A Rajapaksa strongholdHome to some 4.5 lakh people, Monaragala is among Sri Lankas poorest districts and part of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas stronghold in the islands Sinhala-majority south. His new party made huge gains here when it swept the countrys local polls in February. Even after this crisis, my friend says that he [Rajapaksa] ought to be worshipped. I told her fine, light a lamp and worship him then, Ms. Mendis said, laughing.For supporters, Mr. Rajapaksa is the strong leader who ended the countrys civil war. More so in places like Monaragala, where scores of young men joined the Army during the war to combat poverty. However, despite his appeal, some like Ms. Mendis are sceptical of Mr. Rajapaksas recent bid to come back to power, after President Maithripala Sirisena appointed him Prime Minister in place of incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe seven weeks ago. You cant suddenly make someone the PM like that.Not that the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration gave them much to look forward to. They did very little to bring down costs of essentials. There is a lot of talk about the bond scam, I dont know what exactly happened. But the fact is they did not do anything for the people, said Ms. Mendis, who grows vegetables for a living.While the district may have welcomed a change in the next poll, not all are convinced that change entails difference. Everybody is after power. Even in Parliament, they are talking about who should form government, not what all this means to ordinary people like us, said Ms. Mendis.I.H. Ratnaseeli, also a farmer, expressed a similar view. Whether the government changes legally or illegally, high costs of living dont change. Everything from medicines to essentials are so costly, she said.Decades-long neglectTheir emphasis on living costs and commodity prices is not incidental. The lush-green surroundings, gleaming after a recent spell of rain, belie Monaragalas story of decades-long marginalisation and neglect.Beginning in the 1980s, several thousand farmers lost huge plots of land to multinational companies that set up operations here in a recently liberalised economy. They began producing sugar and fruits for export using farmers as labourers. That is how the resource-rich area was dragged to the bottom and became one of the countrys poorest districts, according to K.P. Somalatha, president of the Uva Wellassa Farmer Womens Organisation.From the 1980s, farmers lost their lands and ended up working in these big farms as labourers. Except that what they grew was not for them to eat. It was mainly for the export market, she said. Even the Uma Oya irrigation and hydropower project, which Mr. Rajapaksa initiated, services his home district Hambantota more than it does Monaragala, she pointed out. Peoples poverty, in her view, had political value for leaders. If we stop being dependent on them, then how will they build patronage networks for votes? she asked.As long as people are poor and helpless, they will be forced to worship leaders for the crumbs they throw. Leaders will thrive on this culture of dependence, according to Ajith Agalakada, local politician from Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna.For the district to get out of the poverty trap, factories that add value to local production, for local consumption, are key. Otherwise people will be left at the mercy of leaders like Rajapaksa, who wants to be king and the people to be subjects, not citizens."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.AHMEDABAD: At the end of 2017, the Gujarat State Civil Supplies Ltd (GSCSL) decided to seek help of Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS) after a string of complaints about quality of the goods - including grains such as wheat and rice, cereals, edible oil and sugar - in public distribution system (PDS) and mid-day meal schemes in Gujarat.It was the start of Food Research Laboratory (FRL) at DFS, Gandhinagar , as it started operations on December 12 last year in partnership with GSCSL and DFS. The complaints of quality were not unfounded - over one third of the initial samples did not match the standards of the state department or FSSAI.The samples were riddled with weevil, insects, broken grains and sometimes even synthetic goods to increase weight. It was not easy to assess the quality through one check and thus multiple checks - including weight, microscopic examination and sieve test were employed. The sample collection by the suppliers did not take place at the GSCSL warehouse but at the suppliers place itself. Samples not matching the quality standards were not accepted from source, said a senior FRL official.In one year, forensic scrutiny has brought down the rejection rate from over 33% to less than 3%, said H P Sanghvi, additional director, DFS. A team of 12 led by forensic officers G P Darbar and N A Shah process samples for stock of over 200 tonnes daily, he added. The forensic tests ascertain colour, brittleness, presence of insects and size of the grains and pulses whereas in oils, the tests confirm viscosity and presence of foreign bodies.In past one year, 3,893 samples have been collected in 1,394 cases. Officials said that some of the suppliers have been barred from the process whereas GSCSL has also initiated inquiries against some of the suppliers for quality issues. We are also expanding the laboratory in coming years with new equipment and building capacity for processing larger quantity of samples, said the FRL official."
5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.

One of the substitutes that has been researched over the past many years is biodegradable and compostable plastic materials, also known as bioplastic.Bioplastics are made using a range of materials such as sugarcane, corn and other plant-based sources but are stable enough to be used under controlled heat conditions.These products can be turned into compost with little damage to the environment as compared to single-use plastics.The PLA optionAmong the many bioplastics, poly lactic acid, known as PLA, is seen as a viable option to single-use plastics.PLA products are made using raw materials like sugarcane and corn, which are converted into lactic acid and then used to make products.PLA products are generally made from plant resources. These products are degradable both under aerobic and anerobic conditions. They do not pollute the environment and can be used for a variety of things such as spoons, plastic containers and tumblers, Arthi Rathinasabapathy, Phd Biotechnology from CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico, told The HinduA joint venture company, Total Corbion PLA, which has set up a plant in Thailand to manufacture PLA products, is now conducting trials of PLA-based paper cups in Namakkal and Sivakasi.Cost conundrumUsing PLA, we can make cups, cutlery, can coat them onto paperPLA degrades much faster. It leaves no harmful substances (as residue), Stefan Barot, Senior Business Director, Total Corbion, said.According to him, it takes just about 1.6 kg of sugar to make 1kg of PLA, compared to other types of bioplastics that require significantly more natural resources. Mr. Barot said the company set up a plant in Thailand since it is one of the top sugar-producing countries in the world. India too offers the same advantage.Dr. Arthi said one of the issues with such alternative sources of plastic is the high cost of manufacturing.The cost is almost 50 times higher. Only if demand for such products increases will costs come down, she said."

Kumaraswamy for his failure to get the dues cleared. He is showing sympathy and shedding crocodile tears. Instead of initiating stern action against sugar factory owners for not clearing dues to farmers in Belagavi, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Bidar and other districts, he has been expressing his inability [to do anything about it]. He (Mr. Kumaraswamy) should recall what he had said earlier and should take steps, including legal action if necessary, to get the dues cleared at the earliest. We are not asking for any charity. It is our hard-earned money. He should bring in a piece of legislation in the ongoing legislature session to book criminal cases against sugar factory owners for not making payments for cane procured, he said.According to him, the factories make huge profits by producing ethanol but do not pass it on to farmers. Moreover, they resort to delayed harvesting of sugarcane, which would severely hamper the sugar recovery percentage and also bring down the weight, resulting in losses for cane growers, the farmers leader said.Mr. Shanthakumar also appealed to farmers to launch a united struggle if their demand is not met.Following an assurance from the Deputy Commissioner of arranging a meeting with them, the farmers dropped their plan of staging a rasta roko at Rani Chennamma Circle."

Several farmers from 15 villages in Nagalgidda mandal under Narayanakhed had cultivated sugarcane and their produce was supposed to be procured by GSR Sugar Limited.They allege that sugarcane yield in the fields had been drastically reduced due to lack of water and that diversion of Singoor water to Sriramsagar project has had an adverse impact on the fields.Additional expenseIn addition, though GSR had signed an agreement with farmers to purchase the sugarcane, their lorries were being forced to wait before the factory gate for more than four days, thereby resulting in decay of harvested sugarcane, which would reduce their income. They were being forced to pay rent for vehicles for the days of wait, and also the labour in the field had to be engaged for a few more days forcing the farmers to pay those charges as well.Rasta rokoFurious over the lack of response from the factory management, the farmers held rasta roko at NH 50.

These plants get the CO2 that they need from the air through their leaves, researchers said.Producing bioplastics therefore consumes CO2, which compensates for the amount that is later released at end-of-life. Overall, their net greenhouse gas balance is assumed to be zero.Bioplastics are thus often consumed as an environmentally friendly alternative. However, at least with the current level of technology, this issue is probably not as clear as often assumed, researchers said.The production of bioplastics in large amounts would change land use globally, said Neus Escobar from the University of Bonn.This could potentially lead to an increase in the conversion of forest areas to arable land. However, forests absorb considerably more CO2 than maize or sugar cane annually, if only because of their larger biomass, Ms. Escobar said.Impact of biofuelExperience with biofuels has shown that this effect is not a theoretical speculation. The increasing demand for the green energy sources has brought massive deforestation to some countries across the tropics, researchers said.They simulated the effects of an increased demand for bioplastics in major producing countries. They used and extended a computer model that had already been used to calculate the impacts of biofuel policies. It is based on a database that depicts the entire world economy.The study found that it takes a lot of time for the switch to bioplastics to pay off. The belief that bioplastics will reduce the amount of waste in the oceans may not even come true."

It could change for some as experts are now pulling out patients with diabetes with a simple formula --- lose weight. The experts from across the country were attending a conference on diabetes and hormones, here on Saturday.Patients detected with early onset of type II diabetes and have a reasonable decent insulin level, can completely recover from the ailment by weight management, said Gandhi Medical College (GMC) endocrinologist Dr Sachin Chittawar. He is also the organising secretary of the conference.Losing about 10-15 kg of weight along with management of dietary habits can overcome the need for insulin and diabetes in certain cases, he added.Cardiologist Dr PC Manoria stressed on the link of diabetes and cardiovascular ailments. An Indian council of medical research (ICMR) report in 2012 said in Madhya Pradesh 46% people suffer from pre-hypertension, 16% have stage-I hypertension and 5% in showed signs of stage-II hypertension. 33% were normal.However, experts say that only 1% of those with a history of raised blood sugar take insulin or some form of oral drugs. Other experts also highlighted minimally invasive bariatric surgery procedure that promotes weight loss and its effects on diabetic patients. In a data published data around 2016, analysing some 94,000 patients, condition of more than 70% showed improvement after bariatric surgery. All the patients were obese with a BMI of over 35.

Wondering what I am saying? Well, that's how you eat a Bombay Mittai if you are in Bengaluru.The lovely Bombay Mittai goes back to 50 years ago when the Mittai vendors would pedal across the streets of the city ringing their cycle bells and shouting, Mittai...Mittai.Bombay Mittai, and little children would run out of the homes and hold a fifty paise coin and buy these candies.The last time Bengalureans saw these Mittai vendors was in the famous Kadlekai parishe which happened a week ago where these endangered vendors were surrounded by young children looking eagerly on, wondering what these sweets were, and citizens feeling nostalgic about these lovely candies.The cost of these candies, unlike the chocolates, is much lower. Each Bombay Mittai is just Rs 10 to Rs 20. The candies are made in a very simple method. The sugar is first heated and then melted, the melted sugar is mixed with milk and lemon is added to it. Food colouring like red, green, blue, and other colours are added to it to make it look beautiful. The candy-makers tell that it takes only four hours for the entire process to finish. Bombay Mittai, is kept alive because of a handful of vendors who continue to sell them.Ranga Swamy began selling mittai when he was a six-year-old boy in the year 1956. Now, six decades later, hes still doing it. I would accompany my father to jaathrey (Festival in villages) and other festivals and secretly observe how it is being done. Secretly because my father wanted me to study and become a great man, but I was amazed by the design and patterns that my father would do, Swamy said.Ranga Swamy hails from Satyamangalam, Tamil Nadu and is settled in Gavipuram, Gutahalli. The 68-year-old candy-maker is one of the few people who are still making and selling these candies despite loss of market share to chocolate brands.Swamy recalls the days when children would finish their schools and wait to eat these candies. They would also demand the candy-man to create new designs. They would ask us to create patterns like watches, kites, birds, elephants, dogs, and many other patterns. We as candy makers would wonder how to create these new designs and try to keep ourselves updated, Swamy said.Today's children do not even know what these things are, they only know the branded chocolates and do not understand the joy of these, he said.The Bombay Mittai sellers, usually rode bicycles. The cycles would have sticks covered with candy and a doll on top of it. Every time the mittai man is in the neighbourhood, he rings the bell on his cycle. The endangered mittai might have seen a dip but is still available. It is always easier to move out of the trade and do something different but it is important to keep your passion going and my passion is in this, said Swamy.According to Swamy, the demand for these Mittai is gaining attention because people are searching for something new and different. Once people see us making these candies, they try to reach out to us often and invite us for their family functions and programs, he adds.There are hardly 15 people today in the city who are selling these Mittais and those who do continue to do so because of their love for these sweets. It might not be an easy thing to sell these but the love for the candies will never die, said Shivakumar, another mittai vendor.In an age of expensive chocolate, the vendor of the traditional Bombay Mittai is struggling to survive. But interest in these sweets is rising."

However, the high court had said the bilateral agreement was illegal and had ordered factories to remove the plaques.Despite that experience, this government has issued a notification for which sugar commissioner will be directly held responsible, he said.Sheri said the government has drafted 24 guidelines in the model agreement which doesnt mention about recovery-based payment and ex-field rate for sugarcane.The Centre has fixed an FRP to sugarcane at 10 sugar recovery ie 10kg per quintal. However, the recovery of sugarcane grown in North-Karnataka is 11kg to 14kg per quintal. Factories have been deceiving farmers since the beginning by denying payment on recovery basis. Unfortunately, the government also not mentioned about sugar recovery-based price in the 24 guidelines, he added.The farmer leader said the government should withdraw the notification immediately."

Only one demand which comes, again and again, is that MSP should be 1.5 times the cost of the C2.""...I am in favour of enhancing the income of farmers but to enhance the income by only giving them the price by government, which is not reflected in the demand of the society can have very adverse fiscal implications because many a consumer would not be able to buy such produce and it will end up in mounting public stocks,"" the noted agriculture economist argued.""Cost of such stock and interest thereon will rise, so it becomes so costly,"" he added. Further, if MSP is too high compared to open market price, the export will suffer and the country will become attractive for import from many countries.According to Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), C2 is the most comprehensive definition of the production cost of crops as it also accounts for the rentals on owned land and interest on fixed capital assets over and above A2+FL.The Swaminathan Commission was tasked with finding solutions to the problems faced by farmers. The commission submitted five reports between December 2004 and October 2006.Chand also said he expects that the country's farm production will increase by about 4 per cent in the current fiscal.The agriculture sector growth has been very good in 2016-17 and 2017-18. In one year, it was 6.3 per cent, in the other year, it was 3.4 per cent.""Even this year(2018-19) in the second quarter, it is 3.8 per cent which is not a bad growth for the agriculture (sector). Maybe at the end of this year, we will have agriculture sector (growth) something close to 4 per cent,"" he remarked.Asked why onion prices are crashing and farmers are not getting good prices for their produce, Chand said, ""If you do not have a storage capacity for onions then you will find that this kind of things will happen.""Noting that our agriculture production has changed in the last 10-15 years but our markets are not evolving, he said, ""new production scenario is a scenario of surpluses ... markets should now prepare themselves to handle surpluses.""That will not happen if regulations are not changed, if the infrastructure is not built, we will keep crying about these things,"" Chand insisted."

It will now give way to high-end residential apartments as the buyer  Baashyam Constructions - has applied for approvals after lapping it up.The real estate developer had bought a 30-acre land parcel in Koyambedu and another 10 acres in Karapakkam on Old Mahabalipuram Road in the past few months, giving a leg up to the citys real estate sector.Jeypore Palace as it was called was owned by Jeypore Sugar and housed the Amethyst caf before it moved out to Whites Road. It is on a 21-ground land parcel and was picked up at nearly Rs 100 crore, by Baashyam, sources said. Attempts to reach Abinesh Yuvarajan, director, Baashyam turned futile.The developer has also picked up a 30-acre land parcel, in Koyembedu, opposite the Chennai Metro headquarters. It is a structured deal. A direct buy of 10 acres and a 20 acre structured deal, sources said. The 10-acre land parcel was owned by restaurant chain Hotel Saravana Bhavan.The developer is planning to promote a commercial-cum-residential project at Koyambedu. Nearly 2,000 apartments and 6-7 screen multiplex will come up in the Koyambedu land, sources said. The land has excellent connectivity, with a metro station just a few minutes walk from the site.In another transaction recently, Baashyam purchased a 10-acre land owned by Ambattur Clothing group on the Old Mahabalipuram road. It is learnt that the deal was struck at Rs 200 crore. A mixed-use residential complex is being planned by the developer.Baashyam is now being piloted by the second generation. Yuvarajan started the company in the early 2000. Their claim to fame in the market is the Poes Garden project which gave them the leg up. The second generation is aggressive in the market now, sources said.Excessive unsold inventory applied pressure on both prices and sentiment. The cityscape has not seen significant addition to residential inventory over the past 12-18 months, thereby allowing natural absorption process to deplete unsold units. Prices too, after witnessing a fall post demonetization is showing signs of revival, industry sources said."

This tiny shop on West Masi Street has now become the first shop to use single-use mud glasses to keep up with the plastic ban that is coming into effect in the city on December 10.J B Choudhary of Rajasthan who set up the shop in 1975 says he decided to do what he knew best for a living- a milk-based drinks shop. The shop has not undergone much change after its establishment and is still a tin shed among the towering and attractive shops in its neighbourhood. But come evening and people queue up for its badam milk.His son, B Suresh Kumar Sanghvi, 34, manages the shop now and says he loves the job as he has learnt the trick of cooling the hot badam milk in style. He cools the milk using two brass vessels lifting his hands over his head, behind his back and other directions with his eyes closed as people watch him wonderstruck at the handling of hot milk with such agility. ""It just came naturally to me,"" he says, laughing at the adulation.The shop is open from 10 am to 10 pm, but is more famous for its badam milk which sells from 6 pm to 10 pm. Milk from the parlours do not provide the required creaminess and hence, this shop purchases the milk from country breed cows in the villages around Madurai. About 30 to 50 litres of milk is used daily. Milk for the badam milk is kept on a simmering flame in a large wide iron vessel, and the cream keeps accumulating on the top as the milk boils with saffron for about an hour or two. Then Suresh adds sugar into a special brass vessel and cools the milk with his signature style. It is then topped with cream, badam and cashew nuts, and tada! a tasty glass of badam milk is ready for just Rs 30 a glass.""I have purchased the mud glasses from Kolkata which cost me more than the single-use plastic cups, so I am planning to hike the price in January,"" Suresh said.R Sriram, now working in Malaysia, a regular here whenever he comes on leave, says that the shop offers the best badam milk and he never misses it."

It was earlier felt that his sugar levels had dipped, but this was not the case, the minister said.The minister gave his colleagues and sympathisers a scare as he sank to his seat. His office sources said he began to feel unwell as the National Anthem was to be played and was given some chocolate. As he rose thereafter, he fainted, falling back into his seat.The visual of a staggering Gadkari, who pursues a punishing schedule, made for dramatic TV footage but he recovered quickly and maintained his schedule after being examined by doctors who were part of the ministerial entourage.My sugar level and BP is absolutely normal. It was a closed hall and due to the crowd and heat, I started feeling uncomfortable. Heavy convocation attire added into my discomfort and I fell down. However, now, I am absolutely all right. Available doctors at the venue immediately provided necessary treatment to me, he said.The Union surface transport ministser was in Rahuri to attend the 33convocation ceremony of the Mahatma Phule Krushi Vidyapeeth on Friday when he fainted with Maharashtra Governor C Vidyasagar Rao standing beside him.Suspecting that Gadkari, who successfully underwent a weight- loss surgery, might have fainted due to drop of sugar level, doctors first offered him chocolates and water. But the minister fainted again during the singing of the National Anthem.He recovered fast and, after a few minutes, walked up to the convoy ambulance without any help. Doctors conducted necessary check-up in the ambulance. The check-ups revealed that all health parameters such as sugar and blood pressure were normal and Gadkaris fall had to do with the uneasiness he felt due to heat and suffocation at the venue.With an all-clear from doctors, the minister went ahead with the rest of schedule. He had his lunch in Rahuri and went to Shirdi in a chopper. After landing in Shirdi, Gadkari visited the Sai Baba temple and addressed a short press conference there.Gadkari left for Nagpur in a special aircraft. In Nagpur, he was to inaugurate the Khasdar Culture Festival, a week-long cultural festival organized by him.Sources at the agriculture university at Rahuri toldthat Gadkari attended the entire convocation function for more than an hour.

Sanjeev Mane, a Krishibhushan Award recipient from Maharashtra Government, is providing expert guidance to about 80 farmers on increasing sugar cane yield up to 100 metric tonne per acre in association with Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited.The project was started by Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandli Limited on 150 acre fields located in various villages of Valia taluka in 2017-18 under the guidance of Sanjeev Mane. About 100 farmers had joined the project. A majority of farms have yielded over 70 metric tonne and some 12 between 100 metric tonne to 114 metric tonne of sugar cane.Ganesh Khand Udhyog Sahkari Mandali Limited chairman Sandeepsinh Mangrola told TOI, After the success of the pilot project, we have decided to extend it to another 5,000 acres of land. The yearly requirement of the mill of sugar cane is about 7 lakh metric tonne. With increase in sugar cane yield, we will be able to process more cane from next season.Mangrola added, We had approached Sanjeev Mane and he readily agreed to provide expert guidance to our farmers. Soil testing of all the farms was done and fertilizers, quantity of water and crop medicines were suggested. The farmers followed a checklist and the results were amazing.According to Mangrola, the average yield of sugar cane per acre in Gujarat is 27 metric tonne, while the national average is 21 metric tonne. Valia has become the first taluka where farmers in a pilot project are producing sugar cane between 80 MT to 100 MT per acre.Kiransinh Chavada, a farmer from Borkhadi Netrang in Valia taluka, said, Earlier, I used to get an average of 25 MT per acre in my 30 acre farm. After joining the project last year, I crossed 80 metric tonne of sugar cane yield in the first season. The project implemented by our sugar mill will go a long way in increasing the cane yield in the farms.Sanjeev Mane told TOI, I have been growing sugar cane in my 3.5 hectare farm for the last 32 years and achieving 100 MT per acre. I had visited Israel and Egypt to study their agriculture pattern as well as drip irrigation. I am happy with the progress of 100 MT target in Valia taluka and hope more farmers join the project in near future."

Instead, the management was procuring sugarcane grown in Mandya.Also, he demanded payment of an additional Rs. 300 over the Rs. 2,650 a quintal of Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) announced by the government in view of the high costs incurred by farmers.He said the ZP CEO had constituted a task force to study the complaints made by sugarcane farmers against the sugar factory. The task force has been directed to submit its report within a week."

While announcing the scheme, Kumaraswamy had implored banks to extend help by way of concessions on principal and interest.No nationalised bank has come forward with a concrete package or shown commitment to stand by the government till date, Kumaraswamy told farmers during a meeting at the Vidhana Soudha on Thursday. I have had over 10 meetings with banks, and government officials have constantly followed up in the last four months but banks have remained unresponsive.Imploring farmers not to lose their cool, Kumaraswamy said his government is committed to writing off loans upto Rs 2 lakh availed from nationalised banks and upto Rs 1 lakh from cooperative societies.Water resources minister DK Shivakumar has written to Tamil Nadu CM Edappadi Palaniswami seeking a meeting to reach an amicable solution on the Mekedatu project. The outreach came on a day the Tamil Nadu assembly adopted a resolution urging the Centre to withdraw its approval for a detailed project report on the reservoir, saying it was Tamil Nadus right. P5He said this will be done with or without the help of banks. Dont doubt our intention and commitment, he said. We have set up a separate cell to collect data and officials have been working round the clock. We will soon waive loans up to Rs 50,000 availed by 17 lakh farmers from nationalised banks in the first instalment. I cannot sell government property to waive your loans.Kumaraswamy also said he was helpless on the issue of ensuring sugar mill owners pay dues to farmers since there is no documentary evidence to prove just how much mills owe.I agree that the dues quoted by farmers from sugar factories is right, he said. But nothing is on paper. So the governments hands are tied.He said the government had spent Rs 28 crore to bail out mango growers after prices crashed. My government has also taken a decision to provide Rs 50 per coconut tree affected by disease, he said. Coconut growers will get a minimum of Rs 20,000 per acre as compensation. This is for the first time such high compensation is being given.Kumaraswamy said he is mulling diverting a certain sum from the chief ministers relief fund to health insurance schemes in order to ensure medical help to more people. In the past six months, I have sanctioned Rs 28 crore from the CMs relief fund for medical treatment, he said. Going by this, we may end up spending Rs 70 crore to Rs 80 crore this year. Instead of spending such a huge amount on people who approach the CMs office, I am thinking of diverting this fund to government-run health insurance schemes. Ministers Shivashankar Reddy, Venkatagouda Nadagouda and R Shankar were present at the meeting attended by over 200 farmers."

Officials of the states lone sugar factory, however, claimed that they have not received the required quantity of cane to get the unit running.The farmers had previously protested the delay on November 26, prompting the registrar of cooperative societies to assured them that crushing activity would begin on December 5. Factory authorities, who had even planned to begin operations on December 3 and then, on December 8, now claim to have received just about 525 tonnes of cane despite allowing cultivators to harvest their crop from Tuesday.The minimum quantity required for a 24-hour crushing operation is 1,250 tonnes. Officials said the present quantity handed by the farmers would barely last an 8-hour shift.President of the Sugarcane Farmers Association of Goa, Rajendra Desai, said that close to 28 teams of labourers have been deployed to harvest cane. He also said the farmers fear that the cane provided to the factory four days ago may begin dehydrating, and demanded that the crushing season be started at the earliest.A senior factory official even said the unit could incur an unnecessary burden of around Rs 75,000 to restart operations if it had to start crushing and then stop for want of crop."

If the horticulture department authorities are to be believed, this might be the very first in Western Uttar Pradesh.The farming of the dragon fruits is being practice here at Salava village of Noorpur area. The pink-coloured fruit, which is cultivated in Florida, Caribbean, Australia and South East Asia was grown by a farmer here in his 5-bigha land. He had started cultivation last year, but since the fruit appears after nearly 18 months, the fruit has finally started showing signs. The horticulture department authorities say that if cultivated properly, it can lead to an income of Rs 1 lakh in one year on a one-bigha land.Talking to TOI, Adesh Kumar who is a graduate and first dragon fruit grower, said, I had watched a video of dragon fruit farming on YouTube , last year. Later, I gathered knowledge about the crop, its market and profit. I contacted a Maharashtra-based NGO, which provided me dragon fruits plant for Rs 50 to Rs 80 per piece.I had carried it here from Maharashtra and developed infrastructure for the crop. First, I had installed cemented pillar in the fields and put a cemented wheel on the top of the pillar. The plant of the fruit develops in the shape of vine which climbs up the pillar. Around 400 plants were installed in the area of five-bigha land. I have spent around Rs 5 to 6 lakh to develop infrastructure and install plants in five bigha of agriculture land here, Adesh Kumar said.He further said. The plant starts bearing fruits after 18 months of installing plants. First year, it bears less fruits but later its numbers get increased. It is a season crop and bears fruits for 15 years. If all things go well, farmers can earn Rs 1 lakh in a year from one-bigha land by practicing farming of dragon fruits after deducting all expenses.Stating about the use of dragon fruits, he claims, Dragon fruit is beneficial for the consumers. It maintains cholesterol and sugar in the body and increases platelets in the blood. It costs between Rs 50 to 100 in the market. It is sold in metro cities of India and demand is increasing fast.Talking to TOI, district horticulture officer of Bijnor district Narpal Malik said, Adesh is the first dragon fruit grower in West UP. I have visited his fields. The crop is growing very well and started bearing some fruits. The climate of Bijnor seems to be conducive for dragon fruit crop. Our department will felicitated him for growing this crop successfully. Other farmers will also be motivated for adopting such type of technique and new crop. Kumar presented an example for the farmers who are doing only traditional farming such as sugarcane, wheat and paddy."
5ce5e5b1e8e3fc56af40fd58,Sportsman at heart,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/sportsman-at-heart/article25684547.ece,2018-12-07,"For a long time, television and radio have been fertile grounds to find new recruits for Bollywood. The latest discovery is Aparshakti Khurana, who started his career with Aamir Khan's Dangal . In Delhi, after a late night shoot of Bigg Buzz, where he interacts with the evicted contestants of Bigg Boss, Aparshakti is eager to catch up some much-needed sleep. But since you are here, I can wait for ten more minutes, he says as we start talking about Delhi food, our common love. I just love desi food in Connaught Place. A lot of people know about Kake Da Dhaba but they don't know this unexplored place called Tee Pee O which has very good biryani kamal ka raita kamal ka chicken qorma. And how can I forget Greater Kailash's Brown Sugar which has the tastiest chicken momos. One could almost taste the food through his expression.The fact that he did played cricket and studied law before joining the media industry come out as a revelation. I completed LLB and tried to practise at the bar for a few months but it did not work out. That made me jobless and that joblessness brought me to radio, he says with a tinge of irony.He was still a radio jockey when Dangal 's auditions were happening. For him, the role was the right combination any actor with sports background could have. I got to know from my theatre friends that some people from Mukesh Chhabra's team are meeting wrestlers and sportspersons for a role. Sometimes you are made for some roles,"" he avers. He has an anecdote to share. When I got the selection call, I switched off all the lights because talking on the phone is not allowed in the studio and I had to sit under the console. That call from Aamir Khan Productions made that moment the happiest experience of my life apart from the day when I got married, he smiles.He did theatre for seven years with a group from IIT Delhi and for some time in home town Chandigarh. I cannot claim that I have a theatre background as I did that for learning voice modulation. And better voice expression really brought me closer to understanding my body. However, it is nowhere close to what Ayush bhai (Ayushmann Khurrana is his brother) did in theatre professionally.""Learning from failuresBefore donning the black robe, becoming a cricketer was Aparshaktis dream but his hard work as a young cricketer at the state level did not bear desired results. He was in his late twenties when he realised that he couldnt continue what he trained for. Once I failed in cricket, I joined a law course but when it also did not work out, it was another setback. When you get back-to-back failures, you automatically start to work harder in life. In 2009, it was the right time to start working in the radio industry. When you start your creative journey after failures, I think you already work to perform and want to give your best. I was blessed to have the right kind of people around me.""Though far from sports for a long time, the sportsman inside him is still thriving. Cricket is a team sport. It gave me a sense of unity and I think whenever I am working, I am a team player; not an individual, he says.Aparshakti has featured in many films after Dangal , including Saat Uchakkey , Badrinath Ki Dulhania , Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi , Rajma Chawal and Stree. The last one proved to be the most fruitful for him as it was for the rest of the team. I think nobody was expecting such a response. But our producer was very confident. The film finished its theatrical run on a really good note and has turned out as one of the top grossers of 2018. It did not have any big name to cash on. I think it was our film and it was everybodys film and that is why it became audiences film. When everybody comes together to make something happen, it happens, he gushes.These days he is busy shooting for television, but he has plenty of film engagements which will keep him busy in the coming year. He is about to finish Lukachuppi , a take on live-in relationships that also stars Kartik Aryan and Pankaj Tripathi and Jabariya Jodi starring Sidharth Malhotra and Parineeti Chopra. Does he consider himself an actor now? I would call myself a radio performer who has just jumped in front of the camera and is very happy, signs off Aparshakti."

This is a blunder; the mill owners will again delay the payments to farmers, he alleged.Mr. Sandhwan said that the government must force the sugar mill owners to pay Rs. 310 per quintal to the farmers and also ensure that latter get their pending payments within 15 days.The Punjab government had on Wednesday decided to pay Rs. 25 per quintal on sugarcane to the farmers directly out of the State Assured Price of Rs. 310 per quintal, while the remaining Rs. 285 per quintal would be paid to them by the private sugar mills."

One of the substitutes that has been researched over the past many years is biodegradable and compostable plastic materials, also known as bioplastic.Bioplastics are made using a range of materials such as sugarcane, corn and other plant-based sources but are stable enough to be used under controlled heat conditions.These products can be turned into compost with little damage to the environment as compared to single-use plastics.The PLA optionAmong the many bioplastics, poly lactic acid, known as PLA, is seen as a viable option to single-use plastics.PLA products are made using raw materials like sugarcane and corn, which are converted into lactic acid and then used to make products.PLA products are generally made from plant resources. These products are degradable both under aerobic and anerobic conditions. They do not pollute the environment and can be used for a variety of things such as spoons, plastic containers and tumblers, Arthi Rathinasabapathy, Phd Biotechnology from CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico, told The HinduA joint venture company, Total Corbion PLA, which has set up a plant in Thailand to manufacture PLA products, is now conducting trials of PLA-based paper cups in Namakkal and Sivakasi.Cost conundrumUsing PLA, we can make cups, cutlery, can coat them onto paperPLA degrades much faster. It leaves no harmful substances (as residue), Stefan Barot, Senior Business Director, Total Corbion, said.According to him, it takes just about 1.6 kg of sugar to make 1kg of PLA, compared to other types of bioplastics that require significantly more natural resources. Mr. Barot said the company set up a plant in Thailand since it is one of the top sugar-producing countries in the world. India too offers the same advantage.Dr. Arthi said one of the issues with such alternative sources of plastic is the high cost of manufacturing.The cost is almost 50 times higher. Only if demand for such products increases will costs come down, she said."

Mariappan, Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration Department, seized 40,000 kg jaggery on suspicion of adulteration from the jaggery auction market in the city recently. The samples of the jaggery have been sent to the government laboratory at Guindy for various tests.Meanwhile, the representatives of the Salem District Jaggery Producing Farmers Association called on Mr. Mariappan and promised to adhere to all established norms in the jaggery production process.Ramesh Kumar, the association president, told presspersons that many jaggery units were functioning in more than 15 villages including Karuppur, Pottiyapuram, Naalukaal Palam, Ottatheru in Omalur block. More than 2,000 farmers were involved in the industry and were marketing the stock through the jaggery auction market.He said that after the action of the Food Safety Department, the farmers involved in the trade have decided to adhere to the norms.However, units functioning in the neighbouring districts may indulge in adulteration and produce jaggery mixing sugar to make it whitish, since such jaggery was in good demand in the market and also fetched high price.Jaggery produced without mixing sugar would look brown and did not enjoy good demand, leading to low price. By strictly adhering to established norms, the personnel running jaggery units in Salem district would suffer heavy financial loss, he said.Mr. Ramesh Kumar urged the Food Safety Department to check adulteration in the jaggery manufacturing units in the neighbouring districts of Namakkal, Erode and Vellore, to ensure level playing field for the farmers of Salem district."

Convinced that films can similarly charm people into visiting other spots in the State, the Karnataka government on Wednesday gave the green signal to the Film Tourism Policy that will incentivise movies that showcase tourism destinations.The main intention is to encourage film-makers to shoot in Karnatakas famous tourism destinations so that those destinations get publicity in different parts of the State as well as the country. This would help draw more visitors to the tourism destinations and help strengthen the States tourism sector, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Krishna Byre Gowda told reporters after the Cabinet meeting in which the policy was cleared. The incentive varies from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 2.5 crore, depending on various parameters, he said.In a bid to prevent any misuse of the incentive scheme, there will be a set of guidelines to decide on the quantum of incentive. The guidelines comprise a 100-mark score which will have points for different aspects, he explained. Also the total budget of the film applying for the incentive scheme should not be less than Rs. 5 crore.There is no language barrier for the incentive scheme as the State is looking at other language films to popularise its tourism spots beyond Karnataka, sources said.Other decisionsThe Cabinet also decided to increase the commission for fair price depots from Rs. 87 to Rs. 100 for sale of every 100 quintals of rice.To protect the interests of sugarcane growers, the Cabinet decided to give Rs. 20 crore to the Bidar Cooperative Sugar Factory to help commence sugarcane crushing. The factory, which is in serious financial crisis, is finding it tough to organise the working capital to begin crushing, the Minister said. The Cabinet granted administrative clearance for taking up modernisation of the Malaprabha Left Bank Canal at a cost of Rs. 573 crore and filling up 12 tanks in K.R. Nagar with the Cauvery water at a cost of Rs. 15 crore, the Minister said.

He told The Hindu that the government had refused to respond clearly on issuing an official circular on waiver of loans and had also expressed inability to initiate action against sugar mill owners for withholding arrears. Farmers expected a firm reply from the government on these important issues. As they remain unresolved, there is no option except for launching a protest.

5ce5ed11e8e3fc56af4102af,Stunted  wasted,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/stunted-wasted/article25667091.ece,2018-12-05,"The health, longevity and well-being of Indians has improved since Independence, and the high levels of economic growth over the past two-and-half-decades have made more funds available to spend on the social sector. Yet, the reality is that a third of the worlds stunted children under five  an estimated 46.6 million who have low height for age  live in India. A quarter of the children display wasting (that is, low weight for height) as well. As the Global Nutrition Report 2018 points out, this finding masks the wide variation in stunting levels in different parts of the country. District-level data show high and very high levels of stunting mainly in central and northern India (more than 30% and 40%, respectively), but less than 20% in almost the entire south. This shows the important role played by political commitment, administrative efficiency, literacy and womens empowerment in ensuring childrens health. Food and freedom go together, and the availability of one strongly influences access to the other; social institutions can work to improve nutrition and childrens welfare in free societies, and the absence of hunger enables people to develop their capabilities. Governments should acknowledge the linkages and commit themselves to improved nutritional policies. The national framework to improve nutrition already exists. The Anganwadi Services scheme, which incorporates the Integrated Child Development Services, caters to children up to age six, and to pregnant and lactating women. If it has not worked well in several States, it must be subjected to a rigorous review and targeted interventions for supplementary nutrition made.Among the factors affecting the quantity and quality of nutrition are maternal education, age at marriage, antenatal care, childrens diet and household size. Now that mapping of malnutrition at the district level is available, as in the Global Nutrition Report, it is incumbent on State governments to address these determining factors. A second issue is that of the quality of nutrition in packaged foods available to children. Going by the report, only 21% of these foods in India were rated as being healthy, based on overall energy, salt, sugar and saturated fat on the negative side, and vegetable, fruit, protein, fibre and calcium as positive factors. The fact that the global average of processed foods scored only 31% and a peak of 37% in New Zealand indicates that whole foods and cooked meals emerge superior. India should invest more of its economic prosperity in its welfare system, without binding itself in restrictive budgetary formulations. The Economic Survey 2017-18 put social services spending at 6.6% of GDP, an insignificant rise after a marginal decline from the 6% band during the previous year to 5.8%. The latest report on stunting and wasting should convince the Centre that it needs to understand the problem better and work with the States to give Indias children a healthy future."

After he was killed, all the police personnel including the Circle Officer, locked themselves inside the outpost. The police back-up which arrived later had to cut through the iron mesh of the ventilation at the rear to rescue them after chasing away the mob, he said.The Inspector was confronting Yogesh Raj (the prime accused in the case and a local Bajrang Dal leader) when someone threw a stone at him from the sugar cane field opposite the outpost as he was firing warning shots in the air. He thought it was Sumit who had attacked him with the stone. Suddenly, he pointed his gun at Sumit and shot him, point blank, Mr. Ranjeet Kumar said.No weaponsNo we did not have any weapons ... Its not like we dont have service weapons assigned to us  we have 10 to 15 armed personnel  but we didnt have them at the time. But we did have sticks and batons but they were of no use. In any case, we couldnt have used our weapons against the rioters because there was no clearance or order to do so from the leadership (of the force), said constable Mahesh Chand, who witnessed the incident.Yogesh Raj, the Bajrang Dal leader who approached the police with initial information about the alleged slaughter of the cows at a field in Mahav village, adjacent to his own village of Naya Bans, claimed in his complaint he had witnessed the slaughter of the cattle.According to Preeti Kumari, however, on whose sugarcane field the carcasses were discovered, her husband Raj Kumar got word about cow entrails on his field around 7 a.m., following which local residents decided to bury the remains and the matter but the mob decided against it."

About 12 teams are working in the Sanguem taluka alone with the remaining teams scattered in Pernem and other areas, president of the Sugarcane Farmers Association of Goa Rajendra Desai said.Sources termed this move as an attempt to diffuse any agitation by farmers who are worried that further delay may cause the crop to dry up.Irked with the delay in the new crushing season, farmers had agitated in front of the factory gate on November 26 following which the state government, through the office of the registrar of cooperative societies, had assured them that the crushing season will start by Wednesday with the harvesting of canes.The central pollution body had red-flagged the states lone sugar factory for not installing a continuous emission monitoring system and a team from Bengaluru, attached to Nevco Engineering, New Delhi, is expected to get the mechanism up and running in a couple of days.The factory was trying begin production despite Central Pollution Control Board directives prohibiting it from operating without the monitoring system, but the South Goa Collectorate stopped them."

The presence of dead insects in this essential commodity not only makes one cringe in disgust but indicates the gravity of the situation. The government needs to ramp up staff strength in the food safety commissionerate so that regular checks can be conducted. Though fines have been slapped in some cases, stricter punishment is needed to make errant milk producers/suppliers fall in line. The authorities should deal with the issue on priority to ensure everyone  from schoolchildren to senior citizens  can have a glassful of nutrition without worries.Download The Times of India News App for Latest CityMake sense of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and results on May 23 with TOI.

For, jurisdictional food safety officials have failed to collect a single sample for testing from east and south zones of Bengaluru city, Bengaluru Urban district and Mysuru district (barring Mysuru city) between April 2016 and September 2018, documents accessed by TOI reveal.Officials from the food safety commissionerate test samples of all kinds of milk, including loose, toned and packaged, as is done with all food items.The neglect, however, seems surprising given that milk of suspected quality and with adulterated content is believed to be extensively used by roadside tea shops. The uncovered areas in Bengaluru include Koramangala, Girinagar, JP Nagar, Chamarajpet, Jayanagar, Bommanahalli, Shivajinagar, Fraser Town and Shantinagar.We are too shortstaffed to conduct regular raids and inspections. We are not able to concentrate on adulteration-related issues as well as routine work, admitted an official part of regular inspection exercises.Milk samples were collected from 457 places across the state between April 2016 to September 2018, and 12 of them were found to be unsafe for consumption . Cases were filed in respective magistrate courts. Another 59 cases related to misbranding or substandard quality of milk were filed and in 40 of them, a fine of Rs 42,500 was slapped. The remaining cases are pending, said the official.During the inspections, we found dead insects in loose milk, apart from detergents and low fat content in some cases. Private milk producers were found mixing sugar and sodium chloride salt, which is alarming, said another official.The maximum milk samples were collected from Bidar district, where 19 of the 52 samples were reported as substandard and a penalty of Rs 10,000 was collected. In Belagavi district, five of 47 samples were found to be of low quality. From Vijayapura district, 31 samples were collected and 6 were found substandard.Food safety regulation has been poor in Bengaluru Rural, Chamarajanagar, Davanagere, Dharwad and Mandya districts, with each of them reporting collection of only four samples. Only one sample was collected each from Dakshina Kannada and Hassan. Fourteen samples were collected from BBMP north zone and 13 from west, 29 from Mysuru city 29 and 43 from Ramanagara."

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Phagwara: Their demands for release of pending dues and directions to private mills to start crushing ignored so far, cane growers from across the stage began a dharna here on Tuesday. The agitation, which is being held by seven farmers organizations, began with a dharna outside the Phagwara sugar mill gate around 10.30am. However, the protesters shifted the venue to the national highway at Nawanshahr Bypass around 4pm, completely choking the traffic between Jalandhar and Ludhiana  one of the busiest stretches in the state  and Jalandhar-Chandigarh highway.The farmers served two ultimatums during the day. One in the morning, to block the NH around two and half kilometres from the mill, and another in the evening, saying that if their issues were not resolved, they would completely choke the NH after 5pm. As there was no response from the state government even as senior officials held a meeting with Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association, the protesters blocked the NH at 5pm, holding up hundreds of vehicles on the highway.The farmers have been raising their issues for the last few weeks and were given written assurances on November 18, when they had blocked Jalandhar- Pathankot NH and rail traffic at Dasuya, of redressal of their grievances. However, it was only on Monday that senior government officials held their first meeting with private millers.Apart from demanding release of last years dues of around Rs 400 crore, their biggest concern is that private mills, which have over 70 % of crushing capacity, have not started crushing. While the state government announced State Assured Price (SAP) of Rs 310 per quintal, the private millers say they would pay only Rs 275  the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) announced by the Centre and the gap of Rs 35 should be paid by the state government. They claim low whole sale prices of sugar make operations unviable if they pay farmers Rs 310.The agitation is being led by BKU (Doaba), Majha Sangharash Committee, Ganna Sangarash Committee Dasuya, Lok Bhalai Insaaf Welfare Society and three other Leftist farmers unions.Residents of neighbouring villages have taken it on themselves to serve us langar and would take turns to do so. We shall stay here till the final resolution of issues and not lift the blockade on empty assurances, said BKU (Doaba) president Manjit Singh Rai.The situation arose despite the political and official establishment being well aware that cane crushing would have issues, said Baldev Singh Sirsa, who heads Lok Bhalai Insaaf Welfare Society.Highways blockedThe cane growers have been blocking vehicular movement on JalandharPathankot NH stretch at Mukerian and on Hoshiarpur-Dasuya state highway in Dasuya since Monday afternoon. Both the blockades have been outside the private sugar mills. Police have diverted traffic but farmers have come prepared for a long haul and are being served langar by the locals."
