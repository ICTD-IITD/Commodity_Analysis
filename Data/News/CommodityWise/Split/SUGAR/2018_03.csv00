Pandu and Gopi Kishan of Shiv Sena are also contesting. Pyramid party and BLF have also fielded their nominees.The constituency consisting of four mandals -- Navipet, Yedapally, Renjal and Bodhan -- has 1.96 lakh voters and women top the list with over one lakh, while the rest are men voters. Muslim minorities have 57,000 votes while Seemandhra settlers have 5,000 votes. Muslim minorities hold the key in deciding the result.Being located on the border of Maharashtra and also closer to Karnataka, it reflects a multi-cultural atmosphere. Mr. Sudarshan Reddy, who achieved hat trick wins in 1999, 2004, and 2009, unsuccessfully contested the last election as he was defeated by Shakeel by over 15,000 margin. The latter was defeated by the former in 2009.The Congress nominee has a fair image and contributed for the constituency development as Health, and also as Irrigation Minister. He played a key role in fulfilling the long cherished dream of Government Medical College in Nizamabad and the sanction of Government Nursing College in Bodhan. As the Minister, he was instrumental in sanction of some lift irrigation schemes on the Manjeera. Governments failure to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory is one big disadvantage to the TRS and people in villages though have been benefited with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos schemes, they are apparently not happy with Shakeel as he has a record of being not available to people most of the time. He is largely depending on the TRS governments welfare schemes and also minority votes. As he has a good team of party workers, he is aggressively darting ahead in his campaign. He is also said to have some cases against him.Reopening of NSF and also Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar Factory, roads, drinking and irrigation water, closure of Yamcha scheme, which supplies drinking water to 70 villages, non-completion of four-lane road from Jankampet to Basar are the major issues in the constituency. A lot of unemployment youth are also there in the constituency.Waking up early morning before the dawn, the 70-year-old Sudarshan Reddy is setting out for campaign in villages and is leaving no stone unturned for his victory. Congress workers are also following him with the same enthusiasm. The BJP is also trying its luck and hopes that voters would turn to it after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths meeting on Tuesday."

This, coupled with rising labour costs, has forced a 15-20% upward revision in nolen gur prices in Kolkata.As the citys craving for the sweets with their distinct flavour and subtle aroma triggers a 25-30% sales hike in winters, major sweet shops go to great lengths to ensure they get a decent quantity of the jaggery with some even reserving entire date palm orchards in Bankura to get their supplies.The owners of Nalin Chandra Das & Sons, who source their nolen gur from one such orchard, say prices have escalated 20% despite advance booking.Over the years, supply has declined as the number of trees has gone down. Yet the demand continues to shoot up. From where will the additional jaggery come? Dilution takes place to increase the quantity. Like others, we have to make a compromise although we do have the advantage of sourcing the entire production from an orchard, said Tapan Das of Nalin Chandra Das & Sons.Farmers, too, admit to using essence and sugar to increase volume. The demand for nolen gur far outstrips supply. To match the demand, we have to dilute the nolen gur, said a farmer.Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick hasnt yet hiked the price of sweets.We have managed to absorb the price impact. Ups and downs in quality are something to be expected, given the surge in demand for sweets made of nolen gur, said Sudip Mullick.K C Das hasnt increased prices either, but does not rule out the possibility given the steady rise in price and no abatement in demand. According to Dhiman Das, the sweet shop has held back any further hike as it had recently increased the price of sweets by 10%. Even at wholesale rates, we are purchasing nolen gur at Rs 90-100/kg. We are trying to offset the price hikes by higher sales volumes, he added.Dilwar Hossein Dalal, who has been producing nolen gur at Bankuras Bankadaha forest range for over half a century and selling it in Kolkata through middlemen, says the production dip is primarily owing to adverse weather conditions and felling of date palm trees. The latter has led to contract price per tree going up from 100-120 last season to Rs 150-170 this season.The crisis has been compounded by rising labour costs. Labour cost has gone up from Rs 140-150 a day last season to Rs 200 now, said Dalal. Some also claim the use of plastic containers to tap the sap instead of the earthen pots has also led to a quality compromise."

Seven farmers' groups have joined hands for this agitation and they have hinted that they would turn the dharna into indefinite agitation.Meanwhile, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh held a meeting with Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association on Monday evening which remained inconclusive and it was decided that another meeting would be held on Tuesday.Farmers have said that they have decided to hold the agitation after state government failed to implement the assurances given to them on November 18 when they were persuaded to lift their dharna on Jalandhar- Pathankot national highway and railway track at Dasuya, which they had started on November 17."

However, in a glaring setback to the government, the Nair Service Society (NSS) had cold-shouldered the Chief Ministers invitation to join the programme.Divisive forceMr. Vijayan had set the stage for an era of communal disharmony. Instead of being a unifier, Mr. Vijayan had become a divisive force in society. He paved the way for the rise of communal and casteist forces, Mr. Chennithala said.The Chief Minister had administered rat poison coated in sugar in the name of defending the social dividends of the 19th century Enlightenment Movement that transformed the State from a medieval polity to a modern one.The governments ill-considered and biased action on highly emotive issues such as the entry of women to Sabarimala would not serve Keralas secular polity.Fissure allegedMr. Chennithala said he sensed growing rumblings of discontent in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) against Mr. Vijayan. The Communist Party of India (CPI) was sharply critical of the governments shoddy handling of the Sabarimala issue. The CPI also felt that Mr. Vijayan had unilaterally imposed a police regime at the pilgrim centre. Mr. Vijayans high sounding sermons on the urgent need to uphold secular values did not seem to apply to him. The Chief Minister was playing cheap caste politics to gain a short-term political advantage over those opposed to his policy on Sabarimala. The BJPs Sabarimala agitation was of no political consequence and appeared to totter from one blunder to another."

Zoo director Amit Kumar told TOI heaters and blowers had been installed in all the night houses with their ventilators covered with straw for the time being. There are 21 heaters and 15 blowers to provide necessary warmth to the zoo inmates.For those animals who live in the open, temporary shade of hay has been put up. Wooden boxes have been put up for small cats to spend their nights in. Floor of all the night houses has been covered with wooden plank to provide insulation from the cold. For reptiles , 200 watt bulbs have been installed in their enclosures and, in case of birds, straw bedding has been prepared and water is changed thrice every day, said Dr Samrendra Bahadur Singh, the veterinary doctor at the zoo.Also, the diet of lions, tigers and leopards has been increased by around 20% to provide them more energy. However, reptiles like crocodiles go in hibernation during the winter and their food intake almost stops, Singh said.Special care is taken of frugivores like chimpanzees who are dependent on fruits. Such animals are more prone to cold and in order to boost their immunity, they are given chyawanprash and boiled eggs during winter. Rhinoceroses are given additional minerals and elephants are given extra sugar cane to provide them with energy during this time of the year.There are 1,100 animals of different kinds in the zoo and there are two veterinary doctors to monitor their behaviour on daily basis."

Sugar factory owners have insisted there are no dues and said so in their reply to notices served by the district administration, while farmers have disputed the claim and threatened to resume their agitation.Three weeks ago, sugarcane growers in Belagavi began a protest against delayed payments and stopped trucks carrying sugarcane to factories. They pitched tents outside the Deputy Commissioners office and held on for weeks.This prompted Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy to hold a meeting of farmers and factory representatives, following which he assured the farmers that he would make sure the factories paid them whatever they had promised in two weeks. Farmers were not convinced and resumed their protest till they were pacified by Minister for Water Resources D.K. Shivakumar.After two weeks, however, there is little progress. Neither have farmers got the arrears nor has the government announced the State Advised Price (SAP) higher than the mandated fair and remunerative price (FRP). Farmers have demanded a minimum SAP of Rs. 3,250 a tonne, against the FRP of Rs. 2,750 a tonne.Farmers organisation have vowed to take up a fortnight-long protest if the government fails to fulfil the demands. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the North Karnataka Development Forum have said they will join in. There has been no positive development. Hence, we are going back to the route of agitation. We will also seek support from other associations, said Sidagouda Motagi, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader who broke fast on the Ministers request a week ago.Meanwhile, the district administration says the factories have claimed that they have no dues. The government plans to convene a meeting of factory managements before the session, scheduled to start on December 10.Three factories namedAs per a report sent by the district administration to the government, three of the 24 factories in the district have not paid their dues. They are Soubhagyalakshmi Sugar Factory owned by Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Malaprabha Cooperative Sugar Factory, and Shivasagar Pvt. Ltd. The last two have now stopped functioning.Notices were issued to these factories, along with others, to submit details of the dues and cite reasons for non-payment. They have replied saying they have no dues to pay, as they have paid as per the FRP. As many as 10 of the factories had paid Rs. 400 to Rs. 500 more than the FRP to farmers who supplied sugarcane in the early days of the crushing season. This was because sugar price was high and the factories did not want farmers to sell sugarcane to units in Maharashtra. The rest of the 11 factories have told officials they had paid the same price to all farmers.Farmers, however, are contesting these claims and have said that most of the factories have dues. Jayashree Gurannanavar, farmers leader, said factories have neither paid the FRP nor any amount higher than that. We have submitted to the Deputy Commissioners office a list of 500 farmers who have not got dues from Soubhagyalakshmi factory alone since 2013. But there has been no action, she said.There has been no positive development. Hence, we are going back to the route of agitation. We will also seek support from other associations.Sidagouda Motagi,Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader"

They urged the official machinery to take effective steps for checking adulteration in the production of jaggery, particularly during the Pongal festival season when the demand was expected to soar.The Food Safety officials conducted surprise checks and seized 93 tonnes of sugar kept in the godowns of a few jaggery manufacturing units in Omalur block for adulteration in the production of jaggery.In continuation of the same, a team of officials of Food Safety Department led by S. Mariappan, Designated Officer, Food Safety and Drug Administration, conducted surprise check in the vellamandi. They checked the entire stock of jaggery brought from various parts of Salem and the neighbouring districts for auction.The official team found a majority of the jaggery stock brought from the jaggery units functioning in Kaamalapuram, Ottatheru, and Pottipuram villages in Omalur block of bright yellow and whitish colour. It suspected that it was due to the mixing of the hydrogen sulphate chemical more than the allowed quantity and also due to the mixing of sugar in the production of sugar in violation of norms.When contacted, Dr. Mariappan said that the samples of seized jaggery will be sent to the government laboratory at Guindy and suitable legal action will be taken after the receipt of the report.He said that his department was also investigating whether the jaggery units had proper licence and the lorries had proper permission from the Food Safety Department for the transportation of jaggery.Dr. Mariappan said that he has also alerted the designated officers of the neighbouring Namakkal, Erode and Vellore districts informing them about the presence of adulterated jaggery in the markets during the Pongal festival season.Dr. Mariappan said that he has already warned the owners and drivers of the lorries against transporting sugar to the jaggery units."

The factory shut down its operation in 2004 amidst mounting losses.Ms. Jaimala said that Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had, during his visit to the district a couple of months ago, said that he was open to the revival proposal if the farmers were ready. She would discuss the issue with the Sugar Minister and Commissioner of Cooperatives.Since the interests of the farmers of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada were involved, a meeting of legislators, top government officers and farmers of both districts would be called to reach a conclusion, she said. Sale of the factory was not an option. The government would give all its support to its revival. This would also generate jobs. Coordination among farmers and factory management was essential.Deputy Commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis said that a Detailed Project Report (DPR) had been prepared for the revival of the factory. As per the present estimates, an amount of Rs. 30 crore was required. A feasibility report on cane supply needed to be done, she said.B.M. Sukumar Shetty, MLA, said that main objective of the Varahi Irrigation Project was to help farmers to grow sugarcane. Cane should be available for at least six months in a year, he said. K.

5ce6051ae8e3fc56af411196,The hidden killer,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/the-hidden-killer/article25646278.ece,2018-12-02,"You are what you eat.Unhealthy eating, with excessive intake of processed and fried foods, very less of fresh fruits and vegetables and unhealthy cooking habits at home have been pushing up Keralas epidemic of lifestyle diseases and obesity. An estimated 28.5% of men and 32.4% of women are said to be either overweight or obese (NFHS-4, 2015-16). Over 20% of the population has diabetes, while hypertension prevalence has crossed 30%.Till now, all initiatives launched by the State for the primary prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have focused on screening, early detection and lifestyle changes. For the first time now, the Health Department is looking at the role of dietary interventions in the community as one of the NCD preventive strategies.Two weeks ago, the Health Department and the Food Safety wing announced that they would launch a joint initiative to rein in the high amount of trans fatty acids (TFA), salt and sugar in foods commercially available in the market.The States initiative has now got a fillip with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) announcing on November 30 a new mass media campaign  Heart Attack Rewind  calling for the elimination of industrially produced TFA in food supply. Heart Attack Rewind warns citizens about the health hazards of consuming trans fat.The campaign is to support the FSSAIs global target of eliminating trans fat in India by the year 2022, a year ahead of the global target by the World Health Organization (WHO) for complete elimination of trans fat.The mushrooming of eateries, from pricey restaurants to thattukadas and the crowds milling around these indicate that eating out as a culture has been growing in the State.Till now, we have been focussing on preventing food adulteration and in enforcing hygienic norms and standards. But the FSSAI has been increasingly focussing on food quality, nutrition, safe eating and inducing behavioural changes in eating and has launched several nationwide initiatives in this regard. It is time the State stepped in to enforce regulations regarding what constitutes healthy food when it comes to food available in the market, says K. Anilkumar, Joint Commissioner of Food SafetyWith various studies indicating that hypertriglyceridemia (elevated triglycerides in blood) is way too high among Keralites at 45% ,dietary interventions in the community that focus on reducing the consumption of fried and high fat, salt, sugar (HFSS) foods could not have come at a better time..What are TFAs?TFAs are naturally found in small amounts in beef, lamb, and full-fat dairy products but it is the artificial TFAs contained in food made using partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (PHVOs) that are the culprit here.Hydrogenation is a process typically used by the industry to improve the flavour stability and keeping qualities of oil. Partial hydrogenation reduces the amount of saturated fats in oil, which are deemed unhealthy.By 1990s, various studies said artificial TFAs were worse than saturated fats because while both elevated the bad cholesterol (LDL), TFA also reduced the good cholesterol (HDL).But the food industry prefers PHVOs as these are inexpensive and renders the desirable taste, texture and long shelf life to food. The typical foods which have a high TFA content are commercially fried foods like chips and baked goods like cakes, biscuits, cookies, puffs and the like.Reheating of oil above 180 degrees also produces TFAs. Today, the major sources of industrial TFAs in peoples diets come from products which are made using PHVOs and fried food which are prepared in commercial fryers on the street where oil is repeatedly reheated.Metabolic SyndromeReining in in commercially available food  both in organised as well as the unorganised sector  assumes more importance in the Kerala context because TFA has a direct connection to Metabolic Syndrome (MS).The latest estimates (Harikrishnan. S et al., PLOS One, March 2018) put the prevalence of MS in Kerala between 24% and 33% by various international definitions. The study indicated that one in three or four persons in the State  predominantly women  have this condition. Metabolic Syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities  increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, abdominal obesity, abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels  that occur together, increasing ones risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Literature says that TFA consumption causes metabolic dysfunction. It adversely affects circulating lipid levels, triggers systemic inflammation, induces endothelial dysfunction... increases visceral adiposity, body weight, and insulin resistance. In fact, TFAs seem to have a unique cardiometabolic imprint that is linked to insulin-resistance and Setabolic Syndrome pathways.What regulations sayThe WHO recommends that trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of total energy intake and has called for the total elimination of TFAs in global food supply by 2023.In 2015, the FSSAI set the maximum TFA limit in foods in the country at 5%. It has now proposed to further limit it to 2% and totally eliminate TFAs from foods by 2022. The FSSAI says that its plan is backed by vanaspathi makers, food companies and bakery associations, who have all supported the move and have pledged to make the necessary changes. However, in the market, even the current upper limit of 5% TFA is not met by many industry players, especially those in the huge network of unorganised food manufacturers, and the enforcement has been pretty lax.Measuring TFA contentThe State Food Safety authorities too admit that measuring the TFA content in food has never been a priority and that the food analysis labs have only recently acquired Gas Chromatography machines that can measure the TFA content in foods.At a recent consultative workshop on TFA reduction called by the Health Department, it was pointed out that major players in the food industry had already reduced TFA content in their products because they were compelled to follow the labelling declarations. It was the unorganised sector that needed to be educated about the harmful health effects of TFA and the effective alternatives to TFA that they could use ."

And that a significant number of their members, major chains and big names, have already started retooling or recreating their recipes.Low trans fat optionsWe are on the same page as the food safety regulators when it comes to reining in trans fat.

The jaggery manufacturers also mix sugar to enrich the sweetness of jaggery. This is harmful to people, especially diabetics, Mariappan said.He said the sodium hydrogen sulphate, which is used to whiten jaggery, was meant for the textile industry. It is used as a bleaching agent in the textile industry, he said, adding, Jaggery manufacturers are using sodium hydrogen sulphate to bleach jaggery to make it appear white during the production. Sometimes, they also mix sugar to enrich the sweetness.The team has collected a few samples from the shandy and they would be sent to the government testing lab in Chennai to confirm whether they contain any chemical. Strict action will be initiated against the jaggery manufacturers if the test sample confirms adulteration, the district designated food safety officer said.The officials also seized 40,000 kg jaggery from the shandy."

It seems that government agencies do not even have proper data on the factories.The farmers long-standing demands have been that the State government regulate the process of sugar production and payment by factories and bring in transparency by fixing the area of operation of factories. This, they say, should be done by calibration of weighing scales in factory yards, installing sugar samplers in each factory  cooperative or private  to automatically deduce sugar recovery percentage, and by putting in place a uniform and transparent mechanism for harvest and transport of the produce.They want the factories to clear all dues, some of which, according to them, are four to five years old, announce offer prices one year in advance, introduce transparency in procurement, production and payment, and treat all farmers equally.We want the State government to immediately implement sugar control orders to fix areas of operation of all factories, said Babagouda Patil, farmers leader and former Union Minister. Some private factories may argue that the order is applicable only to cooperative factories, but the government should understand the spirit of the order and implement it for all factories, he said.Meanwhile, the factories, at a meeting with the State government recently, demanded that the government direct electricity supply companies to pay all arrears related to supply of cogenerated power. They asked the government to allow payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) in instalments.

It sells all kinds of kulfis, and at varying rates. The kesar pista rabri, plain cream, fruit cream, paan and gulab kulfis are for Rs. 90 each; the special kulfi - kulhar kulfi, sugar free rabri, sugar free cream  for Rs. 105.Then they sell rabri falooda and kesar pista falooda for Rs. 110. Almond kulfi and pista kulfi are for Rs. 200. And kulfi stuffed in fruits such as mangos, pomegranate, orange and apple are for Rs. 250.Young Vishal explained the kulfis to me, telling me how they differed. I asked for the regular kesar kulfi  which I love  and a kulfi that I had not eaten before  fruit cream kulfi. Fruit cream  a dessert that consists of dollops of cream with pieces of fruit in it  used be such a favourite of mine when I was a young lad that I used to attend weddings (sometimes uninvited) only because this dish often figured on the menu. Then I asked for a new kind of kulfi that they sell  called fruit-based kulfi (Rs. 80).Fruit-based kulfi is essentially a sorbet  a delightful mix of sugar and fruit pulp, but no milk or cream. They have on offer kulfis flavoured with pomegranate, orange and mint. There is also jamun and falsa, a small sweet-and-tart berry that you find only for a few weeks in the summer months. They also have masala kulfi, and aam panna kulfi.Creamy milk kulfiI loved the milk-based kulfis and the fruit-based ones. The aam panna was nice and spicy, and the faalsa one was a lip-smacking mix of flavours. The milk kulfis were as delectable as always  creamy and firm yet soft. I enjoyed the fruit cream kulfi immensely  it did remind me of all the weddings I gate-crashed.A cousin from Allahabad was at home for dinner the day I took home the kulfis. He tasted them all and in between spoonfuls, kept saying, Delicious, delicious.He even sent me some pictures on WhatsApp. The caption  no surprises there - said, Delicious."

M. Asia Mariam, Collector, presided over the meeting.Vaiyapuri, a farmer of Paramathivelur, said that both the banks of the Rajavaikkal suffered damages when heavy water flowed into River Cauvery in the recent past. The banks, which were temporarily renovated, will not stand good for a long.He wanted the government to launch permanent restoration works to strengthen the banks with immediate effect.K.

She assured to hold a meeting with them in this regard soon.Already six teams have been formed to check this, she added.Kupputhurai, another farmer, urged the administration to motivate the cane farmers to bring more area under the crop so that the Salem Cooperative Sugar Mills Limited in Mohanur could achieve its full production capacity.The release of adequate water throughout the year in Rajavaikkal, Poyyeri vaikkal in Komarapalayam will enable the farmers to raise cane in abot 7,000 acres.Ms. Mariam said that the Mohanur Sugar Mill can crush cane to the tune of 4.5 lakh tonnes during every cane crushing season. But the farmer members could not ensure so much of supply. She suggested the farmers of Palamathivelur and Mohanur on the Cauvery river bank to reduce the area under korai grass and instead concentrate on cane production.Natesan complained that the private sugar mill functioning at Pallipalayam has not handed over the cane price to the farmers even after one month after supplying the cane.The Collector said that the sugar mill should provide the dues as per the norms within 15 days."

The trip is funded by the BBMP. Parameshwara is also incharge of Bengaluru development.It is a study tour planned in the interest of the city where garbage disposal is a growing challenge, claimed an official from the department of municipal administration and urban development. This tour should not be termed a luxurious trip since the entourage comprises only two officials and a minister, the official hastened to add. Officials though are not forthcoming on the trios French itinerary.The tour has raised hackles as it comes at a time when the state is gripped by an agrarian crisis. Besides drought, farmers have been hit by pending dues to farmers by sugar mills, price crash of various crops and the governments failure to procure them at minimum support price (MSP).More than the allegation that the DyCM is splurging on government money, its astonishing that how can he find time to go on a foreign tour when his presence is required to address burning issues, said Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association.He pointed out that the problem of growers is still unaddressed with the mill owners owing Rs 577 crore to farmers.

Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.BENGALURU: Farmers across Karnataka have been grappling with consecutive drought years and mounting debts , but if suicides are any indication, sugarcane growers seem to be the worst hit.In the past three years, just four major sugarcane growing districts have accounted for a quarter of all farmer suicides in Karnataka.From April 2016 to August 2018, 2,480 farmer suicides have been reported from Karnataka, while Belagavi, Bagalkot, Mandya and Haveri accounted for 589 or 24% of the deaths. If you add another cane growing district  Vijayapura  it goes up to 656 or 26%. Sugarcane is grown in Hassan and Kolar as well.In the latest, a sugarcane grower in Mandya killed himself on Friday, blaming CM HD Kumaraswamy in his suicide note. The government, which has been negotiating with cane growers and mill owners  mostly politicians  however, is unable to put its finger on the reasons for suicides in the four districts.Agriculture minister Shivashankar Reddy said: Unlike farmers in other regions of the state, those growing sugarcane are better poised, with more water and good land. We are not sure why they are taking their lives.It will need a thorough study. But we are committed to resolving their issues and urge them not to lose hope, the minister said.There was a time when sugarcane was considered a safe crop  with consistent inflow of money and good yields every year. But massive protests by cane growers in the state show that is no longer the case.Government statistics show the average cane yield in the state fell from 101 tonnes/hectare in 2009-10 to 73 tonnes /hectare in 2016-17. Sugarcane farmers say that increased stress from consecutive droughts, lower payments by sugar mills and increasing inflation are among the reasons for rising debt, which is in turn triggering suicides.President of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha Chamarasa Mali Patil, however, attributes much of the problem to the sugar industrys treatment of farmers. He alleged that sugar mill owners delay payments, and blackmail farmers who demand payment by refusing to buy their crops. Mandya district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha K S Sudheer Kumar said the government must not just intervene to provide temporary solutions, but implement long-term policies.Former minister S R Patil, who owns sugar mills, claimed that farmers are paid promptly.I was a farmer first, he said. If cane growers have a standard of living much higher than the rest, it is because mills make prompt payments. As of today, there is not a single rupee of the FRP pending. What farmers claim is pending is actually but additional money that they are demanding."

To avoid further losses, we thought of using sugarcane as fodder, said Ravi Charan, his son.The input cost is between Rs. 35,000 and Rs. 40,000 an acre. With the factory announcing that it would not start crushing operations, ready-to-harvest sugarcane will start suffering.

But even when they dont kill, the cost of treatment can get astronomical, pushing the average monthly cost to at least Rs 10,000.Awareness about the known risk factors  diabetes and hypertension  isnt poor, but there seems to be a collective lax towards prevention, early diagnosis, treatment to slow or halt its progression. Statistics show that most patients are unlikely to know they have kidney disease until it reaches advanced stages, say doctors.For instance, the average intake of salt among Indians, is way above the requirement, increasing risks of heart and kidney diseases, strokes, and some types of cancers. Only a few products list the salt content and some list it as sodium. People dont take salt warning as seriously as they do for sugar, said nephrologist Dr Rajan Ravichandran, who heads the Sapiens Foundation and actively campaigns for action against salt intake.An online survey his foundation conducted among 1,500 adults showed that more than 70% of the population was aware that high salt intake is hazardous, but an equal number said they did not look for salt content in packaged foods and 80% of them were not aware of the WHO recommended levels.We see a bigger problem in diabetics who know they are at a greater risk yet fail to bring sugar levels under control, said senior diabetologist Dr V Mohan.The state health department, says several government policies are now directed towards prevention of non-communicable diseases. Through the year we hold massive health camps to detect diabetes and hypertension. We understand prevention is key and a part of it is government responsibility, said director of public health Dr K Kolandasamy. We have made at least three recommendations to the planning commission to strengthen prevention. First is a policy on sugar and salt. We will create awareness on what people should eat and to read labels on processed foods, he said.Second, the state has asked the agriculture department to ensure more small millets are grown so it can partially replace rice in the public distribution system and be availed at a subsidised cost in government supermarkets. Finally, the state has been encouraging local bodies to build large parks, for people to exercise."

Refiners may buy the sugar ""if prices are good enough,"" said Liu Hande, vice chairman of China Sugar Association.The potential sales come amidst the tariff war that's prompting China to build stronger ties with other nations. The timing couldn't be better for India, where record output is forecast to boost domestic stockpiles. A deal on sugar would be the second such agricultural commodity agreement recently after China said it would import non-basmati rice, India's Ministry of Commerce said.""China needs to show its open attitude to trading partners, and is likely to purchase a symbolic amount in a show of good will given its trade spat with the US,"" said Zhan Xiao, a fund manager with Shanghai Buyun Investment Co.The volume may not be as big as India expects, especially given China's large state stockpiles, estimated as high as 7 million tons, said Shanghai Buyun's Zhan. China Sugar Association's Liu agrees, adding that there's a chance the government may not purchase Indian sugar as stockpiles ""are still quite high,"" and it's looking to reduce inventories, not increase them, he said.China's past actions signal that Zhan and Liu may be right. The country imposed high tariffs on imports in May last year to protect its local industry. Currently, sugar imports above annual quotas are taxed at 90 percent.""We don't know how much import quota would be issued, or whether China and India would sign any agreement regarding low tariffs on imports,"" China Sugar Association's Liu said.Despite the tariffs, the incentive for India to become a regular supplier to China is high. A bumper harvest is set to lift India above Brazil to become the world's number one sugar producer for the first time in 16 years, according to the US Department of Agriculture. With a glut on its hands and benchmark sugar futures sliding to a decade-low this year, the Indian government is giving mills financial assistance to boost overseas sales.India plans to export 2 million tons of raw sugar to China, starting in 2019, the Commerce Ministry has said. An Indian entity has already contracted with Cofco International Ltd. to export 50,000 tons, and the country is positioned to become a ""significant"" exporter to China, the government said.""We want China to issue import permits to its refiners immediately,"" said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Ltd."

The move, however, has upset candidates within the NCP as well as the Congress in the Kolhapur-Sangli belt.Mr. Shetti, a two-time MP from Hatkanangale, was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ally, who exited from the NDA in August last year. After winning the Shirol Assembly seat as an Independent in 2004, he trumped the NCPs MP Nivedita Mane to win the Hatkanangale Lok Sabha constituency in Kolhapur in the 2009 Parliamentary poll. He defeated former Congress MP Kallapa in the 2014 Parliamentary election. Ms. Mane and Mr. Awade have expressed their disapproval to Mr. Pawar in person over backing Mr. Shetti for the Hatkanangale seat, said an NCP leader from Kolhapur.Before the last Parliamentary election, Mr. Shetti had hoped that allying with the BJP would help shake off Mr. Pawars yoke from the sugar belt.In February, Mr. Shetti had met Mr. Pawar in New Delhi.

Many millet-themed stores, restaurants and cafes have sprung up in localities; close to 10 establishments serve anything from millet idlis , dosas and thalis to ice-creams and brownies.Even the menu at weddings, house-warming and birthday parties often feature a millet-based buffet, say proprietors. Areas such as Jayanagar, JP Nagar, Basavangudi and Brigade Road are on the radar of those trying to popularise the foodgrain.Jyothi Madinur, proprietor of Vaathsalya Millet Caf in JP Nagar, one of the first millet-themed cafs in the city, said 15 years ago, there were hardly any farmers cultivating millets in Karnataka and neighbouring states.The governments support for cultivation of wheat and rice could be a reason for farmers showing less interest to grow millets. They are naturally organic grains and do not require too much water to grow. I visited many farms in North Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to encourage and convince farmers to switch to millets. There was no demand from consumers and citing this as reason, farmers stuck to financial crops, said Madinur, who has set up a processing unit in Kanakapura.Now, people a re attracted to the high nutritional value of these raw grains, say restaurant owners who see a noticeable rise in the number of requests for millet-based dishes for children.A lot of consumers hav e realized that millets are not just for the health conscious. We aim to make them a staple in every home, as it used to be more than 50 years ago. We conduct millet-cooking workshops as well. The grains are an easy substitute for rice and wheat and also more filling. It has a high-fibre content, can stabilize blood sugar levels and requires little or no water for cultivation. The latter is the biggest reason why millets should be cultivated at a time when were facing effects of climate change, said Abhishek Beeraiah, founder of Millet Mama in Basavangudi, which now also caters to IT companies and directly sources produce from farmers in Tumakuru, Ramanagara and Tamil Nadu."

The talks were expected to be concluded later Saturday. This is the first round of talks for Wang after he succeeded State Councillor Yang Jiechi earlier this year.Wang has become the state councillor, a rank higher than the foreign minister in the Chinese government's hierarchy. Announcing the talks on November 21, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang presented an upbeat picture of the bilateral ties saying, ""We have properly managed the differences through dialogue and consultation. The border areas on the whole maintained stability"".Officials maintain that this round of talks may focus more on reviewing the progress on trade and maintenance of peace at borders than moving towards a solution to the border dispute as India is headed for general elections next year.Since the first-ever ""informal summit"" between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi in Wuhan, the two countries have launched a dialogue between trade officials to enhance India's exports to China to address the over USD 51-billion trade deficit.Since then, progress has been made towards increasing India's export of rice, sugar and pharmaceuticals. This is expected to come under review at the talks, officials said. Negotiations between the special representatives are regarded highly significant by both the countries as they cover all aspects of bilateral ties besides making efforts to resolve the vexed border dispute.The India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet. The last round, held in New Delhi between Doval and Yang, took place in the backdrop of the 73-day standoff between the two militaries at Doklam over Chinese army's plan to build a road close to India's strategic ""Chicken's Neck"" corridor connecting the north-eastern states.The standoff ended after the People's Liberation Army halted the plans to build the road. Officials on both sides say a lot of spadework has been done to ensure peace and tranquillity at the border, though the solution to the border dispute is still elusive even after 20 rounds of talks.Senior defence officials of India and China held the 9th India-China Annual Defence and Security Dialogue in Beijing on November 13 after a one-year gap due to the Doklam standoff. During the meeting, both sides agreed to enhance defence exchanges and interactions."

Baskar, MLA and other senior officials of the sugar mill.Speaking on the occasion, Ms. Mariam said hat it has been proposed to crush about 1.50 lakh tonnes of cane during this season obtained from 2,481 acres of registered area under this mill.The price of the cane supplied by the farmers to the mill will be fixed as per the Sugarcane (Control) Order and the amount will be credited in the bank account of the farmer members on the 14 th day of the supply of cane.At present, the farmers of Namakkal, Paramathivelur, Tiruchengode and Rasipuram in Namakkal district and Musiri and Thottiam in Tiruchi district supply cane to the sugar factory. The mill has planned to procure the surplus cane of the cooperative sugar mills functioning in the nearby areas too for this season.Ms. Mariam called upon the farmer members to ensure adequate supply of cane for operating full capacity of the mill this season and help its further development.The farmers should bring more area under cane to enable this sugar factory achieve production target during 2018-19, she said.Referring to the previous crushing season, Ms. Mariam said that the mill could crush a paltry 0.53 lakh tonnes of cane alone during 2017-18. About 3.47 lakh tonnes of sugarcane was crushed during the crushing period 2015-16 and 3.59 lakh tonnes of cane during 2014-15 in this mill.The mill was selected at the national level for best technical performance for 2014-15 and bagged the second prize.A modern two-tier reverse osmosis distillery effluent treatment plant was commissioned at the mill at a cost of Rs. 8.50 crore last year for recycling the effluents and in generating fresh water, which could be utilised for running the sugar factory.

Vinay Reddy, who walked out of the TRS, are in the fray in Balkonda and Armoor from BSP and BJP respectively.In Jukkal, Arunatara is contesting from the BJP as the Congress has denied her a ticket.Mixed verdictsThe district had given mixed results in 2009 with the BJP, Congress, TRS and PRP winning one seat each  Nizamabad, Bodhan, Yellareddy and Balkonda, while the TDP secured five  Armoor, Dichpally, Banswada, Jukkal and Kamareddy.In that election TRS and TDP were alliance partners. While the TDP contested five and won all, TRS contested in four, secured just Yellareddy where E. Ravinder Reddy won, a second hit.In 2004 the Congress and TRS were in alliance, and the former bagged six seats, and the latter won three.Culture factorsThe district has 17.17 lakh voters with more female voters at 8.94 lakh, while there are 8.25 lakh males. Youth voters aged between 20 and 40 years constitute a large chunk in all constituencies. Over 1.6 lakh new voters got enrolled in the list.As the district borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka, it has a mixed culture and traditions. Cultural influence of both the States is significant on voters of Jukkal, Bodhan, Banswada and Yellareddy.Further, a considerable number of north Indians live in the city. Muslim constitute at least 25%. The erstwhile undivided district basically is an agrarian economy with literally no industries worth the name.The TRS, which announced its candidates earlier than others is going all out to retain all the nine seats, while its opponents, the Congress-led Peoples Front is trying to catch up after announcing all candidates. The BJP has also pitted candidates in all constituencies. Though BLF (Bahujan Left Front) is also fielding its nominees, its campaign is low key.Points, counterpointsThe campaign will hot up with the arrival of star campaigners. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has already addressed meetings at three places and Congress star campaigner Rahul Gandhi spoke at Kamareddy. Union Ministers J. P. Nadda and Santosh Gangwar campaigned, while Prime Minister Modi, Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and others are expected to join the BJP campaign.The Opposition mainly targeted its attack on the TRS failures in not keeping its promises of double bedroom houses, three-acre land for Dalits, employment for youth, and takeover of the Nizam Sugar Factory (NSF). The latter trained its campaign on Kaleshwaram, SRSP restoration scheme, 24-hour free power, Rythu Bandhu scheme and insurance cover for bereaved families of farmers.Poll issuesReopening and takeover of NSF, exclusive rights for district on Singur and Nizam Sagar waters, setting up of a turmeric board, Lakkampally SEZ (mega food processing park), withdrawal of cases on farmers for demanding Godavari water for kharif, and beedi workers welfare are voters issues."

The new FRP mechanism is in favour of the factories. It does not benefit farmers. In fact, farmers stand to lose with the new FRP mechanism, he said.The FRP for the crushing season of 201819 is Rs. 2,750 a tonne for a recovery of 10%. It means that a factory that produces one quintal of sugar from one tonne of sugarcane crushed, will have to pay Rs. 2,750 for a tonne to farmers.For every percentage point drop in the recovery, the factory deducts Rs. 275 from the FRP. Similarly, for every percentage point increase in the recovery, the factory has to pay Rs. 275 more per tonne to the supplier.Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeps claiming that the FRP is 2.45% higher than that during the last crushing season. However, this is misrepresentation of facts. The Union government has meddled with the minimum recovery point before announcing the FRP. For 12 years, the base recovery point was 9.5%. Mr. Modi increased it to 10% and claimed he is hiking the FRP also. This means that more than 90% of factories can escape paying the FRP by claiming that their recovery rate is not 10%, he said. Even if the stated FRP is Rs. 2,750 a tonne, the amount carried home by nine out of 10 farmers would be Rs. 2,475, which is less than the Rs. 2,500 that they got in the last season.According to Mr. Shanthakumar, the government should fix the base recovery rate at 8.5 and monitor the recovery of each factory using latest technology.Under-reportingThe former Union Minister Babagouda Patil said under-reporting of recovery has been a decades-old habit of sugar factories. It would not go away easily, he said. According to him, each factory that crushes around five lakh tonnes in a season saves around Rs. 200 crore just by under-reporting recovery by 2 percentage points. I have strong reason to believe nine out of 10 factories under-report recovery, he said.Denies allegationsSiddarth Wadennanavar, managing director of Belgaum Sugars run by the Jarkiholi family, denied such allegations. All these are far from truth. Our transactions are transparent. We are fair and just in distributing our proceeds among farmers, who are our main input suppliers, he said."

The state GST department has attached the property of the mill.Over the years, the mill has allegedly failed to clear tax dues to the GST department, which was earlier known as commercial taxes department.In a letter, the GST department has urged the state finance department to ensure that the mill clears the dues once it is paid for acquiring the land. The department has also requested that the dues of Nashik District Central Co-operative Bank too be cleared as the sugar factory has failed to repay the loan that it had taken from financial institute.The project is a positive one and would be a boon for the farmers of the region, the state GST officials said.Centre has planned a dry port project on 250 acres in Niphad. Of these, 108 acres belong to Niphad cooperative sugar mill. GST officials said that the factory owners are likely to get about Rs 105crore for acquiring the land.Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), the nodal agency for the implementation of the project, would have to acquire the land. It has already engaged Ernst & Young (EY) to prepare the detailed project report for its dry port project.We hope the implementing agencies will take a positive decision in this connection to enable the GST department to recover the amount, added GST department officials.The mill has been defunct for the past three years, with total dues of Rs 250 crore, including Rs 135 crore of NDCC bank, Rs 36.65 crore to GST department and about Rs 55 crores as pending salaries of workers.The dry port is to be connected by rail and containers will directly move to JNPT Mumbai. Facilities like custom clearance, value addition services like packaging, grading, loading & unloading, cold storages that are required for export of agricultural and industrial goods would be available at the dry port."

Taraka Rama Rao is contesting from Sircilla and finance minister Eatala Rajender is in the fray from Huzurabad. The grand alliance of the Congress, TDP, the CPI and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) considers winning from here a prestige issue.Congress candidates were finalized early for nine segments: Karimnagar, Manthani, Jagtial, Korutla, Sircilla, Vemulawada, Huzurabad, Peddapalli and Manakondur. Four seats  Choppadandi, Dharmapuri, Ramagundam and Husnabad  were decided later.Old hands againFormer ministers D. Sridhar Babu and T. Jeevan Reddy are contesting from Manthani and Jagtial seats. TPCC working president and former member of Parliament Ponnam Prabhakar is contesting from Karimnagar Assembly segment.CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy was keen on contesting from Husnabad, while Congress candidate and former legislator A. Praveen Reddy wanted to enter the fray to give a tough fight to the TRS.Praveen Reddy, who had already intensified his electioneering in the segment, was planning to contest as an independent if the party gives the seat to the CPI.Cheerleader TDPBefore the advent of the TRS, the TDP had a big hold and sway in all the elections but had been losing its sheen. Interestingly, it had decided not to contest from any of the Assembly segments.Instead, it had decided to extend support and campaign for its alliance partners. So much so, Telangana TDP president L. Ramana had launched the campaign in support of the Congress in Jagtial. He also assured to campaign for alliances candidates in all the Assembly segments in the district.Solo fightThe BJP has decided to go it alone and announced its candidates from Karimnagar, Peddapalli, Manakondur, Korutla, Choppadandi, Jagtial, Ramagundam and Sircilla.It is upbeat after its national president Amit Shah kicked off electioneering in Karimnagar town by addressing a public meeting. And, it is likely to give a tough fight in Karimnagar and Peddapalli segments. However, the resignation of Karimnagar BJP district president K. Srinivas Reddy and his joining the TRS had come as rude shock to the party.Poll promisesThe last Assembly elections were fought on the formation of Telangana State with all the parties claiming their role in achieving it. This election, however, is likely to be different as the TRS is calling upon the electorate to re-elect the TRS for the continuation of all its welfare schemes.However, a number of issues like the beedi industry crisis, Gulf immigrants woes, revival of Nizam Sugar Factory in Muthyampet in Sircilla, Jagtial and Korutla Assembly segments, revival of dependent employment scheme and other sops to coal miners in Ramagundam and Manthani segment, are likely to weigh against the TRS.On the other hand, the Congress and its allies are banking on the prevailing anti-incumbency factor in all the constituencies. The Congress is promising better sops and welfare of all sections of society if elected to power."
5ce66f09e8e3fc56af4131f7,Rural disquiet loud and clear in Madhya Pradesh,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/aadhaar-rural-disquiet-beep-loud-and-clear-in-madhya-pradesh/cid/1676360,2018-11-24,"Rural disquiet appears far more pronounced than urban discontent in election-set Madhya Pradesh, driven not by so-called emotive matters but by bread-and-butter issues and an annoyance multiplier called Aadhaar.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be a big leader but most of his decisions have been wrong, says a tribal youth in Badveli village in Dhar district.With precision that belied his formal education that could not go beyond Class VIII but spoke volumes about rural Indias insight, he reeled out what he felt were the wrong decisions of the Prime Minister who had promised achchhe din.Notebandi, making Aadhaar mandatory for government benefits and services, weakening the rural job guarantee scheme, the betrayal of farmers.Ek crore bhi dega BJP vote ke liye to nahin doonga (Wont vote for the BJP even if they pay one crore), he declared, predicting the certain ouster of Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the November 28 polls.By now, many others had assembled and joined the conversation. One boy in torn clothes intervened with a lethal one-liner: Jhooth bolta hai Modi (Modi lies).Asked to explain, he blushed and couldnt elaborate. But two other boys, Devi Singh Maurya and Ram Pasaya, recalled the lies, which werent about history or politics. They too talked about notebandi, minimum support price, jobs and housing.Their ire is focused on Aadhaar, especially the decision to link the card to government schemes and facilities. Most villagers spend several days taking care of the Aadhaar formalities. First they (officials) will say name is incorrect, surname not added, phone number not linked. Once you get everything corrected after running around, the network link wont be there or the fingerprints wont match. Students could not get admission in school because of Aadhaar. This idea was designed to torture the most vulnerable, Pasya said.The exodus of the young to Gujarat and Maharashtra in search of jobs is another concern.Such signs of anger in the tribal terrain of Dhar, Khargone, Jhabua spell trouble for the BJP because they suggest a rural unease more intense than that in urban stretches.Farmers recall how they rarely got the minimum support price for soyabean and chana (gram), and the crop insurance scheme was a fraud. The Congresss promises to waive loans within 10 days and Rs 5,1000 for wedding of girls appear to have struck a chord.Places like the ancient pilgrimage centre of Ujjain still demonstrates support for the BJP but that may not be enough for the ruling party to protect its overwhelming dominance in the Malwa-Nimar region in southwestern Madhya Pradesh.The BJP won 57 of the 66 Assembly constituencies in this region but even a conservative assessment suggests it may lose 25 to 30 seats this time. The Congress will need a substantial gain from this area to cover the huge gap between the two parties in the last elections.The BJP had won 165 out of the 230 seats in the state with a vote-share of 45.19 per cent while the Congress won only 58 with 36.79 per cent votes. This already comfortable situation metamorphosed into a dream run in the 2014 parliamentary election when the BJPs vote percentage reached 54 and the Congress partys slumped to 35. The difference was so wide that the BJP won many Lok Sabha seats by over 3 lakh votes.The BJP has managed to salvage some of its traditional support base by drastically whittling down electricity bills in urban areas and efficiently implementing a scheme that sold foodgrains at Re 1 a kilo in rural areas.Chandan, a middle-aged employee of a hotel in Indore said: I used to get electricity bills for Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,200 each month. I vowed not to vote the BJP. But now my bill is down to Rs 200. The entire colony where I live has returned to the BJP now.But a section of the BJPs diehard supporters refuse to change their mind. A rich business family, which has two of its members in the BJP, took a collective oath two months ago to not vote for the party. The reasons, apart from notebandi and the GST, cited by one of them: We realised Modi is all hollow words. Corruption has increased and doing business has become more difficult under his regime. My family usually switches off the TV when his speech comes. Most of us will vote for a new party for the first time.In Dhar, one Congress leader said: Ask a poor tribal woman in any village have you forgotten notebandi? She will explode with abuses. Aadhaar is another menace that is hurting the BJP.Toba Ram, a recipient of Rs 2.80 lakh under a housing scheme who praises the Chouhan government, said: That does not mean I will vote for the BJP. The BJP leaders filled their homes and created too many problems for us.Discontinuance of sugar and kerosene from public distribution system has also caused anger in villages.Another reason for the BJPs weakening grip over the Malwa-Nimar region is caste emerging as a factor powerful enough to override the Hindutva consolidation.The Congress has done better caste management and the anger of the upper castes against the Modi government for setting aside the Supreme Court order on SC-ST (Atrocities) Act is helping the party. Various upper caste bodies are mobilising people under Sapaks (Samanya Pichhra Alpsankhyak Kalyan Samaj) to teach the BJP a lesson.In places like Indore, Ujjain and Dewas, many upper caste youths expresses conditional support to the BJP. If they assure us a saner social policy and promise to scrap tge reservation system, they will get our support.Told even the Congress supports caste-based reservation, a youth said: They do. Both these parties want to crush the general category youths. But we expected different from the RSS-BJP. They need to be punished for the betrayal."

The talks were expected to be concluded later on Saturday.This is the first round of talks for Wang after he succeeded state councillor Yang Jiechi earlier this year. Wang has become the state councillor, a rank higher than the foreign minister in the Chinese government's hierarchy.Announcing the talks on November 21, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang presented an upbeat picture of the bilateral ties saying, ""We have properly managed the differences through dialogue and consultation. The border areas on the whole maintained stability"".Officials maintain that this round of talks may focus more on reviewing the progress on trade and maintenance of peace at borders than movement towards a solution to the border dispute as India is headed for general elections next year.Since the first-ever ""informal summit"" between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi in Wuhan, the two countries have launched a dialogue between trade officials to enhance India's exports to China to address the over USD 51-billion trade deficit.Since then, progress has been made towards increasing India's export of rice, sugar and pharmaceuticals. This is expected to come under review at the talks, officials said.Negotiations between the special representatives are regarded highly significant by both the countries as they cover all aspects of bilateral ties besides making efforts to resolve the vexed border dispute.The India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet.The last round, held in New Delhi between Doval and Yang, took place in the backdrop of the 73-day standoff between the two militaries at Doklam over Chinese army's plan to build a road close to India's strategic ""Chicken's Neck"" corridor connecting the north-eastern states.The standoff ended after the People's Liberation Army halted the plans to build the road.Officials on both sides say a lot of spadework has been done to ensure peace and tranquillity at the border, though the solution to the border dispute is still elusive even after 20 rounds of talks.Senior defence officials of India and China held the 9th India-China Annual Defence and Security Dialogue in Beijing on November 13 after a one-year gap due to the Doklam standoff. During the meeting, both sides agreed to enhance defence exchanges and interactions."

It feeds on the insecurities and validation but also gives a platform to all voices and builds communities. The Internet has it all to be a lucrative universe for cinematic exploration, which films like Ralph Breaks the Internet and Searching have dived deep into this year.Disneys sequel to Wreck-It Ralph sees Ralph (John C. Reilly), the former video game villain, and Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from candy-racing game Sugar Rush , navigate the Internet in search of a gaming console to save a damaged arcade machine. In the process, the characters stumble upon various online phenomena like viral videos, spam, memes, viruses and bots, displaying as much navet as a first-time user. The film reminds you of the time when you first plugged into the World Wide Web and were instantly addicted to its endlessness. The film is aware that its primarily meant for children yet it surprisingly ventures into dark subjects like existentialism. After getting the taste of an edgy Internet, Vanellope wants to stay online but Ralph prefers an analogue world, where comfort is rooted in routine and familiarity.At one point in the film, he enters a chamber where all comments are stored and as he begins to read, his self-confidence is instantly affected. The Internet can be both toxic and liberating depending on who you are and how you use it. Ralph Breaks the Internet has its heart in the right place but it often loses the plot by falling prey to quick laughs. It is unable to be as insightful as Inside Out. The film also plugs way too many brands like eBay, Facebook and Pinterest without being critical of any, which is counter-productive for a film trying to, in many ways, promote post-capitalism. Hands down, the films high point is the congregation of all Disney princesses in one room, parodying the various situations they have classically been in.In Ralph Breaks the Internet, its exciting to see Disney mock its own legacy of infusing tales with toxic masculinity, and if this scene is anything to go by, better narratives lie ahead for princesses all over."

A huge quantum of hazardous industrial effluent was still seen stocked at pits, fields, canals and their subsidiaries, and at some ponds.A drive to clean the area to lessen the damage has been commenced, officials of various government agencies said.The mill was strictly instructed to clear the spent wash from pits/ponds and initiate measures to prevent it from entering the canals, a senior revenue officer, one of the senior grade officials deputed to assess the damages, told The Hindu .Consequently, works to collect the spent wash by using pumps have been commenced. Dozens of workers were deputed to collect them in tankers and dump at vacant places in faraway areas, explained the officer.Meanwhile, according to sources at the NSL Sugars, the mill has identified several places at canals to dump lime-filled bags to minimise the damages.We are reducing the speed of flow of spent wash and collecting them in tankers, workers of the mill said.Meanwhile, the Koppa police have registered a criminal case against the NSL Sugars under Sections 278, 287, 337 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code.No arrests were made so far and investigation is on, said the police."

Kumaraswamy has reiterated that his government is committed to provide relief to the farming community by waiving farm loans, as promised prior to the Assembly elections, and also towards addressing other issues affecting the agricultural sector.On Friday, he laid the foundation stones for infrastructure development projects worth around Rs. 718 crore at Shivalli, Dudda, Jakkanahalli, Melkote and other places in the Melkote Assembly segment.Addressing the gathering at Dudda, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the farming community should not lose hopes as the government has decided to waive the farm loans.According to him, Rs. 9,455 crore, taken as loans from the cooperative sector banks, would be waived by 2018. Of the Rs. 9,455 crore, around Rs. 515 crore were taken by the Mandya farmers.The Chief Minister emphasised the need of establishing new sugar mills instead of spending huge sums for the revival of the State-run Mysugar Mill in Mandya, and the cooperative sector Pandavapura Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane (PSSK) at Pandavapura.Expressing displeasure over the growing objections to the Disneyland-like amusement project at Brindavan Gardens, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the project would demand Rs. 2,000 crore and the State government will establish the proposed project downstream the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) reservoir.Meanwhile, tension prevailed for a while near V.C. Farm when Janata Dal (Secular) workers allegedly assaulted the agitating farmers. The protest was organised by the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) to condemn the anti-farmer stand of the State government.Wearing black ribbons, farmers staged the demonstration and raised slogans against Mr. Kumaraswamy. Irked by this, JD(S) workers allegedly assaulted some KRRS members. The agitating farmers were taken into preventive custody and the assaulters were sent out of the programme venue.Meanwhile, he conducted meetings at V.C. Farm Guest House near Shivalli and Inspection Bungalow at Melkote with officials where he discussed the measures to be taken to proceed with regard to the various developmental projects. At 7.30 p.m., he visited temples at Melkote.Later in the night, Mr. Kumaraswamy inaugurated the three-day Thonnur Kere Utsav at Thonnur of Pandavapur taluk."

This sequel to the 2012 Disney hit Wreck-It Ralph  which was set in the virtual world of arcade games, and whose affable lug of a hero was an 8-bit video game villain trying to break free from a lifetime of mindless destruction  sends its protagonists out into the broader Internet, where they discover all the pandering, cruelty, addictive behavior and viral shamelessness that weve come to associate with online culture.The initial reason that Ralph (voiced ably by John C. Reilly) and his best friend, Vanellope (voiced by Sarah Silverman), go online is to find a replacement controller for Sugar Rush, the colourful, candy-and-chocolate-themed racing game in which she competes. But soon enough, they lose their bearings amid the labyrinthine cacophony of the Internet, which is depicted by the directors Rich Moore and Phil Johnston as an impossibly busy, multilayered cityscape of brands, emojis and careening message bubbles.To raise the funds to purchase the controller (which theyve accidentally bid up to $27,001 on eBay, since they have almost no idea what money is), Ralph becomes a viral video superstar on a site called BuzzzTube. He is then plagued by message board abuse, as well as the here-today, gone-tomorrow nature of fame in the digital era.Meanwhile, sweet little Vanellope becomes enraptured by a gritty game called Slaughter Race, which takes place in a wasteland of garbage fires, dancing lowriders, pyromaniacs and sharks. She also at one point finds herself in a corner of the web called Oh My Disney!, where she gets some daffy life advice from a collective of Disney princesses. (Its a clever bit of synergistic self-deprecation for the studio: Who doesnt want to see Cinderella break a glass slipper and wield it as a weapon? Or for the Little Mermaid to get excited about finally putting on a T-shirt?)As Vanellope begins forging her own path, Ralph becomes obsessed with trying to salvage their once-inseparable friendship, which makes him easy prey for the Internets ability to feed on ones insecurities  all our needy, clingy, self-destructive tendencies. And somewhere amid the films ornate imagery and deliriously irreverent humour, we might begin to realise that were watching a terrifying, incisive satire about the ways that a life lived online makes monsters of us all."

Bursting of high decibel crackers accompanied the celebration with scant regard for the Supreme Courts order limiting the timing to 8 to 10 pm, taking a toll on the resident birds in the park.Such high rate of bursting crackers also contributed in creating local level air pollution, which remained stagnant for a long time in absence of much wind flow.But water pollution was many times greater. During the evening, thousands of devotees offered puja at the bank of the water body with bananas, sugar canes and other fruits and then took a bath. Moreover they were putting lamps and other puja offerings in the lake. On November 13 and 14, the lake turned it into a garbage dump, said environment activist Naba Dutta , who visited Subhas Sarobar during Chhath puja.Datta feels that the amount of water and soil pollution on the days at Subhas Sarobar was much more than at Rabindra Sarobar though the latter garnered more attention because of the National Green Tribunal order violation in Chhath being performed in presence of police.A PCB official pointed out that suspended solids in water increase enormously as a result of the bathing of thousands.Such an event contributes to water pollution in various ways. Firstly, BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) level increases with the increase of organic matter in water due to so many bathing and also due to mixing of fruits etc into water; secondly, addition of oil and grease poured into lake as part of puja offerings reduces oxygen transfer in the water which may affect the lives of aquatic animals, explained Arunabha Majumder, an emeritus professor of Jadavpur University and a resident of AA Block in Salt Lake.Its no coincidence that The Telegraph Salt Lake found a number of dead snails and clams floating in Subhas Sarobar the day after Chhath puja.Women pour milk into the waterbody as part of the ritual Picture by Mayukh SenguptaSnails float on the water surface the day after Chhath puja Mayukh SenguptaA devotee prays with offerings seated by Subhas Sarobar Mayukh SenguptaAnglers take position by a dirty waterbody the day after Chhath puja Mayukh SenguptaWhat we sawThe Telegraph Salt Lake also witnessed the tell-tale signs of environmental damages due to the massive mauling Subhas Sarobar had to suffer both during the puja and afterwards.The organising clubs and police were heard making announcements to not burst crackers and throw flowers in the water but few bothered to pay heed. Youngsters were seen bursting crackers as soon as the volunteers were out of sight.We are constantly asking everyone not to toss offerings in the water and dispose of them in the designated areas and not to burn crackers as we were asked to abide by these guidelines by the police before they gave us permission to organise puja here. Our volunteers are guiding people to the sides which are safe to take a bath in, said Deepak Hari, secretary of Narkeldanga Sevak Nagar Naba Yubak Brinda, one of the many clubs organising puja in Subhas Sarobar.The day after, plastic packets, empty packets of sky lanterns, incense sticks, cups and flowers were left strewn on the ground while oil, flowers, uprooted plants from the bank sides and plastic bags were seen floating in the water.The West Bengal Anglers Association, which is responsible for looking after the water in the Sarobar, had called 15 fishermen from Bongaon to clean the water and the banks of the lake the day after. We are responsible for the water while municipality is responsible for the grounds. We are trying to do our best to make this area, particularly the water body, clean as soon as possible, said Bhajan Das, an official of the anglers association, who lamented how the number of devotees performing Chhath puja has been increasing year on year.Devotees, however, were happy to have a place nearby for their puja. Chhath is very special for us and this is one big lake in the area where we can offer puja as these rituals are to be done in the open and in big water bodies, said Shakuntala Mahanto of FC Block, who had no clue about the environmental impact.Green activists point out that Subhas Sarobar enjoys huge biodiversity and such high environmental stress within a short period can trigger significant harm to its ecosystem, both land and aquatic. Calcutta has already lost a huge number of waterbodies, and has less open space and fewer water bodies compared to any modern city. If we start to impact even those, the citys environmental quality and even drainage will be at rick which may prove to be disastrous in this age of rapid climate change and warming, they point out.Telegraph file pictureShowing an alternative wayWhile most devotees flock to lakes and rivers, there are some who perform Chhath at home, in a conscious bid to spare the environment and avoid the crowd. One such family is the Bhushans of DL Block.When the Bhushans moved into DL Block in the 90s they would head to Subhas Sarobar for Chhath puja. But the water was polluted. We started getting rashes and a shard of glass even pierced my wifes foot, says Shashi Bhushan.So from 2000, they started performing the puja at home. They did it on their terrace and used an inflatable baby pool to create a water body (A file picture dating back to 2013 above). The idea worked so well that nearly 30 families started coming over for the puja every year. The Bhushans are now stationed in Bhubaneshwar temporarily and even there they perform Chhath at home.In Bihar and Jharkhand, home pujas are becoming so popular that most houses have reservoirs built for the purpose. This is not possible for say, labourers in Calcutta, who live in small quarters. So when they visit lakes for the pujas, they leave behind diyas, flowers, fruit peels... says Bhushan. It would be great if temporary pools can be set up in parks. If local residents perform pujas there, they would be accountable to clean up afterwards too.As told to Brinda Sarkar"

Maximum dams have been constructed per hectare area, resulting in water imbalance and conflicts between different regions, talukas and districts,"" he said.""Our water policy has always remained flawed. Needs of the region were never considered while sanctioning irrigation projects. Political leaders only thought about regions of their influence,"" Lakhe Patil claimed.Giving an example, Lakhe Patil said the huge expenditure on Krishna Valley irrigation projects resulted in water disparity in western Maharashtra.While Baramati, Kolhapur, parts of Satara, Sangli and Pune benefited, other areas like Sangola, Maan, parts of Satara, Sangli, Pune, Solapur and Atpadi remained without water, he said.Lakhe Patil said the Tembhu-Takari irrigation project in Sangole in western Maharashtra, a perennially drought-prone area, is incomplete due to lack of funds.Similarly, additional water storage capacity dams were built in the upper catchment areas of Jayakwadi Dam which, he said, went against irrigation rules.""Additional storage capacity breaks the catchment water which is meant for Jayakwadi in Marathwada.The conflict started because Jayakwadi does not get enough water,"" he claimed.In 2016, the Bombay High Court passed a historical judgement regarding equitable distribution of water and held that water is owned by the state and not any particular district, region, person or personality, he said.The Mendhegiri Committee set up by the state government laid down a formula on distribution of water from the upper catchment area dams in Ahmednagar and Nashik districts as and when Jayakwadi Dam faced scarcity, he added.The Vithalrao Vikhe Patil Sugar Factory and Mula Sugar Factory moved the Supreme Court against the release of water from these dams to Jayakwadi Dam but their plea was rejected by the apex court, said Lakhe Patil.Following the SC order, Nashik authorities released water earlier this month into Jayakwadi Dam.Lakhe Patil added that 90 thousand million cubic feet of water from west-flowing rivers like Damanganga, Aurangiya, Ambika, Nar, Par goes into the Arabian Sea and no efforts had been made to store this water.He added that Mahrashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, with its chairperson being a retired Indian Administrative Officer with rank equivalent to the state Chief Secretary or a high court justice, had enough powers to tackle water conflicts.Ratnakar Mahajan, former vice chairman of the Maharashtra Planning Commission said the previous Congress-NCP government formulated a uniform water policy for the state through which it set up the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority.But, he said, the authority could not function independently while taking decisions on water distribution for drinking and agricultural purposes due to political interference.Apart from the water conflict related to Jayakwadi Dam, there are other ones too that are coming to the fore in the state.Farmers in Sangola, a perennially drought-prone taluka in Solapur district, are demanding that water be released from the Tembhu lift irrigation project on the Krishna river.They have alleged that water is not being released to them from upstream regions of Sangli and Satara due to political pressure.In Nashik district's Dindori taluka, farmers claim the quantity of their produce has declined as water from the east-flowing rivers in the district's western talukas is getting over before the crops gained strength.Farmers fromKalwan taluka in Nashik don't want water from the Chankapur dam, across the Girna river, to be released to Malegaon and Chandwad, the eastern talukas of Nashik and, further, to Marathwada.Officials said despite the general belief that there was plenty of water in the upper parts of the Godavari Basin, drinking water needs had grown tremendously due to rapid urbanisation among other aspects.There are 23 dams in the Godavari and Tapi basins, but put together, their capacity is less than 50 per cent of that of Jayakwadi, these officials noted.Economist H M Desarda attributed the present situation to what he claimed was a plunder of groundwater levels.""The groundwater bank is in negative balance and depleted due to excessive pumping. There is a needfor holistic programme for rainwater harvesting. Rainwater needs to be conserved and impounded immediately, and replenished in the soil and vegetation,"" he said. Desarda also called for water literacy among policy makers and society."

The protests erupted just before the arrival of CM Yogi Adityanath Yogi tried to assuage farmers. Timely payment of cane dues was a big challenge for our government. I am happy to inform you that we have paid dues of Rs 40,000 crore so far and I have asked concerned officials to ensure payment of the rest by November 30, Yogi told the agitating farmers.We should be thankful to PM Modi who is willing to take steps if there is a production surplus. It will make sure that the farmers get their dues on time, CM Yogi said. The farmers werent impressed, though.Not a single penny has been cleared by a sugar mill in the last 18 months.

They were also non-committal on paying above the FRP for 2018-19.Mr. Kumaraswamy told factory owners to enter into a formal agreement on the payment for supply in the present season, considering that there had been allegations of owners reneging on informal agreements to pay above FRP, contributing to the present crisis.Speaking in Belagavi, farmers demanded that the government announce how it would rein in privfactories."

Kumaraswamy had convened a meeting with factory owners. He had appealed to them to clear pending dues and enter into a formal agreement with growers on payment of money above the FRP for 2018-19.Before attending the meeting convened by the Chief Minister, the factory owners (many of whom are politicians) met at a private hotel and worked out a common strategy.A total of 31 factory owners, including Congress leaders S.R. Patil, Anand Nyamagouda, Ramesh Jarkiholi, Satish Jarkiholi, and BJP MLAs Balachandra Jarkiholi and Murugesh Nirani, attended the meeting at the Chief Ministers Home Office Krishna.Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting, Mr. Balachandra, owner of Belagavis Ghataprabha Cooperative Sugar Factory, said they have sought 15 days to resolve the issue. The factories in Belagavi have paid growers more than the FRP, while it was less than FRP in Bagalkot, he said.While the Chief Minister told the factory managements to pay Rs. 300 per tonne above the FRP in 2018-19, factory owners said they would get back to the government after assessing their financial position. The FRP was fixed at Rs. 2,550 per tonne of cane in 2017-18 and Rs. 2,750 per tonne in 2018-19. With the fall in sugar prices, Bagalkot factory owners had agreed to pay only Rs. 2,250 per tonne of cane in 2017-18, an official press release said.Mr. Balachandra said factories could not pay more than the FRP in 2018-19, since bumper crop was awaited.There was no clarity on the actual pending amount to be paid by factories to growers. While the governments records say the factories have to pay dues of Rs. 35 crore for 2017-18, farmers claimed that dues run into Rs. 450 crore as they had entered into an informal agreement with factory owners. Mr. Kumaraswamy said factories are liable to pay regardless of the type of agreement  oral or written.On Tuesday, the government held a marathon meeting with cane growers and representatives from sugar factories and pledged to get the factories to pay the dues even if the amount was more than what records showed."

Secondly, we dont believe the sugar factories will follow the governments instructions, said Sidagouda Motagi, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader in Belagavi. Though the government has claimed that it would pay half of the Rs. 300 to be paid to farmers, there is no guarantee that the factories would pay their share, he said.He also said that the factories had claimed that they would pay Rs. 150 over and above the ex-gate price for sugarcane.There is no clarity on the use of the term ex-gate. It should be farm gate price or factory gate price. Farm gate price is the price at which the factory buys produce at the farmers gate, paying for transport. Factory gate or mill gate price is the price at which a farmer gets money at the factory, after paying for transport himself.

FRP is exclusively used for sugarcane. However, it is not an absolute amount. It differs from factory to factory based on its efficiency of producing sugar. It also varies from the crop variety and its quality. This could mean that two neighbouring farmers who supply cane to the same factory may be paid differently based on the sugar content. For the crushing season of 2018- 2019, it is Rs. 2,750 per tonne, for a recovery of 10%. For every percentage point drop in recovery, the factory deducts Rs. 275 from FRP. Similarly, for every percentage point increase in recovery, the factory has to pay Rs. 275 more per tonne to the supplier."

During the current crop season, transplantation has been done only in 25,000 acres.The gap between input costs and returns is steadily widening. Since 2010 we have been demanding a price of Rs. 3,000 per tonne. Even now, we are unable to get that price, and the costs have increased manifold in the last eight years, said Muppana Surya Prakash, president of the Samalkot Sugarcane Growers' Association.Job scheme effectGoing by the nature of the soil here, we cant go for mechanisation. After the advent of the MGNREGS, we are not able to get adequate labourers, he adds.The sugarcane farmers have made repeated appeals to the State government seeking allocation of MGNREGS labourers and have offered to bear half the expenses, but their proposal seems to have been turned down. Unless the government takes some decisions in favour of the farmers, it will be difficult to retain the crop, points out Goli Venkata Appa Rao Chowdary, a grower from Samalkot.Though the government has permitted us to export sugar, the prices quoted by the exporters are much lower than the cost of production. The factories are not in a position to undertake crushing on full scale owing to the spiralling costs of maintenance, says M. Raghavaiah, assistant general manager at Navabharat Sugars, a unit of the Navabharat group that owns a factory at Samalkot.Unless we get permission to make ethanol, it is not viable to run the factories in the long run.A decision is pending with the Central government, he says."

The government has made it mandatory for all food grains production to be packed in jute. ShutterstockThe Union government has approved a proposal for mandatory packing of 100 per cent of foodgrain production and 20 per cent of sugar output in jute bags with minor tweaks in both compared with the previous year.The CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) approved that 100 per cent of foodgrain and 20 per cent of sugar shall be packed in diversified jute bags. The decision to pack sugar in diversified jute bags will give an impetus to the diversification of the industry, said an official statement.The statement added that initially 10 per cent of the orders of jute bags for packing foodgrain would be placed through reverse auction on the GeM (Government e-Marketplace) portal that would facilitate price discovery.In jute year 2017-18 (July-June), the approval was for 90 per cent mandatory packing of foodgrain and 20 per cent for sugar under the provisions of Jute Packaging (Materials) Act 1987.Sources said the decision to increase the use of jute bags was on account of the expected production of raw jute, production trends on jute sacking over the years and the likely orders by indenting agencies.The quantity of raw jute available during 2017-18 and projection for 2018-19, as per assessment of the Jute Advisory Board, is 101.40 lakh bales (18.25 lakh tonnes) and 98.40 lakh bales (17.71 lakh tonnes), respectively. The closing balance is 20.4 lakh bales (3.67 lakh tonnes) in jute year 2018-19. Further, the decision to use diversified jute bags is meant to prevent contaminants such as jute fibre and jute batching oil. The government sector buys bags worth about Rs 6,500 crore every year for foodgrains.A mechanism to enable the payment of statutory dues to jute workers and prompt payment to farmers and balers is also under consideration. The mechanism could include obtaining periodic certification from labour department and state government concerned on statutory payments to workers and self-certification from mills on payment for raw jute supplies."

Australia and Canada have disputes over wine. But that does not stop two mature nations from talking to each other and continuing good relations, said Australian minister for trade, tourism & investment Simon Birmingham.Australia has filed a counter notification against India at the World Trade Organisation, pointing to high fixed cane prices in India which it feels subsidises sugar beyond the 10-per-cent levy allowed by the global trade body. India, on its part, says the base year price for calculating subsidies is dated and needs to be changed to reflect realities.However, Australia is softening its stand at the WTO. A second notification which the powerful Australian Sugar Milling Council (ASMC) wanted to bring against the Narendra Modi-governments recently announced subsidies to mills has been shelved.Indian ministers have said they want to make India a bigger sugar exporter than Brazil ... the impact of Indias latest export subsidies could shut down some of our mills, said David Rynne, director at the ASMC.India is likely to end the cane year by producing over 31.5 million tonnes (mt), far more than the 28mt demand at home. Australians and global marketers fear the excess sugar will be exported, resulting in plunging world prices of the sweetener.However, Indian commerce ministry officials said global prices had been falling for some time and sugar mills have been struggling to sell their small export quotas abroad.Fear of China dominating the region has driven not only Japan to build closer defence and economic relationships with India but also brought on board an indifferent Australia into seeking a more strategic relationship with the sub-continent.Sheba Nandkeolyar, board member of the Australia-India Council, said, The strategic relationship with India is important for us and often influences trade and business relations.Its possible to settle our sugar dispute outside (WTO). I have had numerous conversations with my counterpart Suresh Prabhu, Birmingham said on the sidelines of the India Business Summit in Sydney.However, much of the goodwill also flows from hopes of a multilateral trade deal which would propel Australias exports to India valued at Australian $ 14.63 billion in 2016 making it the continents sixth largest export destination, into bigger league. Said Jason Clare, Australias shadow trade minister trade between India and Australia has not boomed as expected ... we need to work on that."

While there is no clarity on how many mill owners will eventually take part, former minister Satish Jarkiholi, who owns a sugar factory, told reporters in Belagavi that he will attend. Politicians own many of the big sugar mills in the state and farmers allege that the Jarkiholi brothers, Satish and Ramesh, have the largest pending dues.A farmer leader said Belagavi district minister Ramesh Jarkiholi owes farmers more than ?17 crore. The minister has dismissed the charge, saying that he will resign if it can be proved.Though the chief minister is making efforts to find a solution to the standoff, it is unlikely that he will convince the mill owners to agree on the dues at Thursdays meeting. In large part, this is because both sides have widely disparate claims. According to government records, the mills owe farmers ?35.2 crore. But farmers put the figure at around ?480 crore.The dues the government records show is as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of 2017, said Kurubur Shanthkumar, president, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association. But many mills in Belagavi, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi and Bidar districts agreed to pay up to ?500 per tonne over and above FRP. That makes the dues of the sugar mills around ?480 crore.The meeting could, however, come to a decision on the price to be paid to cane farmers this season. The farmers have demanded ?200 more than the ?200/tonne FRP fixed by the Centre this year.The government may negotiate with mill owners to pay the farmers ?100 more than the FRP, a senior MLA said.Tearing into chief minister HD Kumaraswamy for the sugarcane imbroglio and charging him with inaction on drought in the state, former CM and BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa on Wednesday said the BJP will not rest until it topples the government.Addressing party workers who staged a protest in Bengaluru on Wednesday over Kumaraswamys remark on Sunday to woman farmer leader Jayashree Gurannavar, Yeddyurappa said the BJP will give justice to the people of Karnataka by dethroning Kumaraswamy.Kumaraswamy is enjoying power despite winning just 38 seats, he said. He is neglecting the interest of people and farmers. He has insulted women of the state by making a derogatory comment to a woman farmer leading the agitation of sugarcane growers in Belagavi. Kumaraswamy has no moral right to continue in office even for a day.Though over 100 taluks are reeling under drought, neither the CM nor his ministers have toured these places so far, Yeddyurappa said. It has been six months since Kumaraswamy assumed office, but not even a single rupee has been released through MLAs funds. The government has not even utilised assistance received from the Centre.The former chief minister said the party would hold a massive rally in Belagavi on December 10, the first day of the winter session, to highlight the failure of the Kumaraswamy government on all fronts.As part of the saffron partys preparation for the 2019 general election, state BJP president BS Yeddyurappa on Wednesday appointed leaders to all 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state.Senior leader K S Eshwarappa will be in charge of the Mysuru seat, CT Ravi of Hassan, Basavaraj Bommai of Haveri, Jagadish Shettar of Ballari and V Somanna of Chikkaballapur.The saffron party is aiming to win at least 20 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka."

The Central Pollution Control Board ( CPCB ) recently directing Goas lone sugar factory at Dharbandora not to start production unless effluent monitoring systems are in place.The delay in starting crushing has put the perishable crop and the farmers financial sustainability at risk.Normally, crushing season at the factory begins by first week of November.A government official said CPCB red-flagged the Sanjivani Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana for not installing continuous emission monitoring system, which costs around Rs 45 lakh, and continuous effluent monitoring system which costs between Rs 14 to 15 lakh. The action has been taken under Air and Water Act, the official said.At the end of the last crushing season, the factory had an accumulated loss of over Rs 75 crore.South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar told TOI that he would speak to the authorities on starting sugarcane crushing at the earliest. The MP said, he has asked the factory to erect the waste effluent system as sought by the central pollution control board.Factory statistics show that Goan farmers supply between 40,000 and 50,000 tonne sugarcane every crushing season.Farmers from the state cannot supply the local cane to other factories outside the state as the sugar content in Goan cane varies between 8% and 9%, while the sugar content in the cane grown in the neighbouring states is nearly 14%. Sources said initially factory operations could not start on schedule since the state government did not release funds for the units annual maintenance. However, the factory management used some funds from the share capital to get new trash plates.The plates arrived on November 10 and the management had planned to start crushing season from Wednesday.Meanwhile, Indias total sweetener production is estimated to touch 35.9 million tonnes (MTs), registering an increase of about 5.2% than last year, according to the latest report of US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The report released on Tuesday has estimated Brazils sugar production to dip by 8.3 MTs.It added Indias huge sugar pile-up due to consecutive years of surplus production will push the global stock to a new high of 53 MTs. India and Indonesia will see record consumption, it said.India has sent delegations to Bangladesh, China and Indonesia to explore government-level agreements for exporting the sweetener as it struggles to deal with the huge glut."

The border areas on the whole maintained stability,"" he said, answering a question on how China viewed the progress made during the 20th rounds of talks.Both Doval and Wang are designated Special Representatives for the border talks.This will be the first round of talks for Wang who earlier this year succeeded State Councillor Yang Jiechi in a reshuffle.Special Representatives' talks are regarded as highly significant by both the countries as they cover all aspects of bilateral relations besides making efforts to resolve the border dispute.The India-China border dispute covered the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of its southern Tibet.Officials maintain that this round of talks may focus more on reviewing the progress of dialogue being held on trade and maintenance of peace at borders than movement towards solution to the dispute as India headed for general elections early next year.Elaborating further on China's view on the border talks, Geng said the two sides attached great importance to it.The two special representatives will have in-depth exchange of view on border-related issues.They will follow the guidance of the consensus reached by the two leaders bearing in mind the general picture of the bilateral ties and benefits of the two peoples on the basis of the outcomes that have been achieved to actively promote the negations.""At the same time, we properly manage differences, peace and tranquillity at the border areas. The two sides will also exchange views on major issue of bilateral ties and the regional and international issue of mutual interest,"" he said.Officials on both sides maintain that though a solution to the border dispute still eludes the two countries, a lot of headway has been made in the 20 rounds of talks in terms of working out mechanisms to restore peace and tranquillity along the border to resolve tensions out of the aggressive patrolling by troops.The last round which was held in New Delhi between Doval and Yang took place in the immediate backdrop of 73-day standoff between the two militaries at Doklam over Chinese military's plan to build a road close to India's strategic Chicken Neck corridor connecting the northeastern states.It ended after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) halted the plans to build the road.The Doval-Yang meeting in New Delhi in December last year also prepared the ground for the informal summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan in April, which resulted in not only normalisation of relations but gave a new fillip to the improvement of relations in all spheres of the relations notwithstanding the border dispute.Since then, both the countries have held several rounds of talks to enhance India's exports rice, sugar as well as pharmaceuticals to China to reduce the USD 51 billion trade deficit as well as improving military-to-military relations.Ahead of the border talks, top defence officials of India and China held the 9th India-China Annual Defence and Security Dialogue here on November 13 after a one year gap due to the Doklam standoff.At the talks, both the sides agreed on enhancing defence exchanges and interactions at different levels between the two militaries."

Its a sign of health and we are dedicated to that and its always been a lead metric for Nestl.Nestl India, in which the $90-billion Nestl SA has a holding of about 63%, saw its net profit increasing 30% to Rs 446 crore on a 17% growth in net sales at Rs 2,922 crore in the third quarter ended September 30, 2018.India, which contributes less than 2% to global revenues, has, however, been a big source of learning for the company. Nestl, after having been caught on the wrong foot with the Maggi noodles crisis in 2015 and from which it successfully bounced back, has had a huge lesson on the importance of reacting swiftly to any negative post on social media. The learning from the Maggi noodles case has been that staying very close to local governments and local consumers is super important. The other important learning is  as much as you want to be absolutely sure that what you say to the last degree is true, reliable and right  you also have to be very fast because these days the slightest concern, the slightest thing that gets out on social media, interest builds up to sentiments. Its important at all times to be totally factually correct, but it is also important to react very early on, as quickly as you see sentiments building, said Schneider.Today, 6.4 million packs of Maggi Masala noodles are served per day. The brand has a market share of around 60%.Schneider was interacting with select global media on the companys initiatives around Healthier Kids. With the company looking at nutrition as an intersection between business and society, Nestl renovates a third of its product portfolio every year. Schneider said the company is talking about totally different starting points market by market. With each country having specific dietary preferences, the progress is measured in different ways.The changes at Nestl are a response to the changing set of consumer preferences and tastes towards healthier products. Schneider, however, said cost-consciousness is equally important to stay competitive and make products that consumers are willing to pay for.The maker of brands like Nescafe, Kit Kat, Milo and Cerelac plans to help 50 million children lead healthier lives by 2030. Towards this, the 150-year-old company, which has a presence in 189 countries, aims to reduce salt, sugar and saturated fats in its products, while enhancing ingredients containing fibre, vegetables and micro-nutrients. In India, the company has reduced sodium by 10% and sugar by 850 tonne in relevant product categories in recent years. The target by 2020 is average reductions of 6% in added sugar, 10% in salt and about 2.5% in total fat.Globally, around 1,000 recipes were developed in 2017 as part of the ongoing initiatives towards the healthier kids programme. A bar of milk chocolate, where the structure of sugar was changed to deliver an identical taste faster than with regular sugar, helped in reducing sugar by nearly 40%. This product is currently available only in the UK.(The writer was in Switzerland at the invitation of Nestl India)"

Kumaraswamy on Tuesday warned the owners of sugar factories of strict action if they fail to pay dues to cane farmers at rates promised by them during procurement. However, with most sugar factory owners sending only their representatives for the tripartite talks  with the government and farmers  a clear commitment on modalities of clearing dues remained elusive.Speaking to reporters after the marathon negotiations with agitating cane farmers and representatives of factory owners lasting nearly six hours, Mr. Kumaraswamy said he would hold another round of talks directly with factory owners on November 22 to chalk out the modalities of clearing dues.Admitting that the one-and-a-half-hour separate meeting with factory representatives had failed to get a clear commitment, the Chief Minister said, As most factory owners had sent their representatives, who are not authorised to take decisions, I have asked the Cane Commissioner to summon the factory owners for a meeting on November 22.Issuing a stern warning to factory owners, Mr. Kumaraswamy said: They should keep their word and pay the dues based on the rates that they had agreed to pay during procurement. According to the farmers, this runs to the tune of Rs. 450 crore. They cannot play around with this commitment. We know how to rein them in, he said.I have also asked the Cane Commissioner to get details of how much each factory owes the farmers and prepare a detailed report. As of now, we only have the figure estimated by the farmers, he added."

Incidentally, the factory management had supplied seeds and fertilizer besides assuring farmers of procuring the produce as usual.A tussle between the factory management and the sugarcane growers has cropped up for the first time, with the former, due to mounting over dues, deciding not to crush sugarcane, while the growers are insisting that the management should procure produce and make payment.What we want is that the factory management should start procuring sugarcane and make payment. If it is not interested in starting crushing operations, let it transport the procured sugarcane to any other sugar factory, is the common opinion of the growers.Enquiries revealed that the management was unable to get financial assistance from banks due to non-repayment of loans taken earlier.The management has been insisting that if it is able to get a financial assistance of Rs. 10 crore on the one hand and an assurance that the sugar produced would not be seized on the other, it would start crushing operations.Deputy Commissioner Ramprasath Manohar has tried to resolve the issue by holding bi-partite meetings. However, he is yet to sort out the issue.Meanwhile, sugarcane growers met Minister for Water Resources and district in-charge D.K. Shivakumar and urged him to intervene and sort out the issue. In turn, Mr. Shivakumar has assured them of looking into the matter and taking appropriate decision after holding discussions with the Deputy Commissioner.We will discuss all possible ways and means to help farmers and would not hesitate to issue legal notice to the factory, Mr. Shivakumar said.Mr. Ramprasath, who has convened another round of meeting on November 22, has asked the managing director of the factory to attend it."
5ce689c3e8e3fc56af413b3d,A politicised industry,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/a-politicised-industry/article25553022.ece,2018-11-21,"At Belagavi, the epicentre of sugarcane agitation, the problem has accentuated for two reasons  many of the owners of the 23 sugar factories in the district are powerful political leaders and a large chunk of farmers, over a third, grow sugarcane and depend on these factories for their livelihood.Sugar is probably the most politicised industry. All factories are owned by politicians and each politician hopes to own one, said former Union Minister and farmers leader Babagouda Patil.All established leaders in Belagavi own private factories or run cooperative factories. Most recently, first-time MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar started her own factory and Anjali Nimbalkar, who was recently elected, is also planning to start a sugar factory in Khanapur, according to sources. Suresh Angadi, BJP MP, is also planning to set up one such factory.According to Mr. Patil, it is hard for officials to enforce rules. For example, the sugar control order that makes it mandatory for the government to fix a local harvest area around each sugar factory from where it should buy sugarcane is not enforced. This compels farmers to transport their produce to distances up to 200 km hunting for factories that will accept their crop. Sugarcane is a fragile crop and loses weight every day after harvest. Delayed crushing, therefore, leads to farmers getting less money as the crop weighs less. The State Advised Price and Fair and Remunerative Price fixed by the government are also not enforced. Factories have also often been accused of fudging sugar conversion and recovery data, which allows them to pay less to farmers, he said.Ashok Pujari, a farmers leader, also suspects a nexus between sugar factories and liquor industry. Factories supply molasses, the essential ingredient of alcohol, to liquor factories. Though sugar factories earn a lot through molasses trade, they do not share this with farmers, who are the raw material suppliers, he said."

Their financial condition is very good. Yet, they are deliberately delaying payment dues payable to sugarcane growers. Producers of other commodities themselves fix prices for their produce and sell them for instant cash.

Kumaraswamy and State sugar commissionerate officials, that they were were upset with the factories going back on their word to pay more than the FRP. The factories had promised this to ensure a critical mass of sugarcane supply before crushing began. However, once the supply was assured, the factories did not keep their promise.The problem, however, is this was something of a gentlemens agreement at best and there is no law regulating such agreements, a senior officer of the sugar commissionerate, who participated in the Chief Ministers meeting here on Tuesday, told The Hindu .CMs promiseThe Chief Minister has now assured the farmers that the government would help them get whatever price the factories had promised them. Strictly speaking, neither the Karnataka Sugarcane (Regulation of Purchase and Supply) Act nor the Sugar Control Order enables the State government or the district administration to enforce any agreement for payment above the FRP. But following the Chief Ministers orders, we have asked the deputy commissioners in the affected districts to issue instructions to factories, a senior officer said.Similar opinion was expressed by Bagalkot Deputy Commissioner K.G. Shantaram.Prices higher than the FRP are part of the agreement between the factories and farmers. However, as per the CMs orders, we are taking a stand in favour of farmers and instructing factories to pay the arrears as per their promise, Mr. Shantaram said.The FRP for the sugarcane crushed in the present season is Rs. 2,500 a tonne. This would be higher for factories with higher output and lesser for factories that produced less than one quintal of sugar for every tonne of sugarcane crushed.Factories in the border districts sensed that they would face a scarcity of sugarcane and growers would sell their produce to Maharashtra, Goa, Telangana, and other States. So they promised farmers between Rs. 2,700 and Rs. 2,900 a tonne. This was paid to early harvesting growers for the first two weeks or so. But then, once crushing was set in order and factories had suagrcane-laden vehicles in front of their gates, they began paying only Rs. 2,500 a tonne. This not only made farmers feel betrayed, but also led to heartburn among late harvesters, commissionerate sources said.Farmers being cheatedMahadev Madiwal, farmers leader from Athani in Belagavi, said factories were cheating farmers and the government.They dont pay us our dues and lie to the government that they have no dues left to pay, he said.Farmers in Bagalkot said politicisation was the root cause of their troubles. Since majority of the factories are controlled by MPs or MLAs, and since they are policymakers at the government level, they exert pressure on the government to see to it that they always keep a higher share of profit, Vishwanath Udagatti, farmers leader told The Hindu .He alleged that the factories always show deflated data on the recovery. He demanded online monitoring of recovery rates to bring in transparency.While talks between the Chief Minister and factory owners are slated for Thursday, the general discontentment among farmers against sugar factories and the government continues in Belagavi and Bagalkot districts. Farmers continued their dharna outside the Belagavi Deputy Commissioners office on Wednesday and vowed to continue it till the winter session of the legislature."

In the last century, 94% of the worlds seed variety has disappeared.In an effort to preserve seed diversity, essential for reducing crop diseases and increasing food supply, a few organisations have come forward to conserve them.In Jawahar block of Palghar district, Pune-based Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BIAF) has set up a seed bank with a collection of 547 varieties of rice and millets. There are 250 varieties of rice, 38 varieties of finger millets and 10 varieties of little millets.Sanjay Patil of BIAF said that the seed bank is an attempt to revive the seed varieties that are still preserved in some tribal pockets of the state.Wherever farmers have taken to sugar cane, cotton or other cash crops, the local varieties of food crops have nearly all been lost. The richness of diversity remains in tribal pockets, where there are no cash crops. However, even in these areas, we have had to identify the seed savers. This variety of jowar, for instance, is called chikani jowar  it is too oily for making rotis, and local people use it for making pappad, or for whipping up a wet gruel, he said, holding up a sample that he is putting up for display at the Wadia College Grounds, where a two-day festival of seed diversity is underway.Patil said BAIF works among tribals in the states six districts  Pune, Ahmednagar, Gadchiroli , Palghar and Nandurbar. The NGO holds exhibitions in schools to create awareness among children about different varieties of seeds and encourages kids to bring samples from home.Mono-cropping and hybridisation has affected seed diversity, but we find that for food and nutrition security, for better fodder quality for domestic animals and even greater environmental sustainability, it is important to conserve diversity in seeds. That is what we have been engaged in preserving seed varieties for 10 years, and the results have been promising, said Patil."

Kumaraswamy after a meeting that lasted over six hours at the Vidhana Soudha here on Tuesday.He said that as most factories have old weighing scales, there were complaints by farmers that they were being short-changed. Modern equipment for weights and measures should be installed in all factories without delay, he said.13 issues raisedPointing out that the farmers had raised 13 issues at the tripartite negotiations between the government, sugar factories and farmers, the Chief Minister said he had directed the factories to start paying farmers the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of Rs. 2,750 for the standing crop (2018-2019) within 15 days in one go. The Chief Minister said that as per the farmers request, the Cane Commissioner had been directed to consider ex-field fixation of cane price instead of ex-gate price.I have told the farmers that in future, if there are any issues or problems, their leaders can meet me directly without seeking an appointment. I will again convene a meeting with you during the forthcoming legislature session in Belagavi, he said.Amendment to ActResponding to the Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Associations demand for amending the Karnataka Sugarcane (Regulation of Purchase and Supply) Act, 2013 (to include provisions for imposing penalty and putting behind bars sugar mill owners who do not pay sugarcane dues to farmers), the Chief Minister said: If there are any loopholes in the Act, we will consider bringing in appropriate changes to strengthen it.Stating that he had directed the Chief Secretary to study the sugarcane pricing model adopted by Gujarat and Maharashtra, the Chief Minister assured the farmers that by next year, no situation would arise wherein they will be forced to protest."

However, the softening of fuel prices affects shipments as it is a major contributor to the export basket.Maintaining export growth from November onwards will be a challenge. We expect the import bill to come down, but the bigger challenge is that the base effect of crude price will kick in along with lower crude prices and so maintaining a strong export growth will be a challenge, Ajay Sahai, director-general and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said.India imports over 80 per cent of its crude needs. Oil imports in October totalled $14.21 billion, up 52.64 per cent from a year earlier, the data showed. Brent crude prices increased 39.66 per cent in October from the same period last year.The TelegraphPetroleum exports contribute over 17 per cent of the countrys overall trade basket.The trade deficit related to fuel items widened to $9.7 billion in October 2018 from $6.5 billion in September 2018.Sahai said: In the 17.86 per cent growth in exports in October, the net export, or the value of exports, is much less than the value in September, which was negative. In September, we suffered a negative growth. In October, we have a growth of around 17 per cent but still the value of exports in October is less than September.The October trade numbers showed that exports jumped over 17 per cent to $26.98 billion compared with $22.89 billion last year. However, when compared with September, the month-on-month dip was 3.47 per cent in October, down from $27.95 billion.Analysts expect crude prices to moderate in the coming months and are likely to remain below $70 a barrel and exports could be in the region of 10-12 per cent.However, the silver lining is the trade war between the US and China, which will provide a window of opportunity for Indian goods.Sahai said: Reaching the $350-billion target would be difficult, but the trade war provides a glimmer of hope. It is allowing new markets for Indian products and opening up Chinese markets for products such as sugar and non-basmati rice.Last fiscal, exports grew 9.8 per cent to $303 billion. In the April-October period this year, exports grew 13.27 per cent to $191 billion. Imports were up 16.37 per cent to $302.47 billion."
5ce69856e8e3fc56af4140a1,Travelling? Take precautions for traveller's bug,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/travelling-take-precautions-for-traveller-s-bug/cid/1675970,2018-11-21,"The holiday season has started and elaborate plans are being made for pilgrimages, trips to holiday resorts and visits to exotic locations. Unfortunately, 40-60 per cent of travellers will be exposed to disease-causing bugs, which result in sundry infections. Of these, 'traveller's diarrhoea' is the most common and incapacitating. It forces sightseeing and travel to be put on hold, as the search for a toilet becomes a priority.The diarrhoea usually sets in within two to seven days of travel. It is watery and may be associated with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and urgency. The good news is that it is self-limiting. It usually subsides within two or three days with or without treatment. One of the critical features of the travellers diarrhoea is that local hosts are immune to it. Their intestines have developed resistance over the years to the offending organism.Viruses belonging to the enterovirus and rotavirus family, bacteria (especially E.coli) and protozoa-like giardia can all cause traveller's diarrhoea. In 70 per cent of the patients, no one agent has been found to be responsible. There is therefore no universal cause and no common cure.Although the disease is self-limiting and usually subsides on its own, it is essential to prevent complications like dehydration. Fluids, such as correctly reconstituted, commercially available packets of ORS (oral rehydration solution), homemade ORS (1 litre of water, 1/2 tsp salt and 6 level tsp of sugar), salted rice gruel, khichdi, bananas, lightly salted buttermilk and lime juice with sugar and salt can be consumed for hydration. Alcoholic drinks and caffeinated, carbonated beverages are not recommended. It is also best to avoid milk. Keep in mind that rehydration will not reduce the frequency or quantity of the stool. It will only prevent complications.The frequency of diarrhoea can be reduced with anti-motility agents such as loperamide (imodium). More than 4-8 tablets should not be used as it can cause dizziness and bloating. These tablets are not advised for children under six years of age. Antibiotics are not routinely prescribed, as often the diarrhoea is due to viruses or protozoa which do not respond to these medications. Also, inappropriate antibiotic treatment does not reduce the frequency and duration of diarrhoea. It is only likely to produce side effects like monilial overgrowth and resistant organisms. Superinfection with some of these organisms can be life-threatening. If the diarrhoea persists for seven days or more, antibiotics may be required with a medical consultation. A short three-day course is usually sufficient. Taking random antibiotics before travel to prevent diarrhoea will also not work.If the diarrhoea persists for 10 days or more after travel, it needs to be investigated. If it is associated with belching, bloating and large unformed stools, it may be due to giardia. If there is blood and mucous, organisms like shigella or cryptococcus may be responsible. If the diarrhoea persists a month or more, and no infectious agent can be found, it may be due to a non-infectious cause or a complication that has set in, such as IBS (inflammatory bowel disease) or milk allergy.Here are precautions you can take to reduce the likelihood of diarrhoea "

The Karnataka Sugarcane (Purchase and Supply Control) Act, 2013, enacted by the BJP government headed by Jagadish Shettar after a decadelong struggle by farmers, vested with the state government the power to fix the sugarcane price each year. It also gives the government the power to seize or take over mills that fail to pay the SAP.The government calculated the SAP by taking into account the revenue of sugar mills, including from byproducts like bagasse and molasses. The farmers were happy because the SAP was usually higher than the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed every year by the central Commission for Agricultural Price and Costs. The Siddaramaiah government implemented the act by fixing SAP for two years despite a stiff opposition from sugar mill owners. Some mill owners refused to pay the SAP but gave in after a favourable court order for the farmers and the government. This led mill owners to get the government to amend the act.Since the SAP has legal backing, the mills decided do away with the provision completely, said Subhash Shirabur, a former member of Karnataka Sugarcane Control Board and a cane grower from Bagalkot. Unfortunately, the government readily agreed. Now we have to beg the mills for the right price.In place of SAP, the government brought in a revenue-sharing formula in which the farmers and the mill owners divide profits at a ratio of 70:30.As per the amendment, the sugar mills have to pay the FRP within 15 days of cane supply and wait till the end of the season to share the profit, said Muttappa Komar, Bagalkot zilla panchayat vice-president. But in the four years since the amendment came into force, the farmers have not received any money apart from the FRP. Former CM Jagadish Shettar says issues like pending dues and irregular payment have cropped up again because the government has no control over the mills. Re-enacting the SAP law is the only solution to this problem, he said. The government should seriously consider this."

Indu, Head of Community Medicine, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College.Literature says that consumption of even small amounts of TFAs is associated with an increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease.Main contributorsThe high content of industrial TFAs and salt in baked goods, fried chicken, or banana chips joints in the State is contributing to this epidemic of MS in Kerala, Dr. Indu said.WHO recommends that trans fat intake be limited to less than 1% of total energy intake and has called for the total elimination of TFAs in global food supply by 2023. FSSAI has proposed to limit TFA limit in foods to 2% and eliminate trans fats from foods by 2022.Enforcing the current FSSAI legislation limiting TFAs at 5% is the need of the hour. Denmark pioneered trans fat ban in 2003 and in three years, their CVD mortality rates plummeted. From an annual mean death of 441.5 per one lakh it dropped by 14.2 deaths per one lakh per year (ie 750 fewer deaths every year). Food industry players and the unorganised food sector should be persuaded to switch to commercially viable alternatives to TFAs, Eram S. Rao, Senior Nutrition Specialist, World Bank, who was in the city as part of the technical support team, said.We will collect information on the TFA and sodium content in a range of commonly consumed food items in Kerala.

The focus so far has been on pushing agri-products into the Chinese market. Sensing that China would look first at its food security by diversifying imports in view of the trade war, New Delhi has stepped up its agro-diplomacy with Beijing.Over the past two months, Indian food and beverage producers have been conducting seminars and road shows in the Chinese capital.Soya sourceThough Indian soya bean exports are apparently a priority, especially after the China imposed a 25% levy on U.S. imports, success in the huge Chinese soya bean market is yet to materialise, though some progress may have registered during talks. Visiting Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan in a conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Shouwen earlier in November expressed satisfaction over progress on soya bean meal and pomegranate and related issues, an Indian Embassy press statement said.However, other agri-products may have stolen a march over soya beans in finding a niche in the Chinese market. On November 6, Jay Shree Tea and Industries Ltd. signed a $1-million black tea export contract with State-owned COFCO. Assam tea, in particular, has good prospects in China as it blends well with milk-based tea drinks. China has been traditionally a green tea market. But of late, its young people are developing a taste for milk infused bubble tea, potentially opening a larger market for Indian black teas, said Arun Kumar Ray, Deputy Chairman of the Tea Board, on a visit to Beijing.Indias efforts to export sugar to China, which began in earnest in June, also appear to have paid dividends. Earlier this month, a Commerce Ministry statement said the Indian Sugar Mills Association had signed its first sugar export contract of 50,000 tonnes with COFCO. During his visit, Mr. Wadhawan briefed the China Sugar Association about Indias proven capacity to meet Chinas sugar needs over the long haul.China has also opened up imports of non-Basmati rice from India in June on the sidelines of the Qingdao summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Officials say China is a lucrative $1.5-$2 billion market for Indian rice. A delegation of Indian rice traders was in Beijing in October on a follow-up visit after China, in principle, opened its doors to 24 India-based rice mills.Efforts to tap the Chinese agri-market, in view of the China-U.S. trade war, was flagged in April. In his opening remarks at the fifth China-India Strategic Economic Dialogue, NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said India was ready to step in and supply soya beans to China. I was noticing that there were some tariffs that were issued on farmers from Iowa and Ohio, etc. Maybe India can substitute for something like soya beans and sugar if we could have access to those exports with all the due quality considerations that you might have, Mr. Kumar had said.Trade imbalanceDespite signs of incremental progress, Indias $63-billion trade imbalance with China is alarming. In his meetings in Shanghai, Mr. Wadhawan stressed that pharmaceuticals, information technology services and tourism, in which India has a significant global footprint, had a minuscule presence in China.Earlier this year, India had raised the red flag about its adverse trade balance during Chinas trade policy review at the WTO, specifically citing hindrances that Indian exporters of rice, meat, pharmaceuticals and IT products were encountering to access the Chinese market.There are some positive developments... but we want that to be reflected in concrete trade figures before we can conclude that there has been a turnaround in our commercial ties with China, an Indian diplomat told The Hindu ."

The doctors at the hospital have also said that in last few days the RJD chiefs health has deteriorated because of an infection and wound behind his neck. He can neither sit not stand due to the wound.Lalu is also suffering from diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney failure. He underwent a heart valve replacement in Mumbai in 2014, and more recently was operated upon for fistula. At present, Lalus blood sugar levels are not under control and continuously fluctuating. Dr Umesh Prasad, who treating the RJD chief, said that spreading of infection in his body is a major concern and if the infection spreads to the replaced heart valve area there is danger to his life as well.Lalus sons, daughters and sons-in-law have met him at RIMS and they have demanded that he be shifted to some other place for better treatment. Rabri herself has never ever visited RIMS to meet Lalu. She has never gone to Ranchi with Lalu in jail.Doctors at RIMS have said that Lalus condition has worsened but not reached a situation that warrants shifting to some other hospital.Rabri also taunted chief minister Nitish Kumar for installing a high resolution closed circuit television (CCTV) camera on the boundary wall between Tejashwis bungalow and the chief ministers bungalow. Its good he has installed the CCTV camera on us but I must say that it is the people of Bihar who are guarding us and they are one who are keeping a close eye on the RJD, Rabri said."

(Shutterstock)China, the largest importer of soybean, is likely to open its door for the oilseeds from India following a tariff war with the US. Beijing had recently allowed India to export non-basmati rice, rapeseed and raw sugar to meet its growing demand.The modalities to allow the export of soybeans to China is being worked out and an announcement from Beijing could be made very soon, a senior commerce ministry official said.Soybean is one of the items on which China imposed retaliatory duties of 25 per cent against the US in response to similar levies imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese products.The trade war is providing a window to the countrys agricultural products to enter the Chinese markets which will help reduce the trade deficit. The US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling goods worth $250 billion, including bags, rice and textiles. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion, mostly chemicals, meat, wheat and wine.China had already cut import tariffs on soybean meals from Bangladesh, Laos, South Korea and Sri Lanka to prepare for more imports from these countries following its reduced purchases from the US. It is buying huge quantities from Brazil to meet its demand.Officials said quality inspectors from China are soon expected to visit India to inspect facilities.Beijing had imposed a ban on the import of soybean meals from India in 2012 over sanitary issues. India produces 10-11 million tonnes (mt) of soybean annually. Indias total soybean meal exports jumped to 2mt for oil year 2016-17 (October-September) from 320,000 tonnes the previous year.Expanding agricultural exports such as soybeans and cotton to China by exploiting opportunities from a global trade war will help cut the deficit, economists at Crisil said.Closely following soybeans is cotton. It puts India in a position to step up and fill the gap left by the US, economists Dharmakirti Joshi and Pankhuri Tandon said in a report.Amid expectations of exports to China, prices of the oilseeds in the country have started to firm up with soybean selling at 3,350 per quintal (per 100 kg) in wholesale markets in Maharashtra, the largest producer of the oilseeds. In the year-ago period, prices were ruling in the range of Rs 2,850 per quintal around the corresponding period. The prices may soon touch and surpass the MSP of Rs 3,399 per quintal set by the government, traders said.Globally, the US produces 40 per cent of the total production and India 4 per cent. The remaining is shared by countries such as Argentina, Brazil and others."

He said the government was conspiring to nourish illegal stone extraction activities.Instead, the government should focus on developing the district, revive the government-run sugar mills, repair the canals supplying water for crops, and fix support/remunerative price for agricultural produce, he told presspersons.Ban quarryingA meeting of members of various groups, which was held at the Gandhi Bhavan here, underlined the need to ban stone extraction activities in a 20-km radius of the KRS.A data analysis from the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), recently, had revealed that quarry blasting signatures were recorded near the reservoir, H.V. Vasu said at the meeting.According to KRRS leader A.L. Kempoogowda, around 48 registered stone extraction units have been operating in the 20-km radius of the reservoir, apart from a good number of illegal quarrying units.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took out a motorcycle rally from Srirangapatna to Mandya on Saturday and urged the State government to ban all kinds of extraction in the reservoirs vicinity."
5ce6ac15e8e3fc56af4148d4,Lower the carbs,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/lower-the-carbs/article25529107.ece,2018-11-18,"It has been a fundamental tenet of nutrition: When it comes to weight loss, all calories are created equal. Regardless of what you eat, the key is to track your calories and burn more than you consume.But a large new study published on Wednesday in the journal BMJ challenges the conventional wisdom. It found that overweight adults who cut carbohydrates from their diets and replaced them with fat sharply increased their metabolisms. After five months on the diet, their bodies burned roughly 250 calories more per day than people who ate a high-carb, low-fat diet, suggesting that restricting carb intake could help people maintain their weight loss more easily.What it showsThe new research is unlikely to end the decades-long debate over the best diet for weight loss. But it provides strong new evidence that all calories are not metabolically alike to the body. And it suggests that the popular advice on weight loss promoted by health authorities  count calories, reduce portion sizes and lower your fat intake  might be outdated.This study confirms that, remarkably, diets higher in starch and sugar change the bodys burn rate after weight loss, lowering metabolism, says Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, who was not involved in the research. The observed metabolic difference was large, more than enough to explain the yo-yo effect so often experienced by people trying to lose weight.Dr. Mozaffarian called the findings profound and said they contradicted the conventional wisdom on calorie counting. Its time to shift guidelines, government policy and industry priorities away from calories and low-fat and toward better diet quality.The new study is among the largest and most expensive feeding trials ever conducted on the subject. The researchers recruited 164 adults and fed them all of their daily meals and snacks for 20 weeks, while closely tracking their body weight and a number of biological measures. The trial cost $12 million and was supported largely by a grant from the Nutrition Science Initiative, a non-profit research group co-founded by Gary Taubes, a science and health journalist and proponent of low-carbohydrate diets. The study was also supported by funding from the New Balance Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and others.While some experts praised the findings, others were more cautious. Dr. Kevin Hall, a scientist and obesity expert at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, said the new study was ambitious and very well run. But he said the researchers used methods that raise questions about the results. One method they used to track metabolism, called doubly labelled water, has not been shown to be reliable in people on low-carb diets and it may have exaggerated the amount of calories the subjects burned, he said.Calorie countThe idea that counting calories is the key to weight loss has long been embedded in the governments dietary guidelines. It is the driving force behind public health policies like mandatory calorie counts on restaurant menus and food labels. Many experts say that the underlying cause of the obesity epidemic is that Americans eat too many calories of all kinds, prompted by easy access to cheap and highly palatable foods, and that they need to exercise portion control. On its website, for example, the National Institutes of Health encourages people to count calories and warns that dietary fat has more calories per gram than protein or carbs: You need to limit fats to avoid extra calories, it states.But experts like Dr. Ludwig argue that the obesity epidemic is driven by refined carbohydrates such as sugar, juices, bagels, white bread, pasta and heavily processed cereals. These foods tend to spike blood sugar and insulin, a hormone that promotes fat storage, and they can increase appetite. Dr. Ludwig and his colleague Dr. Cara Ebbeling have published studies suggesting that diets with different ratios of carbs and fat but identical amounts of calories have very different effects on hormones, hunger and metabolism. He has also written a best-selling book on lower-carb diets.Dr. Hall and others disagree. They have published studies disputing the notion that carb-restricted diets accelerate metabolism and fat loss. Dr. Hall said that low-carb diets have many benefits: They can help people with Type 2 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels, for example. But he argues that the carb and insulin explanation for obesity is too simplistic and has been experimentally falsified in rigorous studies.NY TIMES"

Lalu Yadav will appear again on December 20 through video conferencing. The court also directed CBI to make all arrangements of video conferencing.Special judge Arun Bharadwaj passed the directions after he was told that the accused could not appear before the court, as per earlier direction, owing to his ill health.The court directed the CBI and ED to ensure Lalu's presence from video conference from the hospital, if he is still lodged there, or from jail.The ED, meanwhile, opposed the bail application of Prasad's wife Rabri Devi, son Tejaswi Yadav and others on the grounds that they were influential persons who could hamper the probe if granted the relief.Lalu Yadav is currently lodged in a paying ward of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) due to ill health. He was convicted in the Rs 900-crore fodder scam.The RJD chief had surrendered before a special CBI court in late August, following the Jharkhand High Court 's refusal to extend his bail on medical grounds.The health condition of Yadav deteriorated due to a festering boil on his right leg, the doctor attending him had said on Sunday.The sugar level and blood pressure of the RJD chief, who is a diabetic, had shot up in the past two to three days due to the boil, Dr Umesh Prasad of the RIMS, who attends Prasad, told PTI.The case Lalu was convicted in, known as fodder scam, is related to fraudulent withdrawal of government funds from the treasuries of various districts of undivided Bihar in the 1990s when RJD was in power and Yadav the chief minister then.The case in which the Delhi court adjourned the hearing on Wednesday, the IRCTC scam, is related to alleged irregularities in granting the operational contract of two IRCTC hotels to a private firm.Besides Lalu Prasad, and his eldest son and wife, former Union minister Prem Chand Gupta and his wife Sarla Gupta and Agarwal, then managing director of IRCTC P K Goyal and then IRCTC director Rakesh Saxena have also been named in the charge sheet.The other names in the charge sheet include then group general managers of IRCTC V K Asthana and R K Goyal, and Vijay Kochhar, Vinay Kochhar, both directors of Sujata Hotels and owners of Chanakya Hotel.Delight Marketing Company, now known as Lara Projects, and Sujata Hotels Private Limited were also named as accused companies in the charge sheet.The CBI had registered a case in July last year and carried out searches at 12 locations in Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar and Gurgaon in connection with the case.The charges in the case include criminal conspiracy (120-B), cheating (420) under IPC and corruption, the central probe agency had said.The ED had filed a case based on the the CBI FIR."
5ce6b449e8e3fc56af414a71,Here's how you evaluate a nutritional study,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/here-s-how-you-evaluate-a-nutritional-study/cid/1675695,2018-11-18,"Spin Doctors: Some negative medical findings never see the light of day. Some are reported with a spin that casts the non-significant results in a positive light (Thinkstock)Confused about what to eat and drink to protect your health? Im not surprised. For example, after decades of research-supported dietary advice to reduce saturated fats to minimise the risk of heart disease and stroke, along comes a new observational study of 1,36,384 people in 21 countries linking consumption of full-fat (read saturated) dairy foods to a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease.But without dissecting each study included in this meta-analysis, it is not possible to say what might be behind this surprising result and whether you should now resume putting cream in your coffee and whole milk in your cereal bowl. The study may simply mean that consuming the equivalent of three servings of dairy products a day is healthful, not saturated fat per se.Caution is in order, especially since another new study, this one a randomly assigned clinical trial, found that three weeks on a diet rich in saturated fat caused liver fat and insulin resistance to rise far higher than diets high in sugar or unsaturated fat.Or maybe you bought into the hype about pomegranate juice as an antioxidant superfood, only to learn that the health-promoting evidence for this expensive drink derives mainly from $20 million of company-sponsored research.In the book, Unsavory Truth: How Food Companies Skew the Science of What We Eat, Marion Nestle, emerita professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, points out that pomegranates might have high antioxidant activity, then asks compared to what? Are they more healthful than (much cheaper) grapes?The POM Wonderful company responded: Comparing the health benefits of our product to other juices is not a key objective of our extensive research programme. To which I would ask, If youre selling health, why wouldnt it be?The answer, as Nestles extensive research shows, is that the unstated interest of most company-sponsored studies is the bottom line. Its marketing research, not science, she said in an interview. It matters not whether the food in question is considered healthy, like wild blueberries and avocados, or its laden with health-robbing calories from fats, sugars and refined starches.Noting that nutrition research, especially that funded by industry, requires careful interpretation, she suggests an approach that all consumers would be wise to follow: Whenever I see studies claiming benefits for a single food, I want to know three things: whether the results are biologically plausible; whether the study controlled for other dietary, behavioural, or lifestyle factors that could have influenced it; and who sponsored it.Consider the studies sponsored by the soft-drink industry, in which Coca-Cola has led an effort to undermine the contribution of sugar-laden carbonated water to the United States obesity epidemic. For example, the company funded a study of childhood obesity that, without looking for a possible link between overweight and sugary soft drinks, concluded that low physical activity, inadequate sleep and lots of television watching were most important. To make such conclusions appear valid, Coca-Cola enlisted the participation of university-based scientists who all stood to profit financially from their association with the research.The who sponsored it issue forms the crux of Nestles book. It is a critically important question to ask, not just with regard to foods, but also drugs, supplements, exercise regimens and any other product or service that may  or may not  affect the health of consumers.Increasingly, actual or potential conflicts of interests  factors that can consciously or subconsciously influence the outcomes of research  are being brought to public attention. In September, the director of clinical research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center relinquished his post after failing to disclose the millions of dollars he received from pharmaceutical companies whose drugs he studied. An investigation revealed he had put a positive spin on results that other researchers found wanting.In September, a piece in the Upshot section of The New York Times described yet another type of conflict prominent in the reporting of drug trials: what studies get published (most negative findings never see the light of day), how their results are reported and spin that casts negative or non-significant findings in a positive light. The problem is often confounded when these spurious study results are cited over and over again by other researchers.Fifty years of research has demonstrated the influence of pharmaceutical companies on physicians behaviour. Even giving doctors pads or pens printed with the brand name of a drug can prompt doctors to ignore a generic or competing brand, Nestle said.However, Nestle said, while there have been thousands of studies of conflicts of interest involving drug studies and industry-touted medications, she could identify only 11 such studies of the influence of industry funding on the outcome of food and beverage research in relation to health.Nestle documents how commercial sources have co-opted organisations that members of the public, and even science writers like me, rely on for unbiased assessments of research results. Even experts in organisations and on panels who formulate health advice for the public can be tainted by commercial influences, she found.There is an inherent conflict, for example, within the US Department of Agriculture, which has two potentially opposing mandates. The agency is supposed to support production of all kinds of agricultural products  meat, poultry and dairy, as well as fruits and vegetables  and it participates with the Department of Health and Human Services in formulating national dietary guidelines and nutrient requirements for school lunches and other public nutrition programmes."

Some chewed on sugarcane while shouting slogans that they had nothing else but their crops to survive on. Some sat for some time with a heavy stone on their head. They said they had spent the night on the street in front of the DC office.The protest that seemed non political on Thursday, took on a political colour when BJP leaders joined the agitation.Suresh Angadi, MP, Vishwanath Patil, BJP district president, party leaders like Eeranna Kadadi and Ashok Pujari spoke to the protesters and said that the State government was not doing enough for farmers. Mr. Angadi alleged that Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had come to power based on false promises of waiving farm loans and ensuring remunerative prices for farm produce, but had forgotten his promises after assuming power.The protestors held a meeting of all leaders at the protest site and announced that the protest would continue till the government took concrete action."

On Friday, a panel of BKU (Haryana) under the leadership of Charuni went to meet Kurukshetra superintendent of police (SP), demanding quick action against the mill officials.On the other side, the parallel faction of BKU (Haryana) led by Rattan Mann and Guni Prakash alleged that Charuni had taken the money from the mill to compromise the interests of sugarcane farmers.In his complaint to the Shahabad police, Charuni alleged, Till date the Piccadily Sugar Mill, Bhadson, has not made pending payments of the farmers. In this regard, farmers had staged protests many times to pressurize the mill management to pay them the arrears. To weaken the farmers agitation, the mill had adopted two illegal methods. Firstly, the mill intentionally deposited the payments only to the accounts of the members of the Ganna Sangharsh Samiti to make them infamous among other farmers. Secondly, on October 9, the mill management offered Rs 1 lakh to me in Shahabad. To show the real face of the mill management I had decided to accept the money and disclose about them in the next panchayat. During a panchayat held on November 8 held in the sugar mill, I had disclosed the illegal method adopted by its management.Talking to TOI, Bhadson sugar mill chief executive officer (CEO) I U Khan said, The mill officials have not given any bribe. The complaint given by Charuni is fabricated and it is only a political stunt. The police are investigating the matter, truth will come out soon. A counter FIR will be filed from our end.Kurukshetra SP Surinder Pal Singh said, I came to know about the matter today and further action will be taken after investigating the matter."

In response to farmers threatening to thwart the legislature session, scheduled to be held next month in Belagavi, Kumaraswamy said, We will not allow threats like this. The Belagavi DC has held talks with the owners of the sugar mills and has told them to clear pending dues of farmers at the earliest. The owners have also agreed.Following the CMs assurance, farmers withdrew their agitation and cancelled a plan to gherao home minister G Parameshwara, who is scheduled to attend programmes in Belagavi on Saturday.Farmers had launched an indefinite dharna on Thursday night after Bommanhalli had failed to negotiate an acceptable deal with sugar factories. Farmers also held a semi-nude protest on Friday. Some protested by holding a stone on their heads. One farmer climbed the mobile tower on the premises of the regional commissioners office, while another climbed a tree in the premises of the DCs office and threatened to jump. Police personnel and fire service personnel succeeded in bringing them down. Farmers also locked the offices of the regional commissioner, DC and assistant commissioner. Police removed the locks.The protest received support from leaders of all three major political parties. Members of the Belagavi Bar Association also submitted a memorandum to the regional commissioner supporting the farmers demands.Regional commissioner PA Meghannavar had previously held a meeting with farmer leaders at his office and assured them of organizing a meeting with managements of sugar mills to discuss FRP (fair and remunerative price) and payment of dues. He said notices will be issued to factories that have defaulted on payments.Farmer leaders say 15 factories have defaulted on dues. They had handed over documents to the DCs office, but no action was taken. Farmers said many factories had started the crushing process a month ago, but no payments have been made despite a rule mandating payment within 14 days of receiving the produce."

The seminar was aimed at tax payer capacity building with respect to the use of the TRACES portal.Over 300 drawing and disbursing officers from government departments and industry, chartered accountants, tax practitioners and members of various trade organisations from across Karnataka and Goa attended the seminar.Stating that TDS contributes nearly 45% to the total direct tax collections, Yashroy said that an increasing number of defaulters in the Karnataka and Goa region have started complying with TDS provisions and that e-TDS returns are being filed in time.Some deductors, though, continue to be non-compliant, causing a loss to the exchequer. This also results in deductees not getting credit for taxes deducted in their income tax returns. The department has initiated strict action against such TDS defaulters by way of launching prosecutions against the errant deductors, she said.Yashroy also spoke about the series of surveys initiated by the department which have resulted in detection of major TDS defaulters across sectors such as the banking, hospitality, civil contractors, sugar factories and transporters, among others.

According to information available with the sugar directorate, sugar mills owe Rs 58.5 crore to growers as on November 16.Of the Rs 9,800 crore they had to pay to farmers during 2017-18, as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP) fixed by the Centre, sugar mills have already paid Rs 9,742 crore. Weve directed the factories to clear the remaining amount at the earliest, said an official.Farmers, however, claim the d ues are around Rs 480 crore. The sugar mill owners have been giving false information to the government and the sugar directorate and misleading people. Why will farmers protest for dues if they are already paid, asked Karuburu Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka State Farmers Association. Since most mills are run by ministers and MLAs, neither the government nor officials have the courage to tell the truth and this is the root cause of the problem, he added.Sidagouda Modagi, state president, Karnataka Krishika Samaja, said over 500 farmers have given a written com plaint to the Belagavi deputy commissioner, stating that they have not got full payment for cane they supplied to mills, including one owned by district minister Ramesh Jarakiholi. Are they all lying? he asked.Growers alleged that mills, mainly in Mumbai Karnatak region had promised to give Rs 100 to Rs 200 per tonne over and above the fair remunerative price in 2017 owing to the steep increase in sugar price in the open market but backtracked when it came to payment. However, an IAS officer said it would be difficult for the government to mediate in such issues when there are no documents to prove claims. Any agreement of payment over and above FRP must be agreed upon by both mill owners and growers and it should be a written agreement. Only then can the government intervene, he added."

Alleging that the subsidies have seen Indian sugar production leap from an average 20 million tonnes to 35 million tonnes this year, Australia says these subsidies exceed the level of farmer assistance permitted under WTO rules. The issue is set to be discussed at the WTOs Committee on Agriculture meeting later this month.India has so far announced several relief packages for its debt-ridden sugar sector this year, with mills saddled with several thousand crores of arrears due to farmers. With a record 32 million tonnes of production reaped during the 2017-18 marketing year (October-September), the governments relief packages have tried to manage excess supply.The first of Indias sugar sector relief packages came in June this year, with nearly Rs 4,500 crore allocated for soft loans to build ethanol capacity. In two separate actions in September, it increased prices for ethanol derived from 100 per cent sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses, while offering more production aid to farmers and transport subsidies to mills for sugar exports.Indias sugarcane farmers were expected to produce as much as 35 million tonnes of sugar during the current marketing year (October 2018-September 2019). However, this number is likely to be lower than initially expected at around 32 million tonnes, ISMA said in a revised projection recently, due to untimely or erratic rainfall. Meanwhile, diversion of cane into ethanol production through tenders floated by oil marketing companies is expected to reduce sugar production by another 5,00,000 tonnes.(With inputs from agencies)"

Desai said the amounts are paid separately. We demand that both the amounts be paid together. Also, the government has not yet declared the fresh rate of cane and the association has written to the government to raise the rate to Rs 4,000 per tonne combined, Desai said.Repeated destruction of crop by wild boars and monkeys, despite solar fencing and other arrangements, deter farmers from cultivating cane, said Venkatesh Desai from Bimbal, Collem, in Dharbandora taluka.The Collem farmer has demanded that the government have some arrangements to control animals.

As per a report from the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR) and UP Sugarcane Research Institute in Shahjahanpur, the cost of cane production recording an incremental growth in cost of cane production from Rs 287 per quintal to Rs 297 per quintal - a rise of R s 10.The rise, officials in the cane department said, is essentially because of the escalation in prices of electricity, fertilizer and diesel which is commonly used by farmers to run tubewells to irrigate their fields. The increase in cost of cane production, officials in the cane development department said, has put the government in a fix.They said that an increase in SAP would further burden the cash-starved millers resulting in delay in cane payments, triggering a potential unrest among the farmers just ahead of the much anticipated general elections due in the next six months. The cane arrears had turned into a big political issue during Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur Assembly bypolls earlier this year with the ruling BJP losing both the seats to a combined opposition. Likewise, not increasing the SAP would also snowball into a political issue with the opposition painting the BJP as anti-farmer.While cane minister Suresh Rana refused to comment on the issue, officials in the cane department admitted that increasing SAP will purely be a 'political' decision in the wake of general elections due next year. Sources said that the UP chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey and cane commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy are likely to meet CM Yogi Adityanath before SAP is announced after a cabinet nod later this month.The increase in cane production cost comes at a time when cane arrears for the cane crushing season 2017-18 still hover in the range of just over Rs 7000 crore. Nevertheless, the cane development department has set the target to clear the dues till November 30.The state government has ordered millers to start crushing of cane for 2018-19 season. As many as 50 mills, including 42 in the private sector, have already started operations by Wednesday.Not surprisingly, apprehensions have come to grip the millers ahead of the forthcoming crushing season. In a letter sent to principal secretary (cane development) and marked to CM Yogi on November 2, the UP sugar mill association (UPSMA) said that the industry was facing a huge cash deficit'' due to uneconomic pricing of cane and depressed sugar prices."

Only 61% stick exclusively to modern medicine and 9% use only alternative medicine . The main reason for these are the high cost of modern medicine and fear about side-effects.This is shown in a study  Complementary and alternative medicine use by diabetes patients in Kerala  conducted by Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies. For the study, they assessed 400 patients to check the prevalence of exclusive use of combined use of alternative medicine, exclusive use of modern medicine and combined use.The higher use of alterative medicines might be due to limited availability of free and regular supply of modern medicine from public health system in Kerala. The combined use of alterative and modern medicines could be probably due to cultural practices, lack of perceived side-effects, easy availability and acceptability of alternative medicines, said Dr K R Thankappan, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies.Doctors dealing with patients admit that often compliance is low among patients as they dont stick to prescribed medicines either due to fear of side-effects or higher costs. Depending on patients condition and other complications, the cost may vary from Rs 500 to Rs 3,000/month for modern medicine.Compliance is 65-70% and it depends on how well you counsel them and their financial status. At the onset of diabetes, patients take medicine for some time and then 30-40% stop it without physicians advice. Later, when sugar level is high, they try to control it with diet, exercise and alterative medicines, said Aster Medcity endocrinologist Dr Vipin VP.Patient realizes the problem when the blood sugar level shoots up. They return and the adherence rate holds good for one or two years. When blood sugar becomes stable, they try to manipulate medications, he added.So it is not much of a surprise for doctors that only 15% patients have diabetes under control. Reasonable control of blood sugar is important to prevent kidney disease, heart attacks, stroke and blindness.Poor treatment access, high cost, low awareness, health system challenges, inadequate number of trained physicians and the inertia of healthcare providers are barriers to achieve optimal blood sugar control. Beyond pharmacological therapy, individuals with diabetes also benefit from dietary and lifestyle management, said Dr Jeemon Panniyammakal, assistant professor, epidemiology , Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology."

During the research, antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%.The findings have recently been published in the Elsevier journal, Virology. The research group at IIT Roorkee has filed a patent for an antiviral composition containing this tamarind antiviral protein. The researchers are now developing tamarind-based therapeutic agents for chikungunya.Alphaviruses cause mild to severe viral diseases in human beings and animals and are usually transmitted by mosquitoes. The chikungunya virus is an alphavirus that causes high fever and severe joint pain.Professors Shailly Tomar and Pravindra Kumar from the Department of Biotechnology, have shown that a protein found in tamarind seeds has antiviral properties.Antiviral drugs and vaccines against most alphaviruses, including chikungunya are still not available in the market, and preventive measures are currently the only route to managing diseases caused by such viruses, said Tomar, on the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics.Chikungunya and other alphaviruses are made of a single strand of RNA that is enveloped in a capsule. The outmost layer of capsule consists of glycoproteins having glycans, a form of sugar. Through these sugar moieties viruses attach to the host cell receptors and enter the cells, causing infections.An antiviral drug that is able to block the interaction of alphaviruses with the host cell and thus should inhibit the virus. In biological systems, antibodies bind to the viral surface glycans (sugar) and glycoproteins and prevent entry of the virus into the host cells. Thus, research on developing antiviral drugs have largely focused on developing sugar-binding molecules that can mimic the action of biological antibodies.Lectin, a diverse group of proteins derived from plant sources, are known to bind to glycan sugars. The use of lectin as antiviral has been extensively studied for a range of viruses, including the HIV and HPV. Tomar and Kumar have shown that a lectin derived from tamarind seeds bind to glycans/ sugar molecules having N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on the capsule of viruses, thereby preventing the entry of the virus into the host cells. Chikungunya glycoproteins have NAG, which makes the tamarind-derived lectin a promising agent against this virus.Tamarind is known for various medicinal properties in India and is an excellent Ayurvedic food. The fruits, seeds, leaves and roots bark of the tamarind tree have been used to treat abdominal pain, diarrhoea and dysentery, bacterial infections and parasitic infestations, wounds, constipation and inflammation, said the researchers. They have isolated lectin from tamarind seeds using chromatography and have studied the binding of the lectin molecules to the glycan in the viral capsule by a process called Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Antiviral activity of the tamarind seed lectin has been shown by techniques such as luciferase-based assay, plaque reduction assay and real-time PCR. Not only did the chikungunya virus lose 64% of is infectivity on treatment with the lectin, but the levels of viral RNA in the cells were also found to reduce to nearly 45%.This study has, for the first time, evaluated the antiviral use of tamarind seed-derived lectin having specificity for NAG and assessed its ability to block the entry step of the virus, said Tomar."

Narayanasamy told reporters after holding a meeting to review cyclone preparedness. As per the forecast, Karaikal was expected to receive more rainfall and hence had to be put on alert, he said. Mr. Narayanasamy said he would chair a review meeting in Karaikal on Wednesday.Thirty fishermen who had ventured into the sea from Puducherry have returned to their respective villages. Eight fishermen from Karaikal were still at sea. Efforts are on to bring them back safely, he said. The Public Works, Local Administration and Revenue departments have been asked to coordinate their works in case of flood due to heavy rain.The immediate priority would be shifting people to relief camps and draining water from low-lying areas, the Chief Minister said.The cyclone is expected to hit the shore on Thursday. The Meteorological Department has predicted very heavy rainfall in several places in coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry from November 14. Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam, Minister for Education R. Kamalakannan, Revenue Minister M.O.H F Shahjahan, Development Commissioner A. Anbarassu attended the meeting.In Cuddalore, the district administration has sounded a high alert. With Cyclone Gaja likely to cross the Tamil Nadu coast between Pamban and Cuddalore on Thursday, the district machinery is all geared up to tackle any eventuality. Talking to reporters, Collector V. Anbuselvan said that 14 multi-purpose disaster relief centres and 28 cyclone shelters have been kept ready. Zonal officers and tahsildars have been instructed to make all arrangements to accommodate people and organise food and water, he said.As many as 3,126 first responders, 55 trained swimmers and 25 snake catchers have been identified. They will work in coordination with the official teams during exigencies, he said.Mr. Anbuselvan said a 75-member team from the NDRF had been kept on standby at Cuddalore, Parangipettai and Chidambaram. The district administration has stocked adequate equipment and machinery including 276 earthmovers, 196 generators, in addition to life jackets, boats and searchlights. As many as 7,504 tonnes of rice, 1,056 tonnes of sugar and 348 tonnes of wheat have been kept ready, he said."

The issued has snowballed into a huge controversy and wildlife activists protested across the globe. In contrast, the villagers of Yavatmal carried Asghar and Nawab in a procession and gifted them a silver cheetah as a souvenir.Nawab Shaft Ali Khan told TOI, ""After NTCA investigation we reached base camp at 730pm. Sarpanchs from affected villages in Yavatmal where human kills have taken place came to us. They requested to visit Sawerkheda village where they organised a felicitation. Asghar and I went to the village and were welcomed by 12 sarpanches and 3000 locals that include widows and orphans of victims who were killed by the T1 tigress. We were carried in a procession. They burst crackers and villagers gave us sugar and facilitated with a shawl and a coconut.The silver cheetah memento mounted on a wooden shield and a headless woman lying in front indicating it as a man-eater was presented to us. A lot of praises were showered on Asghar. My son is a hero for them. The villagers appreciated our efforts of spending 35 days and nights in the area while he searched for T1. They invited Asghar and his family to stay with them for two days. The cheering and traditional singing continued till 12.00 in the night. It was a holiday mood. As our convoy came from Pandharkawada villagers cheered all along and youth took selfies, he added.Meanwhile, the NTCA probe team questioned the five-member shooters team.Asghar Ali Khan who shot the tigress told TOI, NTCA asked us a minute to minute details of what happened on the night. They asked all the questions including how it was darted and where it was shot. We were taken to the spot individually to seek answers on how it happened. Our statements were recorded and videotaped.Asghar Ali said, ""Villagers are very happy as normalcy returned after two an half years. They can walk around freely. Children are playing outside the houses. Despite them being poor, they made arrangements for felicitation. They asked for me advice, and in my speech, it told them they have to learn to co-exist with the tigers. I told them that Maharashtra is the only state where tiger population has doubled and they have to take it as a matter of pride and try to protect forests and tigers.The tiger trackers of Maharashtra forest department found the pug marks of cubs of Avni in agriculture fields. Nawab Shafat Ali Khan said, ""The pugmarks of sub adults were found in agriculture fields. This indicates that they were hunting for hare in the fields. They are venturing two to three kilometres out. They are zero risks. They need not be tranquillised if they are living a normal life. The only worry is that the mother fed them in the last three human kills. As long as they dont turn man-eaters, it is ok. Even tranquilising causes much stress to the bit cag. Once you tranquilised you can't release them, and it is life imprisonment in a small cell. It is better to keep watch and take a decision."

However, I get to see at least one to two children in a screening of every 2,000 children in the age bracket of 3-15 years in a school health programme now, paediatrician Anuradha Khadilkar said.As per the latest International Diabetes Federation 's (IDF) Atlas 2017, India now has 1.28 lakh registered diabetic children, which is only second to the US.This number, experts said, was an underestimation of the actual prevalence as many children in India have not been getting diagnosed even today. There is a possibility that the rise in cases is due to the better diagnostic technology and increased awareness, Khadilkar said.There is no database for Pune, but around 1 in every 1,000 children has type 1 diabetes, experts said.The latest treatment modalities have improved the sugar control. Major improvement in type 1 diabetes management is through technological advances in monitoring of blood glucose and in insulin delivery systems, paediatric endocrinologist Supriya Phanse said."

The spherical dumplings that vary in size from shop to shop must weigh around 10gm each. The syrup needs to be light  the stipulated sugar concentration is 30 to 40 per cent  and have a transparent appearance.Banglar Rasogolla should also conform to the metric of sponginess and have a smooth, soft texture with average moisture content of around 50 per cent. No starch can be used while preparing the dumplings.The catch lies in the strict specifications. We at Hindusthan Sweets use a negligible quantity of starch because that gives the texture to our rasogolla. Like us, many others cant do without starch. And how about considering the fact that a large number of consumers dont prefer spongy rasogollas? said Rabindra Kumar Paul, who owns the popular franchise.Paul is also the general secretary of the Paschim Banga Mistanna Byabsayee Samity, the largest association of sweetmeat producers in the state. A section of sweet producers accused the government of not even distributing GI application forms.An official in the Union ministry of commerce and industry, which is building a GI registry, said labelling a product Banglar Rasogolla would beillegal without meeting the specifications and applying for permission.Without a GI tag, there is no way of knowing whether the rasogolla one is enjoying in Bengal is actually Banglar Rasogolla or some other variant."

It is made with grape and raspberry flavoured ice cream, blackcurrant jelly pieces, milk, freshly whipped cream and topped with marshmallow, skittles and almond macaroon.That is more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult and over six times the amount of sugar recommended for seven to 10-year-olds. It is the equivalent of drinking more than four cans of cola.The British Heart Foundation calculates an average 25-year-old would need to jog for nearly three hours or vacuum the house for five hours to burn off the calories.The researchers found that many other shakes contain more than half the daily recommended amount of calories for an adult.Action on Sugar, which is made up of specialists concerned with sugar and its effects on health, have called for mandatory traffic light-coloured nutrition labelling across all menus.The government is currently consulting on menu calorie labelling.Freakshakes were invented in Australia, but have become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years and with their photogenic qualities are a popular posting on social media."

The factory also needs to repair boilers, condensers and centrifugal machine that separate molasses from raw sugar.The facility has four crushing mills each of which require a trash plate that have been procured from a UP-based company at a cost of around Rs 5 lakh. A source said, in the absence of government funds, the factory utilized money from share capital to pay for the plates, which arrived last Saturday, as the mills cannot be reassembled without them.With the assembly of the mills likely to take another ten days, factory officials are planning to commence the current crushing season from November 21.The start of the season had been delayed last year as well, owing to the failure of a Maharashtra-based contractor to supply the adequate number of labourers. Following the delay, the season officially started on November 14, 2017, but production began only on December 6, 2017. Once it started, it was again shut down for a total 850 hours on multiple occasions owing to mechanical faults.Snags had developed in its turbine, condenser, jackwell, and other machines, and a pipeline had also burst leading to the stoppage of work. Of the 135-day season lasting till March 28, the factory functioned for less than 90 days.Despite these odds, the factory had crushed a total of 73,568.55 tonnes of cane, leading to a yield of about 5,700 tonnes of sugar."

If millers will not crush cane properly this time, most area under cane would shift to paddy and then, next year, they would not get enough cane to crush, said union leader Kirpal Singh The union demanded that the SAP should be fixed at Rs 350 this year. Private mills have already announced that they would pay only fair and remunerative price (FRP) announced by the Union government, which is Rs 275 per quintal, this time and the state government, if it announces the SAP, would have to pay the difference. Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association president Jarnail Singh Wahid said there were yet to receive a communication on FRP and SAP from the state government.State cane commissioner Jaswant Singh said the letter to start crushing from November 15 had already been issued. The state government has decided to keep SAP at Rs 310 per quintal. The notification will be issued after Sunday, he said."

But when bouts of fits and vomiting went up after medication, paediatricians ordered further tests.The results showed he had monogenic diabetes  a rare condition resulting from mutations in a single gene passed on by parents and which can be managed without insulin. Unlike in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, where there are multiple gene mutations, this has only one gene variation.The rogue gene was making his pancreas release too much insulin that would speed up metabolism. As a result he would frequently have dangerously low sugar levels, said his mother Geetha. The only option was to remove nearly 95% of his pancreas.Now nine, Daiwik has normal blood sugar levels and does not require medication to manage his sugar levels, but the frequent blood level drops when he was less than one-year-old damaged his brain. He forgets things very fast. I wish we had known about his condition earlier, Geetha told a hall filled with children with monogenic diabetes and their parents at an event organised by the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation.Tears welled up in the eyes of Saranya R, who lost two children to Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS)  a genetic disease characterized by permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus with multiple stymied growth, weak bone and other clinical manifestations, including recurrent episodes of acute liver failure. I have been working hard to keep Varun alive for 13 years. I could not help his sisters, she said.Over the last decade, the number of people diagnosed with monogenic diabetes has increased, say doctors at the Madras Diabetes Foundation. We realised these patients and their parents need support groups so they can share information and help each other. We are also making recommendations to the government based on policies, said diabetologist Dr V Mohan. On Saturday, ahead of international day for diabetes (Nov 14), his centre launched Monogenic Diabetes Study Group . The Madras Diabetes Research foundation has also tied up with centres across the country for diagnosis and treatment of children with the condition.Many poor patients get free treatment. While tests for research purpose are done for free, we raise funds for treatment for some patients, he said. On Saturday, the research foundation promised medication for twins Yamunashree and Gopikrishna, 9. Their medicines cost Rs 10,000 a month.

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityKOLHAPUR: Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, the farmer outfit led by MP Raju Shetti , cancelled its proposed 'Chakka Jam' (road block) agitation set to begin on Sunday after an hour-long meeting of farmers' representatives with sugar mill operators.The operators assured the farmers that mills will pay the fair and remunerative price (FRP) in a single instalment, unlike last year when the FRP was divided into two instalments.Also, mill operators have decided to pay the amount based on 9.5% recovery rate instead of 10% fixed by the central government. Shetti had demanded Rs 3100 per tonne for sugarcane and mill operators have agreed to pay Rs 2,750 per tonne. The rest of the amount will be paid if the market condition of sugar improves and the mills make profits.Former MLA Prakash Awade, speaking on behalf of sugar mill operators, said, ""Considering the market situation. The demand put forth can't be met. We are ready to pay the FRP amount in one instalment. The rest of the amount will be paid if the mills gain, and if the market situation improves. We are ready to pay more to farmers.""Mill operators said last season there was a decline in sugar prices. They are thus not in a position to adhere to the price fixed by the centre. However, considering the anger of the farmers, which has already forced mills to delay crushing sugarcane by two weeks, mill operators concluded that they will pay as per the FRP.It is learnt that while the discussion was on, one of the mill operators called Shetti over the phone and told him about the decision. Since Shetti was not in the city, he was not present at the meeting. He had sent his representatives to confer with the mill operators.After the meeting, Shetti's close aide Bhagwan Kate said, ""We made three demands. First -- pay FRP amount in single instalment. That has been met. Second, pay Rs 200 per tonne in addition to FRP; mill operators have assured us that once the price of sugar in the open market reaches Rs 34 per kg that will be possible. Also, the third demand of payment of dues for last season will be immediately met. Now, the mill operators from Sangli are going to take a similar decision. The agitation has thus been called off."""

This new building replaces a row of dilapidated rooms.In the last four-and-half years of the first BJP majority government ruling in the country, RSS and many of the Sangh Parivar constituents have consolidated their immovable assets. From state-of-the-art building for the BJP in Delhi to large-scale expansion at Jhandewalan, RSS and smaller organizations affiliated to the Sangh have never seen such good times.In the city where the RSS is headquartered, a national cancer hospital with over Rs500 crore investment has taken shape. The idea was old but the success has come in these four years. Madhav Netralaya, another Sangh offshoot, has one unit at Vivekananda Nagar and is now coming up with a larger one at Hingna.Vivekananda Hospital at Khapri has been refurbished. Hedgewar Blood Bank has got a spanking new building near Ram Nagar. Construction work worth crores has been witnessed at the Reshimbagh facility of RSS. Hindu Dharma Mandir at Dhantoli, a new building of ABVP opposite Anand Talkies, has materialized in less than five years. The cooperative banks supported by the Sangh too have gained good financial health. RSS has also officially claimed that enrolments in its shakhas have gone up substantially.All this activity has brought great cheer to Sangh supporters. For them, the Modi regime has helped each constituent to grow with vigour. The Statue of Unity that has come up on the banks of the Narmada in Gujarat has given them hope that the Modi government would take firm steps to realize the Ayodhya Ram temple promise too.The Congress, meanwhile, is crying hoarse that the RSS has installed its men in Raj Bhavans across the country and in key positions like vice-chancellors, besides thousands of posts over which the government has direct control. However, even the Congress-ruled governments have ensured that people close to their ideology got all key positions. The Congress and Left enjoyed this advantage for decades, now the Sangh Parivar has done the same thing.RSS observer and analyst Dileep Deodhar is not surprised. They have been preparing for it, and when the chance came, the Parivar has grabbed it. According to him it was RSS stalwart Bhaurao Deoras, brother of third RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras, who had in 1991 laid the foundation for this.Bhaurao Deoras had exhorted that if someone close to the RSS came to power, the Sangh Parivar should not be caught napping. It should have men ready for the task cut out, he had warned, just before his demise, said Deodhar.Deodhar pointed out that during decades of the Congress rule, the partys leaders amassed wealth and individuals became immensely powerful. In stark contrast, the Sangh model has helped growth of the Parivar and made each organization stronger in terms of assets and facilities, he said.The cancer hospital started by Aabaji Thatte Trust is not any individuals property but its dedicated to society at large. So is the blood bank or the cooperative bank giving employment to many. In the Congress regime, its leaders created private education empires or sugar factories or cooperatives over which they exercised control, Deodhar said.These Congress leaders used their wealth for personal or progenys sake, or against a rival within the party. Not many of them are ready to bail out the party in its hour of need and resource crunch, Deodhar said.The benefits reaped by the 36 frontal organizations of the Sangh and league of its sympathizers and supporters would now come handy for the BJP to come back to power in 2019, Deodhar said.Perhaps, the biggest gain for the Parivar constituents was from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds that flowed from India Inc. Last year, Ratan Tata chose to spend his birthday at the RSS headquarters here, pledging full support to Bhagwat for joint projects with Tatas. This raised the credibility of the RSS and Sangh parivar. The win-win situation can continue if the Modi government gets another term in office."

While diabetes has been growing manifold across the globe, there were ways with which the patients can live with certain regulations in the intake of food and changes in lifestyle habits. Keeping this in mind, the hospital, through its Diavention Trust, had planned to involve diabetic patients in participating in the hunt. At least one participant shall be a diabetic patient and a navigator would be allowed on a bike. The participants shall compulsorily wear helmets. It would be flagged off from Madurai Medical College grounds by Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham in the presence of Dean M. R. Maruthupandian at 7 a.m. and conclude at the MMC grounds around 9 a.m.The participants, Dr. Arthur said, had to cover 10 different locations in the city and at every spot, the hospital staff would issue clues to the next point. Thus, it would not be described as a race, but on the lines of a treasure hunt. It would be of interest to participants to learn about diabetes differently, he added."

""However, they stopped attending my calls,"" he said. After Patil approached the police, Swapnil was traced to a hideout in Baramati, based on his call data record (CDR) network location, and arrested on November 2. ""A team has been sent to Baramati to track down the main accused,"" said inspector Balwant Deshmukh .The police have found out that Swapnil and his father have also duped a Pune-based businessman of Rs1 crore after promising to convert his agricultural land into a residential plot.

The accused seem to promise people approvals from government for various projects,"" said a police officer."
