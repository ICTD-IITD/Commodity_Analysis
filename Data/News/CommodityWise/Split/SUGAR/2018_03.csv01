Director general of police (DGP) RP Sharma expressed displeasure that the SPs hardly invoked the stringent provisions of Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (PITNDPS) Act that ensure preventive jail detention of habitual drug peddlers for a year.I do not think the NDPS Acts special preventive law, meant to prevent habitual offenders from indulging in narcotics trade, was ever invoked on anyone in Odisha in last five years. Recently, we received proposal from Koraput SP Kanwar Vishal Singh to invoke the preventive law on two habitual ganja smugglers. The proposal is being examined by the government. The state home department is only authorised to pass the PITNDPS order, Sharma told TOI. Sources said a person can be held under the PITNDPS Act for a period of one year without any scope for bail even as his detention period can be extended further.Koraput police that busted several drugs trafficking rackets in recent past have proposed to invoke the detention law on Bhagaban Khila and Trilochan Bag, the two habitual drugs traders. Interestingly, Khila is a police constable, who was already arrested twice for allegedly conniving with ganja smugglers in Koraput. He is still in judicial custody.As Odisha turned out to be a safe haven for ganja cultivators and smugglers, DGP Sharma said all SPs have been instructed to strengthen enforcement drives under NDPS Act. Our focus is destruction of cannabis plants and arrest of ganja smugglers. At times we face difficulty to carry out enforcement drives in Maoist-hit areas as people cultivate in inhospitable terrains. We will soon launch massive drive against ganja cultivators and traffickers in Malkangiri , Sharma said.Additional director general of police (Crime Branch) Santosh Upadhyay said the Odisha police recorded highest ever seizure of narcotics substances under the NDPS Act in 2018 compared to the previous years. Between January and September this year, the police seized nearly 673 quintals of ganja across the state as against the seizure of about 303 quintals in 2017, 428 quintals in 2016 and 198 quintals in 2015. Our personnel also seized record quantity of brown sugar this year compared to the past. While 915.5 grams of brown sugar was seized so far this year, 411.51 grams of the substance was seized in 2017, 704.44 grams in 2016 and only 04 grams in 2015, Upadhyay said. Crime Branch said cannabis cultivation was destroyed on 4632 acres across the state during 2017-18 crop year compared to destruction of the ganja plants on 3599 acres in 2016-17 and 2457 acres in 2015-16."

We are on the verge of losing another proposed investor, ITC , which is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore, he said.The ITC has been waiting for land allotment for the last one year. The company requires 70 acre land in Muzaffarpur , which is currently with the Bihar State Sugar Corporation. We are unable to give the land to ITC because the sugar corporation is not transferring the land to us, explained the BIADA MD.According to him, a US-based company has proposed to invest Rs 350 crore to set-up a Maize Park in Purnia , but BIADA is unable to facilitate it for want of land.Apart from non-availability of land, another issue is non-allotment of land to non-priority manufacturing and service sectors. For example, three cement projects  each worth Rs 600 crore  are pending as we are not allowed to give land to this non-priority sector, Shrivastav said.He said he would submit a proposal to principal secretary ( industries ) K K Pathak at a scheduled meet on November 16, seeking land transfer from the state government to BIADA, amendment to the Bihar Industrial Policy 2016 and allotment of land to non-priority sectors. He said BIADA has 116 acre land in bits and pieces across the state."

""We will not allow them to do so. We will not allow them to start crushing if they decide to pay FRP in instalments,"" said Shetti.Minister of state for agriculture Sada Khot has sought payment of FRP + Rs 200 (Rs 2750 + Rs 200) rate per tonne for sugar cane in the presence of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis at a sugar cane conference in Kodoli last week.""This indicates that the government is ready to accept the amount declared by Khot. But government has not taken any official step in this regard nor has assured farmers about the price,"" he said.Shetti pointed out that revenue minister Chandrakant Patil has stated that the millers are facing problems to pay FRP this year. ""We will not allow the government to take the side of millers regarding FRP issue. They must pay FRP at one time. We can wait for the additional amount,"" he said.Shetti added they were firm on their demand for change in recovery base from 10 per cent to 9.5 per cent and FRP (Rs 2,750) + Rs 200 per tonne linked to this recovery rate. Raghunath Patil, leader of one faction of farmers' organisation, has already conducted a sugar cane conference in Kolhapur on October 10 and demanded Rs 4,500 per tonne for sugar cane crop from sugar mills. The Union government has fixed the FRP for sugar cane crop at Rs 2,750 per tonne for 10 per cent recovery and Rs 289 for every 1 per cent rise in recovery in the FRP."

Irked with the delay in payment from the Arignar Anna Sugar Mills at Kurunkulam, the farmers demanded the settlement of dues immediately.The farmers also held black flags stating that they are observing Diwali day as a black day.Farmers in Thanjavur district usually take up sugarcane cultivation on thousands of acres. However, due to the non-payment of arrears by sugar mills, the number of cane farmers in the district has gradually been coming down, farmers said.Non-payment of arrears is the main reason for the farmers who have abandoned their lands without taking cane cultivation. Private sugar mills are enjoying privileges from the governments. However, they are not ready to pay the dues to the farmers who are in distress, they alleged.Cane growers across the state have been demanding Rs 4,000 per tonne for their sugarcane, as the input cost for raising sugarcane has been skyrocketing day by day, they said. As of now, the government has been providing Rs 2,750 per tonne to cane farmers. So, there was a shortage of Rs 1,750 per tonne. Despite many obstacles, farmers have been managed to raise cane, farmers lamented.Sugar mills across the state have to be disbursed arrears amounting to Rs 1,600 crore. The Arignar Anna Sugar Mills is yet to pay Rs 30 crore arrears to its members for many years. Each farmer has to be paid Rs 450 as arrears per tonne, they alleged.Despite repeated representations and number of protests, the mill authorities have remained mute, they further stated. Farmers said that they have decided to stage a marathon hunger strike in front of the sugar mill if the situation continues without any development."

The forest department has yet to take a call on this matter and has installed a cage to trap the animal, which has injured 12 people..Kailas Pawar (35), a resident of the village, has sustained major head injuries  he received 45 stitches at Sassoon hospital in Pune. All the other injured received treatment at a local government hospital. They are mostly workers engaged in cutting sugar cane or at jaggery-making units. All of them hail from outside the state.The attack occurred between midnight on Sunday and 5am on Monday. Most of the people stay in small huts. As the nights have been warm, most people have been sleeping outside their houses. Thats how they were targeted by the animal, Nanda Bhandvalkar, sarpanch of Dapodi village, told TOI on Wednesday. We feel it is a leopard as they are found in large numbers near the adjacent village of Pargaon. In fact, a leopard was spotted in the nearby Bori Pardhi village yesterday, she added.We conducted a panchnama at the sites. We found pugmarks of an animal on a brick at a kiln near the site of the attack on Monday evening, forest guard Ankush Kharat said.We have installed a cage to catch the elusive animal. We showed the injured people photographs of leopards, hyenas and even foxes, but they could not identify it. They only said that the animal was larger than a dog, M N Hazare, range forest officer of Daund taluka, told TOI. Leopards normally attacks their prey and drag them, but that has not happened here. A hyena does not attack a people sleeping in groups. So we are not able to ascertain which animal attacked so many people, Hazare said.This is flat terrain. There is a jungle along Bhima river, located 10-12km away. We dont think a leopard would have come this far away, Hazare added.The department has spread awareness among the villagers. We have advised the people not to sleep in the open, to carry torches while moving at night, to move only in groups and play loud music on their cellphones, Hazare said."

We are also setting up a 200 kilo litre of distillery (ethanol) capacity which will be operational from 2019-20 sugar season starting October next year,"" Shriram told .That apart, he said the co-generation power would also be added next year. The company would be able to sell 76 MW of surplus power to the grid post expansion.Asked about sugar production, he said the company is likely to produce 70-75 lakh quintal of sweetener in 2018-19 marketing year (October-September) as against 66 lakh quintal in the previous year.On exports, he said: ""We have got an export quota of 92,000 tonnes. We have already contracted about 40,000 tonnes for exports and will soon complete the contracts for the entire quota. We will complete shipments by end of the cane crushing season.""The losses in undertaking exports would be compensated from financial assistance offered by the government.The Centre has announced a financial assistance of Rs 13.88 per quintal cane crushed in 2018-19 marketing year to offset the cost of cane. That apart, it is providing support to mills by compensating expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate 5 million tonnes (MT) export during 2018-19.Interest subsidy is also being offered for creating ethanol capacity.in 2017-18 marketing year India had an all-time high sugar production of 32.5 million tonnes and expects similar output this year or little less.On arrears, Shriram said the company owes about Rs 250 crore to farmers for the cane purchased during 2017-18 marketing year and the same would be cleared soon.Apart from sugar, DCM Shriram is into fertilisers, seeds, chemicals, cement and UPVC windows businesses.In the chemical business, the company is expanding capacity by 560 tonnes per day at its Bharuch and Kota plants with project cost of Rs 350 crore. Another Rs 240 crore is being spent on 66 MW captive power plant at its Kota plant in Rajasthan.In plastic business, Rs 32 crore has been earmarked for adding capacity of 40 tonnes per day.""Our expansion projects in different businesses are getting operational in phases and will be fully completed in next 12 months,"" Shriram said.Out of proposed Rs 1,300 crore total capex on expansion, he said the company has already invested about 500-600 crore and the rest amount would be put in over the next one year. ""The expansion will help in future growth of the company"".DCM Shriram is also strengthening its product portfolio in bio-seed, farm solutions and 'Fenesta' window businesses to achieve sustained growth.Last week, DCM Shriram reported a 2 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit at Rs 168.7 crore for the second quarter of this fiscal on higher finance cost. Total income rose to Rs 1,717.28 crore in the July-September period of 2018-19 fiscal from Rs 1,620.53 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. MJH DRR"

The old Kali Pujas of Kolkata  held at the palatial mansions of the aristocrats  defy the passage of time and take you back to a bygone era when the city was still developing its festive culture. The bonedi families stick to the tradition with the same devotion with which their forefathers had launched them. Centuries have passed and the grandeur has ebbed, but they still survive.Take Dorjipara Mitra Bari , for instance, that has been holding its Kali puja for the last 226 years. Started by Prankrishna Mitra two centuries ago, the first idol was just 1.5 feet in height. It changed the fortunes of the family. Still worshipped in exactly the same manner, the family offers 108 aparajita flowers to the goddess. Kali here is worshipped with Durga, Lakshmi, Saraswati and Jagadhattri. We are extremely careful about the rituals, said Anusuya Biswas of the family.At Hatkhola Dutta Bari of north Kolkata, the puja has to begin exactly three and half hours after sunset and iswrapped up by 11pm. Believed to have started in 1794, the Duttas worship Dakkhina Kali and the image is not wrapped in a saree. We stick to the rituals and timings as prescribed in the scriptures.They have never changed, said Suchismita Dutta, a family member. A unique feature at the Dutta bari is Dipannwita puja  which involves lighting up the whole house with 108 diyas.At the Pathuriaghata mansion of Chhatubabu-Latubabu, the puja is launched with the bursting of crackers at exactly 7pm. We burst seven firecrackers and the fireworks continue for an hourand-half without a break. The preparations begin weeks in advance and the bhog is cooked by a designated thakur, said Debnath Dutta, a family member.At Haldar Bari, the puja bhog is prepared only by the women of the house. Started in 1750, the puja was once held on a grand scale. Over the years, it has lost much of its grandeur but the age-old practices havent been discarded. Here, the idol would be tall but was shortened due to safety reasons in 1954. As long as the puja continues, no electric light can be switched on. The whole house is lit up with candles. Many years ago, we had boli but it was stopped in 1942. But little else has changed. For instance, we have been offering sugar to the goddess ever since the puja began, said family member Barun Haldar who plays an active role in organizing the puja."

Chandrasekhar Rao for corruption. Only KCRs family members were seen in all television channels indicating their dictatorial authority within the TRS, he said.Addressing the BJP Jana Sanghatana meeting here on Monday, the senior MP said that the Centre had sanctioned Rs. 1,157 crore for the construction of houses giving subsidy at the rate of Rs. 1.30 lakh to each house. While it constructed houses with the assistance of the Centre, the TRS government claimed the scheme to be its own contribution, he said.Stating that BJP would win Armoor, Nizamabad Urban and rural, he said if his party was voted to power, it would put a bridle on liquor sale. KCR regime earned Rs. 20,000 crore each year through liquor sale, which was the highest in the country, he said.

Congress was aligning with TDP which was dubbed as another name for corruption by late N.T.

The grey-suited governess  Mary Poppins  gets a pair of unenthusiastic children to finish their chores by showing them how a song can move the job along.But  I hear you say  not all jobs can be moved along with a song. There are many that are absolutely no fun, where the only pleasure is that of completion. How does one find that element of fun where none exists? Or, to put in a different way, how can one inject fun into a dull chore?Lets take college assignments, for instance. Sometimes, the assignment takes on a life of its own and becomes an enjoyable exercise just because of the subject matter, or because you find the topic interesting. But what if it is for a course that you have found dead boring, or one that you have no real engagement with? What can you do that lights a spark and makes the process more bearable? Almost all topics can be looked at through a variety of lenses and interpreted in multiple ways. Look for a way to link the boring subject with something that you are interested in. For instance, if you are a football fan, you can use the sport to speak to a number of concepts in science, marketing, history, and so on. If you enjoy keeping up with fashion, you can do the same  the industry depends on a whole range of processes and partnerships  materials science, adaptability to climate, aesthetics, and yes, even math.Team workOf course, this approach may not always be feasible, as some assignments are specific and do not allow you room for such interpretation. Another way of bringing relief to tedious or difficult work is to pool resources with a friend  what in common parlance is called joint study. Agree to work together in a way that motivates you  take short chat breaks to compare notes, egg each other on, and share ideas as you work, and give feedback on progress. Group assignments are usually structured in a way that you need to work with others, and this can be fun and well as productive, as you are combining ideas and keeping each other on track. Work becomes a shared project, not a burden you alone have to bear.For some people, playing music helps them focus and release the tensions related to meeting deadlines, or addressing quality and completeness. In fact, music has been used even by surgeons in operating rooms, because it helps steady the nerves and achieve a working rhythm.

The border haat committee, in its recent meeting, decided to formally ban the entry of people from beyond the 5km radius of the market.Sepahijala district magistrate Dr Brahmneet Kaur said, ""As we have taken a decision to ban the entry of people in contravention of the agreement, we will issue a formal notification soon. Local residents have been complaining against the entry of outsiders for a long time now. As of now, the administration has decided to allow 1000 buyers and sellers - all local residents - to enter the border haat.""Many businessmen from distant cities have been procuring goods from the haat and selling it at higher prices in the open market. This reportedly angered the local residents who could not purchase most of the local items from the border haat. ""Items like sugar and cosmetics from India and packaged food, dry fish, hilsa and plastic goods from Bangladesh were procured en masse by big businessmen of both the countries. As a result, local consumers were not getting access to most of these products,"" said a senior official of the administration."

The entire family would come together to do puja, after which we would eat all sorts of mithai and festive delicacies. All the kids would play games  our favourite one was snakes and ladders!Diwali plan: I plan to celebrate this Diwali at home with family and close friends. We are planning to have a small puja and dinner at home, post which we will all play cards and just enjoy a simple celebration. As far as Diwali shopping is concerned, I will be buying some jewellery for my wife Pankhuri and my mother.Sourced by The TelegraphRithvik DhanjaniAppeared in: Pavitra Rishta, Kumkum Bhagya, Nach Baliye 6Favourite Diwali memory: My most memorable Diwali moment is from my childhood. I remember in our lane we had a buaji we were irritated with. In fact, she was the most irritating person in the colony and everyone disliked her. She lived in a white house and one day, a cow pooped outside her house and we put a rassi bomb on top of the gobar. The result was gobar all over her white house; her entire house was smeared in cow dung! She got to know who it was and we had a Happy Diwali... we had to clean the cow dung the next day.Diwali plan: These are childhood memories but as I have grown up I have come to believe that people should stay away from crackers as they are not only unsafe but are also causing a lot of pollution. So this year guys, please enjoy a cracker-less Diwali! Also, since the festival of Diwali is all about family and friends, this year too, I will be celebrating Diwali with my family and close friends at my home in Mumbai.Sourced by The TelegraphVivek DahiyaAppeared in: Ye Hai Mohabbatein, Nach Baliye 8, Qayamat Ki RaatFavourite Diwali memory: Back home in Chandigarh, we dont have apartments but independent houses. We would all be out on the road bursting crackers. Some would start as early as 8pm and it would go on till 2am. This was back when there was little awareness of air pollution from firecrackers. These were some sweet memories while growing up but now I feel a responsibility towards our environment  so I will refrain from bursting crackers and urge my fans to do the same.Diwali plan: Ill be going home this Diwali... will be celebrating it in Chandigarh this year. My wife Divyanka will be there too, so Im looking forward to some family time with my parents and sister. Well be home and have a few relatives over.My mom prepares a lavish meal but Im already craving for her dessert! For the smallest of occasions, we celebrate with special sweets prepared by her. Her Diwali special is kheer. This year we will celebrate Diwali with earthen diyas. Divyanka and my sister design lovely rangolis and they do it all by themselves.

I feel slightly embarrassed saying that now, but I did. Id save money to buy firecrackers  with around 400 or 500 bucks. Every day there would be new permutations or combinations, like Id need these many rockets, laris, anars or bombs. Itd change every day depending on my budget. That used to be really cool. I used to start making that budget two months in advance, thats how excited I used to be .I remember we used to go back to our hometown Udaipur or to Gujarat where my nana used to be and I used to really look forward to that. But as I grew up I started disliking firecrackers and realised we can completely do away with it. Those were some amazing occasions full of memories. In Udaipur, I used to love having batashas; they were sweet sugar balls.Ive a fond grown-up Diwali memory too. Two years back, when my grandfather came down from the US, we celebrated Diwali with him. It was lovely; he led the puja. Its something we do only once a year so we really look forward to the puja. It was sweet to get blessings from him and do it with him. I remember going to my wife Jankees house during one Diwali and hanging out with my in-laws and friends; that was a perfect Diwali, too, with just family and friends.Diwali plan: My next three weeks are extremely busy so I hope to get a holiday for Diwali. My folks are not back in Mumbai until the night of Diwali which means that Jankee and I will have to step up and do the puja. But Im really pushing them to come back for Diwali and do the puja with us which is a yearly affair. Theyre coming back from Rajasthan, so Im expecting a lot of sweet treats, which I absolutely let go and indulge in a week before and a week after Diwali! I really enjoy that. Jankee and I both love decorating our house during Diwali with a lot of lights. We also like to call our friends over; that would be an ideal Diwali, to have friends over a night before Diwali, sit and chat, sing songs. I dont really play cards, so singing, drinking and eating a lot of good food is what wed like to do. We also do a lunch with all the combined staff that we have  both of our parents and us. We like having a meal with them and give them their Diwali goodies. Its a ritual that weve started and something we like to do. As you grow older you realise you want to spend it with your parents first and then friends because you spend the rest of the year with friends. Thats something Ive grown up to acknowledge and accept and value.I love wearing Indian clothes during this time. I know not too many men around me are kicked about wearing Indian clothes. But I love wearing kurta-pajamas! I get new kurta-pajama for Diwali that lasts me the whole year. My cousin, Priyanka Bapna, is a well-known designer. She does it for me every year.Sourced by The TelegraphKaranvir SharmaAppeared in: 24, Mangalam Dangalam, SiyaasatFavourite Diwali memory: The first time I got the permission to light a green rassi bomb!

It was like love thy neighbour for us.

Its a very tight schedule managing both. Ill get one day off  on the Diwali day. Ill make sure that its my biggest cheat day  Ill eat all the mithais.

They were upset that Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes had reneged on an offer late Friday to provide buses on Saturday to leapfrog the migrants to Mexico City.The migrants trekked to the town of Isla, about 700 miles (1,126 kilometers) south of the U.S. border, where several thousand stopped to rest, eat and receive medical attention. They planned to spend the night there before departing at 5 a.m. Sunday en route to the town of Cordoba.But other migrants, mainly men and the younger members of the group, kept on walking or hitching rides toward Puebla and Mexico City. They hunkered down for the night in Juan Rodriguez Clara or Tierra Blanca farther along the route.ALSO READ | Donald Trump suggests firing at migrant caravan if people throw stones""We think that it is better to continue together with the caravan. We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,"" Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras who is traveling with his wife Jessica Fugon, said in Isla. ""Others went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.""Caravan organizers have pleaded for buses in recent days after three weeks on the road, hitching rides and walking. With the group scattered, some have raised questions about whether the caravan would stick together.In a statement, the migrants lambasted Mexican officials for directing them northward through the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz, calling it the ""route of death."" A trek via the sugar fields and fruit groves of Veracruz takes them through a state where hundreds of migrants have disappeared in recent years, falling prey to kidnappers looking for ransom payments.Authorities in Veracruz said in September they had discovered remains from at least 174 people buried in clandestine graves. Some security experts have questioned whether those bodies belonged to migrants.Gerardo Perez, a 20-year-old migrant, said he was tired. ""They're playing with our dignity. If you could have only seen the people's happiness last night when they told us that we were going by bus and today we're not,"" he said.The caravan's ""strength in numbers"" strategy has enabled them to mobilize support as they move through Mexico and has inspired subsequent migrants to try their luck via caravan.Mexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz, with a total of more than 6,000 migrants.ALSO READ | Donald Trump says he's 'bringing out the military' at Mexico borderOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.Another caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Chiapas. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.The first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct.Mexican officials appear conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journeys.Immigration agents and police have at times detained migrants in the smaller caravans. But several mayors have rolled out the welcome mat for migrants who reached their towns - arranging for food and camp sites.Mexico's Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have returned home.With or without the government's help, uncertainty awaits.President Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.He plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum."

Due to security reasons, paper cups and pet bottles were allowed in the lower decks of the stadium. In the gallery, steel tumblers were used for distributing coffee and tea, while in the VIP pavilions, mud cups were used.Digital ticketsA majority of the crowd had avoided print-outs of tickets, and instead used digital tickets, following a call given by the Corporation and the Kerala Cricket Academy. The local body has kept 255 colour-coded bins for various kinds of waste in different parts of the stadium.Fifty green army volunteers were on duty to spread awareness on the waste management initiatives. After the match, a few spectators too joined the green army volunteers and the sanitation workers in clearing up the waste.Roadside vendors removed the waste from either side of the road from Karyavattom junction to Kazhakuttam junction. From the Corporations health wing, nine health inspectors and 31 junior health inspectors oversaw the clean-up activities, in which 630 sanitation workers participated."

Hoffmann story is Lasse Hallstrom and Joe Johnstons The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, a hokey oddity that glissades along with a few charms and a pleasant score by James Newton Howard heavily incorporating themes from Tchaikovskys ballet (though theres little dancing).Children who are 10 and under may be enchanted by the abundantly whimsical holiday-themed visuals; accompanying adults might chuckle at the movies leaden attempt at a girl-empowering message. Anyone squeamish about rodents  even ones that have been rendered sort of cute by CGI  might consider steering clear.On Christmas Eve in Victorian-era London, Clara (Mackenzie Foy), a budding inventor, receives a special, egg-shaped box left for her by her recently deceased mother. With it is a note that reads in part: Everything you need is inside. But lo! The key to unlock the egg is nowhere to be found, and thus her journey to discover what lies inside it (and, of course, herself) unfolds.At his annual holiday celebration, Claras artisan godfather Drosselmeyer (Morgan Freeman, with an eyepatch) leads her, Alice in Wonderland-like, to a new fantastical world  except instead of chasing a white rabbit, Clara chases a grey mouse that possesses the key she seeks. Once there, she meets the unfailingly loyal nutcracker Captain Phillip (Jayden Fowora-Knight) and the regents of three realms: Snow (Richard E. Grant), Flowers (Eugenio Derbez) and Sweets (Keira Knightley, as the Sugar Plum Fairy). Clara also encounters the eerie, circus-y fourth realm and its leader, Mother Ginger (a typically game Helen Mirren); also, many more mice.Knightley has quite a bit of fun with her role as the sprightly Sugar Plum, adopting a high-pitched, whack-a-doodle characterisation that is Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time meets Helena Bonham Carter in everything. Foy is fine as Clara  a clever girl as the movie likes to remind us  though Ashleigh Powells script gives the actress some of the films corniest moments.The ballet dancer Misty Copeland, who makes a brief appearance during the film and in the closing credits, is the highlight, gracefully unhindered by silly dialogue in two dance sequences. But ultimately, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is a family holiday movie that will do well enough for now; it probably wont linger in your memory long enough to make it until the next inevitable adaptation comes around."

The Commission had also recommended supply of unpolished rice (brown rice) as diabetes was rampant in rural areas of Krishna, Prakasam and West Godavari districts.

A closer examination revealed that the sugar they had bought from the neighbourhood grocer to prepare the sweets was in fact teeming with plastic grains. On Tuesday, prof Ashok R Patil, a neighbour of the aggrieved family, complained to the food safety commissioner and health commissioner about the suspected plastic grains found in the sugar.The head of the family, SV Karki, had bought 5kg of sugar from Krishna Provision Store on Sunday. My wife made besan ladoos and some other sweets for my daughter who was set to leave for the US. We used up all the sugar. While tasting the ladoos, we realised it was impossible to bite into them. When we dissolved them in water, we could see transparent crystals settling down. I complained to the shopkeeper, said Karki.Prof Patil, chair professor of consumer law and practice, National Law School of India University, learnt about the matter and lodged the complaint  TOI has a copy  alleging that the sugar was adulterated with plastic grains.We informed the food safety officer to take action against the manufacturers and sellers involved. We have kept a sample of the sweet for lab test. The matter needs to be investigated further, said Patil. With the family having used all the sugar purchased from the store, theres no way to verify the extent of adulteration Maneesh Singh, proprietor of Krishna Provision Store, said he did not receive a complaint from any other customer. I buy a gunny bag of 50kg of sugar from the wholesale market, he said.However, Patil claimed the shopkeeper had admitted to some problem in the sugar when Karki questioned him.Dr Harshavardhan B, joint commissioner, Food Safety & Standard Authority of India (FSSAI), Karnataka, said he has received a complaint and his officers would inspect the store.If it is settling at the bottom of the vessel, it might not be plastic grains. They would float. We have received over 90 samples of rice and sugar in the past one month and in none of the cases was the presence of plastic grains proven. Testing samples for the presence of plastic grains costs Rs 6,000. The complainant has sent us an email. We will collect the sample and test it further, he said, adding that it could be a case of adulteration."

This is because elections are fought bitterly irrespective of their importance in this hotbed of Vokkaliga politics, which has a reputation of defeating even stalwarts like S.M. Krishna, G. Made Gowda, and M.H. Ambareesh.But despite this, there are hardly any visible signs of electioneering now in Mandya, which is going to bypolls on November 3. In fact, there are a large number of villages that are yet to be visited by prominent candidates in the poll fray. Most of the voters are not even bothered about the polls, though it is comparatively a season of leisure for this agrarian district.This indifference could, perhaps, be attributed to the fact that the new MP would get just about a four-to-five months tenure before the 2019 general elections to the Lok Sabha. The short tenure appears to be the reason for the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress combine and the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party not bothering to field political heavyweights.While the controversial, party-hopping former MLA L.R. Shivarame Gowda has been fielded by the JD(S) with support from Congress, former bureaucrat Siddaramaiah is testing political waters on BJP ticket. The party is yet to win any Assembly or Lok Sabha election in the district.However, what has provided an interesting dimension to the otherwise drab elections is the effort by the saffron party to gain political foothold in this JD(S) and Congress bastion by using the undercurrent of dissidence within the district unit of Congress. Though the JD(S) and Congress have joined hands to form coalition government in the State, the district is still witnessing political animosity between the leaders of both the parties who are keen to safeguard their own political turf. The situation aggravated after two rebel JD(S) MLAs from the district were chosen by the Congress to contest the Assembly elections held in May this year. However, JD(S) settled political scores in an emphatic manner by making a clean sweep in all seven Assembly segments of the district.The district Congress unit, including former JD(S) rebels, have been directed by the Congress top leadership to support Mr. Shivarame Gowdas candidature.The BJP, which never had any foothold in the district, is trying to gain advantage of this uneasy political situation. Whether we will be able to win or not is a different thing. But definitely, this has come as a good opportunity for us to expand our party organisation here, a senior BJP leader said.On its part, the JD(S) is not unduly perturbed and is banking on the political clout of its top leaders  former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy. Its finally the clout of these two leaders that works here and the image of the candidate is immaterial, claimed a senior JD(S) leader, who was confident of the partys victory.Surprisingly, none of the issues that are impacting the district such as farm crisis marked by substantial number of farmers suicides, problems of sugarcane farmers complicated by non-operation of Pandavapura co-operative sugar factory, and sufferings of tail-end farmers owing to shortage of water have made it to the poll agenda.The bypoll was necessitated for Mandya Lok Sabha seat after JD(S) leader Puttaraju was elected to the Assembly."

In return, said Sharma, they have asked for concessions similar to those we would be giving to any other company setting up units in similar fields. The government has further rationalised VAT for supply of piped gas to urea manufacturing units. It will be at a flat rate of 10% from now on. To promote its One District-One Product scheme, the government will be opening common facility centres across districts, depending on what a particular centre requires.An official said that up to Rs 15 crore would be allocated for each centre, based on the requirement. Of that, 90% of the funds would be given by the government while the remaining 10% would come through local craftspersons etc, who would have to band together a society.

5ce75f61e8e3fc56af418f5f,How liberal was the liberal order?,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/how-liberal-was-the-liberal-order/cid/1673172,2018-10-31,"Nostalgia over the passing of the Liberal Order fits in well with familiar memorials to the halcyon past when servants knew their place and servitors of empire doffed their hats reflexively to their superiors. But sceptics will surely pose the question, how liberal was the Liberal Order? The Anglo-American Establishment was the beating heart of the Liberal Order, its workings executed with due diligence by the good and the great in Washington and London.President Donald Trump is vulgarly capricious as were the emperors Nero and Caligula, when imperial Rome was careering to its fall. Washingtons ties with Moscow and, possibly, Beijing are in free fall. Hungarys Viktor Orbn and the Polish regime have become the remains of the European day. However, the serious historian and political theorist ought to be a trifle more discriminating in bundling names and countries. China is a one-party dictatorship with press and internet censorship. Russia and Hungary are multi-party states that hold regular elections, whatever their outcomes. Double standards have long been the bane of the acclaimed Liberal Order. The venal dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, the repressive Shah regime in Iran, the brutal despotism of Saudi Arabia, the death squads in Guatemala and so on are part of its shaming record of complicity.Regime change became the panacea of American foreign policy, ending up opening a can of worms. The Greater Middle East today is a mass graveyard of folly and wickedness. Saddam Husseins non-existent weapons of mass destruction, the local torture chambers of the occupying American forces, the biblical exodus to Europe in search of security  each is an element of a terrifying dystopia.Trumps performance at the UN general assembly raised titters of scorn from delegates who perceived his bombast as the vapourings of a CEO of a crime syndicate, his prescription for national salvation a further increase of military spending to an astronomical $750 billion. The Republican-Democrat music hall revolves around imagined enemies, under the bed or in distant shores. Witch hunts have been integral to the American narrative. Black slavery, the dispossession of Indian lands and the extermination of the population are minor themes of the American Dream and its Manifest Destiny, the touted pursuit of happiness of the countrys sacristan Constitution, now cabined, cribbed and confined to a plutocratic elite.Americas gilded age had a putrid underbelly, as General Smedley D. Butler, the most decorated commander of his generation, revealed in an article published in 1935: I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street... I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903 Looking back on it, I feel I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. We Marines operated in three continents.The Ku Klux Klan, Senator Joseph McCarthy, the atom bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the pornographic violence from land, sea and air inflicted upon the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were undertaken by Washingtons liberal consensus. They were not simply aberrant episodes but among the worst as crimes against humanity in recorded history. Vice-admiral William D. Leahy, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, wrote at the time: It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance to our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender in being the first to use it we had adopted the ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages.The dark side of the famed Camelot administration of President John F. Kennedy was clinically exposed as a modern-day Borgia dispensation by Seymour Hersh, investigator extraordinaire, of whom all Americans and the civilized comity of nations should feel proud.The lessons of history have often been ignored, frequently with tragic consequences. It was the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan that initiated the Cold War and not Harry Trumans resolve or Winston Churchills Fulton speech. News of the successful atomic test in America arrived at the Potsdam Conference of the Big Three in 1945. The visible truculence of Truman towards Russia followed. Lord Alanbrooke, chief of the imperial general staff, recalled Churchills first reaction: that the weapon could now be used on Soviet cities. Next came instructions to Britains military to draw up a plan for a possible invasion of the Soviet Union; the document produced was named Operation Unthinkable. Liberal Order has long been a chastening global experience."

The Congress recollected TRS poll promise of taking over the factory within 100 days of its coming to power, while the ruling party maintained that it was the Congress which was also behind its privatisation.Trading allegationsCongress said that the TRS regime failed to keep its promise despite repeated representations with an eye on taking over its valuable assets. TRS refuted the accusation saying that the Congress is aligning with the party (TDP) which sold away the factory at a throwaway price to private persons.Established in 1937 by the last ruler of Hyderabad State Mir Osman Ali Khan, the NSF was one of the biggest sugar factories in Asia in those days. Bodhan towns progress is associated with the factory as it has over 16,000 acres of its own land and a separate railway metre gauge line for transportation of sugar cane and sugar.The metre gauge line subsequently was made as broad gauge line for transporting both goods and passengers. A super speciality hospital and school, junior and degree colleges had also come up thanks to the company. Thousands of families depended on it directly or indirectly. The Shakkarnagar area, where the factory is located, and the town and district were economically vibrant when the factory was running.Hoping for takeoverWhen this correspondent interacted with the middle-aged women of the farming community in Mandarna, Salura, Salura camp, Hunsa and Khajapur where sugar cane is grown in large tracts, they said they would be happy if the factory is taken over by the government.We dont need pension of Rs. 1,000 or Rs. 2,000. We will be more happy if the NSF is opened, said one Gangavva, who owns two-acre land in Hunsa lying on the border of Maharashtra.DisillusionmentAs the factory remains closed for three years now they are transporting cane to the companies in the border State or to Gayatri Sugars Limited near Kamareddy. Farmers, who reduced the cane cultivation ever since the factory was in the red, are ready to undertake cultivation of sugar cane in larger area provided the government reopens it and ensures remunerative price.However, farmers after a long wait to see the past glory of the factory seem to be disillusioned over the promises of the political parties. The TRS former MLA Mohammed Shakeel Amer is pitted against former Minister P. Sudarshan Reddy here."

Medical experts are worried over a rise in the number of youths who are suffering brain stroke as it leaves the families of the victims in the lurch.Doctors say that brain stroke has become the second largest killer disease in the country and it has outnumbered the deaths of people suffering from other diseases. Although, it is completely curable if the patient is brought to the hospital within 4 hours. But it is always disheartening to see young people in the hospital, said Major General (rtd) Dr Kumara Velu, noted neurologist with Dr Ramesh Hospitals in the city.He added that the patients must be rushed to nearby brain stroke centres for their survival. People can avoid the risk of brain stroke by consuming good diet, going for physical exercise and stay away from smoking.It is a myth that stroke only happens to elderly people. But we are finding that the number of youths with the disease on the rise, said another neurologist Dr Sai Sandeep Budha.He added that they have recently treated a 22-year-old youth who suffered stroke, the second common cause of death across the state. Medical experts feel that strokes are completely preventable if one could properly manage the risk factors like high blood pressure, control blood sugar .

The minister had assured us that he would ensure that the formula is abided by all.The millers have only paid the FRP till now and have not taken any stand regarding the remaining Rs 200 per tonne. We will meet the minister at his residence and question him about the remaining amount, he said.Reiterating his demand for Rs 3,500 per tonne for sugar cane crop for this season, he said, Earlier, the recovery base of sugar cane was 8.5%. The government has steadily extended it to 10% till now. Our demand is that government should declare base recovery rate of 8.5% and Rs 3,500 per tonne for the same. The farmers will ultimately get Rs 4,500 and above per tonne for recovery of 12%.Raghunath Patil said that they would meet the minister and convey their satisfaction over the BJP government decisions for the farming community. We will also request him to stick to the decisions related to market committee federation, which are beneficial for the farmers, he said."

Perhaps, he was contemplating the next item on his agenda.Asked how the campaign was going and whether the BJP stands a chance of recording an upset, Yeddyurappa said: We are certain to win Shivamogga and Ballari, but we will give a tough fight in Mandya.For over six decades, politics in the rice and sugar bowl of the state has been a sort of turf war between the Congress and JD(S). Voters loyalties have swung only between these two parties. However, for the first time, the pre-poll alliance between the archrivals has opened the door for the BJP to make inroads in the Vokkaliga heartland.State intelligence reports suggest the BJP is set to gain a foothold in Mandya even if its candidate is defeated. Reports say the swing may be comparable to the 1994 elections when the Ayodhya and Ram Janma Bhoomi issues swung a lot of votes for the saffron outfit.However, Yeddyurappas statement that the BJP stands more than a chance is far removed from facts on the ground, with every village and town in the constituency reaffirming its loyalty to the JD(S) and the tallest Vokkaliga leader in the state, H D Deve Gowda. However, some are considering the BJP as an alternative, thanks to the void left by the Congress.In Thatahalli, 82-year-old Chinne Gowda, puffing on a beedi outside his home, reflected on loyalty to the JD(S). It does not matter who the candidate is, we are going to vote for Dala (colloquial name for JDS), he said. Previously, we had voted for Congress when the JD(S) failed to deliver on its promises. However, considering the stature of Deve Gowda and his ability to deliver on promises, we have always come back.However, in Koppa, some 15km away, staunch Congress workers say the decision of the partys high command to surrender the seat to the JD(S), has undermined their efforts in the constituency. They say their younger colleagues could shift to the saffron party.With local leaders not spelling out clearly whether to work for the JD(S), a lot of Congress sympathisers have openly declared they will vote for the BJP, said a senior Mandya Congress worker. Local Congress leaders fear their party could be wiped out in Mandya. They say it is possible their substantial vote base could be handed on a platter to the JD(S).With the JD(S) sweeping Mandya district in the assembly polls earlier this year  the party won all eight segments by margins ranging between 30,000 and 50,000 Congress leaders are peeved with the alliance that has been forced on them by its high command.Congress losing candidates and former JD(S) MLAs Ramesh Babu Bandisiddegowda and N Cheluvarayaswamy are not campaigning as no invitation was extended to them. Their supporters have only been holding indoor meetings.Making it even easier for the BJP to expand its voter base is the choice of L R Shivarame Gowda as the alliance candidate. The alliances choice of candidate is not good and it will help us, said Yeddyurappa, reflecting on the popular thought in Mandya that Shivarame Gowdas name had figured in the alleged murder of a journalist. The wave of discontent has been so strong that chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has been forced to defend Shivarame Gowda at every election rally.Every media house carried a report on the 22-yearold case and of Shivarame Gowda being a murder accused, said Kumaraswamy at a rally in Maddur. However, he has been acquitted by the judiciary. If the disgruntlement is simply because he was jailed, then let us remind the people that even Yeddyurappa and other BJP leaders have also gone to jail.The murdered journalist was from the Kuruba community which has more than two lakh voters in the constituency. The BJP is expecting to swing these voters to their fold."

Following a brief hearing during which the counsel appearing for the GMIDC gave the undertaking, the court posted the matter for next hearing on October 31.Nashik district collector Radhakrishnan B said, In an email communication, the lawyers appearing for the GMIDC have conveyed to the irrigation corporation about the undertaking given by them to the SC. As such no water will be released for now.According to the communication, the apex court questioned the GMIDC counsel regarding the stay on release of water to which the counsel said no water would be released till further orders. The GMIDC, which is based in Aurangabad, has since communicated the same to the Nashik district collector. The plan for release of water  as decided by the district administration in the morning  have thus been postponed till further orders by the Supreme Court.Earlier, the GMIDC had ordered release of 590 million cubic feet (mcft) water from Palkhed dam to Nandurmadhmeshwar through Kadwa river, 590mcft from Gangapur dam and 2,020mcft from Darna dam  through the Godavari river  as per the clauses of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) for water sharing between Nashik, Ahmednagar and Aurangabad.While the Maharashtra water resources department (WRD) had announced its plans to release water from the dams from October 26 to October 31, the programme got delayed given the law and order situation in the upstream areas following agitations against releasing of water.Political parties, including Shiv Sena, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena , Congress, Nationalist Congress Party , Communist Party of India (M) and others, violently protested against the release of water. On the other hand, the villagers downstream of Nashik tried to block the water that would be released from the dams by use of needles in Kolhapur-Type weirs. While the WRD removed the needles, the villagers again put it back and that would slow down the pace of water flow towards Jayakwadi.Police, meanwhile, conducted recces of the dams and had sought Riot Control Police, Quick Response Teams as well as the State Reserve Police Force teams to be stationed at Palkhed, Gangapur and Darna dams and at the major villages downstream to deter the public from taking law into their hand and trying to obstruct flow of water."

Data released in August last year had also revealed that sugar and distillery was the most polluting sector in the state.The Maharashtras star-rating programme, which is jointly run by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC-India) and few other institutes, has released the latest data of stack emissions for 140 industries across the state.To provide information on environmental performance of the industries to public, the programme gives star ratings to industries based on the median concentration of latest stack (chimney) samples for particulate matter.Among the 140, 26 industries got one-star rating which indicates that the particulate matter emitted by these units is 250 milligrams per normal metric cube (mg/NM3) or more, which is nearly twice the permissible standards. As per the standards laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the permissible limit for PM stack emissions is 150 mg/NM3.Apart from this, about 37 industries have got two-star rating, indicating that their emissions are between 150-250 mg/NM3.Data shows that majority of the one-star industries belong to the sugar and distilleries sector. Most sugar industries are known to use low quality solid fuel. The anti-pollution devices installed by them are also badly maintained, said Ishan Choudhary, the communications and outreach coordinator at EPIC-India.Apart from it, sectors including chemicals, textiles and pharmaceuticals have highly polluting units. This is a worrying factor and that is why we are counting on the public to be more interactive on the star-rating platform. If this happens, both the regulator and the industry will have to show more accountability, added Choudhary.Eighty-two new industries of the state have been added under the programme. Overall, emissions of more than 300 industries are being currently monitored. Industrial units of two recently added sectors  food processing, and glass and ceramics  have also been included.The programme monitors industrial air pollution in 10 clusters of the state: Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Thane, Nashik, Chandrapur, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and pockets of Gadchiroli.Apart from industries, the programme has also made the ambient air quality data of over 25 cities accessible to the public. As per the latest information, the level of Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter (RSPM) was highest at Bandra, Ulhasnagar and Thane."

But just utter the word Lassi, you would soon be directed to Kamudhi Milk Stall, a 12-year-old dairy shop run by K Senthoor PandianUnlike what its name suggests, the petty shop deals in lassi , paneer and curd from 6 am to 4 pm every day. But what it earned a name for is the mouth-watering special lassi. The tale of this unique taste actually began when Pandian drank a delicious drink made of milk while working in Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram districtIt gave me the idea of setting up a dairy shop. The milk in Madurai is tasty as it is from native breeds . After I moved to Madurai, I often bought milk from Kamudhi and made curd and lassi out of it. That tasted very nice, he says.The milk from Kamudhi was what made him name the shop. However, his milk now is procured from native cows in Palamedu in Madurai for better taste. If one enters EB Colony Road, chances are that he or she would miss the shop because the sign is weather-worn and is overshadowed by much larger shops nearby. Its tiny presence notwithstanding, many from of Madurai would vouch for the best taste the lassi has.So what makes this lassi so special? I collect the malai from the milk and add a little of it as topping on every glass of lassi. When the malai is eaten with the sugar sprinkled over it, the lassi tastes better, he says. Each glass of lassi is made using a wooden churn which he has motorised. A tasty glass of lassi is ready when he adds a little rose water for flavouring and the malai with sugar topping.Apart from lassi, Pandian sells curds, buttermilk, and paneer in his store all which are made by him. The lassi is to die for in this shop. I also ensure that the curds my kids eat are bought here as you can feel the difference in taste, says K Thirupathi, a regular customer."

It inevitably draws flak from the opposition. On Friday, Kumaraswamy made an emotional speech at a rally in Malavalli in Mandya district and instantly drew criticism from BJP state president and former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa, who was also criss-crossing the district.The two traded barbs as they campaigned all day in Mandya and Ramanagara I might not live for very long, Kumaraswamy said. I was lucky to have survived in Israel when I went there on a study tour last year. But as long as I am alive, I will do everything possible to serve you all, Kumaraswamy said. The CM went on to say: I will not reveal what really transpired in Israel.Party sources say Kumaraswamy suffered a heart attack  his second  during the visit to Israel ahead of the assembly elections in Karnataka . He returned home after undergoing treatment. Only his close aides and family were privy to the news.At Malavalli on Friday, Kumaraswamy said he did not become chief minister to make money.I dont know for how many days I will live, but with the reins of power in hand, I will strive to give life to as many poor people as possible in the state, he said.Responding to this, Yeddyurappa, at a rally in Maddur said, Kumaraswamy should stop making emotional speeches about his health and should instead focus on developmental work and providing good governance.There is anarchy in the state as people are suffering. Developmental work has come to a standstill, Yeddyurappa said. Your emotional speeches wont affect the people as they are already in distress.Yeddyurappa also accused Kumaraswamy of doing sweet nothing to develop Mandya, although the district gave rebirth to his political career and made him CM.Though I was born in Mandya, I was not elected even once (from here), Yeddyurappa said. But still, as CM, I released crores of rupees for the development of Mandya including to revive two sugar factories which were on the verge of closure.Countering the former chief ministers accusations, Kumaraswamy said Mandyas farmers are the biggest beneficiaries of his mega loan waiver scheme.When I presented the budget soon after I formed the government, BJP leaders called it Mandya budget. But now suddenly they have developed sympathy for the people of Mandya, Kumaraswamy said.At another rally, Yeddyurappa urged former PM H D Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy to tender a public apology for insulting the Valmiki community by not receiving the Maharishi Valmiki award.With just a week to go for polling, campaigning in the Ramanagara assembly segment reached a feverish pitch.C P Yogeshwar, BJP leader and former minister, who campaigned for BJP candidate L Chandrashekar, on Friday targeted Anitha Kumaraswamy, alleging that she received bribes to facilitate transfers and postings of officials in Ramanagara.Anitha rejected Yogeshwars allegations outright.It is Yogeshwars culture.

Not that Vikramjit needed much convincing. He loved the Marine Drive (though he would have preferred a different name, one which did not invariably occasion the patronising Oh yes, the other Marine Drive nod-and-head-bob from Bombaywallahs).Sometimes they would chat  updates about ones birds or the others students were exchanged  but, mostly, Josh would roll down the window (something his mother never allowed since the breeze interfered with her hair), stick his head out, and let the wind slap noisily against his cheeks. His father, who had grown up with dogs, delighted in his sons canine behaviour, folded up the sleeves of his Brooks Brothers shirts, and sang along to the radio.

If we go after, we could bring Pixie with us to Brubeck. And order the cake then. It all depends on how hungry you are now.Not hungry. Miss gave us lots of cookies, Josh replied. His drawing teacher was a flaky young Parsi artist who lived in one of those beautiful rambling colonial buildings and seemed to survive only on cookies and milk, which she set out before her students as she randomly showed them great works of art projected on the living room wall. The kids adored Miss Daruwalla.Dont mention the cookies to Ma though. She might give Miss...A lecture. I know.

Vik, who had his own chrome blue box in his bag somewhere, quickly wolfed down the cold quinoa cutlet with its side of home-made tomato relish. He could not stand quinoa and the coldness settled like an icy chrome-blue feeling in his stomach, with angry red lashings curling around it, like memories of the tomato relish. Lets go over to their guest house then and see how Pixie is settling in?Josh handed his father his water bottle, also chrome blue.Is Pixie going to be invited to my birthday? Josh sounded neutral enough.I am sure, Vik replied, allowing the water to unglue himself from that feeling, handing the bottle back to his son and starting the car. In fact, Tilo has probably already invited them. Why?She will go on and on about London. And my friends will find her lame.Now now, Vik said, accelerating the car.And then we went St James Park, and then we had tea with the Queen, Josh mimicked Pixies accent, in an accurate if cruel fashion. Maybe shell expect an Enid Blyton kind of high tea? With meringues and potted meat and ham and sardines and jam tarts.Vik narrowed his eyes and looked at his son.Josh Sen, is that what you want?Whaatt? Josh said innocently.***Several well-appointed flats, airy and central, had been turned by the company into a group of serviced apartments, which offered greater privacy to long-term residents than the old-fashioned guesthouses. A centralised hospitality desk offered luxuries such as room service and turn down (which, since shed had to pick up after everyone in London, felt like an unbelievable luxury to Nisha) and the kitchen provided food which, while not exciting, was adequate.One such apartment, off Kadma, was currently occupied by the Das Biswas-es, and its living room, with white walls, regulation sofas and severe landscapes, was currently caught in a terrific squall. Nisha was firm. The polka-dotted puppy who had been found under the mango tree must be returned to that spot. She had a toddler; she was not going to get another creature to look after; she was already at the verge of a nervous breakdown.But I am going to look after him myself, Mama, I promise, I promise, Pixie wailed. And Lisa Didi can help me. Lisa was the nanny. She lurked in the doorway and followed the war. She had fed some milk to the puppy and was on his side.Lisa Didi has her hands full. So do I. We will go back and return the puppy. I cant believe you smuggled him in when we expressly told you not to!Nishas face was thunderous. Bappa hovered around the flat  unable to take a stand  and had now decided to escape inside and call up admin to find out about the serviced apartments policy on pets.Pixie, equally firm, announced that if the puppy was going back to the mango tree, so was she. Lisa Didi, pack my bag, Pixie called out.Nisha couldnt decide what she should be madder about. The damn dog. Or her daughter ordering about Lisa so blithely.Pixie, Nisha began ominously when there were footsteps outside and the bell rang.Bappa reappeared, phone glued to his ears, and breathed a sigh of relief after he opened the door.Vikramjitda, welcome, welcome. We have a bit of a situation here. In fact, you can help! Come in please. Hello, Josh.The puppy, meanwhile, had hopped off Pixies lap and wandered towards the door.Woofwoof, he said to Josh.Woofwoof, replied Josh in return.Pixie snatched him up.I didnt know you had a dog, Josh said, as he came and sat next to her.She doesnt, Nisha said coldly. That dogs going.She forced herself to smile at Vik. Tea? Coffee? No Tilo?Having gauged the situation, Vik decided that it was better he sat. The puppy cast its soulful eyes on him. I wouldnt mind some tea, he said, But only if its no trouble. Tilo is working late today. We were going to Brubeck and thought wed take Pixie along if thats okay.Tea is no trouble, Nisha replied and made her way to the kitchen.Whats his name? Josh whispered, conspiratorially.Scone, Pixie whispered back.What? Josh narrowed his eyes exactly like his father.S-C-O-N-E, spelt out Pixie, now no longer whispering, Its pronounced scon, like don, not scone like cone.Josh digested this.Meanwhile, Scone Das Biswas had laid his little puppy head on Joshs knee. Despite his dislike for Pixie gathering up again, into a pulsating ball of annoyance, Josh couldnt help but fall a little in love with the polka-dotted creature, who wasnt a patch on his birds of course, but was, nonetheless, a delightful thing to love. He stroked his velvety ears gently. And that Pixie did not say anything to that. Instead, she looked beseechingly at her father and his friend. Soon, fat tears rolled down her cheeks one by one.***It was around 11.30 that Nisha returned to their bedroom. She was freshly showered. Though shed dried her hair, a few curls were still damp and clung to her cheeks. Postos asleep, she said and sat at the dressing table, applying cream on her cheeks.Nisha smiled at Bappa in the mirror and a load lifted off his chest.So is your daughter and that Scone. He is ensconced  or should we say en-scone-d now?  in her bed. Lisa is sitting there looking at him adoringly. I hope she still pays attention to Posto!Nisha got under the duvet and folded her body against her husbands.So your friend Vikramjit is quite the convincer. Should have gone into law!He was a famous debater baba, Bappa replied, taking her hand in his, leaning in to her. Long day, today, he said.Nishas hair smelt all coconut-y and familiar. Bappa felt himself descend into the sort of semi-comfortable space that might just develop an edge and lead to some (long, overdue) action.How much do you think professors earn at that B-school? Nisha asked him.Sorry, what? Bappa said, a little surprised at this new turn.Vikramjit and Tilottama  how much do you think they earn?Hmm, said Bappa, considering the matter.To be continued"

Ive known Santanu for some years now, as a neighbour who is also my physician, and as a keen participant in our paras various activities, especially during the festive season. A few months ago, after he had completed my check-up, we got to chatting about healthcare issues and he told me how surprised he had been to discover the high prevalence of so-called diseases of affluence, associated with sedentary urban lifestyles, among the labouring poor in rural Bengal. When I asked, somewhat sceptically, where he got this information from, he invited me to visit the health centre that he runs in his ancestral village and take a look for myself. So, on the first Sunday of this October, I did.We reached Manihara village, just beyond the Bankura-Purulia border, a little before noon, and went straight to the Manindra Seva Sadan, named after one of Santanus ancestors. The spacious three-room centre is located on a largish plot of land, with a beautiful garden and immaculate lawns  Santanu tells me that it belongs jointly to several members of his extended family, but had been lying unused until he decided to set up the centre. He took a loan from his mother, cleared and cleaned the land, and constructed the neat, single-storey structure that stands there now.Outside the building, under a large permanent awning, villagers wait, patiently, for the daktarbabu to come. On arrival, Santanus team swings into smooth, practiced action. Of the three rooms, the first  which runs the length of the building  is where patients have their names, blood pressure and pulse rates noted, and are given a number (depending on their place in the queue) on a slip of paper; as they pass through the long room, they can get a battery of tests done, if needed, on a device that Santanu calls his lab in a box. Once all this is completed, they line up to enter the doctors chamber in the next room, where one of Santanus assistants notes down their details on a laptop. After Santanu examines them and writes out his prescriptions, they move to the adjoining room, where medicines are distributed. On the day of my visit, Santanus wife, Kokila, a doctor with an MD in microbiology, was assisting Santanus father, a retired engineer, in the medicine room. Patients leave only after collecting a months worth of medicines. Some will come back to the centre in a weeks time, and report their condition to Santanu via video-conferencing  he is available online between 9:00 and 11:00 am every Sunday  and some of them will return on the first Sunday of the following month. The cost for all this is the ten rupees patients pay when they register; there are no other charges.The day I was there, over 200 people had registered to be examined. There was a low buzz around the centre, interspersed with the occasional shout, as a patients name was called out, or someone asked someone else not to shove others in the queue. The noise level went up several-fold as patients jostled in line, assistants shouted to patients to register their names, have their pressure noted, and so on and so forth. In the midst of all this, Santanu sat like the calm eye in the centre of a mild storm, radiating cheerful good humour as he spoke to patients in his soft, measured tones and wrote down their prescriptions. Santanu has a mild, friendly manner, and is unfailingly polite even to the most vociferous of his patients. When his assistants raise their voices, mostly in order to ask patients to maintain quiet (Have you come to a doctor, or to a fish market?), he remains composed. He also has a sly sense of humour and a ready smile that puts even the most grim-faced individual instantly at ease. He tells a patient, with a broad grin, that he will kill himself if she can prove she actually did take the medicines hed prescribed last month. After much hemming and hawing, she admits that she might have missed a couple of doses.Of course, many of his patients have seen him before, and he seems (at least to my untutored self) to recall every detail of their various ailments. Interspersed with talk of symptoms, diagnostic tests, medicines and so on, he exchanges pleasantries with his patients  telling someone shes fine, reassuring another that he neednt worry, the usual doctors prattle: but, sometimes, he turns to me and says, half in jest and half in despair, Tell me, how on earth do these people get these diseases, here, of all places? He seems to be especially puzzled by the high incidence of diabetes among his patients, including in some who are in their early thirties, as well as other diseases of the leisured, particularly hypertension. Look at her. Not an extra ounce on her and yet she has a blood sugar reading of 210! How do you explain this? There is speculation in the medical community that undernutrition in infancy could be a likely cause even though official statistics do not seem to bear this out. This is something that needs to be investigated thoroughly because the health of thousands is at stake. Over 33 per cent of his patients have diabetes and 40 per cent suffer from high blood pressure. He has the details of all the patients he has treated since he set up the clinic three years ago but wants to know more about the prevalence of illness in the area. I would like to make a database of every individual and their ailments in the 30-odd adjoining villages. Once I know this, we can do more to alleviate or, best of all, prevent them. He would also like to bring every woman, child, and man in the area under a health insurance scheme.When I leave the centre, it is past 4:00 pm, but Santanu is still inside, talking, smiling, examining, prescribing. He will stay back tonight, along with his wife and two kids, for tomorrow they will distribute saris among the women of Manihara for the festive season. His parents will help him, as will his paternal uncle and aunt, who still live in the village.As I speed towards the bright lights and loud noise of the city, I glance back at the endless expanse of undulating green, dotted with clumps of kaash flowers, harbingers of the season of festive joy, and I wonder: what makes a man like Santanu Banerjee do this month after month, year after year, almost single-handedly, with scarce resources and at considerable cost to himself in terms of time, effort and energy? By my reckoning, it costs Santanu some thirty to forty thousand rupees every time he visits the health centre, but when I put this to him later he only smiles at me. Does he receive any money from funding agencies? No. Do many other doctors go with him to the centre? Again that smile. Yes, he agrees, he couldnt have done it without strong family support. But why does he do this, I persist. He looks up, quizzically, Shouldnt you be asking me why others dont do it as well? I have no answer. Santanu says he cant really explain why he started doing this work and refuses to accept the usual explanations about giving back to society, extending a helping hand to people, and so on. Instead, he tells me a story. One night, as I was peeling open sealed boxes of medicines and arranging the strips into smaller bundles, my fingers started to bleed. And instead of feeling upset or angry, I felt this joy radiating through me. That was my epiphany. Thats when I knew this was the right thing to do."

With just Rs. 200 crore the factory could be reopened, he said adding that the famous factory was neglected by the TRS government.Farmers are ready to plant sugarcane in the vast tracts of land provided they are assured the reopening of the NSF.

Hence, the report on samples collected before Durga Puja in this city hasnt yet reached Dhalbhum SDO, the officer designated for implementation of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.SDO Chandan Kumar said a team had inspected some mithai shops in Sakchi and Mango areas of the steel city, where there are a total 200, on October 11 and 12. Samples of butter, paneer, khoa and curd, among others, were collected but, he conceded, that the report was pending.A team will soon visit sweet shops to check adulteration in the run-up to Diwali, SDO Kumar promised.According to National Referral Centre for Lead Poisoning Prevention in India, cheap artificial colours used in sweets are a major health hazard.Metanil yellow, a lead-based dye, is used to give besan, laddoo or biryani their inviting colour instead of permitted tartrazine, which is more expensive. Such non-permitted colours are harmful for the central nervous system if consumed regularly. Sudan III, another non-permitted dye used in gulab jamun, causes skin irritations. Muriatic acid in paneer and formalin in milk to increase its viscosity are again toxic for the central nervous system.STAY SAFE THIS FESTIVE SEASONSimples tests at home that can be done to beat adulterationKhoya/Paneer: Boil a small sample in water, cool it and add a few drops of iodine solution. A blue colour indicates presence of harmful starchVark: The silver film on sweets is supposed to be 99.9 per cent pure. If it is adulterated with aluminium, it will roll into a ball when rubbed between fingers instead of just disintegrating. Also, adulterated silver foil will not spread out smoothly and tend to breakGhee: Add a pinch of sugar and some hydrochloric acid. If the ghee turns crimson, it is adulteratedChocolates: Simply add water. If the chocolate becomes grainy and breaks, it is substandardBox of chocolates Telegraph pictureMost mithai shops, in order to rake in maximum profits, often use these non-permitted dyes and chemicals, starch and aluminium-mixed vark (instead of edible pure silver foil) that can lead to severe gastrointestinal disorders.East Singhbhum food inspector Dr Gulab Lakra admitted that chemical analysis of samples take no less than a fortnight. The report of the earlier samples is pending because Durga Puja holidays shortened the number of lab working days. We expect the report in a week, he said.Dr Lakra fumbled for an answer when asked how it was prudent to call out shops on adulteration after the festival ended. I admit that ideally samples should be collected a month in advance so that the report can be made public before festivals. But then, there are challenges such as manpower crunch and protocol before raids, he said after a while.Dhanbad SDO Raj Maheshwaram said they had carried sampling at 10 restaurants and sweet shops before Durga Puja, but were yet to receive the results. We will carry out fresh sampling from tomorrow (Friday) and the same will continue till Diwali (on November 7).State health officials were found equally wanting when questioned on the delayed adulteration survey every year.We are going to ask all districts to carry out sampling of food before Diwali. We may deploy our mobile food testing lab in Ranchi to make up for the delay, said Chandra Kishore Oraon, additional secretary (health) and joint food safety commissioner, deflecting the real issue.Food lab analyst Chaturbhuj Meena in Namkum expressed helplessness. Fourteen days is the minimum time needed to test any sample. We have to follow norms set by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) and they are rigorous, he said.Additional reporting by Praduman Choubey"

The company, which already has brands like Sugar Free and Nutralite, the addition of Complan and Glucon-D, is expected to strengthen its equity in the consumer wellness segment. Further, its range of skincare products under Everyuth is also expected to be complimented with the inclusion of Nycil.Apart from the four brands, ZWL will also get two large manufacturing facilities in Aligarh and Sitarganj and teams devoted to operations, research, sales, marketing and support. Heinz India has a strong distribution network of over 800 distributors, more than 20,000 wholesalers covering 29 states.Among these brands, Heinz India recorded revenues of about Rs 1,150 crore for the 12 month period ended June 30.

The patient complained of fatigue which led doctors to call for a blood test. The tests revealed uncontrolled sugar and high levels of acid in the blood. The patient's red cells, white cells and platelets were also very low, prompting the doctors to test him for dengue.The result was positive on an NS1 antigen test and was re-confirmed with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the dengue virus."".. in an endemic area, dengue should always be kept as an important differential diagnosis in patients with leucopenia (low white cell count) and severe thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), even in the absence of fever, especially during periods of outbreak,"" the AIIMS doctors stated in the study, published in the latest issue of the Journal of The Association of Physicians of India.They added that dengue patients who do not show fever are likely to be old, diabetic or suffering from other immunity compromised states.According to Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant, internal medicine at Max Saket, diabetics, cancer patients and those who have undergone transplant may show with fever when infected with dengue due to impaired immunity.

Apart from protesting that the leaders never visited the villages in the last four-and-a-half years, the public have also targeted them for ignoring development that they promised prior to election.In the case of K. Vidyasagar Rao who is contesting from Korutla in Jagtial district, the problem was more serious as the villagers at Vempet in Metpally mandal confronted him for not implementing his promise to reopen within 100 days of TRS coming to power sick mill of Nizam Sugar Factory at Mutyampet.Mr. Rao was also said to have promised that the government will run the mill. This time round at Vempet, he again promised that the government would run the mill with farmers participation but the villagers would have nothing of it and entered into a scuffle with his supporters.The TRS leaders dismissed the protests saying it had become a habit with voters to treat the contesting candidates, particularly of ruling parties, as those seeking alms when they visited villages for votes. Such a tempo was built only during elections. Otherwise, the public never aired grievances with such intensity on normal occasions.Other TRS candidates who faced protests included Ms. Rekha Naik who is seeking election from Khanapur (ST) constituency in Mancherial district, K. Prabhakar Reddy and G. Sunitha in Munugode and Alair constituencies respectively of Yadadri district and Aswaraopet candidate Thati Venkateshwarlu in Bhadradri Kothagudem district. The canvassing by Gadari Kishore in Thungathurthy constituency was also stopped in this background on Monday. Surprisingly, a protest demonstration and a bike rally was held against Wyra candidate Banoth Madanlal in Khammam district by his own party men who were aggrieved against his candidature.A TRS leader led the protest against Ms. Rekha Naik at Badampalli village of Jannaram mandal."

The evil purple urchin.Five years ago, assigning wickedness to the purple urchin, a shellfish the size of a plum with quarter-inch spikes, would have been absurd.That was before the urchins mowed down Northern Californias kelp forests.The underwater forests  huge, sprawling tangles of brown seaweed  are in many ways just as important to the oceans as trees are to the land. Like trees, they absorb carbon emissions and they provide critical habitat and food for a wide range of species. But when climate change helped trigger a 60-fold explosion of purple urchins off Northern Californias coast, the urchins went on a feeding frenzy and the kelp was devoured.Warming oceanIt would be like one of those beautiful deciduous forests turned into a desert, said Gretchen Hoffman, a professor of marine ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. But in the matter of five years.The dangers extend far beyond this inlet: Kelp forests exist along the cooler coastlines of every continent but Antarctica. And they are under threat both from rising ocean temperatures and from what those warmer waters bring.Already, Maines forests of sugar kelp, a source of the sweetener mannitol, have experienced temperature-linked declines. And in Tasmania, kelp forests have succumbed to a purple urchin outbreak. Here in Albion, they are trying to avoid a similar fate.The divers went to work, scraping purple urchins off the bottom of the cove, hoping it would allow the kelp, which has declined 93 percent in Northern California, to grow back.Cynthia Catton, an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and a small team of interns sat on a boat counting the urchins that divers hauled to the surface, to get a sense of how they were faring.The story of the kelps disappearance is the story of an interwoven food system breaking down, and in the process threatening peoples livelihoods. Some of the first people to sound the alarm about the purple urchins, Catton said, were commercial red urchin harvesters.One of them is Gary Trumper, who has harvested red urchins for more than 30 years. Red urchins, larger than purple urchins, are commercially viable because people eat them  or more specifically, their gonads. The delicacy is better known to sushi aficionados as uni.But the increasing purple urchin population outcompeted the red urchins for the available kelp. Without kelp, the red urchins starved.That cut the value of Northern Californias commercial red urchin fishery from $3.6 million in 2013 to less than $600,000 in 2016. Many harvesters have moved on. Its probably 10 or 15 guys left doing it in the harbour, Mr. Trumper said.The trouble began with the starfish. Sunflower starfish, whose appendages can span more than 3 feet, normally eat purple urchins, helping to limit their numbers.Starfish deathsBut in 2013, the starfish mysteriously began dying. There is not scientific consensus on why, but Drew Harvell, a Professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University, said she thought a virus was at least partly to blame and that warmer waters exacerbated its effects.Sea otters, another predator of purple urchins, were hunted to near extinction in Northern California by 19th-century fur traders. Their numbers have not rebounded.Around the same time as the starfish began dying, a mass of warm water appeared hundreds of miles off Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon. By 2014 that warm water had moved toward land, stretching from Southeastern Alaska down to Mexico.The marine heat wave was hotter than anything humans had recorded dating back to the late 1800s. Researchers and locals called it The Blob. It would last into 2016.Human-caused global warming made it much more likely to get as extreme as it did, said Nathan Mantua, an author of a study linking The Blob to climate change.Theyre like cockroaches of the ocean, said Sonke Mastrup, a program manager at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.. They can endure starvation conditions much longer than most of the other critters.NY Times"

It has cited tests that found GM soy in Gujarat last year.The non-government Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, had said in July that it had found signatures linked to GM crops in 21 of 65 food products picked up from retail outlets. The food items included canola oil, corn-based products, and soy infant formula.Expectations that only GM-free material will be shipped to India are unrealistic, and the government lacks the machinery to test every import consignment, Rohit Parakh, a spokesperson for the coalition, said.The Union health ministry had told Parliament in February that food with GM ingredients would require approval from the Food Safety Standards Authority of India, and that no standards for GM foods had been notified yet. The FSSAI had in July said it had initiated work on framing rules for GM food.Several food items based on GM crops have been consumed across the US, Canada, China, Europe and Japan over the years, and biotechnology proponents assert that there is no evidence to justify concerns about GM crops.A 2016 report from Technavio, a market research analysis company, had estimated that GM seeds occupied more than half the global commercial seeds market and included corn, soybean, cotton, canola, sugar beat and wheat.Three US regulatory agencies  the department of agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Environment Protection Agency  have deemed GM foods as safe to eat.But in some European and Asian countries, consumer and economic concerns have led to strict regulations on GM crops, including partial or full bans on cultivation.A study by Purdue University scientists two years ago had predicted that a global ban on GM crops would raise food prices and hit the poorest countries the hardest.But anti-GM activists have cited controversial studies on laboratory animals to argue that the long-term impacts of GM crops on human health remain unknown."

While LJP would get four seats, RLSP would get two. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, LJP had contested on seven seats and won six, while RLSP had won all the three seats it had contested.These seat-sharing numbers are based on speculation in the media, but we will not accept any less than seven seats.

We have not known what it is to be happy after an earlier baby of ours died minutes after birth in 2011. My wife had delivered after a full-term pregnancy then. Later, she had three miscarriages which eventually scarred her uterus and rendered it dysfunctional, said Hitesh Valand, husband of Meenakshi who delivered the baby girl at 12.12am at the Galaxy Care hospital here on Thursday.The Valands hail from Jambusar village in Gujarat , 50km from Vadodara. While Hitesh runs a mens salon, Meenakshi is a beautician.The girls birth on Vijayadashami (Dasara) made it all the more special for the couple. I feel very blessed to have a baby born on Dasara, Meenakshi said.The family members have already started thinking about an apt name for the baby. In the Gujarati community, the name for the newborn is given by the fathers sisters. I have two sisters who are absolutely thrilled. They will come down to Pune in a few days. The naming ceremony will take place at the hospital itself as both mother and child will have to stay here for another one-and-a-half months, Hitesh said.Meenakshi, who was in the ICU, was shifted to a private ward on Friday.Transplant surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar, medical director of the hospital, said the baby cried immediately after birth. Initially, the baby had mild respiratory distress which settled with oxygen therapy . Now, she is breathing on her own. Puntambekar had carried out the uterus transplant surgery on Meenakshi on May 19 last year.The baby has presently been kept in a radiant warmer at the hospitals neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We are monitoring the babys vital parameters, temperature and blood sugar levels. She is present on tube feed. Depending on the babys tolerance of the feed, we will wean intravenous fluids and grade up enteral feeds, preferably mothers milk. The baby may need two weeks of hospital stay to start taking mothers milk, said hospitals neonatologist Sandeep Kadam.The doctors said the weight of the child is not a criterion for discharge from the hospital. A pre-term baby is usually discharged once it starts taking oral feeds, maintains its temperature and shows weight gain. This may take another two weeks, Kadam said."
