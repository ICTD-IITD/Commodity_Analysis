We have enough tomato and other vegetables stocks, which we import from India only in case of shortages in the domestic market,"" he said.The reason behind the ""suspension"" of cotton imports from India was, nevertheless, different, he said.""No. We have not stopped cotton imports from India. It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions. We're looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong,"" Shami said.He said only those cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes where importers had already secured permits from his department and carried phyto-sanitary certificates.""Our cotton consignments are not being allowed to enter Pakistan through Wagah and Karachi for reasons known to the ministry but cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn is being brought in without any let or hindrance. At least 11 trucks of Indian yarn entered Pakistan on Thursday when the department stopped cotton consignments from coming to this side of the border,"" a textile factory owner told Dawn.He said the suspension of cotton import from India would create a huge problem for the textile exporters as the truncated domestic crop target of 11.25 million bales for this year appeared difficult if not impossible to meet.""The industry requires 14 million bales. We will still be short by three million bales of cotton even if the crop target is achieved,"" he said.He said cotton shortages after the ban on Indian imports would make domestic prices shoot up at the expense of exports.Pakistan had imported 2.7 million bales of cotton (1 bale is 170 kgs) - about 40 per cent of India's total cotton exports in 2015-16 - due to crop failure that wiped off 0.5 per cent of GDP growth. The industry is expecting to import 2 million bales this year."

Rivlin appreciated the work carried out by Indo-Israel projects and remarked that Haryana had developed same technologies as Israel. ""Cooperation is something that not only goes between governments, but also between people. We are happy to share what we have our experiences and knowhow. We appreciate India for using Israeli technologies and for improving understanding between people and government.""When asked about technologies India can still learn from Israel, he said, ""We are good not only in agriculture, but also in fields of security and water management. Israel is a dry state.

The team noticed considerable content of morpholine and its derivatives in over a dozen fruits and vegetables collected from supermarkets.Morpholine oleate is a chemical which is mixed with wax to give an 'attractive' look to fruits and vegetables. It gives a fresh and shiny look and kills fungi and bacteria.India does not have any rules and regulations regarding the use of Morpholine oleate because of which its use goes unchecked. The chemical is as dangerous as carbide particularly when it combines with atmospheric and dietary nitrates to form the harmful chemical N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR). Excessive intake of NMOR can cause cancer and damage the foetus in pregnant mothers. It is banned in the UK and other European countries. However in Hyderabad it is being freely used by sellers.""Pilot studies conducted by us indicate presence of Morpholine in some fruits and vegetables purchased from local super market in Hyderabad,"" the researchers said in their study published in the recent issue of the scientific journal, The International Journal of Science Technology and Engineering (IJSTE). The team found average concentration of morpholine of 0.171 mgkg in tomato, 1.831 mgkg in carrots and 0.342 mgkg in capsicum. ""Though the levels are below the acceptable range of 0.48 mgkg body weightday, it does not rule out the risk of formation of NMOR if consumed directly and continuously.Considering the fact that formation of NMOR may lead to cancer over a period of time it is certainly not a situation to be ignored,"" the study warned. Less than 0.3 parts per million of Morpholine may not cause harm to people The study said people should ""wipe, wash and soak fruits and vegetables in water for a longer time"" to reduce the harmful impact of the chemical. The team also suggested that people ""not fall prey to bright and dark colour of fruits and vegetables"" and use local and seasonal fruits and vegetables for a healthy life."

Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change. ""People give us Rs 2,000 note and we don't have change, so no transaction takes place,"" said Rajendra Prasad at Nishatganj mandi.Vishakha Dubey, a school teacher who had come to buy fruits said first of all you need to carry change loads the purse and then the prices of fruits have shot up as there are not enough Rs 100 notes in the market."

He secured a bank loan for the onion crop last year, but his hopes were dashed soon after the yields started fetching prices much less than his expectations.The Galande family owns 4.25 acres of land in Bhoyegaon, 14 km from Chandwad taluka in Nashik district, and 23-year-old Somnath was the youngest of three brothers. He ended his life by consuming poison on December 5.After having passed his Class XII exams from a local college, Somnath was the most educated member of the family. All his three brothers are married and work in their own farm as well as in other farms.Somnath's mother Shakuntalabai told TOI that her son had studied in college and was handling the economic affairs of the house. ""However, every year after the produce was sold in the market and income tallied, the balance in hand would upset him. He wanted to construct cement walls for our house, but there was never a significant remainder in his hands.""Rambhaji said his son Somnath secured a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh from Corporation Bank. ""Somnath was delighted with the good monsoon this year and was hopeful of good returns for the produce. But when that failed to materialize, he was very upset. He remained away from the family affairs for two months, but we thought it was a temporary phase,"" he said, adding, ""We never had an inkling that he would take such an extreme step.""Somnath's brother, Vasant, said, ""My brother was looking for jobs in Chandwad and would visit people. He would also work in the fields with us.""""Somnath and we discussed the loan and also the mounting interest on it. We were hopeful of getting some profit this season. But the returns for vegetables, tomatoes and onions were not encouraging and he lost hope. I have also lost all hopes now,"" said Rambhaji."

As a result of low demand, prices of vegetables have also come down drastically.Around 5 lakh tribals in 11 mandals of Visakha agency depend on these weekly markets near their villages. More than 30 weekly markets operate per week in all mandals. Of these, 10 to 13 major markets transact business of more than Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.25 crore per day.The major weekly markets take place at Seeleru, Chintapalli, Pedabayalu, Araku, Paderu, Sunkarametta, Guttulaputtu Maddigaruvu, G Madugula, Hukumpeta, Darakonda, Minumuluru, Kinchumanda and Lammasingi. Traders come from Vijayawada, Rajahmundry and Visakhapatnam as well as from some parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh come to these markets where commercial crops and vegetables are sold.""The yield of many vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and carrot have come down this season. If you do not sell it, they will rot. So we are selling the vegetables for less price as we don't have any storage facility in the agency areas. Tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers rot within a few days,"" P Ramarao Dora, one of the farmers of Hukumpet mandal, said.Prices of various vegetables have come down drastically in the last 12 days since the central government announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.

Nagaraju asked.Amidst the currency crunch, the weekly market in Pedabayalu did business of Rs 50 lakh last Monday against its original average sale of Rs 1.25 crore. The other markets have not done much, sources said.Majority of the tribal farmers are visiting the post offices in their panchayat limits to change the old notes as Visakha agency has only 15 to 20 banks and below 10 ATMs across 11 mandals.

58d6ae71a3d24b1894a69cee,Veggie wholesale prices crash,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Veggie-wholesale-prices-crash/articleshow/55847328.cms,2016-12-07,,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: The wholesale price of vegetables has started dipping from Monday. However, there is little impact of on retail price. Thanks to the middlemen and the last man in the retail market, the price of vegetables remains quite high compared to their prices the same time last year. With the liquidity crunch continuing unabated, there is an element of distress sale at the source (from the field) by farmers. The overwhelming fear that the perishables may not be sold at all is also working behind the price crash.The potato (jyoti variety), which grows in abundance in Hooghly, is sold at Rs 4 per kg soon after its withdrawal from the cold storages. After sorting the potato, wholesale price stood at Rs 7-8 per kg. The retail price should have been Rs 910 per kg after taking into account the transportation and other costs. But the retail price remains as high as Rs 16-22 in most of the markets in the city. Thanks to demonetisation and the resultant liquidity crunch, a stockpile of 8 lakh tonnes of potatoes remained in the cold storages even after the deadline of clearing the stockpile expired on November 30. Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said the potato price should come down after the potato stockpile is cleared. He has set a deadline of December 8 for clearing the entire stock from the cold storages.The price of brinjal, which grow mainly in Hooghly and Burdwan, crashed to Rs 55-60 per palla (per 5 kgs). The wholesale price should not be more than Rs 15 per kg. But brinjal price in the city retail market hovered around Rs 25-30 per kg.Cabbage, which was Rs 35-40 per palla in the wholesale market, is sold at Rs 20 per kg in the city retail markets.The biggest crash happened in tomato prices. Toma toes grow in huge quantity in Bankura and Purulia. The farmers on Tuesday sold it at Rs 20 a palla. The tomato wholesale price at Khatra and Manbazar stood at Rs 6 per kg. But the retail price of tomato remains as high as Rs 20-25 per kg on Tuesday.Uttam Kundu, a wholesaler at Seoraphuli wholesale market, said, ""We have asked farmers to raise Rs 1 per kg against every vegetable so that farmers get some price. But the fear of liquidity crunch is so high that people did distress sale. The market has become a bit unpredictable.""Agriculture marketing department sources said there is a collusion of middlemen and the last man in the market (last retail outlet) that prevented the plunge in retail price.Dasgupta said, ""We are not sitting idle. We have already carried out raids at several retail markets."""

Only 5,000 crates of pomegranates were supplied by farmers, instead of the regular average of 15,000 crates. In Neera market, the auction of jaggery dropped by almost 50%, with the unloading of about 1,000 boxes as against the daily standard of 2,000 boxes. Meanwhile in Junnar , trade in fresh vegetables, onion, tomatoes and potatoes was down by 40%.Traders and farmers at these local markets have traditionally preferred transactions in cash, and were caught off-guard by the sudden announcement. The cancellation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has affected the payments, while purchases have also suffered. Even prices have dropped because of the low demand for farm produce.Officials in the agriculture produce market committee fear that more time would be required before things return to normal.An official attached to the market committee in Indapur said, ""Pomegranates have a huge market here, and a daylong auction registers transactions amounting to over Rs 50 lakh. This is peak season for pomegranate sales. We were expecting a rise in trade. However, for the last week, it has dropped drastically. Cash crunch forced traders and farmers to suspend auction because of the ban on cash transactions using demonetised notes. The auction finally resumed on Saturday to recover losses.""Local sources said that pomegranates had piled up in the orchards and if not sold soon, will rot, causing losses. So farmers and traders were left with no choice but to go ahead with trade.Soybean is ready for harvest in most parts of Baramati , and growers are likely to face losses if auction is not held.Even auctions of foodgrains like wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and soybean were completely halted for a week. The agriculture produce market committee said that supply of foodgrain dropped by almost 50% in last 10 days, and even traders were not unwilling to auction off their produce at lower prices. The committee was hopeful that action would resume on Monday. Local sources in Junnar-Ambegaon-Khed , which is predominantly known for cultivation of vegetables, said despite a good yield, business has taken a hit.Meanwhile, the government's latest move of increasing withdrawal limits for farmers, to Rs25,000, was met with scepticism. ""Cash is not available at most banks. Farmers cannot spend the entire day standing in queues in banks. Also, there are limited branches of nationalized banks in rural parts so farmers are badly hit,"" said Ashok Banker , a resident of Ambegaon area."

Their 'cash only' tags, they rued, only added to their miseries.Such was the plight of petty traders that many , specially in the Rythu Bazaars, were found slashing their prices by 30-35% or dumping their perishable stocks in waste bins. They claimed that they suffered major losses with footfalls dropping by 60-80 per cent. That is was a weekend didn't make matters any better.Mohd Bashir, a vendor operating out of the Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam, said, ""This has been happening for a few days now. Despite supply of vegetables dropping, we are unable to sell the entire supply .By the end of the day , we are forced to dump the leftover vegetables outside the bazaar, as transporting them and storing them is not possible for us.""The situation is no better at shops in Old City areas such as Lal Bazaar or the Falaknuma Rythu Bazaar.Another vendor, who was compelled to dump Friday's leftover tomatoes and cauliflowers into the bin on Saturday morning, pointed out that locals were even picking up leftover veggies to feed their cattle.""They are unable to buy feed due to the change crunch. So they are collecting the lefto vers,"" he said. Meanwhile, many vendors have gone from making daily payments to suppliers to depending on small loans and deferring payments.Nevertheless, they claim, their losses are running easily up to `2,000`3,000 per day . Abdulla Pasha, a vendor at the Kukatpally Rythu Bazaar , said, ""Even with the new cashless and cardless purchase system introduced here, many customers are unable to make purchases as their bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar number. Hoping for more customers today (Saturday) we had procured extra supply but now we have slashed prices by half.""Harinath, owner of Kevaiah Rice Mart at the Erragadda Rythu Bazaar said that even rice sales have dropped substantially. ""Number of customers have dropped from 100 to 20 per day now. While earlier I used to refill my supplies every two weeks, now it looks like it will take a month before I can finish the current lot,"" he lamented."

But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

As wasted fruits and vegetables fill the area and raise a stink, estimates show that at least 60-70% of the produce is going waste because supply chain has been disrupted by cashlessness. It is the same situation at most mandis that come under Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Markets Board.On Wednesday morning, potato buyer and whole seller Mohammad Salim ordered throwing 25 sacks into the garbage dump. A single sack contains 1 quintal potatoes. ""An average of 20-25 sacks are going waste since demonetisation was announced,"" said the businessman.His son Mohammad Shaan said wastage over the month was to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh. ""We would have sold the produce to retailers at an estimated rate of Rs 5 per kg which means Rs 12,500 for 25 quintals. If the average for 28 days of demonetization period is calculated, our loss stands at Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said.But Salim is not the only one to have run into losses. The mandi comprises 50 buyers and at least 500 farmers in the vicinity. ""Cash and change crunch has upset business across levels. Over 60-70% of the produce is wasted for lack of demand. If this goes on, the mandi will have to close down,"" said Arvind Shukla, vice-president of the mandi's vegetable and fruit whole sellers association.General secretary Irshad Hussain added, ""Many farmers are not able to bring their produce to us because they have no money for transport. Some of the growers are dumping their produce either for peanuts at the local level or leaving it to fate. Even those who can manage are not able to get the cost of ferrying goods as prices have nose-dived.""Explaining the price factor, Saroj Pal, a dealer in tomatoes said, ""In October, a crate of tomatoes (25kg) sold at Rs 700 but a farmer gets only Rs 100 for the same now. Clearly, the rates have come down seven times.""Cauliflower, the cash crop of the past two seasons is making farmers regret. ""A single bud is fetching just 1 rupee instead of Rs 6-8 each last season,"" said Dharmu Lodhi, a farmer from Bangermau.Wastage at the fruit sellers' end was estimated to be around 40-50%. Tanveer Ahmed, who dealt with exotic fruits like kiwis , kinnows and grapes said, ""We dealt with these fruits on a daily basis but there have been just one or two business days in the week. The stock is going waste on a daily basis.""Tomato farmer from Rajpur (MP), Angad Singh said ""Will Modiji pay for our losses?"" Nizam Bhai pyazwale said, ""Many farmers had taken loans... the bid to battle black money is fine but not at the cost of human lives. Steps have to be taken immediately,"" he said.Hand-to-mouth locals are perhaps the only happy ones in the mandi because some vendors are giving away their vegetables free. Potato dealer Mohammad Irshad said, ""It will be disrespect of the Almighty if food is thrown away so it is better some human consumes some it without paying."" Beneficiary of this benevolence, Gita from Birdibagh said, ""I will use the best part for the family while feed the cattle on the rest."""

She hands out a kilogram of tomatoes free if a family has constructed a toilet in its house.Sharanamma Bakar, from Danapur village of Gangavati taluk, thought of this unusual incentive when she realized that about 500 of the village's 1,300 families don't have a loo of their own.Sharanamma goes to every nook and corner of the village, educates people on the need of having a toilet in each house and also why it's important to keep the environment neat and hygienic. And she's not offloading tomatoes because of the glut in production.The vendor told TOI she buys 120 kg of tomatoes shelling out about Rs 3,500 from the wholesale market every day. ""I've been selling vegetables for 25 years to eke out a living. I am a fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who's encouraging people to build toilets in their houses as part of the Swachh mission,"" she said.Like thousands of villages in the country, Koppal's Danapur has many villagers who walk a long distance or wait for the dusk to set in to relieve themselves in the open. ""When I go door to door with my Swachh campaign, I tell them about the health benefits of having a toilet in each house. I also give them details of financial support offered by the Union government to construct toilets,"" she said.The woman vendor has handed out nearly 300 kg of tomatoes as part of her campaign, suggesting she has seen at least as many families having built a toilet in their house. ""Sometimes, I have gifted a kilo of tomatoes to families which are willing to build a toilet. I will do this campaign for some more time,"" she said.Channamma, from the village, said, ""The woman vendor is doing an incredible job. She came to our house and enquired about the toilet mission. When we replied in the affirmative, she gave us tomatoes.""Danapur gram panchayat president Mahammad Shafi said Sharanamma has set an example for others by launching a voluntary campaign and parting with vegetables for a noble cause. ""After she started the initiative, more and more people have approached us with queries about the Swachh mission."""

It was then that Shankar Swami arrived in Kashi and cooked khichdi (dal-rice and different vegetables) for Lord Shiva and satiated his hunger.""Swamiji would prepare khichdi with donation from pilgrims at a pedestal raised on Dedhsi bridge at Dashaswamedh temple and serve the needy, poor and the homeless. He came to be known as Khichdi Baba,"" says Sanjay Maharaj.He said that Makar Sankranti, also known as `Khichdi', was named after Khichdi Baba.Khichdi is a customary food item prepared on Makar Sankranti. The trend is believed to have been started by Lord Shiva.But Khichdi was introduced to Lord Shiva by Khichdi Baba and this is the reason the festival is named after him, said Sanjay, adding that the place where Khichdi Baba used to cook was given the shape of a temple and the bust of Khichdi Baba and his disciple Harihar Baba had been installed by the family.Sharing an anecdote narrated by his father Rajendra Prasad Maharaj, Sanjay says that during the British rule, a British Army man had sent the then-Khichdi Baba to jail. That very day, the officer's family members fell ill and their condition started worsening. A local then reminded the officer of his behaviour towards Baba and the Englishman released him from jail. The next moment his family members were as fit as a fiddle.That was the power of Khichdi Baba, he says.According to Sanjay, Bhandaras are run everyday from 7am and needy people who throng the temple are served hot khichdi prepared with as many as 10 types of vegetables including, cauliflower, brinjal, potato, tomato, bittergourd, and others.In one round, more than 200 people are fed khichdi. The count crosses 600 almost everyday, he said, adding that on Mondays and Saturdays, the count of people crosses 800 as both days belong to Baba and it is customary to eat khichdi every Saturday ."

However, farmers are having to bear the brunt of the situation, as they are failing to get sufficient returns on their harvest. The impact was evident with the suicide of a farmer in Mansa, who reeled under losses.Nitin Patel, 37, a farmer from Chandala, said, ""The plummeting of wholesale prices for vegetables have spelled havoc for us. We grow chillies, cabbage and cauliflower on our three-bigha farm. Of these, we harvest about eight tonnes of cabbage in a season. However, cabbage is fetching wholesale price of Rs 2 per kg. Against this, we invest Rs10,000 for seeds, Rs5,000 for fertilizer, Rs2,000 for pesticides and Rs7,000 for labour.""The transportation cost to the respective APMCs adds to the cost, and therefore farmers are ending up with heavy losses. The situation is no different for farmers who harvest other vegetables such as pigeon peas and tomatoes among others.""We harvest pigeon peas (tuvar), which grows once in twelve months. If the weather conditions are not favourable, a large chunk of our crop is destroyed. We harvest around 6,000 kg of pigeon peas every year, for which we get a return of Rs 2,000 per quintal, which is not sustainable,"" said Jayantibhai Dabhi, another farmer from Sukhad village.Even as the export of tomatoes to Pakistan has halted, prices have gone down and the market supply is high putting farmers in loss. ""Tomatoes are being sold at a wholesale price of Rs2 per kg. We invest close to Rs 1 lakh over a period of four months to harvest around 30,000 kg tomatoes. However, what we are getting in return is only about half our investment,"" said Hemant Patel, a 35-year-old farmer."

However, the closure of markets dashed their hopes again. As the auctions at the market yards in Nashik and Girnare had been halted for the last few days, some of the farmers even had to throw away their produce.Lahanabai Fasaal, a farmer who grows tomatoes, said she incurred losses of 40 crates of tomatoes from November 15-18, adding up to a loss of Rs 40,000 per acre.""The markets were closed as the traders refused to pay. As they are perishable items, we had to throw away all the crates. On Monday, we went to the markets with our produce and things seem to improving gradually. But our loss was too much. The prices have come down,"" said Lahanabai.Many other farmers like Lahanabai had to face the wrath of their labourers. ""I could not pay my farm labourers because the produce was not sold and the labourers were not ready to take the banned currency notes which they could have exchanged or deposited at the banks,"" Lahanabai said.Another farmer, Dhondya M, who sends most of his produce to Vasai market, had to throw away 20-25 crates of cabbage and tomato. ""As I knew that the markets were closed, I did not send the crates with my produce to the market. From Monday, we started sending the crates to Vasai,"" said Dhondya.The opening of markets has not helped the farmers though. A tomato grower, Vaman Tople said, ""Even though the markets have opened now, it is still slack. We are getting less value for our produce. All the traders give us Rs 2,000 notes, but nobody gives us change. We have faced heavy losses due to the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."""

In distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. Since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.But in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.An analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and Delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since November 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. There has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Patna and Guwahati.Wholesale traders in Delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. So, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.As a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding November 8 and the fortnight following it. This should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. But that was not to be.Wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. In all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. In Delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.Onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. Okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. But at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.Onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices. ""This is the rate we are getting at the mandi. The wholesalers are making money, not us,"" said Mangat Ram, a vegetable seller in East Delhi who claimed that his sales had dipped since November 8."

Vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, potato, tomato, brinjal, gourd, radish, carrot and capsicum are being sold at a far lower price as compared to those of last year.Meanwhile, prices of staples like wheat flour, fine wheat flour, pulses and sugar have increased by around Rs 10 to 20 per kg.""Since there is a decline in the quantity coming from outside, the prices are on the higher side,"" said Jayesh Tandon, a wholesaler."

Express Sandeep Mohans latest film Shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer who grapples with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life. ExpressIF life throws stones and tomatoes at him, he would collect it and make a comedy about Stones and Tomatoes. Thats Sandeep Mohan for you, an indie filmmaker and the man behind The Great Indian Travelling Cinema initiative. As part of this initiative, his latest film Shreelancer was in Chandigarh recently. Shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer named Shree,in his mid 20s, as he tries to grapple with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life.Watch what else is making news:Unlike my earlier films  Love Wrinkle Free & Hola Venky, which were termedcomedies, Shreelancer might be slotted as drama. Also in my previous films, the protagonists were in their mid 30sin Shreelancer, for the first time, I am delving into the mind of a mid-20s freelancer. It is a contemporary story told in an engaging manner, says Mohan, who has developed his own kind of cinema  guerilla style, candid, witty, full of observations and reflections on life and people. Cinema for him is a constant process for exploration, and he hopes he doesnt discover fully what cinema is, because then the charm goes out. I want the mystery and magic to remain forever.With the final mix of Shreelancer over just 10 days back, this is the first screening of the film in Chandigarh. Mohan is also travelling with it to alternative spaces across the country as part of his The Great Indian Travelling Cinema experiment. One of the reasons for screening here was that a few of the cast members are from Chandigarh  Chandan Singh Gill, Karanveer Khullar, Vivek Sharma, Krishan Rathee, Nikhar DanielI also shot a part of the film here. There is something charming and big-hearted about this city, says Mohan.Born in Jabalpur, he moved to Mumbai at the age of 21. Being an independent spirit who prefers to learn by making mistakes rather than be taught by an authoritative figure, independent cinema seemed to be the right choice for Mohan. For someone who consciously stays away from film festival circuit and is allergic to the censor board, he conceptualised The Great Indian Travelling Cinema. A one man experiment, Mohan travels to various cities and screens his film. The idea is to see the film with an audience and learn something, while watching and interacting with them. Since my films fall between mainstream and film festival films, I have to see for myself that there is an audience for my films and travelling cinema screenings help. I soak in the energy, feel motivated, and then go back and write another film exactly the way I want to, reassured that there is an audience. However, he would love to go through the festival route for his films. Ideally one would want a right mix of a limited theatrical release, film fest rounds, travelling cinema screenings and a good online release on bigger platforms. To sell the film in India and for satellite rights etc, you need a censor. So, I might have to take one for Shreelancer. It was for my last film Hola Venky that I refused to take a censor and went around travelling and screening it in 92 cities, he says.Its a space where survival is tough, and Mohan feels one has to be very strong internally and think long term. Indie filmmaking wont make you rich but happier especially if you have creative control and if you go about it a little smartly, then you can even survive well. Money will follow for there are better things to run after in life, he adds. He agrees that with Netflix and Amazons coming in, viewing habits will changeit is good time for filmmakers who budget their films correct and tell a good story. As for demonetisation, I downloaded the Paytm app and ask people to pay through it after My Great Indian Travelling Cinema screenings.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The cool weather is not kind to those with joint and bone problems. Though doctors say little can be done to avoid the ill feeling, precautions can be taken to ease it. From keeping oneself warm to making sure one gets enough exercise, inflammation can be controlled if attention is paid.Consulting orthopedic surgeon Dr Rajesh Badiyani said people already suffering from arthritis or other orthopedic disease are more prone to morning stiffness.""For many people winter is welcoming, but for arthritic patients it can be a pain. The weather affects them differently i and it is different from person to person,"" a he said while suggesting that exercising, walking and moving about are the best way to ensure that joints don't stiffen. Dr Prashanth Agarwal , consulting orthopedic, Apollo Hospital , said, ""In some people, frigid temperatures may worsen inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and joint pain, affecting the hips, knees, elbows, shoulders and hands.""Researchers aren't sure why cold weather makes us so stiff and sore, but one the ory , based on a small study , is that inflamed joints swell as barometric pressure drops.The swelling irritates the nerves around the joints, causing pain. ""There is also less supply of blood to the peripheral regions of the body due to which one's joints become stiff, causing pain,"" he said.To keep bones less painful, doctors suggest exercises. Being a couch potato is bad for the joints. Exercises help lubricate them to prevent pain. Walking can reduce joint pain and stiffness, keeping people flexible. ""Exercises can boost a person's mental and physical state. Stretching and exercises with light weights are good, as they strengthen the knee muscles and improve flexibility ,"" added Dr Agarwal.Apart from starting your day basking in the sun, it is also important to include foods rich in vitamins in your diet.""Foods like spinach, cabbage, tomatoes and oranges are rich sources of vitamins and minerals. These vitamins play a vital role in the production of bone cartilage and tissue,"" said a doctor."

She knew this was the best opportunity to realize her long-cherished dream of cultivating her own vegetables and herbs, and she immediately roped in a gardener to help plant spinach, tomatoes, okra, lemons and chillies. Six months on, the entire family not only enjoys spending time in the balcony amid the plants, but also boasts of eating self-cultivated, pesticide-free vegetables at least once a week.A growing discussion about organic food appears to have rekindled an interest in gardening among many citizens, who are now experimenting with not just nourishing plants but also generating manure from their own kitchen waste as part of a conscious decision to move towards more sustainable living.As a result, sunny kitchen corners, balconies and terraces in high-rises , and small garden spaces around bungalow-style homes across the city are turning into 'green labs' with residents trying their hand at growing everything from easy-to-cultivate herbs and leafy greens to vegetables and fruits. Not only is the produce healthier than what is available in the markets, but tastes better too, in part sweetened by the hardwork put in by 'cultivators', who gain more than just good health.It's therapeutic and a deeply spiritual experience, says Meghana Kulkarni , a homemaker who has even been cured of several ailments since she set up a terrace garden at her bungalow in Kothrud. ""I started about 18 months ago and now grow everything from chillies to tomato, pumpkin, gourds, brinjal, herbs and leafy vegetables. I had a chronic problem of thyroid, then swine flu, high BP and even depression. All these were cured as I started eating self-cultivated produce. We now manage to do cook the produce at least four to five times a week. The taste is completely different and we even manage to eat some of it in its raw form, including okra. I am in a meditative state when I am in the garden,"" she said.It's fairly easy to do it, once you understand the technique, shared Aruna Shelke, a resident of Hinjewadi, who has also set up a kitchen garden at her ground floor home. ""Even a small balcony is enough to start a kitchen garden, if it can fit 10-12 pots. I am growing a variety of vegetables. One need not spend more than a few minutes every day. Some basic skills, like how to tie-up the tomatoes, or other fruits, etc, can ensure that the plants stay in good condition,"" she said.It's the best thing one can do for the family's health, said Dnyaneshwar Bodke, president of Abhinav Farmers Club. The association helps people set up kitchen gardens and imparts daylong training for their maintenance. ""Instead of wasting time in the gym, we suggest people register with us to devote about half-hour everyday for their plants,"" he said."

In Unnao district, farmers haven't been able to sell their paddy as buyers are offering to pay in the old currency. Over 70% of perishables are on the verge of rotting. In the case of tomatoes and potatoes, losses are over 80%.In Bengal, Chintamoni Pakhira (54) of Singur had to borrow cash at 11.5% from a moneylender because he was running out of time to harvest his 7 bighas of kharif paddy. This raised his production cost. The loan and anxiety about getting the right price in the middle of the liquidity squeeze haunt him.In UP, the rabi crop is threatened, farmers don't have money for seeds and fertilisers. Many farmers are being coerced into ""futures trading"". ""A seed bhandar told me he'd give seeds on credit but I'd have to repay thrice the amount six months later,"" said Bhuvesh, a farmer in Subhani Khera.Another says he hasn't any funds left to buy fertilisers, so his crop will die. For Chintamoni, in Bengal, time is money. The rabi season has begun and, already late in harvesting the old crop, he's unsure about re-sowing in time. Farmers in rural MP, it appears, faced lesser hardship.They managed to sow their lands, but with a slight delay due to the cash drought. According to official figures, the area sown this season has increased by 1.7 lakh hectares compared to last year. ""Farmers don't have much to do with cash.Compared to cities, things are better in the villages,"" said agriculture production commissioner Prem Chand Meena. Rajkumar Rathore, a farmer from Sehore , agreed. ""Cash is required, but not like other works in farming (sic).""UP's farmers fear that with no crop or very low yields, they'll won't be able to feed their families. Vinay Kumar of Purva village has decided to go to Lucknow and work as a labourer to run his family.Bengal's Chintamoni says smaller farmers are the worst hit. ""I can somehow survive. But small farmers have no option but to struggle,"" he said. The cash crunch has created problems in rural MP. About 15 residents of Sheikhpura village in Sehore are jobless because the tile factory that employed them has stopped working."

One of the boys standing in the patient queue before the ATM kiosk on the other side of the road walked up to him and said, ""Do you take money on Paytm?"" When Akhtar said, ""No"", he replied with a degree of helpless resignation, "" Cash nahi hai mere paas. Paytm hota to achha hota (I don't have cash. It would have been nice, if you were using Paytm).""The scene and dialogue was repeated over the next few days. Several youngsters from the adjacent New Ashok Nagar colony would pose the same query. In regular circumstances, Akhtar wouldn't have spared much thought to the persistent question. For the past two years, the 35-year-old from Bihar's Samastipur district has been peddling vegetable biryani from a mobile food stall near the New Ashok Nagar metro station. For Rs 30 a plate, he serves a decent helping of the flavoured rice garnished with slices of soyabean chop, tiny pieces of paneer, tomato chutney, chopped onion and chilli pickle. And business is generally brisk.But last month his sales plunged after Prime Minister Narendra Moditriggering a sudden shortfall of currency. Daily-wagers, auto-rickshaw drivers, college students and young executives - the bulk of his customers were not turning up. ""I often took back home kilos of unsold biryani. For about a week, I stopped coming here,"" says Akhtar, who goes by the name Aman-ji. When he resumed business, the customers returned but not in the same numbers as in pre-notebandi days. Some would still ask about the option of paying through Paytm.So when an executive from the mobile wallet company came by a week ago and offered him the option of taking payments through the mobile wallet, Akhtar reluctantly decided to give it a try. The biryani seller was uncertain because it meant having to part with a small portion of his earnings as the company's commission. And though, he is ""inter pass,"" Akhtar wasn't fully sure how the technology would work.It is easy to understand Akhtar's hesitance. Like millions of other migrants, the son of a daily-wager came to Delhi in search of a better life about 15 years ago. The third among seven brothers and sisters, he did a variety of odd jobs in the NCR before finding his true calling: selling biryani. The food cart sustains his family- his wife and three kids.He wakes up around 5 am, helps his wife prepare the biryani and sets up his roadside cart by 8 am. The hawking is done by 4.30 pm. A brief rest at home and he sets off to the grocers to buy all that he needs the next day. Has he ever considered selling chicken or mutton biryani? The migrant mumbles something about wanting to sell "" shudh khana .""Akhtar is cagey about divulging details of his daily returns. And he doesn't want to reveal the number of customers who use the mobile wallet. ""About 10-12 customers every day,"" he says after a little cajoling. During the two hours TOI spent interviewing him, four customers paid through Paytm. A couple of others were requested to pay in cash if they were carrying currency. The biryani seller explains why. ""I would have to stand in a bank queue again to get my money. So I prefer people paying in cash. But when they say, they don't have any, I let them use Paytm,'' he says.One such customer is Sumendra Singh, a 26-year-old who works in the customer services division of a mobile phone company. ""I am short of cash. There's too much work and no time to stand in the queue. I haven't even brought my wallet,"" he says.This month, as usual, the company transferred Singh's salary to his bank account. He shifted Rs 1,000 to his mobile wallet. At the food cart, Singh scans the Paytm bar code and transfers Rs 30 to Akhtar's mobile phone. "" Zara mobile check kar lijiye. Mera payment aur number ka message aa gaya hoga (Check your mobile. You would have got a message about my payment and phone number),"" he says. Akhtar asks for the last four numbers of the customer's mobile number, looks into his own phone and serves him.Slowly and cautiously, the migrant from Bihar has embraced the world of mobile wallet business."

But before it could capitalise on natures bounty, the demonetisation exercise delivered a body blow to agriculture and its allied sectors, which primarily deal in cash. The prices of vegetables  both at the wholesale and retail level -- have crashed, leaving farmers, especially the small and marginal ones, in a perilous situation. Most farmers are still dependent on cash for their daily dealings and those engaged in growing vegetables have no support mechanism to hold their crop for long as it is perishable. The result: Last week, at two wholesale markets in Madhya Pradesh, onions were sold for Re 1 per kilogramme. Similarly, tomatoes cost less than Rs 2 per kg in Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh.Read: Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationWhat is worse is that these farmers will not be eligible for any crop insurance schemes because those are valid only in case of natural calamities such as droughts and floods. Demonetisation is a new phenomenon and so it has never been factored into the list of events that are eligible for insurance cover. Agriculture and the allied sectors  forestry and fishing  account for about 16% of the GDP but more importantly, 60% of India is linked to agriculture. About 40% of the total agriculture loans go towards kharif crops while the rest is given for rabi crops.Read: Workers laid off for refusing to accept salary in demonetised notesIn the last two years, the NDA government has undertaken a host of measures to support the farm sector: First, public sector banks have been given an agriculture credit target of Rs 9 lakh crore for 2016-17, up from Rs 8.5 lakh crore in the previous financial year; second, it has launched the national crop insurance programme, the soil health card and the Krishi Sichai Yojana. Third, the agriculture market committees are also being revamped. But these measures will need time to create the safety net that the farmers need. But the key question that remains now is this: Who will compensate the farmers for crop losses due to demonetisation?"

Nonetheless, it was an interesting and engaging play. I enjoyed my time watching it.""Actor Ranvir Shorey told us, ""Rajat has done adaptations of Shakespearean plays and presented it with clowns, but I found this project to be exciting because we explore the world of clowns, who exude darker emotions.""

If I were to stand in a bank line one day, who will man my stall?"" he asked.Junaid Khan, a vegetable seller on Minto Road, said he had not yet dropped prices, but a lot of his sale was done on credit. ""I know most of my customers. I am doing business in the hope that they will pay me soon,"" he said."

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Even a few years ago, it was rather difficult to get hold of well-grown, leafy greens and exotic vegetables to replicate the taste Jadhav had developed for healthy and fresh foods.The frustration eventually bore solutions and Jadhav, with absolutely no background in farming, took to cultivating greens on her own, albeit at a friend's farm in Holkarwadi on the outskirts of the city. Now, Jadhav's venture has grown from the small, self-feeding model of exotic vegetables to a full-scale operation focusing on all aspects of organic farming , marketing and exporting the produce.By and by, more health-conscious citizens from the city have willingly given up their cushy, well-paying careers to get down and dirty and ensure that only chemical-free and pure farm produce reaches their dinner tables. While some are farming themselves, others are extending a helping hand to farmers engaged in organic cultivation near the city to help them scale up their operations.For Sus Road resident Sujit Agarwal, encouraging reviews from buyers tilted the decision in favour of taking up this work full time. From designing electronic chips for an Indian tech major in a plush air-conditioned office to tilling the land with farmers in and around Pune, Pandharpur, Nevasa, Dehu and Phaltan, the life-changing experience has seen the entire family interact with farmers, understand how they grow their produce and ensure that it reaches a growing customer base in the city.Describing the learnings of the two years since setting up My Farmer, Agarwal said, ""I took this up after reading about farming and farmer suicides as I wanted to do something meaningful. After reviewing our financial condition and lifestyle, my wife and I decided to take the plunge. There are quite a few farmers who have taken up chemical-free organic farming and they need a helping hand to reach out to buyers in the initial years. We started from our own residential society and gradually extended it to a six-kilometre radius. We now have a steady customer base that appreciates the distinct taste and flavour of natural produce including everyday vegetables, fruits, even pulses and rice. The rates are fairly competitive to the market prices but it is insignificant if one considers the quality.""The demand for exotic vegetables in the city is steady and encouraging, says Jadhav, who specializes in organic cultivation of broccoli, golden and red cherry tomatoes, salad leaves, zucchini, red capsicum, among others. She is also marketing other farmers' produce and extends technology know-how to cope with agricultural challenges like water scarcity, going soil-free, etc."

But the mobile ATMs of the State Bank of India were seen attracting crowds in many places, including Thiruparankundram constituency which will go to poll on November 19.Among the affected population were attenders of patients who had been admitted to the corporate hospitals in the city. ""The billing for the patient is being done using the swipe machine, but I am not able to buy even a tender coconut for want of notes in smaller denominations,"" said K Thangavel of Manamadurai, who has a relative admitted at the hospital.Finding change for the bus fare to come and visit the patient has also become a problem, he said.Many like Thangavel are bringing food and other essentials from their homes itself so as to not face any issues. ""we are bringing puliyodharai or bread from our home towns so that we don't have to face the problems of finding change to eat at a hotel,"" said K Saraswathy , who was staying with her relative.Many of the smaller traders continue to be affected. ""I did a business of Rs300 last Monday, but my business today has come down to just Rs50. I am finding it difficult to sell even 25 per cent of the tender coconuts,"" said Ganapathy , a tender coconut seller at K K Nagar. ""This is such a sudden move. Many of us are struggling now and don't know if we will be able to recover,"" he said.Business has been affected at the Oddanchathiram flower market in Dindigul district, as the prices of vegetables has touched an all-time low, mainly due to the crisis caused by the demonetisation move. Farmers who brought their produce were wary of taking the Rs500 or Rs1,000 notes as traders were not able to give smaller denominations. The vegetables were being given away at throwaway prices. Tomatoes sold for Rs 2 at this wholesale market on Sunday.The cattle market in Oddanchathiram also does brisk business on Mondays - over 3,000 cattle were brought to the market last week. On Monday, only 300 animals were brought and farmers could not find a good price for most of them as, again, their counterparts were not ready to accept the old currency notes."

However, looking at the lukewarm response, they scaled it down to a ""Jan Akrosh Morcha "".The march in Nashik was, however, supported mainly by weavers who had come from Malegaon under the leadership of Congress MLA Rashid Ahmed.Only few prominent faces of Congress and NCP, including city and district unit presidents, made it to the morcha where they condemned government's policy of unearthing black money instead of bringing money deposited in foreign bank accounts.The member of legislative assembly, from Igatpuri, Nirmala Gavit also condemned the government for its laxity shown towards providing any relief to the people. ""We are not against demonetisation. But it pains to see that farmers are unable to sell their produce and are forced to throw it in the dump.

The banks are getting one-third of the cash needed. ""It is a precarious situation. The state economy is badly hit. Small and marginal farmers and small traders were severely affected,"" the minister told the assembly.Reminding that chief minister Naveen Patnaik had taken up the issue of cash crunch in cooperative banks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Amat said the state government has taken up the various problems arising out of demonetisation from time to time.Amat's reply came after the Congress members disrupted the assembly proceedings over growing inconvenience to people over demonetisation in the state forcing repeated adjournments while BJD members also raised the issue.During zero hour, Congress whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati pointed out that farmers were forced to throw tomatoes at a weekly market in Bargarh district on Thursday because there were no buyers due to severe cash crunch. Similarly, at another market in Koraput district brinjals were thrown by the farmers, he said.Since the wholesalers are reluctant to lift vegetables, the prices have fallen to dirt-cheap level. While tomato is being sold at Re 1 to Rs 2 by the farmers, brinjal is being sold at less than Rs 5. Even at such low prices, the vegetables remain unsold, Bahinipati said.BJD's Samir Ranjan Dash too raised the issue and said though the state had supported the Centre's move to curb black money, its implementation in the past one month exposed complete failure of the Modi regime. While Dash was speaking, the Congress members jumped into the well of the House seeking the finance minister's statement amid shouting of anti-government slogans. Deputy speaker Sananda Marndi, who presided over, first adjourned the House for 15 minutes.When the House reconvened, BJD MLA Amar Prasad Satpathy started speaking on demonetisation criticising the Centre. However, as the Congress MLAs continued shouting anti-government slogans, the deputy speaker adjourned the House till 3pm. Post-lunch, the finance minister gave his statement. The House was adjourned till Tuesday and will reconvene on Wednesday.Speaking to the media outside the assembly, leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra said, ""It is an emergency like situation. People don't have money. The situation is worsening by the day."""

Soon, they will drop to the ground and wither away. A season's hard work wasted.Yet, for the progressive farmer from Chikkahasala village, it makes economic sense to let go of the tomato crop. Prices have fallen to a new low this season: with a 15kg box of tomatoes selling at Rs 20-40 at the APMC Yard in Kolar in the past few days, Muniyappa doesn't want to spend on labour and other expenses.It is not only Muniyappa, scores of big farmers have allowed the crop to die. Muniyappa attributes two factors to the low procurement price - the major one being demonetization of high-value currency notes, which he said has robbed many middle and upper middle class traders of their purchasing power. He said non-availability of money in banks has also contributed to a cut in buying.He said the other factor for low prices is that both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major tomato purchasing states from Kolar. Normally, between November and December, there would be at least a couple of cyclones in these two states which would have resulted in the crop loss, but with no cyclones in November and the beginning of December in these two states, the tomato crop there was good, leading to little demand for tomatoes grown in Kolar district, Muniyappa said.Byalahalli Govinda Gowda, president of Kolar District Cooperative Central Bank and a farmer, said that he has allowed his tomato crop, grown on about eight acres of land, to wither away. He said since the procurement price is very low, farmers are unable to even get the labour cost. He said in Kolar district alone, the tomato crop grown on over 25,000 acres has been allowed to wither away. He said a farmer will incur an expense of nearly 2 lakh per acre to grow the crop, and the demonetization effect has had a crushing impact on the farmers of Kolar district. He said the procurement prices of most of the vegetables grown in Kolar district have fallen as few people come forward to purchase vegetables at APMCs.CR Srinath, proprietor of CM Ramaiah Tomato Mandi in Kolar, said the traders have very little money in hand, and there is low demand for the crop. He said normal weather, which is conducive for the growth of tomatoes, that prevailed in most parts of the country, resulting in a good yield at various places, including Kolkata, Tamil Nadu and Bengal, and as such, there is little demand for the crop grown in Kolar district. He said during the past two days, 15-kg box of tomatoes was being sold for between Rs 10 and Rs 40."

He sold them for Rs 12 per kg. A week later, it was a dramatically different situation. The price had crashed to Rs 4 per kg. ""Nobody's picking up the stuff in the mandi now. Nuksan ho raha hai (I am suffering losses). The mandi guys are telling me that with shortage of currency, there's little demand at the retail level,"" he says.Another farmer, Virendra Dahiya, said, he had wholesaled the same vegetable for Rs 15 per kg at the mandi before the stunning currency measure announced on Nov 8 and has now been trading them for Rs 9-10 per kg.Those standing in the long queues before a PNB branch complain that cash comes and vanishes with the speed of a rumour.Currency shortage seems to have caused a ripple effect down the supply chain. And the consequence can be seen at the bottom of the pyramid.Ajaypal, who mainly grows vegetables over 16 bighas of land owned jointly by four brothers, is making adjustments to beat the blowback of notebandi, the term everyone uses to describe demonetization in these parts of rurban south-west Delhi.Another batch of cauliflowers would have been ready for the market in a couple of days. But the 46-year-old Jat farmer has stopped watering the plants. ""That would delay their growth. I want to hold on for a fortnight. Maybe we will get a better price after that,"" he says.A similar tactic to beat the falling rates has been employed by Jagbir Singh, a Jat farmer with 15 bighas of land in Asra, a village located in west UP's Hapur district. ""I will not harvest potato for 8-10 days. Let them stay where they are till the mandi rates improve,"" he told TOI last week.Once he has disposed of the cauliflowers and the radish, Ajaypal will sow tomatoes and peas. Like many in these parts with a cash flow problem, he is relying on the bond of traditional association that gets him seeds and fertilisers on loan. ""That's part of our dealings every year,"" he says. Dahiya says credit is part of every transaction in this urban village poised on the edge of south-west Delhi. ""Yahan to kirayedaar ka bhi udhaar chalta hai (Even the tenants pay you later,"") he says.Part of Ajaypal's land is fallow at the moment. He has just harvested jowar and now is ready to sow wheat. He's behind schedule by about 10-15 days. ""I will plant a late variety of wheat to compensate,"" the farmer says.Normally, at this time about 20 people would have been working in the field, says the farmer. But the delay means there are only two farmhands at work on Thursday after noon.Ajaypal pays them Rs 250 for a day's work. But he is unable to pay them in cash right now. Overall, he owes about Rs 4,000 to his other regulars who are now working elsewhere, he says. How much do the shortage of money and the losses bother him? His feelings are mixed. ""No 2 ke paise ko lagaam lag rahi hai (Black money is being brought under control),"" he says.Life is more difficult for Sharmila Devi, one of two daily wagers still working in Ajaypal's field. These days she carries vegetables home as part of her payment. Call it a form of barter or good old jugaad, adjustments like these keep the wheels turning for the marginal and the marginalized in times of the scarce rupee."

And when they do so with just a little more than regular home appliances, the interest only goes up.On Friday, chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar , bankers and farmer came together to think of ways to encourage youth to take up farming, one of the suggestions put forth was to make agriculture financially attractive. A disgruntled farmer even asked why a farmer could not have an AC car.The three engineers-turned-agri-entrepreneurs may not really have luxury sedans but they certainly farm in an air conditioned environment.The innovative idea came to three cousins, Sandeep Metri, Jagdish Naik and Ajay Naik , all in their early 30s. ""I am a foodie and I like to visit restaurants. I did some research and found that most of the exotic vegetables come from outside the state and are commercially using harmful pesticides,"" Ajay, a software engineer, said.The trio took up hydroponics, the technique of growing vegetables in water, which increases produce by 20-30%, while saving on water. Needless to say, the idea ruffled quite a few feathers within the family. ""Our family was surprised and said it was not for us. They said we would not succeed and were surprised that I shifted from IT to agriculture,"" Ajay adds.Ajay is no ordinary IT graduate. A former Persistent employee, he has two successful startups under his belt. His first startup in collaboration with Lucio Misquita , called L&A Tech, was sold to a German company for 1 million Euros.The three rented out a 150sq-m shed at Thivim Industrial Estate where they grow four varieties of Lettuce and Basil in an 80sq-m air-conditioned room. The agri-startup, Letcetra Agritech, produces 100 kg vegetables every day or three tonnes of exotic vegetables per month.""Next, we shall start with cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, cucumbers, other Indian vegetables and even strawberries,"" said Ajay, who looks after the core hydroponics technology and marketing.Sandeep, a 33-year old electrical engineer, looks after operations while Jagdish, a mechanical engineer takes care of production.The trio believe agriculture can be profitable if technology is used efficiently. ""There is a fear that agriculture is risky because you depend on the weather. I have taken out 90% of that risk. There is the fear that you don't get good rates and for that I eliminated the middleman,"" Ajay said.The entrepreneurs do admit that not all risks can be tackled. The demonetization move has dampened the demand for exotic vegetables but they are confident that the market will pick up.Cool as a cucumber did you say?"

The agriculture department in the district, which should have sold 19 tonnes in November, still has a huge stock left. This is despite the Centre allowing government seed depots to accept old currencies.To ensure cultivation during rabi season was not affected by demonetisation, the Centre announced that all national seed corporations could accept scrapped notes from farmers for the sale of seeds and fertilizers, on Monday. On Wednesday, a government order issued allowed state agriculture department-run seed depots to also accept old notes. Even this has not encouraged farmers to buy seeds. ""The slowdown in seeds sales is more due to drought than demonetisation. With absolutely no rains in the district this year, farmers are apprehensive about sowing seeds,"" said an area manager.While the state agriculture department also sells around 19 tonnes of paddy, pulses and millets, the seeds are usually sold out by November-end. ""This year, the sales has dipped because of scanty rain. But a few farmers are buying seeds, hoping it will rain in December,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal.The situation is not much better among private dealers. ""This season it is only paddy, pulses and tomato seeds, which is not much for us. But this drought, which has lowered the ground water level, is going to bring down seed sales by almost 50% over the next few months, after Pongal ,"" said a representative from Sri Rajalakshmi Agro Services.Many farmers, especially those practising organic farming, say they may give the rabi season a miss. K Marappan, a farmer in Sathyamangalam, has decided not to cultivate for the rest of the year. ""I had been practising organic farming for the past three years, but this year we have had no rain. What is the point of spending on seeds, labour, organic fertilizers and pesticides,"" he said.Despite installing drip irrigation, farmers say they have water problems. ""With many borewells going dry, we are paying electricity bills as high as Rs7,000, to irrigate our lands. We are not even getting water from any of our canals,"" said Madukkarai-based banana and tomato farmer, A Kandasamy.

Shortage of valid currency in rural areas has affected the purchase of tomatoes in the wholesale market, leading to a price crash.Tomato is now fetching farmers as little as Rs 2-3.5 a kg. With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day. The rate prior to demonetisation was between Rs 8 and Rs 9kg. But now with the shortage of the new currency, traders are insisting that farmers accept payment in old notes. And because farmers are refusing, they have slashed prices,"" an official from the market committee said.Farmers said since the auction had been stalled in these market yards for the past one week, they have had to throw a lot of their produce away as they cannot store this perishable item. Babanrao Lahane, a farmer, said he had to throw away 40 crates of tomatoes due to low sales last week. ""I have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 35,000 per acre. I continue to get affected by the low sale price.""Traders said since most of them had accounts in district cooperative banks, it was hard to withdraw cash. So they too are forced to work with old notes. Cooperative banks have been barred from exchanging old notes and are also carrying out limited transactions.Meanwhile, arrival of fresh crop lowered prices further.Abundant supplies are arriving at Vashi APMC market from Nashik. The wholesale rate has dropped from Rs 7-10 per kg a fortnight ago to Rs 5-7. Retail rates have fallen from Rs 15-20 to Rs 10-14 respectively.""Over 45-55 truckloads of good quality tomatoes are arriving daily from Nashik, which seems to be in surplus compared to the demand in the Mumbai metropolitan region. So prices are low and will remain so,"" said trader Balasaheb Badade.Also, since Monday, green peas have been getting cheaper.""Farmers have started harvesting the new crop, causing a drop in rates,"" said Mandar Jadhav , a retailer.Prices of other vegetables are fluctuating on a daily basis by Rs 5-10 a kg.

The Lasalgaon APMC had suspended onion auction for almost eight days, from November 10 to 17, due to cash crunch."

However, she was forced to sell her goods at throwaway prices and discard the remaining, as there were very few customers.Shinde is one of the villagers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch following the demonetisation of big currencies.Madhukarrao Kagale (65), a farmer, said, ""This is the worst time to be a farmer . We have returned to the times when all of us were happy eating zunka bhakar . The only difference this time around is that we have to eat zunka bhakar forcibly and that too once a day.""For Shinde, it was the second consecutive weekly market that disappointed her. ""A few days ago, a bunch of 'methi' would fetch us around Rs 10, but now we are forced to sell it for Rs 3-4. The prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes too have come down to Rs 10 or Rs 20 per kg . We cannot afford to sell in these rates, but there is no other alternative,"" she added.Shanta Sonali, another vegetable vendor, the number of sellers have decreased by at least 30 percent this week. If the same situation prevails, only 40-50 percent might turn up for the weekly bazaar next week, she said.Vishwas Khot, a farmer, said that earlier milk cooperative society gave hard cash, but since the agents and the society is short of cash, the money is being deposited in their accounts at the Kolhapur district bank, which itself is out of cash.""We have money. Believe me, that is not an issue. The fact that we cannot use it or withdraw it is biting hard. We are making our daily sale on credit, but how long can we do that. What are we supposed to do,"" he asked.Rajendra Chougule, another villager, said that in Yalgud village, 75 percent of the residents' accounts are in the district bank. ""We live in a village and that is why at least the grocery shopowner can give us essential goods on credit.""Tukaram Hanbar said banks are giving only Rs 1,000 and that too not regularly. Most of the times, they are out of cash, he added."

Fruit sales, especially those of apples, have gone down by 80%.The sale of vegetables has also taken a hit but not as severely as that of fruits. The retail price of vegetables like potatoes has gone down by about 50% though demand remains more or less constant. As a result, apart from farmers, migrant labourers are hard hit by the sudden turn of events. According to traders, 60% of migrant labourers have returned to their home states.Rajesh Yadav, CEO, Agriculture Produce Marketing Community (APMC), Sahibabad wholesale vegetable and fruit market, said that 1,156 quintals of fruits were sold between November 1 and 8 while between November 15 and 22 the figure nosedived to 390 quintals. ""The same is true in the case of oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava, which saw a dip of about 70% post-demonetisation,"" Yadav said.Rashid Qureshi, manager of MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, said that normally 100 to 125 trucks laden with fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava would come to the Sahibabad mandi but after demonetisation on average only 25 trucks are coming in. ""This being the wedding season our sales should have gone up but demonetisation has upset our applecart and many small traders would take several months to recover from the ongoing shock,"" Qureshi said.MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, one of the biggest wholesale dealers in fruits at the Sahibabad mandi, used to do business worth about Rs 50,000 per day during normal days but, after demonetisation, business has not exceeded beyond Rs 15,000 on any given day, according to Qureshi.As for vegetables, the overall prices have come down Vegetables like potato, onion, cabbage and tomato are still witnessing steady supply,"" Yadav said.""On Tuesday 2,586 quintals of potato found its way into the Sahibabad mandi and the average in the last week roughly comes to around 2,000 quintals a day though the retail price has come done drastically,"" Yadav said.According to Yadav, 1kg of potato before demonetisation came for about Rs 30 but after demonetisation it is now being sold at Rs 15/kg. ""Similarly, cabbage before demonetisation was sold at Rs 20 per kg which has now come down to Rs 4 /kg and tomato has come down to Rs 8/kg from Rs 18/kg,"" Yadav said.Explaining consumer behaviour in the backdrop of demonetisation, said, ""Since there is dearth of cash in the system because of demonetisation, consumers tend to spend only on essential items such as vegetables and they are saving on liquid cash by doing without fruits.

Over the years, the region in Sirmaur district has become known as a place from where men from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab  states with a skewed sex ratio (the number of girls per 1,000 boys)  have found brides.The recent rescue of a woman allegedly abducted for marriage forced the administration to look at a trend described as cross-regional migration of brides. Locals do not like to talk about this, but following the womans rescue, the administration in the regions Shillai area, about 240 km from Shimla, conducted a survey to assess the exodus.The survey conducted across 140 villages revealed that in the last decade nearly 1,100 women from Shillai had married men in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, said Vikas Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Shillai.The report was shocking. A majority of the women were enticed for marriage with the promise of better life, said Shukla. Not all the grooms were youth. He said the Union minister for women and child development, Maneka Gandhi, had sought information on this disturbing trend.Several instances of migrated brides being sent back home, allegedly after facing mental and physical abuse, have caught the administrations eye. Many of these marriages are not registered and solemnised with the chunni-odhna tradition in which a bride and groom tie the knot under a sheet, according to a government official who did not want to be named.Not all women who marry outside are abducted, but the survey has found the enticement is money, a big draw in the region where jobs are few and crop activities are limited to ginger and tomato. Many people from this region make up the workforce in various unorganised sectors across the state. It is generally known that people who come bride hunting either pay her family or purchase land for them. None of the people involved speaks about it, said the government official.Pratap Singh Tomar, convener of the Central Haati Committee, an organisation seeking Scheduled Tribe status for nearly 250,000 people in the trans-Giri region, said, Not all the girls marry for money. They also look for better life. There is so much hardship here. The people in trans-Giri region make up nearly half the population in Sirmaur district.Surinder Rana, head of Millah panchayat in the region, said, We have heard about some families marrying their girls outside for money. I have been trying to discourage this.Incidentally, there have been reports of girls and women of the region being trafficked on the pretext of marriage. Sirmaur police busted an interstate racket two years ago. Three men from Haryana were arrested. Girls had been taken to Haryana on the pretext of finding a match, said Zahur Zaidi, inspector general of police (Law and Order).The survey in Shillai has put the spotlight on the cross-regional migration of brides. Anuradha Thakur, secretary of the states women child welfare department said officials had contacted the Shillai SDM, and the social welfare department was conducting an independent inquiry. We will do whatever is needed so that women and girls dont have to make forced choices, said Thakur."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow.

On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest.

No seed sellers are ready to give seeds on credit.If the situation did not improve, there will 20-25% shortage of vegetables in the market in December, he saidJharkhand is a surplus vegetable production state. The Jharkhand state horticulture mission figures show that the state produces more than 37 lakh metric tonne of vegetables every year but only 30 lakh metric tonne is locally consumed.The state exports more than one million tonne of vegetables to other states every year.Even though farmers are selling their produces at a lower price to whole sellers, price of the perishable commodity in city retail markets is high. The arrival of vegetables from outside the state has partially stabilized prices.The cash-crunch has also hit harvesting of paddy and sowing of Rabi crops, as farmers have to queue outside banks to withdraw money. I did not start harvesting paddy due to the cash shortage. Who will purchase my produce?, said Jeetu Manjhi, a farmer of Ranchis Angarha.We are also struggling to purchase seeds and fertilizers for Rabi crops.Director of state agriculture department Jatashankar Choudhary, said that they are aware of the condition of farmers and discussions are on to ease farmers trouble.

The hangover of the Raj, complete with the traditional Christmas spread, is what draws us to this place. Windamere, actually, is like an old country house, David told HT.For the past few years, we have been staying in Darjeeling for a longer period. We arrive before Christmas-eve and leave only in the first week of January, said Pat.Originally from Kiama, 130 km from Sydney, the Gates first visited Darjeeling in 1991. We had read about Darjeeling and Calcutta while in school. So we decided to explore the places. Thankfully, it was Christmas that year. And we fell in love with the way Windamere celebrated  the carol, the entertainment, the dinner... Since then, we have not celebrated Christmas anywhere else. It is homecoming for us, said Pat.She also appreciated the fact that Darjeeling has done away with the use of plastic carry bags.Over the years, we have befriended so many of this towns folks. We visit them every year. Many of them have passed away while many others have moved on, David said with a touch of nostalgia palpable in his voice.There are many tourists who keep coming back to Windamere but the Gates are special. Shubhana Rai, sales manager at Windamere, said, They have become a part of the Windamere family. We look forward to their visit every year. And yes, we try to keep our Christmas celebrations as authentic as it was way back in 1939.The Christmas menu of 1960, proudly displayed, reads, Hors Doeuveres Varies; Cream of Tomato Soup; Lobster Mayonnaise and Russian Salad; Roast Turkey and Ham Croquette Potatoes, cauliflower and garden peas; Christmas Plum Pudding and Brandy Sauce; Pickled Sardine on Toast; Dessert and Coffee. The menu has remained the same with minor variations, said Rai.We will keep coming back till our health and wealth permit, quipped David."

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November. The supply dipped to an average of 93 quintals per day from November 9 to November 22. The supply of oranges also dipped from an average of 453 quintals per day to an average of 306 quintals per day, after November 8.However, the supply of guava has remained constant, at 220 quintals per day, from November 1 to November 22."

Their endeavour is now supported by rest of the society members.Recycling and caring about environment is almost a habit now. I have been personally segregating waste for more than eight years, Reddy said.The building terrace holds a variety of vegetables, ranging from chillies to tomatoes and herbs such parsley and celery. There are around 55 baskets of 15 different vegetables on the terrace, said Reddy.Other vegetables and herbs such as brinjal, Romanian spinach, mint, lime, basil , rosemary and curry leaves are part of the terrace garden.We are also planning to plant green garlic, cherry tomatoes and other seasonal vegetables during their appropriate seasons, said Manoj Jain, another resident.With all of the 24 households in the society uniting for the cause, it was easy to the experiment, said other residents.Besides planning to add more variety to its terrace garden, the society also has a unique way of making compost. We call it Amrit Mitti. It is a mix of cow urine, cow dung and neem leaves, which adds to the fertility of the soil and helps get a better produce. It also acts as a pesticide, albeit a natural one, said Pappu Mehra, another resident.The residents said, though small, the terrace garden needs total commitment and round the clock care.Commenting on the societys initiative, resident Kevin DSilva said the primary aim was to tackle the waste generated. Handling wastes at individual-level is the need of the hour.Many residents joined the initiative to experience the thrill of home-grown vegetables. Everyone benefits from it. People can consume these vegetables without fear,as they are free of adulteration and chemical fertilizers, said Madhu Reddy, another resident and a committee member.Start Upcycling Now (SUN), a waste management company, helped the society to start on the terrace garden.Mumbai has an awesome climate and has favourable conditions throughout the year.

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

But PM Narendra Modis decision to demonetize Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes has changed it all.After the announcement, the shortage of smaller denomination currency led to a sharp fall in prices of fruits and vegetables. The traders have now asked farmers to not bring their produce owing to the drop in prices and lack of currency.We are stuck in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the vegetable produce in the farm is ready for cutting. But we cant go ahead with it as there is no point taking it to the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Traders say they dont have the cash to purchase our vegetables, said another farmer Madhukar Gogawale, who produces bitter gourd, tomato and bottle gourd on his 14-acre farm.With the halt in supply of money from buyers to farmers, the rural economy has taken a hit.The number of vehicles supplying vegetables to Pune APMC came down by 40% on Tuesday, compared to the previous week, claim sources from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).The problem, farmers feel, may aggravate further with the district central cooperative banks not being allowed to exchange the higher currency by smaller denominations notes. These banks, considered to be the backbone of rural economy, have been barred from carrying out transactions, as many of them have not completed the know-your-customer formalities by taking PAN and other details.In Nashik, many onion growers did not bring their produce to APMCs on Sunday and Monday, as there was not enough cash with traders. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman at APMC, Nashik, said, We have stopped buying onions for the past two days.Our vegetable produce is not getting good price despite demand. Neither can we exchange old currency from the district central cooperative bank, nor can we withdraw money from our accounts. It is a really tough time, said Ramesh Kondhe, another farmer from Khed Shivapur."

Due to cash crunch, the contractor is not able to pay them daily. Things were fine till the old notes were exchanged by banks, but now the labour is hardly getting any wages.Another official said there is no point in letting Pakistani trucks in India. If goods come from Pakistan, there is no labour to unload the trucks, he added.Rajdeep Uppal, president, Confederation of International Chamber of Commerce, said most of the labourers do not have bank accounts and they demand cash. Even those who have accounts dont accept cheques as its not easy to withdraw money from banks these days, he said.Uppal added that the cash crunch has not only affected the labour but also traders. The orders placed by us are still stuck across the border and we are just waiting for the situation to ease.Also, the export from India through the border has also virtually come to a standstill as trucks carrying tomatoes are not getting quarantine import permits from Pakistani authorities due to unknown reasons, traders claimed.Talking to HT, a customs official said, While the import has totally stopped due to cash crunch, only a few trucks carrying cotton are going to Pakistan these days."

He fired a shot from his licensed revolver which hit the brides brother, Rishabh Gupta, and led to his death. Later, the victims family lodged a complaint and named Chauhan in it, said Majhola police station house officer, Neeraj Kumar.Chauhan, a manager with Ravishs firm, fled Moradabad after the incident. He arrived in Ghaziabad early on Saturday morning and checked into Hotel Mahadev at Bajaria near Ghaziabad railway station.Around 1.30pm on Saturday, he ordered food, and later went out for some work in the local market. He returned in the evening and stayed in his room, said a hotel staff member.Chauhans relatives came to the hotel at 11.30pm. When he did not open the room, they informed police.His relatives told us they got a call from him saying he was going to commit suicide. Later, his mobile was switched off, said Ghanta ghar Kotwali officiating station house officer, Brijesh Sharma.By the time his relatives reached the hotel, Chauhan had killed himself, Sharma said.We have recovered three suicide notes and he shot himself in head with his licensed revolver. His relatives also said they tried to convince him to surrender, but he fled Moradabad, said Sharma.In the note on the room wall, Chauhan accused one Rajesh Singh of harassing him. Singh allegedly shot at him seven months ago and harassed him for three months. Chauhan also mentioned Singhs address.The note on the bed sheet said, Mummy, Papa, Sunita (wife), Rohit and Archit (children)... please forgive me as I am leaving you without any support. I cannot see any way as Rajesh Singh has affected my life... Ravi sir (his employer), I am the person who snatched away the happiness in your family... Please forgive me...The third note written on a piece of paper describes the entire incident and about how Rajesh sent a man to threaten him at the wedding.It is my mistake to undertake celebratory firing. But the man sent by Rajesh to threaten me was trying to take away my revolver and it triggered fire... the note said.He also said he was leaving Rs 11,000 and a gold chain to be handed over to his family."

Mera naam Pablo hai, aapka naam kya hain ? Aap kaise ho ? is stated with a self assurance that makes one think that Agular has spent years in the island city. But the reality is that Agular is a chef in transit. But its a reality that his comrade-in-food, entrepreneur and pastry chef Pooja Dhingra is hoping to change. For the few past weeks, Agular and Dhingra have been working round the clock  to launch the Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today.For Dhingra, this is a dream that she has worked hard to make come true. During the past four years or so, Dhingra has been busy trying to find a suitable spot in South Mumbai to launch a caf, and she almost did. We actually started work on a caf in Breach Candy and then it suddenly fell through and never took off, she says. Pablo was here too. I had called him over to help me.Dhingra met Agular nine years ago, where they both were students at Le Cordon Bleu Paris. She says, He did cuisine and I did pastry. But we never really interacted much. He was working in a caf close to school and that is where all of us went after hours to hang out. Dhingra is clearly admiring of Agulars work ethic, He moved to Paris when he was 18 and worked himself through culinary school. He would do a 10-hour shift and come to school and then study. Then go back to cooking and I would ask him, when do you sleep?So, when Dhingra found the dream location for her caf, right on the street where she wanted it, she promptly dialled Agular to make his way to Mumbai. And he did, Right before I came to Bombay, I used to own two restaurants in Paris. And for some personal reasons, I decided to split from my company. I have been working for close to nine years without taking a vacation, explains the half-Hungarian chef. Right now, I am going through this period in my life where I am going to take some time to enjoy and yet keep working. So coming to India was the perfect opportunity to discover new things.While Dhingra was busy tying up the myriad loose ends that go along with a caf launch  Agular made the long trip to Mumbai. Then they started work on a menu. Between the two, Dhingra and Agular might be able to cook up a storm, but for the cafs offerings, simple has been the motto they have stuck to. She explains, This is an extension of what I have always wanted to do. Dessert is my forte and its what I excel at. But food is something that I was completely clueless about. I had an idea of what I wanted at the caf and that is where Pablo comes in. I wanted a very tight menu. At Le15, we do a few things and we do them well. Theres no point in having a 10-page menu.Agular being agreeable to that thought process, has helped Dhingra develop a far-from predictable menu that has sandwiches, salads, soups and four main courses. For the cafs four-plated desserts; the two named them after French women. For someone who is passionate about chocolate, Dhingras favourite dessert from the menu is a non-cocoa dish that they have dubbed Amlie. You can see her excitement shine through when she describes it while beaming, Its a milk cake, raspberry coulis, pepper crumbs with mint.Agular, chimes in, We arent doing anything to just please people but stuff we like. For example, the burrata  I didnt really want it on my menu because everyone is doing burrata nowadays. But Pooja wanted it so much, that we are doing it. And its become one of the favourite dishes during the tastings. Another dish, the duo is excited about is the crispy parmesan waffle, with tomato sauce and a poached egg and then more parmesan on top.The plan is to keep adding on to the menu as the caf settles into a routine, explains Dhingra, For now, its going to be open from 10.30 am to around 7.30-8 pm for the first few weeks. For Agular, it will also be a time to perhaps try out his newly learned Hindi with patrons.Le15 Caf, Shop No. 18, Lansdowne Building, behind Regal Cinema, near Apollo Hotel, opposite Lings Pavilion, Colaba; 9769341994Agular, Dhingra have been working hard to launch Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today"

The 68-year-old AIADMK supremo breathed her last at 11.30pm.Offices and schools shut or closed early and panic buying sent prices soaring as the city virtually shut down, fearing the worst.Earlier in the morning, there was confusion among parents as social media was flooded with messages about a holiday for educational institutions. There was no official government declaration, but a few schools decided not to function.Sishya at Adyar called off classes at 11am, while the management of Sri Sarada Secondary School at Gopalapuram, close to DMK chief M Karunanidhi's residence, asked students of all classes to assemble in foyer after the first period and sent them home.Employees of many companies also began returning home by afternoon. Staff of a few IT firms at Tidel Park were given the choice of leaving early.All this caused traffic jams in many parts. ""There was choc-a-bloc traffic on Sardar Patel Road and instead of taking my car, I opted to walk toward Kotturpuram,"" said Adyar resident Nithya Murugan.While suburban trains, MTC buses and SETC intra-state services functioned normally, inter-state buses from Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were suspended. There was dip in the number of cabs and autos on the roads, while the few available drivers demanded huge sums. ""While it took a long time for me to hail an auto, I had to pay Rs 350 from Aminjikirai to R A Puram,"" said Raj M, a resident.Many theatres, including Luxe Cinemas, remained shut through most parts of the day, while some ran shows only until afternoon. All evening and night shows across SPI screens were cancelled and multiplexes said money would be refunded either online or in person.There were long queues at ATMs throughout the day and grocery stores were crowded. Tomatoes and onions retailed at Rs 40 a kg in many parts as stores cashed in on the fear and panic unleashed by 'statements' from various quarters. Essentials like milk, eggs and bread sold out by evening and many grocers downed shutters. Some stores that remained open till late evening closed down after TV channels broadcast 'breaking news' on the AIADMK chief's health.Online food delivery services were down as restaurants in their network downed shutters due to the prevailing confusion. Nandanam resident V Ramya said hotels in her neighbourhood closed by evening. ""I picked up a few essentials from a nearby departmental store. I hope the situation doesn't turn worse,"" she said.The US Consulate operated with reduced staff and temporarily suspended appointments for routine services to US citizens and visa applicants.

Fearing a shutdown on Tuesday, residents flocked to neighbourhood stores to stock up on rations and motorists queued outside petrol bunks.Until Monday morning, the price of tomato and onion remained stable.Soon after the news spread that the chief minister was very critical, traders at the Koyambedu market raised the tomato prices to 20/kg while onion prices went up to 20/kg. Market advisor to the Koyambedu market traders association R Soundararajan said, ""Panic caused by the announcement created an artificial demand, prompting sellers to hike rates. But the rise was minimal at the market.

Farmers have no other option but to reduce the prices to sell their produce. The prices of greens have fallen by almost 50 per cent since November 20.The prices of cauliflower, tomatoes, potatoes, lemons, brinjals, carrots, bottle gourds etc. range between Rs 2 per kilo and Rs 8 per kilo in the wholesale market, compared to Rs 10 and Rs 50 that prevailed before demonetization. Lemon, which was being sold for Rs 80 per kilogram before November 8, is available for Rs 5 per kilogram in the APMC market.Farmer leader Darshan Nayak told TOI, ""Demonetization has literally broken the back of the farmers. Reserve Bank of India 's (RBI) restriction on the district cooperative banks is to be blamed for the farmers' plight. There is no new currency with the banks and they are unable to provide cash to their account holders, who happen to be farmers. The dealings in APMC are done in cash. The farmers and the farm labourers are facing serious situation. The farmers have started destroying their standing crops as they are unable to bear losses in taking their produce to the APMC and pay to the labourers.""APMC secretary Nilesh Thorat said, ""Farmers want to sell, but the traders want to bargain heavily due to shortage of currency notes. This has led to sharp fall in the prices of greens."""
58e4a155a3d24b525e0eba4f,Demonetization slices vegetable prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Demonetization-slices-vegetable-prices/articleshow/56146460.cms,2016-12-24,,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: After many years, retail vegetable prices in the city have gone down considerably. The plunge can be attributed to the recent decision to demonetize high currency notes that has led to severe cash crunch in the market. Tomatoes, cauliflower and cabbage are being sold at Rs10 per kg in the retail market.Deepak Patel, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, ""There are three reasons for the low prices. First, the winter season is known for plenty of green vegetables. So, there is proper flow of green vegetables in the market. The second reason is cash crunch because of demonetization. People are unable to buy from regular vendors in cash and hotels' demands too are low as there are less customers. The third reason is there is no marriage season in the next one month, leading to low demand.Even though the prices have fallen, the retailers are witnessing lacklustre business because of cash crunch. Hasmukh Vaghela, a retail vegetable vendor in Jamalpur, said, ""Although the prices have fallen, there is no surge in customer numbers because of the note ban.""Most of the vendors are yet to be introduced to digital modes of payment who claim that their daily business has taken a hit. Pallavi, a vendor in Vastrapur, said, ""I am illiterate and I don't know how to use card or anything. I don't understand it. I am not getting enough customers for vegetables. People are asking for credit, but we need some money for our daily bread and butter. Our regular customers have shifted to big shops, as they are facing cash crunch. We try to sell it in wholesale price but still we don't have enough money for food.""M D Patel, 58, who is doing job in ISRO, said, ""The prices of vegetables are low and I prefer to buy them every day in cash. Yes, people are facing cash crunch, but till today, I didn't face any problem as the prices of vegetables are very low.""Even as the retail prices of vegetables like cauliflower have touched Rs10 per kg, the prices of fruits have not been affected much. The prices of bottle guard and brinjal have gone down to Rs20 per kg. While carrot is available at Rs25 per kg, capsicum and peas are available at Rs30 per kg.Unlike some vendors in the city, the 'Sai Vegetable Market' in Vastrapur has backed the government's push for cashless transactions. ""We've made provisions for cashless transactions through Paytm,"" said Giridharilal Malviya , who has been running the store for six years.In Navrangpura, Bhaggaji, who runs a vegetable store, too has started Paytm facility for customers. ""It's been 20 days since I started it. On an average, seven-eight customers buy vegetables through Paytm,"" he said."

Photo: K. VenkateshwarluHANDOUT_E_MAILHow about getting an apartment in an eco-friendly building overlooking the Hudson River and a 13-acre park, while having fresh vegetables and fruits grown on the roof-top at affordable rent?It may look incredible for people with low and moderate incomes in New York, where rented space comes at a premium, but a unique Government private partnership has made this possible, a model that could be replicated in Indian cities.Hunters Point South Living has two buildings with environmentally sustainable features  32-storey Hunters Point South Crossing with 306 apartments and 37-storey Hunters Point South Commons, with 619 apartments in Long Island City. Built on a parcel of post-industrial land, the two buildings were completed last year. The apartments range from studio to three bedrooms, with equal mix of low and moderate income group families selected through a rigorous process, says Luke Falk, Assistant Vice President, Related Companies, that took up the project as part of affordable housing programme. All the lessons we learnt when superstorm Sandy hit New York have been incorporated in these two buildings.All apartments have fittings rivalling high income group housing, that includes dishwasher in the kitchen, while amenities range from lounge with outdoor terrace, tech lounge, fitness centre, childrens playroom. The icing on the cake, of course, is the urban farm on the 14th floor terrace irrigated by a storm water retention tank and pollinated by the bees in the apiary. The vegetables grown include eight varieties of tomatoes, five varieties of peppers, two varieties each of eggplant, radishes, turnip, roots and beets and three varieties of cucumbers. Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries from the fruit basket while the herbs range has chives, cilantro, dill, fennel, lemon verbena, rosemary and three varieties of basil, mint and thyme.The two buildings have silver and gold Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) rating for its green, sustainable, energy-efficient, healthy and cost-effective design features. The residential complex has also won the 2016 ULI NY Excellence in Development Award for best housing project. It has all the conceivable sustainability and resilient features one could think f  from energy efficient lighting to storm resistance, said Charlotte Mathews, Vice President of the Related Companies.The support from the local government and civic authorities include tax credits and subsidies, the details of which Mr. Falk was not prepared to share.But he says such projects are economically feasible and had good future given the difficulties faced by low and moderate income groups in expensive cities like New York where per square foot space could go up to $ 500. We have provided apartments at almost half the rent with all the amenities of high- end apartments.(The author was in the U.S. at the invitation of the U.S. Embassy)"

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows. Some buy a couple of acres just outside the city and head there on weekends. An easy, and popular compromise: rooftop and terrace gardening. A tomatos tastier when you grow it on your own.Mesmerised by pancakes: Food videos became big this year, as they got slicker than ever before. Faintly hypnotic and surprisingly relaxing, they easily sliced across geographical and age barriers. Everyone was watching them, though hardly anyone was actually trying the recipes in real life. Among the most popular videos this year were mozzarella stick onion rings, ice cream churro bowls and pizza puff pastry twists, which got a mind-boggling 159,908,933 views.Single origin everything: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla Local artisan produce got better than ever this year, thanks to determined entrepreneurs and an audience that was willing to not just pay for quality, but also educate themselves.Try The Indian Beans Monkey Bitten Coffee, cultivated in the forests of Andhra Pradeshs Araku Valley. Or Blue Tokais roastery, where they simultaneously grind beans, make cappuccinos and hold workshops.Prefer chocolate? Earth Loaf in Mysore, Mason & Co in Auroville and Pascati are creating gourmet, hand-made, organic, locally-sourced, single-origin, bean-to-bar, proudly desi chocolate (phew).Geeking out on coffee: If youre still using capsules, go sit in a corner with your finger on your lips, and think about the impact on the environment. This was the year of responsible handmade coffee. The AeroPress became popular, as did the Moka pot. Need something trendier? Buy and learn how to use the Chemex, vacuum siphon, bee house dripper or filtron cold brewer.A latte a day: Turmeric lattes, coconut lattes, pumpkin lattes... Mornings got a lot more interesting this year. Turmeric lattes, made with almond milk, fresh turmeric and honey, ruled. For the paleo and keto nuts, it was all about bullet-proof coffee made by whipping together coffee, butter and coconut oil. If youre less intense, try a cold brew coffee with coconut, almond or cashew milk.Soup in light bulbs: Unusual platters ruled. We ate cheese on the lid of a wine barrel. Dessert in a flower pot. Breakfast on a spade. Coffee in a waffle cone.We even saw a burger served on a weighing scale!IN: Gin. Also called vodka for grown ups. Watch out for a pink strawberry version as part of 2017s ginnaissanceOUT: Carb-heavy, creamfilled, decadently sweet desserts. Watch a Tasty video instead. Then eat an apple"

Processing of tomato can be a remedy to the problem of plenty, according to food scientists here.The technologies developed by Mysuru-based Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) on tomato processing can come to the rescue of farmers when tomato prices fall drastically and they are forced to throw their produce.Tomato is sold at Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.5 a kg in the wholesale market/at farm level in the glut season and during the off season, the price shoots up to an extent of Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg at retail level, according to DFRL.The reasons cited for this uncertainty were lack of cooperative marketing, transportation and processing centres close to the areas of production. Tomato processing, especially primary processing in the form of pulp, juice, and chutneys, at farm level can enable value realisation to the growers.DFRL has developed a range of products and processing technologies for tomato utilisation to reduce the post-harvest losses with special focus on progressive farmers, self-help groups (SHGs), and rural enterprises.Importantly, the technologies are farm-friendly and have been developed keeping in view the traditional Indian taste and palate. The products are stable from up to six to nine months when stored in ambient temperature, according to Mallesha, DFRL PRO. The products are ready-to-serve (RTS) or ready-to-prepare (RTP).In a bid to reach out its technologies to farmers and other interested village groups, DFRL, under the rural development programme, along with Spoorthy Janaabhivruddi Samste, recently conducted an awareness programme and a workshop for farmers of Ahalya village, about 35 km from Mysuru, on various tomato processing and products at DFRL.Rakesha Kumar Sharma, Director, DFRL, spoke about the technologies at the workshop, which was attended by farmers and SHG members from in and around the village. DFRL has proposed to adopt a couple of villages, mostly in the tomato-growing belt, and install the technologies there. If others come forward, the technologies can be transferred for a cost, Dr. Mallesha said."

A plate of vada costs Rs. 20 while the combination of vada and curd cost Rs. 25. On any normal day, one has to squeeze to get into the wholesale shopping complex, but these are unusual times.

The dealers have also stopped accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes since Tuesday. The prices of pulses too are going down, he says.With the big notes out of legal tender, the wholesale business in Lalapet area has taken a hit. Wholesale traders say very few customers have turned up to buy goods in bulk during the last week. Most of them do not have access to the electronic mode of accepting debit or credit cards on Point of Sale (PoS) platforms and rely on traditional mode of payment.The sudden decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 have struck a deathblow to small traders. The daily turnover wholesale business in the town is about Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 crore.

The price has remained constant at Rs. 5 during the past few days.A large number of farmers have raised tomatoes in Omalur and the surrounding villages of Theevattipatti, Nadupatti, Kanjanayakkanpatti, Kundukkal, Karuvalli, Thumbipadi, and Kaamalapuram, taking advantage of the abundant rainfall received in the months of July and August.

But eat, you must, for the food is prettier.At one end of the historic Cochin Club, the eatery does not make a big show of itself. But it is not so undramatic at the table. Enter the salt-baked fish, the house special. A little before it arrives, while we are still going at the seafood platter with a clamour of knives, fork and claws, the attendant has quietly set two smaller tables beside the one at which we are seated. Seafood is one of the eaterys mainstays, as is evident from the menu. But not at all the usual fare one would find in Kerala. Not sure? Try the cured anchovies on toast then. It is a brilliant way to use the slim fish, cured in white wine and vinegar for a day, and laid on crunchy buttered toast. The flavour pops in the mouth.In between each dish, there is hectic admiration of the china. Its a mixed set for us, each of us gets a different colour or pattern. The soup has been had, a creamy tomato with basil, that soothes and rejuvenates and kindles instant desire to try at home. Since we dont care much for order, the salad has been had too somewhere in between--a melange of romaine lettuce, feta, prunes and caramelised walnuts that afford much crunch. If you are a bacon fan, you can opt for bacon bits that come in a small white bowl to go with it.The Drawing Room draws much of its ingenuity from the people around, says Sharath Pulimood, one of the partners. So, there are a lot of recipes from friends that are tried out, a few friends make cakes and desserts for the eatery as well. Sharaths mothers tender coconut pudding is something he wants to try out soon. The Drawing Room is the result of a shared passion for food, music and travel between friends Tharun Thomas, Abraham Thomas and Sharath, who had conceived of a performance-worthy venue, which can host plug and plays and basically, curate music along with top class food.The show-stopper has finally arrived. The salt-baked spectacle, which has got the tourists at the next table curious. As we all look on in wonderment, the attendant cracks open the thick crust of the fish and it sends out curly wisps of steam. This dish is all about the fish. This is a brackish water snapper, but we do use the baramundi as well, says Sharath. It is a relief not to have the usual masala in fish, here you can taste the freshness, with just a faint hint of lime and salt. A Spanish recipe, it has worked well here, adds Sharath. The fish is stuffed with herbs and lime and brushed with a mixture of egg whites and sea salt, which forms a thick crust when baked. The fish cooks in its own moisture and is best had with a butter garlic dip and a wacky accompaniment made of kanthari chilli, parsley, white wine, vinegar, olive oil and capsicum.If you are not the dramatic type, the platters are always there with a delicious variety of meat and fish (a lot of shrimp), not to mention the pastas. While you are there, try the teas and the coffees and the juices, each section of which offers variety of some kind, the chefs special tender coconut water and hibiscus, for instance. Dessert is not fanciful, but have the basics in place such as chocolate cake, cheesecake with a few surprises thrown in such as baked date pudding, carrot cake and tender coconut ice cream with sea salt."

I have a line of credit with the moneylender, said Prem Singh Pawar, 64, military-man-and-clerk-turned farmer.About Rs.10,000 is due but that will remain (in our accounts)and well adjust. I have not had a problem with getting wheat seeds. This assertion seems to be borne out by data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture. As of November 11, rabi crop had been sown on 146.85 lakh hectares compared to 126.71 lakh hectares at this time in 2015. Wheat had been sown/transplanted in 25.72 lakh hectares as opposed to 18.65 lakh hectares last year.Palpable crisisBut the crunch of readily-available cash is palpable. In the towns main vegetable market where, apart from fresh produce, seeds, pesticide and fertilizer are traded, private traders are furious. Sales of pesticides and fertilizers are down 50 per cent, said Ashok Gupta, 30, a trader, Nobody is buying anything and our stocks are fast approaching the expiry date. They will be useless in two weeks.Mr. Gupta said his business was heavily dependent on cash, but added that he occasionally deposited some savings in his bank account. This year, he saw customers shifting to the Haryana Seed Development Corporation store  a State-run store three doors away  that was accepting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. We got a call from the Agriculture Department asking us to accept these notes, said Ajit Singh Gulia, who runs the store.But I spend a few hours after lunch everyday to deposit these notes, he said. The State-run store stocks at least eight varieties of wheat and has a steady stream of buyers. Customers who take more than five sacks (roughly 40 kg a sack) and bring old notes must deposit a copy of their photo identity.Definite lullThe vegetable market, meanwhile, was bustling with deals being struck on tomatoes, cauliflower and potatoes, but Inder Prakash Gupta, general secretary of the vegetable traders association, said there was a definite lull.We have long relationships and can handle the lack of money for sometime, the farmer-cum-moneylender told The Hindu, but added that nearly 40 to 50 people were losing about Rs.15 to Rs.20,000 per day."

But in the past, Blumhouse Productions (founded by Jason Blum) has given us great scares in the form of horror series like Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and The Purge. In fact, the company is responsible for The Hush, a 2016 horror thriller film that has an impressive 100 per cent holding on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the company has hit a speed-bump in their successful proceedings. The said obstruction is by the name of Incarnate, perhaps the least scary possession film to ever grace a big screen.Wheelchair-bound Seth Embers (a thoroughly wasted albeit sincere Aaron Echart) can enter the subconscious minds of victims possessed by evil spirits. Hes handicapped after a car accident  caused by an inexplicably vindictive demon  that killed his wife and son. For years, hes been hunting Maggie as the evil entity has come to be known. Now shes taken a young boy hostage  one that looks eerily similar to his own deceased son  and Embers must evict the spirit from the boy. Theres also the Vatican involved in the form of a supremely attractive papal agent Camilla (Catalina Sandino Moreno), an unnecessary addition among many. Oh, and Lindsay, the possessed boys mother is played Game of Thrones Carice van Houten. She so stoic, she barely tears up after witnessing the death of her estranged husband.To say Incarnate is derived is an understatement; there have been countless films with demon possessions. This writer didnt sleep for days after watching the 2005 horror, The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Yet, slumber was oh so sound after Incarnate, in fact perhaps even induced by the film. Lets spell it out in case there was any doubt: this film is a crashing bore.Why Eckhart would deign to waste his talent after being in films like Thank You for Smoking (2006) and Sully (2016) is something we will have to live with forever. Thats not to say the actor is wont of trying in Incarnate. Its just that everything is against him. When a director, in this case Brad Peyton (whose only credit is disaster film San Andreas) hooks you up with the two assistants who look like theyve been ousted from a concert for being too wannabe punk, theres little a protagonist can do.Then theres Embers ability to enter other peoples subconscious, wheres hes got full use of his legs and dressed to the nine, nonetheless. Its all so convenient and cheesy. You see the process is not religious, so it cant be termed exorcism. Embers uses science to evict a spirit from a body with several monitors and medical equipment to trace the movements of the parasite inside a host. Basically, its tripe. Last and definitely not least are those possessed with their black eyes; more amusing than scary.Incarnate has no scares, thrills or chills and a glaring lack of originality. What little gore has been incorporated will be censored. So give it a miss, if you value your time and money."

Whether it was Cinderella or Rapunzel and even Enid Blyton, these characters played on our minds as we drifted off to sleep.Anoothi Vishals life was different. As a two-year-old, she remembers her grandmother narrating recipes to her. Those were her bedtime tales. The first recipe I remember bari ma [grandmother] telling me about was gajar ka halwa, says Vishal. One kilo carrot in two litres of milk, she recalls, and confesses that shes never really tried making that particular dessert. As for the other recipes handed down by her grandmother, Vishal has spent hours trying out and perfecting them. And, the result of those many experiments in the kitchen is her first book  Mrs. LCs Table: Stories about Kayasth Food and Culture.Its a narrative of the rich legacy of the Kayasth community, its history and culinary tradition, peppered generously with anecdotes and 20 recipes. The journalist and author says, I stayed with my grandparents for a few years and there was a lot of emphasis on food. My grandmother, Swaroop Rani Mathur, (fondly known as Mrs LC, after her husbands name Lakshmi Chandra Mathur) taught me table manners. Her table was always so wonderfully laid out. As a result, when I used to come back home from school, I would also want the table laid out well for me.Vishal remembers her 13th birthday where as a young girl she cooked an entire meal for the family, under the guidance of her very regal grandmother. She was a bureaucrats wife, reminisces the author. She gave instructions and orchestrated the meals.The authors gastronomical repertoire includes faux meat dishes created using raw banana, jackfruit; and, believe it or not, dal, to make kaliya and kebab. One such dish, is the raw banana fish  the fruit cut like fish slices and cooked in kasuri methi and ajwain. Theres also the delightful shami kebab which is so soft it could well be a galouti kebab. The trick is in the proportion. According to bari mas recipe, its 125 gm of chana dal and 500 gm of mince mutton, and requires a lot of masala during cooking, says Vishal.Despite the variety of non-vegetarian meals that Mrs LC cooked, she was a vegetarian. Kayasth cuisine is unique and inventive, says the author. The food has Indo-Islamic influences. Bhuna and dum are the two main ways of cooking Kayasth cuisine. The most common ingredients are khada masala, amchur powder, fennel and dried methi. Yoghurt is used as the souring agent, and not tomatoes, she adds. And, what are her favourites? takey paise, yakhni pulao and pasande.Mrs. LCs Table took Vishal two years to complete. Since her book is based on Kayasth food, she often gets asked should food not bind instead of marking separate identities? To that, she says: You cant write on the history of food without going into sociology.Mrs. LCs Table: Stories about Kayasth Food and Culture, Hachette India is priced at Rs 350"

Bonda tribals, whose number is around 6,000, live in remote and isolated hilly region in the northwest of Machhkund river. Their remote habitat in Mudulipada and Andrahal panchayats of Khairaput block is called Bonda valley. They have till date tried to preserve their ancient culture and tradition.Demonetisation has also affected lives of Bondas. During past years, efforts of administration and Bonda Development Agency (BDA) have brought in changes related to life and livelihood of these primitive tribals. Bondas had left behind their barter system of transaction and started using currency. According to sources, they store their currency notes, especially the ones of higher denomination, inside small tubular caskets made of bamboo. For their regular needs as well as to sell their forest produce, they travel around 14 kms to reach Khairaput market. They had been using mostly 500 and 1000 rupee notes that they were getting from traders for their cashew produce.After demonetisation, Bonda tribals are facing some problem while making transactions in the Khairaput market. The old 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not accepted in the market. Thus they are now resorting to barter system. They are exchanging their tomatoes for salt or medicinal herbs for biscuit.But along with it, they have also started to stand in queue in front of branches of State Bank of India (SBI) and Utkal Gramin Bank (UGB) at Khairaput to exchange their old currency notes or to get them deposited in their accounts.When contacted, BDS project leader Manga Panna said after the demonetisation process, awareness of banking has increased among Bonda tribals. They have now realised that banks can be the safest place for savings, he added.Mr Panna accepted that out of compulsion some Bondas are also resorting to barter system at Khairaput market. According to him link of Bondas will increase further once the proposed branch of SBI comes up at Mudulipada. According to him, a large number of Bonda families have bank accounts. Speaking to The Hindu , Malkangiri Collector, K.Sudarshan Chakravarthy said 83 per cent of populace in the tribal-dominated Malkangiri district have Aadhar cards. It includes the Bonda tribals."

Instead, they have to pay their way through, with the policemen on watch at the check-post allegedly demanding anywhere between Rs. 20 and Rs. 50 as toll to let the tourists vehicles in.A bus driver from Karnataka told The Hindu that the cops demanded Rs.100 from him to let two buses into the district. If we refuse, they make us wait for 45 minutes to one hour, till the driver relents and pays up, said the driver who did not wish to reveal his identity. I travel to The Nilgiris quite regularly, and its [paying money at the check-post] a regular occurrence. The police in Karnataka do not extort money from Tamil tourists like this, said the driver.The allegation is that the toll collection from cars, private buses and trucks involves most of the policemen at the check-post.A couple of locals also help them out by collecting the money at a spot that is covered by CCTC surveillance, so that the policemen do not get videographed.Even vegetable trucks are not spared. A share of the consignment of tomatoes, onions and other produce is demanded and taken.The Nilgiris District Superintendent of Police Murali Rambha said he would review the evidence against the policemen at the check-post and take immediate action."

As a result, Vizagites are fast turning into kitchen gardeners. If you have always wanted to grow your own food but lack the expertise to do so, there are many options available.Making the dream of creating blooming kitchen gardens come true, city based startup Your Prosperity is offering door-to-door services by planning, designing and providing regular technical assistance in growing a green space organically.Founded by Karthik Chimata, the startup is already in the process of creating rooftop gardens in 10 houses and apartments in the past two months since its inception. Our main thrust is on organically grown vegetables. There are a lot of information and groups who give tips on creating kitchen or rooftop gardens. However, not many are able to maintain a garden for long or lack the basic skills to start a small green space at home. Our idea was to help create a lifestyle where people can grow fresh organic vegetables on their own and improve the familys health chart, Karthik told The Hindu .His team has six members that include nutritional health coach Sangeeta Muddapu and two natural farming promoters. With an initial investment of Rs 4 lakh, the startup has also started a 500 square yard vegetable nursery near Simhachalam which has varieties of vegetables like tomato, green chilly, ladys finger, bitter gourd among others. They provide services from Duvvada to Tagarapuvalasa with customised assistance on kitchen gardens. Green vegetables grow well in rooftop gardens. However, native vegetables require initial support for 15-20 days. We get the grown vegetables from our nursery to the gardens, said Karthik. The startup also provides round-the-clock assistance in pest management by natural methods. You can contact the startup at 7660938918.When Cyclone Hudhud jolted the citys greenscape in October 2014, Varma Datla and Rambabu Karri got together to create the Facebook group Rythu Mitra for reviving the citys green cover by spreading awareness about home and rooftop gardens. The group today has over 10,000 members from across India which includes 40 NRIs while half the group members hail from the farming community in and around Visakhapatnam.We provide training for terrace, ground and home gardening and also give assistance to farmers who are interested in growing vegetables organically, said Rambabu Karri, one of the group administrators. This apart, Rythu Mithra also provides assistance on utilisation of kitchen wastes to create organic manure. Other city organisations that are working towards creating a green awareness are Paryavarana Margadarsi Vaisakhi (vsp.paryavaran@gmailcom) and Green Face giving tips and assistance for rooftop and kitchen gardens to produce organic vegetables."

I have a line of credit with the moneylender, said Prem Singh Pawar, 64, military-man-and-clerk-turned farmer.About Rs.10,000 is due but that will remain (in our accounts)and well adjust. I have not had a problem with getting wheat seeds. This assertion seems to be borne out by data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture. As of November 11, rabi crop had been sown on 146.85 lakh hectares compared to 126.71 lakh hectares at this time in 2015. Wheat had been sown/transplanted in 25.72 lakh hectares as opposed to 18.65 lakh hectares last year.Palpable crisisBut the crunch of readily-available cash is palpable.

Sales of pesticides and fertilizers are down 50 per cent, said Ashok Gupta, 30, a trader, Nobody is buying anything and our stocks are fast approaching the expiry date. They will be useless in two weeks.Mr. Gupta said his business was heavily dependent on cash, but added that he occasionally deposited some savings in his bank account. This year, he saw customers shifting to the Haryana Seed Development Corporation store  a State-run store three doors away  that was accepting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. We got a call from the Agriculture Department asking us to accept these notes, said Ajit Singh Gulia, who runs the store.But I spend a few hours after lunch everyday to deposit these notes, he said. The State-run store stocks at least eight varieties of wheat and has a steady stream of buyers. Customers who take more than five sacks (roughly 40 kg a sack) and bring old notes must deposit a copy of their photo identity.Definite lullThe vegetable market, meanwhile, was bustling with deals being struck on tomatoes, cauliflower and potatoes, but Inder Prakash Gupta, general secretary of the vegetable traders association, said there was a definite lull.We have long relationships and can handle the lack of money for sometime, the farmer-cum-moneylender told The Hindu , but added that nearly 40 to 50 people were losing about Rs.15 to Rs.20,000 per day.Private traders in the towns vegetable market, where seeds, pesticide and fertilizer are traded, are upset"

In 2014, the government announced that 15 centres would be opened in Visakhapatnam, 10 in Guntur and five each at Tirupati and Anantapur in phase- I. The fact remains that the officials are still studying various models to roll out more canteens across the State. There is no consensus on the food items to dish out to the people.While there is a proposal to serve lunch with all dishes such as curry, chutney and sambar, the officials negate it saying different types of ricesambar rice, tamarind rice and curd rice-- could be served at these canteens. The GoM is, now, also mulling over a proposal to provide region-specific food at the NTR Canteens. The officials would have to study the food preferences of people in the State. It takes back the issue to square one and a Group of Ministers (GoM) on Anna canteens, subsequently, has decided to study the models in Telangana and Tamil Nadu again.A high-powered delegation headed by Civil Supplies Minister Paritala Sunitha already visited Chennai along with a team in 2014 to study how these canteens, taken up by the Jayalalithaa Government in Tamil Nadu function. The delegation studied whether these could be replicated in AP. The officials also studied the model followed in neighbouring Telangana State.The government had planned to initially provide subsidised food to around 1 lakh people in the first phase. The officials are now scouting for places which are labour intensive saying that the government target was to reach out the labourers. We are planning to start 100 canteens at places such as Visakhapatnam, Nellimara, Rajam, Tirupati, SRikakulam, Anantapur, Hindupur, Kurnool and Kakinada shortly, says Ms. Sunitha. The government also plans to supply region-specific food at these canteens. A proposal to provide full meals is also on cards. We are exploring all the options, she adds.The menuThey (the canteens) are modelled on the lines of Amma Canteens that gained immense popularity in Tamil Nadu. An idly costs just Re.1 in Anna Canteens. Two hundred grams of pongal and an equal quantity of tomato bath costs Rs.5 each. Two hundred grams of sambar rice, pulihora (tamarind rice) and vegetable rice costs Rs.5 each, and 150 grams of curd rice costs Rs.3.There was an overwhelming response to the Velagapudi canteen. Not less than700 people visit the canteen every day. About 500 people have meals there. The government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 4.38 lakh as against total expenses of Rs. 7 lakh per month, she explains."

Many tomato growers have left their yield to rot in their farms as they are not sure of getting back even a portion of their investment. And many of those who do go to the market carrying vegetables return without recovering even the transportation cost.Mithun of Hosahalli in Salagame hobli, Hassan, has grown tomatoes on 17 guntas of land owned by his father, Shivappa. He stopped marketing the harvest when the price of tomato went below Rs. 30 for a 15-kg bag. I have left the tomato plants in the field unattended to and have also let cattle into the farm. What else can I do when I am not sure of getting back even what I spent on harvesting? he asked.Tomato growers require at least six workers to harvest 100 packs (each of 15 kg) a day. The payment to the workers comes up to around Rs. 1,500. If my product is sold at Rs. 20 or 30 a pack, I will not be left with any cash. After deducting 10 per cent commission for middleman and the transportation cost of Rs. 500, I will have nothing left, he said.Tomato growers expect at least Rs. 100 a bag, considering their investment. Last month, they were earning up to Rs. 150 a bag.But now, merchants in the market do not have cash in hand. They are not purchasing vegetables in the amounts they did earlier and are also offering lower prices. Meanwhile, farmers are forced to sell their produce at the rates offered as they cannot take the vegetables back.Ganesh of Narasipura grows many vegetables, including tomato, beans, ridge gourd and capsicum. On at least three days a week, he carries vegetables to the market in Hassan. A kilogram of beans was sold for Rs. 25 last month. Now, it has come down to Rs. 8, he said.He says his income is down by Rs. 25,000 a week.

The restaurant is such a draw that visitors to the Capitol are advised to head a few blocks west for lunch at Mitsitam.The chef, a member of the Navajo tribe, sees the restaurant as a resource for helping people see food in new ways while reminding them that the foundation of their diets  corn and beans and tomatoes  is a legacy of native growers.Native culture has always been viewed as a romantic culture, like this lost thing where everything is comic and cute, he said.Genuine representationMr. Bitsoies challenge in presenting American Indian cuisine is specific and far-reaching: There are more than 500 federally recognised tribes across 34 states, according to the National Congress of American Indians.Mr. Bitsoie said he had found a lot of discrepancies in how people were presenting native cuisine, and I thought it was being represented very unfairly.

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

It is week three since demonetisation. And at Rayakottai tomato mandi, it is business as usual  seemingly uninterrupted by demonetisation.But, for the tomato growers, there is a major concern. The price of tomatoes has seen a drastic fall over the past month, even before demonetisation was announced. The reason being an oversupply of the vegetable, left undisturbed by the failed annual monsoons around this time. Last year this time, when the State reeled under the deluge, tomato growers of Rayakottai saw a bumper price for their produce. Their produce was auctioned between Rs.700 a box (23 kg. per box) to Rs.1,500 a box then. The rainfall had affected the quality of the produce in most fields, and the resultant supply. This in turn saw a spurt in the demand for tomatoes vis a vis a fall in the supply.However this year, with the failure of monsoon, there has been an oversupply of tomatoes from all the fields. Today, a box of tomato is auctioned for Rs.180, says Shanmugam, owner of Saravanan tomato mandi in Rayakottai. That would be Rs.7.80 per kg. the mandi. So are the prices for cauliflowers, says Shanmugam.A bag consisting of 20 quality cauliflowers are being auctioned at Rs.180 per bag. An ideal price for a farmer growing cauliflower would be Rs.300 per bag, because that would just about meet the cost of production for the farmer, says Shanmugam. Rainfall affects shelf life of the vegetables, and offsets the oversupply. But this time, there was no rain, and the price of vegetables has fallen, explains Shanmugam.Sitting behind the counter, Shanmugam, had just finished the auctions and was making payments to the farmers. He had refused a wad of notes of Rs.500. Few notes are accepted, but not in bulk, he says.For the farmers, the sharp pinch felt from the fall of price for tomatoes was only intensified by demonetisation. Most of the fields growing the70-day tomato crop are in the midst of harvesting. Here demonetisation has affected the farmers.The sack, the rope, the tempo rental from the field to the mandi all adds up to Rs.300 per bag for Cauliflowers. But now, its going for Rs.180 per bag, says Marappa, who managed to exchange his Rs.500 note for Rs.400 over the past two weeks. He pitches in with his workers on his tomato field, and cannot lose out a day on the field, waiting outside the bank.Until now, the mandi has been operating on old notes to the extent possible, palming off the burden of currency exchange and deposit on the farmers, who come to auction off their produce. The last two weeks, we could withdraw up to Rs.20,000 per week, but my daily requirement will be Rs.3.5 lakh. The real worry, however, is after December 15, when we will completely stop accepting Rs.500s, he says. The mandis had not been accepting Rs.1,000 anyway, since November 9."

That situation may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the latest technologies in drying and preserving fruits and vegetables.All it takes is to cut open a packet of three-month-old dried vegetables and soak them in water for a while before cooking, all without leaving the comfort of the house.Scientists at the CSIR National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology here have developed an energy-efficient technology for drying a range of fruits and vegetables for preservation. Named Refrigeration Adsorption Dehumidification Drying (RADD), the process involves drying the material under controlled temperature and uniform distribution of air to retain the properties and nutrients. The method is cost-effective and dries faster.According to P. Nisha, scientist, Agro Processing and Natural Products division, NIIST, fruits and vegetables dried using the RADD method were found to have a shelf life ranging from three months to one year. Dr. Nisha said the dried product retained its qualities. NIIST has already transferred the technology for drying spices like nutmeg and cardamom.Packets of spinach, bitter gourd, cucumber, pineapple, banana, cardamom and nutmeg dried using the RADD method are on show at the expo organised in connection with the workshop on agro processing and value addition which began at the Kanakakkunu Palace grounds Thursday.Value added products made from coconut and jackfruit are the highlights of the expo.

Sitting on a choupal and sipping afternoon tea, the septuagenarian recalls how his village was full of trees, rivulets with crystal clear water, the scent of fruits and millets that his father grew on the family farm and of the labourers who carried him on their shoulders.I clearly remember that neither my father nor my grandfather paid them any cash. They would come to the fields at sunrise, have breakfast and lunch with us and leave home in the evening, carrying bundles of hay for their cows and bags of grain for their children, he said. But, by the time Mr. Bhalke grew up to take control of his farm, the system of barter had changed form. Only a part of the payment was paid in grain while the labourers demanded the rest in cash. I have been giving away less grain and more cash for nearly 50 years now. But the cash crunch arising out of demonetisation has changed all that, he said. Barter system has returned to Hulyal. It might be the same in every village in the country, he feels.Usually, labourers seek money in cash as only a few of them have bank accounts. But now, due to the confusion about the currency crisis, the labourers dont want to take a chance with notes. They are insisting that we give them grain. What is more, farmers have no money as the agriculture commission agents in the mandi are buying their produce with the new currency, he said. Does he think barter is good? It depends. Sometimes, it is good for the farmers and sometimes for the labourers and may be sometimes both of us benefit, Mr. Bhalke said.When grain prices are low, barter is good for farmers. And when the grain prices are high, barter is good for labourers. But now that I do not have money but I need to sow jowar in the rabi season. I have to pay labourers in soya and invite them to work on my farm. That is not only essential, but also beneficial for us, he said.Mangalabi, his wife, who oversees the work on the familys 15-acre farm, says the format and quantum of the barter system has changed. Earlier, the labourers would take only the staple grain like jowar or soya. But now, we are giving them soya, tomatoes, chillis, milk, oil, salt and even soap, she said. The asking rate for barter in the village is 2.5 quintals of soya for harvesting 10 quintals on around three acres of land.Rajendra Pawar, a farm labourer from Lal Singh tanda near Ekamba, says he has brought home some soya and some black gram as wages. My mother uses black gram for making items like mixed flour rotis, curry, papad, and dosa. But there is a problem with soya. We need to sell it to get some money for daily expenses. But the buyers in the mandi are not giving us cash right away. They are asking us to wait. Barter is not very helpful in that way, he said. Secondly, how do I pay my childs school fees, by giving soya to the teacher?, Mr. Pawar asks with a loud laugh.There exists a barter system, though slightly different, for carrying grain from the field to the village. Vithal Shilke, of Jamalpur who owns a herd of donkeys, is loading soya bags of 80 kg on the back of each of his donkeys to take them to the farmers house. For this, he gets to take home two kg of soya per donkey. I sell that grain and make around Rs. 3,000 per donkey per month, he said. Demonetisation has helped him bargain for half a kg more for each donkey. But some farmers agree to pay while some shout at us and ask whose grain shall I carry next kharif, Mr. Shilke said, adding, In those cases, I agree to the old rate and go ahead with my work."

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, said both wholesale and retail vegetable dealers were facing losses since demonetisation of the two high value currencies. Vegetable markets are yet to bounce back from the effect, he said.The rates of vegetables have dipped by 5 to 6 per cent in the last few weeks. Business has gone down by nearly 50 per cent. At least half of the stock of vegetables is going waste with no takers. Many vendors have been forced to dump the vegetables as they perish quickly, he said.He added that people did not have money, and hence, the markets were dull with no business. Until a few days ago, we were accepting the old Rs. 500 notes from customers, while we were accepting the old Rs. 1,000 till last week. We have stopped accepting these notes as we do not have change to give in return, Mr. Balu added.The cost of tomatoes is Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 a kg while onions are priced between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15 (fresh onions) while the old onions are priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20. Small onions cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 while potatoes cost Rs. 20.The cost of other vegetables (per kilo): ladys finger  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, drumstick  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, brinjal  Rs. 15 to Rs. 30, cabbage  Rs. 10, carrot  Rs. 15, beans  Rs. 12, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, ginger  Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, broad beans  Rs. 20, bitter gourd  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, snake gourd  Rs. 12, yam  Rs. 20, peas  Rs. 80, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 15."

Shops and business establishments were open. Though there was an apprehension among a section of traders on opening the shops on account of official mourning that would continue till Thursday, some traders opened the shutters as usual. Following this, others also resumed their business.Similarly, hotels, restaurants, eateries which had downed shutters on Tuesday as a mark of respect to the late leader, resumed their business as usual. Cinema halls resumed the shows from afternoon.The Gandhi Market that attracts traders from Tiruchi and nearby areas resumed its activities with the arrival of vegetables from villages. However, the arrival was less than the usual, traders said.The market will witness optimum business from Thursday as loads from far away places and neighbouring States will reach Tiruchi on Wednesday night, a wholesale merchant of tomato said.Normality returned to the Tiruchi Bus Stand, which wore a deserted look on Monday and Tuesday, with the operation of State owned Transport Corporations and private buses. The long distance buses bound for Chennai, Tiruvananthapuram, Coimbatore and other destinations were operated as usual. Similarly, city buses were on roads. However, the occupancy rate in the long distance buses was said to be less than the normal days.Reports from Karur, Ariyalur and Perambalur said that normality had retuned in most of the towns and rural areas. Though the cadres of AIADMK and the people were yet to come out of grief, sorrow and shock over the death of Jayalalithaa, traders and merchants slowly opened their business houses. Most of the textile and mosquito net manufacturing units too resumed their operation as usual on Wednesday.To stay away from courtsThe Tiruchi Bar Association on Wednesday resolved to abstain from attending courts for three days as a mark of respect to the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. A resolution to that effect was passed unanimously at its special meeting.V. Srinivasan, president, and J. Mathiazhagan, secretary, were present. Over 700 advocates attended the meeting. Stating that the death of Jayalalithaa was an irreparable loss to the country, particularly Tamil Nadu, the resolution said that the advocates would not attend courts till Friday as a mark of tribute to her. Earlier, they paid floral tribute to the late leader. They also observed two-minute silence.ThanjavurThe AIADMK cadre and the public displayed enormous resilience in the aftermath of the demise of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa testified by the sombre mood and absence of any untoward incident from any part of the region on Wednesday. Though most people are in grief, normality slowly returned to the delta districts.Most of the shops and trading establishments reopened on Wednesday while fuel stations too started dispensing supplies to motorists. The TNSTC resumed operations but on a vastly reduced scale as the movement of passengers and commuters was dull. Holiday for educational institutions was one reason for the lean movement of passengers, sources said.Meanwhile, people and AIADMK cadre continued to glorify Jayalalithaa, adorning her portraits with flowers in major street corners and in almost all villages in the region. At Koviladi, around 15 cadre tonsured their heads and took bath in the Cauvery. Amma was all for us and we feel orphaned by her death. So we decided to undertake the rituals, normally done in the event of death of their own mother, Sundaram, one among the cadre, said. At Sengipatti nine cadre tonsured their heads as a mark of respect to the departed leader.Thanjavur Kamaraj Market Vegetable and Fruit Vendors Association took out a candle light procession led by association president Dharmaraj.

PeriasamyM_PERIASAMYCome Monday, the Coimbatore Corporation will turn its attention towards the Thudiyalur weekly market to stop the use of plastic bags.The civic body was supposed to have taken up the work on December 5 but due to the sudden turn of events in the State, the civic body would start the work on December 12. It had displayed notices warning traders and customers and also held meetings with the former in this regard a couple of weeks ago. Therefore, the move would not catch the two by surprise, said sources.The reason the civic body focussed on the weekly market was that the volume of plastic bags that changed hands was quite high. The estimate was over 50,000 but this was only a conservative figure. Sometimes, it could be as high as over a lakh bags, they said.S. Suresh, who collects cess from traders at the market, said the number of traders could vary from 1,000 to nearly 2,000. Assuming that each trader sold goods to 50 to 100 customers, they would have used 50,000 to a lakh bags.The traders, who begin business around 11 a.m. and wind up by 10 p.m., sell vegetables, greens, groceries, snacks, footwear, farm implements and clothes. But most sell vegetables and they use plastic bags, he added.By focussing on the weekly market, the Corporation would be able to bring around a significant change, for it would be able to work with a number of traders and customers at a venue. Plus, when the traders move to other weekly markets, there would be changes there too, however small, the sources said.What the Corporation was attempting to do was welcome but it should go beyond initiating penal action against traders packing goods in plastic bags. It should provide an alternative and that should be a workable alternative, said K. Senthilkumar, who sold puffed rice.How could I sell puffed rice in paper bags or cloth bags. Will it remain crisp and moisture-free, he asked and suggested that there should be reasonable exceptions.Vegetable vendor V. Rangaraj said that selling vegetables without plastic bags was not difficult but customers, especially while buying tomatoes, insisted that the traders provided plastic bags.To bring about a total change, the Corporation should also penalise customers, he suggested.Former Councillor of the area V. Vathsala said that Corporations drive to ban use of plastic bags in the market on Mondays needed to be welcomed. But the civic body should do more for the market.The traders and buyers did not have public convenience facility.The vendors resorted to open urination and defecation and that too not far from where they sold goods. To improve the hygiene, the Corporation should build toilets and also platforms for them to sell their goods.Plus, the Corporation should strengthen the conservancy work there, especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays because after the traders vacated the market, cattle went there to feed on vegetable waste and their dung added to the sanitation problem.She had raised the issue several times. A comprehensive solution would be in order, Ms. Vathsala added."

Not only Chatoi, many other traders at the mandi are facing problems in arranging smaller currency notes even after almost one month of the demonetisation. Most of the traders have to depend on the cash collected from the daily sale of their products to make payments to labourers and meet other expenses. The cash crunch has adversely affected the overall business transactions of the traders at Chatra Bazaar by almost 30 per cent in the past one month. ""Though most of the traders here have started to make payments through cheques to their counterparts in neighbouring states, we are facing problems as we have to make daily payments to the labourers in smaller currency notes, which are not readily available,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi also claimed that the closure of banks for three consecutive days also had led to shortage of cash as most of the ATMs also ran dry till late in the afternoon today. ""I could not make payments to my staff and labourers as I had withdrawn cash for the last time on Friday. The retail traders are also making payments to us in new Rs 2,000 currencies. The situation at the market is unlikely to improve till supply of Rs 500 notes are not increased along with the weekly withdrawal cap of Rs 24,000 per week,"" Chatoi added. Around 5,000 people comprising wholesale, retail traders, middlemen, farmers and labourers are directly involved in the daily fruits and vegetable trade at Chatra bazaar that caters to the bulk of the vegetable requirement not only for the people of Cuttack but for nearby cities also. Chatra bazaar usually registers a daily business to the tune of Rs 2 to 3 crore and 50 to 60 trucks are engaged in transportation of goods to other parts of the state. Now, only 25 to 35 trucks are arriving on a daily basis here. ""There was sharp fall in the booking of stocks from neighbouring states, including Andhra Pradesh and Bengal, during initial period of the demonetisation. However, the situation has improved considerably in the past one week,"" said Kedarnath Lenka, another trader. Lenka said that a truck full of vegetables from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh costs nearly Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000 per trip, while daily payments to labourers vary from Rs 2,000 to 3, 500 per day, including some cash payment to drivers. Earlier, all the traders used to make payments in cash through the drivers arriving from various states with commodities. A senior member of the Chatra Bazaar traders association, Devendra Sahu said despite the financial crisis, there had been no hike in the prices of vegetables in the past one month due to good harvest and production of locally produces from Athgarh, Banki and other nearby areas in the district. ""The retail traders are now depending on the vegetables such as cauliflower, cucumber, tomatoes, brinjals grown by farmers of nearby areas to meet the requirements. As a result, there is no pressure on wholesale traders for bulk import of such vegetables which are perishable items from the neighbouring states,"" said Sahu. Traders at Chatra Bazaar mostly imports tomatoes, peas, coconuts, pumpkin, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits including apple, orange and grapes from neighbouring states, including Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharastra."

Picture by Hardeep Singh For once, nature's bounty has become a bane for farmers and boon for homemakers in Ranchi. Surplus yield of tomatoes in these demonetised times is forcing farmers of Bero, Mandar and Pithoria to sell their juicy produce at throwaway prices in the capital. The culinary vegetable (botanically, a fruit) is available for as low as Rs 4 per kg in wholesale markets while the retail price has plummeted from Rs 18-20 a kg a month ago to Rs 8-10 a kg now because of a grave supply-demand mismatch triggered by cash crunch in the market. In Jharkhand, tomatoes are grown in the vegetable belts of Ranchi, Lohardaga, Hazaribagh and Chaibasa. According to K.K. Jha, a horticultural scientist at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Kanke, the total tomato yield is around 13.5 lakh metric tonnes this year against 11 lakh metric tonnes last time. ""Production is surplus, but the demand in market is limited because people are rationing their kitchen needs because of the cash crisis. Farmers have little choice but to sell their produce at throwaway rates because tomato is a perishable item,"" Jha explained how demonetisation had altered market dynamics. Vinod Kumar, a vegetable vendor at Lalpur market, said he had stocked five quintals from the wholesale haat of Makhmandro near Pandra. ""Farmers are selling tomatoes at Rs 4 a kg. They don't have easy access to banks and are in dire need of cash to run their families. The bumper crop has made their labour dirt cheap,"" Vinod said, adding that he was extending the price advantage to his buyers. ""For the past week, I am selling tomatoes at Rs 8-10 a kilo, half the usual rate."" Vijay Gupta, another vendor in Lalpur, said 50 trucks of tomatoes arrived at Makhmandro haat every day, but at least 10 trucks were surplus. ""Farmers have been hit bad. They cannot stock tomatoes on their own and hence, are selling their produce to middlemen too at very low prices,"" Gupta said. Namita Singh, a resident of Circular Road, said she was thrilled to buy 5kg tomatoes for just Rs 50. ""The best part is I spent five Rs 10 coins on the purchase. My purse is lighter for good. Tomatoes add great taste to every curry, especially in winter,"" she beamed."

Jhode says the prices have fallen from Rs 15 to Rs 10 a kg in the wake of the demonetisation move Nagpur/Wardha, Nov. 21: Bandu Ghormade had no choice but to accept the old Rs 500 notes from the procurement agent and a lower price: Rs 200 less for every 40kg crate of his freshly harvested eggplants. ""If I didn't, my produce would have gone waste,"" said the farmer in his late 40s who grows carrots, spinach, eggplants and okra in Chicholi, about 50km from Nagpur. ""Those who grow grains or cotton can hold on to their crop; I can't."" For years, Ghormade would load four quintals (400kg) of vegetables on his tempo every morning from October to December and drive to Nagpur's state-run Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi, where licensed traders buy farmers' produce through agents. Since November 8, when high-value notes were demonetised, Ghormade has been selling at a loss at the mandi every day while his son is going to the nearest bank, 5km away, to stand in queue and deposit the notes. Still, Ghormade is earning something because he is ready to accept the old notes. Some farmers, also with perishable produce, are not - and are taking terrible losses. Many farmers have junked their vegetables in the absence of buyers at markets in Thane and Pune, newspaper reports suggest. At the Hiwarkhed village market in Amaravati, about 160km from Nagpur, orange growers have dumped mounds of the fruit on the roads in protest at a sharp fall in prices. The prices have fallen because the traders have stopped buying. The traders aren't buying because most farmers aren't accepting the old notes. So, is the farmers' plight solely an inevitable consequence of a poorly planned demonetisation, or are they shooting themselves in the foot by insisting on payments in usable cash? Sudam Pawar, 38, was the lone farmer at the mandi in Selu town in Wardha district, about 70km from Nagpur, selling his nine quintals of cotton on Wednesday. The trader offered to transfer the money directly into his bank account. Pawar, former sarpanch of Aamgaon village, agreed. The money got transferred immediately, without any hassles. Later that day, Pawar said, eight more farmers known to him sold about 80 quintals of cotton at the mandi, accepting the old notes. With hardly any other arrivals, the trader bought their cotton at Rs 5,000 a quintal - a little more than the market price of Rs 4,750-4,900. So, why are more farmers not following their example? Pawar explained the point. Most farmers are afraid to put their earnings in their bank accounts because these are in the same banks from where they have taken crop loans. A majority are long-term defaulters because, for years, they haven't earned enough to repay their loans as well as sustain their families. Once their earnings go into their accounts, they fear the banks will discourage withdrawals, pressuring them to leave a balance equal to the sum they would need to repay by March to settle their loans. Most farmers know that this would leave them in serious jeopardy. There's no government order asking the banks to unilaterally deduct the loan repayment from the farmers' accounts, but the banks have used pressure tactics in the past, knowing well that the farmers cannot afford to annoy them because they would need a loan the following year too. ""I could accept the money transfer because I don't have a loan in my name, nor do I need cash urgently,"" Pawar said. ""Our crop loan is linked to my father's account, so the bank cannot deduct the repayment amount from my account."" Nor were the other eight sellers at the mandi in any urgent need of cash, he said. ""But most small farmers, who do sustenance farming and have no other income, won't accept cheques or money transfers."" ""Demonetisation has wrecked the farmers,"" said Ramkrishna Umathe, farmer and deputy chairman of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandi at Selu, which serves about 100 mainly soybean and cotton-growing villages. ""For about a week, sellers and buyers have virtually deserted our market."" So the coolies, transporters and other ancillaries too have been without work, assistant market secretary Mahendra Bhandarkar said. ""This is the time of year for brisk sales but the arrivals have tanked since November 8,"" Umathe said on Wednesday. From 5,000 quintals a day, the arrivals had dropped to zero, he said. ""Yesterday, 100 sacks (quintals) came."" Umathe said the traders were offering cheques and money transfers but the farmers weren't ready to accept these lest the banks ""deduct the crop loan"". ""Most fields are un-irrigated here; the farmers are already under a lot of financial stress. They have to repay hand loans and the cost of inputs taken on credit, and pay their grocers and farm hands,"" Umathe said. ""If there's some residual money, it gets deposited into the bank - else the bank loans remain unpaid."" Sales - and prices - of produce are falling for another reason too: a drop in consumption in the retail markets. ""Forward movements have been affected,"" said Rajesh Thakar, a wholesale tomato trader in Nashik. For instance, orange arrivals at the Nagpur mandi have dried up because of a demonetisation-driven slump in sales at the markets in Calcutta and north India, said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director at the Nagpur APMC and an orange trader himself. ""Orange prices fell 25 to 35 per cent today (Tuesday), from Rs 40,000 to Rs 25-30,000 per tonne,"" he said. ""Ten to 12 truckloads of oranges left the mandi for Calcutta daily; that has stopped."" Madhusudan Harane, a director at the APMC in Hinganghat town in Wardha district, said: ""Our APMC has been shut since November 8."" He questioned the timing of the demonetisation. ""Some Rs 1,500 crore worth of annual business took place in our mandi, over half of it between October and December - the peak months for farm markets,"" he said. The irony is, a favourable monsoon had led to a good harvest this year and the farmers were hoping for good returns after successive years of drought in many regions of the country."

The measures were taken following last week's temporary ban ordered by the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority (Bafra) on import of these vegetables. Confirming the development, the secretary-general of the Bhutan-India Friendship Association, Gelephu chapter, Ugyen Rabten, said: ""There has been strict surveillance on vegetables imported from India. It is much less now, but still continuing as local supply is not enough to meet the demands downstream."" Rabten said the ban is mostly on vegetables produced at Falakata in West Bengal and Barpeta in Assam, which are said to have high pesticide content. ""There will be proper monitoring of the imports now,"" he said. Assam shares 261km of the 700km international border with Bhutan. Of this, Kokrajhar shares 85km, Baksa 83km, Chirang 40km and Udalguri 53km of international border with Bhutan. People from Bhutan purchase most of the vegetables from border areas at Datgiri in Chirang besides Darangamela, Kumarikata, Subankhata and Nikashi in Baksa and Bhairabkhunda in Udalguri districts in Assam. The Bhutan media has reported that the agriculture and forest ministry last week had asked Bafra to clamp a temporary ban on import of beans and cauliflowers following lab tests that showed pesticide residues higher than the permissible limit for human consumption. Reports, quoting a ministry press release, said: ""Following the recent positive test results confirmed through use of the test kits for imported fruits and vegetables, the samples of selected 10 imported fruits and vegetables have been tested in three reference food laboratories in India and Thailand."" Assam agriculture commissioner Amlan Baruah told The Telegraph in Guwahati this evening that he is not aware of the ban, but now that the matter has been brought to the notice of the state government, it will definitely examine the issue. ""Buying and selling of agri/horti produce are private activities and do not come under the purview of the agriculture department, but we will look into it since a neighbouring country is involved. We will be issuing advisories to the growers to follow the guidelines developed by our state university on use of pesticides. The ban would also have its impact on the growers about benefits of using pesticides judiciously,"" Baruah said. Sources said the ban has affected bean growers in lower Assam districts. Initially, the ban was imposed on import of potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, beans, cabbages and cauliflowers from Indian markets. But as the production of organic vegetables goes down in Bhutan, demand for vegetables grown in the border districts goes up. ""So, except beans, all other vegetables have been supplied to Bhutan as before,"" a vegetable vendor from Chirang district said. The demand of vegetables grown in India is more in Bhutan because of their cheap price compared to vegetables produced in that country, a police source at Datgiri in the India-Bhutan bordering area and one of the gateways to Bhutan, told The Telegraph. Bhutan nationals in Sarpang district of that country buy green vegetables from a big weekly market at Datgiri in India every Thursday. ""The market survives on buyers from Bhutan,"" Nandalal Mogor, a youth of Runikhta in Chirang district, said. According to a section of farmers in Chirang, growers in West Bengal use higher amount of fertilisers and chemical pesticides. ""Vegetable farmers in lower Assam use fertilisers and chemicals wisely. Early seasonal vegetables need high amount of chemicals for growth and their prices are also high because of the cost of the chemicals,"" farmers in the Bengtol area in Chirang said."

(Vishvendu Jaipuriar) Hazaribagh, Dec. 16: Ravi Kumar Gupta has a degree in civil engineering from Gaya College of Engineering. But the 30-year-old hasn't taken up a job. Instead, he grows tomatoes. A 'red revolution' is bearing fruit in the red zone of Vishnugarh, where Ravi and his two friends, Pintu Kumar Saw and Awadh Kumar Yadav, have turned a barren 18-acre plot in the non-descript Chalkari village into a farmers' delight, not only growing tomatoes but also creating jobs for fellow villagers in the process. This is no mean feat given that Vishnugarh has its own share of challenges, being a safe den for Maoists because of its topography marked by hills and dense forests and a border that overlaps with Gomia (Bokaro) and Bagodar (Giridih). Chalkari is located on the Bagodar border, some 48km from the Hazaribagh district headquarters. ""I come from a family of farmers at Banka village in Katkamdag block. I was never keen on a job and had always wanted to do agriculture. I convinced my friends Pintu and Awadh, who are graduates and help their fathers in the field, from the same village to join me. After consulting local agricultural scientists, who confirmed that the soil was good for tomato cultivation, we took up the land at Chalkari and started our own farming,"" a visibly proud Ravi told The Telegraph. He added that they started the groundwork in June and till now, had sold 70,000 quintals of tomatoes in the local markets besides sending consignments to Bengal. ""In the next two months, they will grow more tomatoes. Many villagers have been roped in to take care of the tomato plants right from sowing the seeds to plucking the vegetable. This way, we have generated employments,"" said the new-age farmer. Pintu and Awadh, also in their 30s, added they had invested around Rs 10 lakh on this project, but were happy to see that our efforts finally started giving returns. ""One plant produces more then 5kg tomatoes on an average. Hazaribagh is a green belt and very conducive for agriculture. With huge swathes of land lying abandoned, unemployed youths can make farming their profession and earn good money,"" Pintu said. Ravi added: ""Yes, this needs hard work, but if done with honesty will give good results as in our case."" Local villagers hailed the trio, saying their success was an inspiration for others. ""Definitely, this kind of inspiring tales will encourage youths to make a career in agriculture as engineer Ravi and his two graduate friends did,"" said Bhuvaneshvar Patel, RJD district president and resident of Vishnugarh."

Telegraph Picture If all goes well, the 20,000-tonne vegetable processing plant in Kanke, the foundation of which was laid by chief minister Raghubar Das in February this year, will start operations in six months from now. Being set up by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), an autonomous entity working for the state government to boost milk production and market agrarian products, the plant will be the home of Safal products, ranging from fresh vegetables to all kinds of fruits. Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of NDDB, is investing around Rs 70 crore in the project. Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, B.S. Khanna, managing director of Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation (also known as Jharkhand Milk Federation), a joint venture between the state government and NDDB, said work on the plant spread over 27 acres was proceeding in full swing and they were bullish about beginning operations in another six months provided no hurdle crops up. ""Between February and now, there has been considerable progress in this project. We are bang on time with our groundwork. I visited the site two days ago and found the progress to be satisfactory. The process of setting up a boundary in and around the plant is almost complete. This apart, structure of the plant has come up while construction of the roof will begin very soon. Procurement of equipment and machinery is going on simultaneously,"" Khanna said. They had also got in touch with the district administration and power department for setting up an electricity feeder. ""There are some encroachment issues on a small patch of land. We are in talks with the district administration to ensure that it doesn't affect the plant in future. We are hopeful that these issues will be sorted out soon,"" he added. Once it begins functioning, the plant will initially take up pea and tomato processing and marketing followed by seasonal vegetables such as cabbage, beans and cauliflowers that are grown in abundance both on the capital's outskirts and adjacent districts. ""We have plans to take up fruits as well in phases. As far as veggies are concerned, frozen peas, tomato puree and pastes are a few items that we intend to supply in the market. The raw materials will be directly procured from farmers, which will ensure them good returns,"" he said. As for milk production, Khanna said the 1.2-lakh litre automated dairy plant in Hotwar, which also officially debuted this February, had touched the 75,000-litre production mark. ""Earlier, we used to process roughly around 20,000-25,000 litres of milk. Slowly, we touched the 75,000-litre mark. Soon, Ranchi dairy will be producing to its full capacity,"" he signed off."
58e534c4a3d24b500504a431,The capacity for obedience,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-capacity-for-obedience/article16757514.ece,2016-12-04,,The Hindu,"Tyranny is not possible without mass obedience. The murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust was carried out not by sadistic monsters but by ordinary humans who were obeying orders. Writing on the trial of Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann, Hannah Arendt coined the memorable phrase, the banality of evil.The enabler of such evil is the moral imperative to obey. For the Holocaust to have been averted, the majority of German citizens needed to disobey. But they did not. In the words of Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal, We know that one doesnt need to be fanatical, sadistic, or mentally ill to murder millions; that it is enough to be a loyal follower eager to do ones duty.Today, as authoritarian leaders are voted to power in countries around the world, many fear that their ability to command blind loyalty from their followers could erode democratic institutions and practices, with frightening consequences for civil liberties and human rights.The experimentThis has renewed interest in the psychology of obedience, which is a fascinating subject in itself. The most systematic study of obedience was conducted by the American psychologist Stanley Milgram in 1962-63 at Yale University. His findings, published in a book titled Obedience to Authority in 1974, became a bestseller in its time, and makes for an enlightening read in ours.Milgram sought to answer a basic question: To what extent would people obey a command that severely conflicts with their conscience, values, and self-image?The experiment he designed was as simple as it was brilliant. Milgram advertised in the newspaper seeking volunteers for an experiment in learning. From the list of respondents, two people at a time are invited to his lab. One of them is designated a teacher and the other a learner. The experimenter, clad in a grey lab coat, and representing the authority of science and academia, explains to them that the study is about the effect of punishment on learning.The learner is taken to a room and strapped to a chair with electrodes attached to his wrist. He is told he has to learn a list of word pairs for a test, and every time he makes an error, he will receive electric shocks of increasing intensity.The teacher is taken to another room and seated facing a shock generator with 30 switches, ranging from 15 volts to 450 volts. He is told that he will administer the test, and also the shocks for the wrong answers, increasing the level each time the learner makes a mistake.But the teacher, in Milgrams words, is a genuinely nave subject. He doesnt know that the learner is a confederate of Milgrams who receives no shock at all, and has been instructed to give wrong answers. The point of the experiment, Milgram writes, is to see how far a person will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which he is ordered to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim.Shocking resultsMilgrams descriptions of the experiment in his book, his analyses of the subjects justifications for their obedience, even the chapter on research methodology, make for a gripping read. Common sense leads us to expect that most individuals would refuse to administer electric shock to anyone, even as part of an experiment. Indeed, one must be a psychopath  not unlike what the world imagined Eichmann to be  to continue administering shocks to a helpless individual even after he starts to protest.But the results of Milgrams path-breaking experiment shocked (no pun intended) the American public: 65 per cent, or roughly two-thirds, of the participants continued giving shocks to the maximum level (450 volts). Every single participant continued up to 300 volts. (For the sake of comparison: the household electrical circuit in India is typically at 220 volts).The disturbing conclusion of Milgrams experiment was that most people would follow the orders of an authority figure, even if it meant killing an innocent person. With the Eichmann trial still fresh in public memory, Americans bristled at the insinuation that their capacity for a moral response to an authoritys abuse of power was no different from that of Germans under Nazi rule. Interestingly, the same experiment conducted in Germany found an obedience rate of 85 per cent.Milgram reproduced in his book the transcripts of the verbal exchanges between the experimenter and the teacher, which chart the transformation of an ordinary clerk or factory worker into a cold-blooded bureaucrat administering death to someone hed just met. A recent biopic on Milgram, titled Experimenter (2015), starring Peter Sarsgaard (as Milgram) and Winona Ryder, does a splendid job of dramatising the lab experiments.To be fair, nearly every subject turned to the experimenter for guidance when the learner began to scream in pain. But the experimenter would urge the teacher to continue, and the latter would comply. The authority  in this case, the experimenter  had no means of enforcing obedience. The participant stood to lose nothing from disobedience  no danger of material loss, and no threat to life, unlike, say, a civilian in the Nazi bureaucracy. And yet most of them obeyed. How does one account for this transformation?Behavioural modesMilgrams explanation was that people operate in two behavioural modes: autonomous and agentic. It is when a person is functioning as an autonomous individual that his conscience kicks into play, dictating behaviour. The moment he enters a social hierarchy  which could be an army or a state bureaucracy or a company management  he sees himself as an agent of anothers will, thereby shifting the (moral) responsibility for his actions to the authority. This enables him to act in ways that he would not were he to take personal responsibility for his actions.Milgram drew on evolutionary theory to explain this transformation. A potential for obedience is the prerequisite for social organisation, he noted, and because organisation has enormous survival value for any species, such a capacity was bred into the organism through the extended co-operation of evolutionary processes.He switched to cybernetics (the science of regulation and control) to demonstrate why civilisation depends on it: What modifications in its design are required if an [automaton] is to move from self-regulation to hierarchical functioning? Milgram answered: The most general need in bringing self-regulating automata into a co-ordinated hierarchy is to suppress individual direction and control in favour of control from higher components the individuals who enter into such hierarchies are, of necessity, modified in their functioning. We imbibe this modified functioning from family and school, which drill into us values such as loyalty, duty, and obedience to authority.Scope for disobedienceOf course, this does not mean that the scope for disobedience is absent in a hierarchical set-up. In situations where the group pressure to disobey outweighs the imperative to obey, disobedience results. This is something revolutionary leaders have intuitively known, and political activists operate with the understanding that resistance is only possible through collective agency. Hence the popularity of civil disobedience as a tactic to build solidarity and undermine authority.Milgrams work needs revisiting if we wish to understand the workings of authoritarianism and whether its worldwide emergence has anything to do with a deep psychological need to be led, for clear answers, for certainty in an era of ambiguity and uncertainty.His Obedience to Authority is unparalleled as a document of human vulnerability to tyranny, and as an article of faith for humanitys capacity to resist tyranny.sampath.g@thehindu.co.inWhen a person is functioning as an autonomous individual, his conscience kicks into play.

The herd was lingering at the thickets abutting Sivunikuppam village of Santhipuram mandal at 8 p.m. on Thursday.Since Wednesday midnight, forest officials of the Bangarpet range, Krishnagiri range of Tamil Nadu and Kuppam range of A.P. have been camping at the villages.Officials argueThe Karnataka officials refused to allow the pachyderms to enter their side, arguing that the herd had actually emerged from the T.N. side. However, the T.N. officials too remained stubborn, demanding that the elephants be driven towards Karnataka. The Bangarpet range staff had even brought the tranquillizer guns to dart at the herd, in case they kept entering their limits.The Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West), T. Chakrapani, held a series of talks with officials of the border States. A solution was arrived at on Thursday late in the evening.Keeping in view the reluctance of the pachyderms to move towards Karnataka, and their inclination to march towards Tamil Nadu, the forest personnel of Chittoor district readied their path towards Mallanur near Kuppam, close to the Maharaja Kadai forests of Tamil Nadu.During the the last 24 hours, standing crops of paddy and tomato and horticulture crops were reportedly damaged by the herd in Santhipuram mandal. Mr. Chakrapani told The Hindu that with the cooperation of villagers and forest personnel of the neighbouring states, the tense situation in the rural areas was brought under control."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Demonetisation has paralysed wholesale markets in the city, be they of grocery  rice, wheat, pulses, spices and suchlike  or fruits. The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. As one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."

The herds have retreated to the thickets of the neighbouring States. But the prowling of two lone elephants at the tri-State junction continues leaving the farmers in about 100 fringe villages in a grip of tension as they expect the return of the herds to their fields any time.During the last five years, movement of the wild elephants, numbering over 70 and split into five or six herds, between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon in the Kuppam region.Two herds had barged into the fringe hamlets of the two constituencies in the third week of December, and the forest personnel could drive them back into the thickets of TN and Karnataka in separate operations during the last couple of days.Since August, the farmers of the Kuppam mandal have been familiar with the presence of a lone elephant moving along the borders of Tamil Nadu. Another single elephant problem surfaced a couple of days ago in Santhipuram mandal, when it got separated from a herd of seven pachyderms.The farmers who are generally used to drought conditions mostly rely on horticulture crops. Since November, stretches of banana, potato, tomato and beans plantations suffered the ire of the marauding tuskers in many villages. With Sankranthi just two weeks away, the farmers get ready to harvest their crops.However, the man-animal conflict has forced them to abandon night vigils. This gives them an additional headache: scope for theft of motor pump sets and other electrical gadgets and cables by miscreants. Danger also lurks for farmers while moving in the fields during 10.00 pm-2.00 am shift of power supply. In the last two years, five farmers had been killed in the attacks of wild elephants. At the same time, seven pachyderms were reported killed in the same region, due to infighting among the herds and electrocution in the fields. The last quarter of 2015 had witnessed the presence of large herds in the V.Kota and Ramakuppam mandals.Forest Range Officer (Kuppam), Kalappa Naidu, said all efforts were under way to prevent the man-animal conflict in the region, including strengthening of solar fencing, digging of elephant proof trenches and talks with the TN and Karnataka forest department officials, seeking their coordination in monitoring the movement of the wild elephants.Movement of the wild elephants between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon"

All that he was offered for a box of 25 kg of tomatoes was Rs. 60.The frustrated farmer dumped all 350 boxes he had and returned home empty-handed.This is not the first case. We have been witnessing this since demonetisation came into effect, said Srinivas, a clerk with a commission agent.He said the Anantapur farmer preferred to sell the produce in Hyderabad as there were no takers in small markets in the Rayalaseema region. He had to pay Rs. 2,000 for the hamalis [workers who load and unload goods] alone. He will not be able to recover those costs.Daily affairMr. Srinivas said a bag of 80 kg carrots would earlier fetch Rs. 600 to 700 but the farmers are not getting more than Rs. 200 now, thanks to the cash crunch. You can find heaps of vegetables thrown in the yard when the market closes at 10 p.m.The Special Grade Secretary of the market, Y.V.

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

File PHOTOVegetable farmers in Punjab and Haryana are going through yet another period of hardship as the wholesale price of the seasonal crops has hit the rock bottom, forcing farmers into distress sale.Farmers and officials told The Hindu that with the harvesting season picking up, the supply of green peas, cauliflower, potato, carrot and tomatoes had increased. But the demand is subdued because of the poor cash availability.Farmers have not been able to recover even the production cost.At the Amritsar vegetable market, price of green peas on Moday was down to Rs. 4 a kg, well below the production cost of Rs. 6 a kg. Farmers blamed the poor returns on the increased supply and demonetisation.Cash crunch impactGreen pea prices are so low that I wont even recover the input cost , said Jagbir Singh Maan, a farmer from Manawal Kalan in Amritsar. He said traders were offering low prices, citing subdued demand and the cash crunch post-demonetisation.In the fruit and vegetable market in Chandigarh, the wholesale prices of fresh vegetables have slumped because of the rise in supply and low demand.Rajinder Kumar, secretary of the Chandigarh Market Committee, said in the past week, potato prices ruled at Rs. 5-10 a kilogram. I have been supplying vegetables in bulk to hotels in Chandigarh, but since demonetisation, the orders have gone down by 30 per cent, said Deepak Dhawan, who is a commission agent in the Chandigarh market.The wholesale prices of all seasonal vegetables have dropped in the past month, he said.In the Jalandhar vegetable market, potatoes fetched a paltry Rs. 2 a kg on Monday. Prices are down but I dont have any other option than selling. If I delay, the quality of the potato will deteriorate. I have to sow wheat after potato harvest, hence, Im forced to sell my crop at a poor price, though it means a heavy loss, said Jaswinder Singh, a Jalandhar potato farmer.In Haryana too, farmers are selling seasonal vegetables at throw away prices. In the Shahbad market, potato fetched Rs. 2.75 a kg, while cauliflower went for Rs. 2 a kg. I sold my potato for Rs. 2.75 a kilogram.As the prices have dropped, farmers in my village have started feeding their potatoes to their cattle to avoid buying feed, said Rakesh Bains, a farmer from Kurukshetra, who planted potato on 24 acres.Farmers have been unable to recover cost of productionas the priceshave plummeted"

She said while in West they call it a lifestyle, in India we call it a way of life.Irani said modernity and tradition can go hand in hand and make India proud.Modernity is belief in our way of life, in having a open minded dialogue about it. And it is our family where people can set examples and encourage youngsters to embrace modernity without compromising Indian traditional values, she said.Irani said that for her, the real definition of modernity is if you accept and respect everybodys point of view, if you embrace your traditions without being ashamed of them.Author and award-winning scriptwriter Advaita Kala, who was also present at the session, said modernity can be viewed from different perspectives. Some say modernity has made us automatons of delivery and has dehumanised us. But we should not forget that we are the beneficiaries of modernity. The way forward is to reconcile modernity and traditions. It is high time we move away from the battle of modernity vs tradition, she said."

Last week, Cuttack mayor Anita Behera had to resign after her name was found in the list of NFSA beneficiaries. The government has suspended at least 15 officials in various parts of the state for bungling in preparation of the cards.Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee president Prasad Harichandan said the rising incidents of protests against the ministers showed peoples discontent, particularly after mass irregularities in ration cards. It reflects only peoples anger on the government, he said. Justifying the egg attacks, Congress chief whip Taraprasad Bahinipati said, Not only eggs, the BJD leaders deserved to be attacked by sticks, Bahinipati said.BJD condemned the attacks. In a democracy everybody has a right to protest. But the means has to be democratic. Nobody can take law into ones hands. Those provoking them are also liable for action, said BJD spokesperson and MLA Amar Prasad Satpathy.Though the ongoing spell of egg attacks on the ministers is being attributed to NFSA scam, the trend had picked up after some Congress workers hurled eggs at chief minister Naveen Patnaik in February 2014.In November first week, eggs were hurled on agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy and school and mass education minister Debi Prasad Mishra, among others."

And one of Bapu's original disciples, Abdul Hamid Kureshi , 89 -the chair man of the Sabarmati Ashram - has enclosed a message in his death. Kureshi, who was also an eminent lawyer , chose to be cremated and not buried.Kureshi breathed his last at the breakfast table in his residence in Swastik Society, Navrangpura, on Saturday morning. Sabarmati Ashram was the cradle of Bapu's revolutionary ideas to win freedom from the British.It was a rare sight at the Mukti Dham crematorium in Paldi where Kureshi's illustrious family gathered for his final rites. Senior members of the higher judiciary and distinguished lawyers stood alongside the grieving family . Kureshi was the grandson of Imam Saheb Abdul Kadir Bawazir, a close associate of Bapu in South Africa.Bapu referred to Imam Bawazir as his ""sahodar"", brother born from the same mother.""Kureshi saheb wished to be cremated because he did not want to waste land with his burial,"" said Bharat Naik, the sonin-law of Kureshi's brother, Wahid Kureshi. ""In fact, he made me a witness to the decision in the presence of other family members."" Over the past four years, Kureshi had been reminding his son, Justice Akil Kureshi, and Naik that they should ensure he is cremated. He asserted that if anyone objected, the person should be told of his last wish.Kureshi was cremated after 7 pm.Kureshi was born in the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad where Imam Bawazir had settled with Bapu in 1915. Born in 1927, Kureshi grew up on Bapu's lap till Bapu embarked on the Dandi March in 1930. Kureshi was one of the few kids who ate tomato slices from Bapu's lunch. Bapu wrote letters to a young Kureshi, which were later donated to the National Archives of India.""Kureshi's father, Ghulam Rasool, was part of `Arun Tukdi' that walked ahead of the Dandi March procession,"" said Sabarmati Ashram director Tridip Suhrud. ""The team had to ensure that arrangements for meetings and halts were in place.""After Ghulam Rasool and his wife were arrested during the Dandi March, Abdul Hamid, his brother Wahid, and sister Sultana were brought up for a few years by Anasuya Sarabhai, said the secretary of the ashram, Amrut Modi. ""Sarabhai was a Gandhian and pioneer of women's labour movement in India,"" he said. Rizwan Kadri, an Ahmedabad-based historian, said that in September1942 Kureshi was arrested in Detroj during the Quit India movement.Kureshi became the chairman of the Sabarmati Ashram trust three years ago. A peace activist at heart, Kureshi worked to build bridges between Hindus and Muslims and penned a book titled "" Agnipariksha"" after the 1969 communal riots in Gujarat."

Onion bulbs should be evenly coloured with no signs of sprouting, tomatoes have to be smooth and firm with no cuts or blemishes and greens should look fresh and springy, with no signs of insect damage. ""My mother taught me how to choose vegetables. I am particular that even the potatoes I pick are firm and well-shaped without green patches or sprouts,"" says the 35-year-old bank employee.""I want to feed only the best to my family and won't pick anything with blemishes.""In India and abroad, looks do matter. Not just among human beings but also where produce is concerned. Sellers and buyers, supermarkets and restaurants, all often reject `ugly' food, that is, misshapen and bruised fruits and vegetables.""Customers do prefer fruits and vegetables that `look good'. Sometimes they do reject fruits that are misshapen, so we return them to the vendor from whom we procured,"" says V R Govindasaamy , founder of Amma Naana. According to estimates m the United Nations En from the United Nations Environment Programme, onethird of the produce grown in the world is thrown out simply because it's considered `ugly' though it is perfectly edible. To combat the colossal food waste, the `ugly food movement' is taking off across the world, especially in Europe and Australia. In 2014, Intermarche , the third largest supermarket chain in France, launched a campaign, Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables, to celebrate `ugly' produce and help put an end to food waste.Until recently, the European Union had specific rules that prevented misshapen produce from being sold. For instance, a spear of asparagus could not be sold unless at least 80% of its length was green. Those rules have since been scrapped and 2014 was designated the `European Year Against Food Waste'.While Indians may not reject produce terming them `ugly', fruits and vegetables that do not conform to the way they should ideally look are rejected. India, the second largest producer of fruit in the world, wastes fruits and vegetables worth Rs 13,300 crore every year. According to a 2013 report by Emerson Climate Technologies India, a business of the US-based manufacturing and technology company Emerson, this is because of the lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated transport.Discriminating against 'ugly' produce adds to wastage. ""We get our produce from various farms. If any of it is oddly shaped or has blemishes -for instance, if carrots have a cut in the middle or the bottle gourd is knotted up, they are filtered out at the farm,"" says Madhusudanan K, director of Dhanyam, an organic store with branches in Adyar, Anna Nagar and T Nagar. ""Customers do tend to like things that look good and have a `normal' shape. And they feel bad feeding anything that looks misshapen to their families,"" he says.""Customers pick and choose, and whatever they reject, we dispose of,"" he says, adding that it is probably just 2% of what they procure.Ramanthan Balasubramanian, a media professional admits he wouldn't buy misshapen fruits and vegetables. ""I wouldn't reject them as they are `ugly' but I would be afraid there is something wrong with them,"" he says.That's also the reason why many stores are careful about placing 'good looking' fruits right in the front.""Most of the shops polish the apples, and also keep the best looking fruits in the front when we stack them up,"" says the owner of a fruit and vegetable store in Mylapore.""People are attracted by the way it looks and are willing to shell out more.""The Indian way of selecting produce also causes damage and wastage, say store owners. ""People like to touch and feel their veggies and fruits. When too many people handle it, even good produce gets spoiled,"" says Madhusudanan.In India, though, wastage is cut as the oddly shaped produce is often sold off at a cheaper rate, says shop owners. ""Even if something has blemishes, we can always cut off that portion and sell it cheap,"" says a fruit stall owner. ""But then, it is only poor people who opt for it.""Experts feel that the Indian market and sensibilities are different from that of the West, so an `ugly food movement' may not be the need of the hour.However, different methods can be employed. ""People here are conservative and look for value for money, so it is but natural that when they go to a store, they pick the best,"" says Shree Periakaruppan, founder of Foodology , a recreational culinary studio. ""But if these oddly shaped produce are sold cheaper, there will definitely be takers."""

After visiting horticulture projects during a press tour organised on Wednesday, collector K Veera Raghava Rao said the administration was planning to bring 900 more hectares under vegetable cultivation.At present vegetables are cultivated in 2,100 hectares in the district during the year. Onions, tomatoes, brinjals and ladies finger are major vegetable varieties cultivated predominantly in Kottampatti, Melur, Alanganallur and Sedapatti blocks.The farmers can't keep incurring losses depending heavily on a single crop. Hence, they will be encouraged to shift to vegetable cultivation to manage the loss, the collector said.Progressive farmers will be identified in each block and encouraged to take up vegetable cultivation. They will be briefed on the schemes available in the horticulture department, he said.This year the district received the subsidy on micro irrigation for 10,000 acres. Deputy director of horticulture G O Poopathi said Madurai district received Rs 4.22 crore this year for integrated horticulture development under the national horticulture mission and Rs 9.26 crore was granted for micro irrigation projects under the prime minister's micro irrigation scheme.The district was granted Rs 43.56 lakh under the national agriculture development project and Rs 21.19 lakh for organic farming. Altogether, the district received Rs 14 crore for various horticulture projects, he said.Vegetables are short term crops requiring minimum water. Micro irrigation can help conserve water.

""The biggest advantage of direct selling is that previously during season time I would sell tomatoes for Rs3 per kg. Today I sell them at Rs20 round the year,"" says Sudhakar Kubde, who has a farm near Kalmeshwar where 17 varieties of vegetables are grown. ""My annual income has doubled from Rs1.5 lakh to Rs3.5 lakh in one year,"" says Kubde.""I was curious after receiving a message for buying farm fresh veggies,"" says Dr Kirti Jaiswal, now a regular customer of these farmers. ""The products were amazingly tasty, fresh and had a longer shelf life. I was surprised to see how politely they would speak to the customers,"" say Jaiswal, who convinced her neighbours at MHADA Colony near Bole petrol pump to also buy from these farmers. ""The fact that this helps the poor farmer to get a fair deal is enough for me to buy from them,"" adds Sonal Barde, a busy entrepreneur.More than the farmer, it is the consumer who should be taking up this movement, feels Vasant Futane a farmer from Warud. ""The direct markets help in forming a relationship between the farmer and the consumer. This way both get sensitive to each other's needs,"" says Futane, who doesn't need to bring his produce to the city as he has a large chain of buyers who contact him directly."

Fish ladders are a series of pools built like steps to enable fish to ascend a dam and enable them to migrate upstream over or through a barrier. The ladders will enable the fish to cross the dam and breed further up the river.Bharti is on record as saying once that happens, the fish, considered a delicacy in East India, will be available in the Ganga in regions as far as even the Chambal in MP and UP, as was the case in the past. Indeed, till the time the Farakka barrage was built in 1975, hilsa which only breeds in fresh water travelled hundreds of kilometres inland to breed. The building of the barrage barred their migration.The hilsa is now like a fish out of water in the Ganga. ""Gone are the days when we relished the choicest preparations of hilsa, which is revered as 'machher rani' (queen of fishes), amid monsoon spells. It is a thing of the past. Today, we can't afford this luxury and have to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 for a kg of fish,"" laments Gauri Das (75), a resident of Bengali Tola area in Varanasi.The last time Das bought hilsa was three years ago on a special occasion. Recalling the old days, when it was available in abundance in the markets, she said, ""Dishes like Shorshe Ilish (hilsa cooked in mustard paste) and Bhapa Ilish (steamed hilsa with chilly mustard paste) were common in Bengali households. Today, we are yearning for hilsa."" Those were the days before the Farakka barrage was built and the hilsa travelled long distances upstream.Das was elated at the thought that hilsa could be fished locally in the Ganga waters in the coming days. "" Sotti! Eta hobe?"" (Really! Would it happen?),"" she wondered with her wide open eyes. ""Hilsa is cooked in a number of ways,"" she said, adding that it can be fried, cooked in spicy tomato or ginger-based gravy (jhol), or mustard-based with green chillies (shorshe batar jhal). It can also be cooked with posto, doi (curd), seasonal vegetables, and steamed inside of plantain or butternut squash leaves."

And if you relish the flavours of piping hot tomato soups, then the latest trend is a tempting option. Souping or an all-soup diet is catching up with individuals looking to shed some kilos and cleanse their system.Typically a three-day routine, souping involves replacing lunch and dinner meals with a bowl of fresh, homemade soup. ""The diet plan includes soups coupled with a bowl of boiled vegetables, fruits, nuts or sprouts. Packaged soups aren't allowed,"" says Suhasini Viswanathan, dietitian, Qua Nutrition.While oil cannot be used, the soups can have a little salt, pepper and herbs. "" Adding a piece of ginger or garlic is advisable for delicate stomachs. The diet doesn't include dairy products, eggs, sugar and non-vegetarian dishes,"" says Suhasini, adding that one portion of cabbage soup is a must.Experts say souping is helpful as it adds a lot of fibre, water, vitamins and minerals to the fare. But certain soups must be avoided. ""Clear soups aren't recommended as they have few calories and can increase the appetite,"" says consultant dietitian Dr Dharini Krishnan, adding that high-calorie creamy soups are off the menu too. Pre-diabetics, diabetics and those on medication must refrain from following this diet as they require planned meals with sufficient carbohydrates after medication.Following the diet has had mixed outcomes. Some people have lost weight and felt `lighter' while others have returned to their cheesy burgers. ""I lost two kilos after trying it with professional guidance as the diet was tailored to my needs,""says Krithika Vidyasagar, who tried the routine recently .The all-soup diet is replacing its juice counterpart as it is considered healthier. ""Juicing adds vitamin C, potassium and some fibre but in souping, the diet has more nutrients,"" says Dr Dharini.However, like any dietary fad, this too can land you in a soup.Giving up on your cravings may help you lose some fat, but a sudden dietary shift is unhealthy. ""People develop nutritional deficiencies when their intake doesn't involve supplements. Mood swings, headaches, exhaustion, and a constant craving for food are common side-effects,"" says Dr Kousalya Nathan, lifestyle and anti-ageing consultant, Apollo Nova Hospital. She adds that a nutritionist's consultation is crucial.It is also essential to keep a watch over one's diet even after the souping detox to maintain weight. ""Diets restricted to one food group, like vegetables, can be followed for a short period as they can cause nutritional imbalances in the long run,"" says Dr Dharini."

""Though minimum temperature came down to 3-4C, people did not feel the chill because day temperatures remained around 22-24C,"" he added.Wadood said a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal and western disturbance are causing upper air cyclonic circulation in the northwestern part of the country. ""These two wind system act as limiting factor for each other and the western disturbance is likely to indirectly affect the weather in this part,"" Wadood said.IMD observation shows a wind confluence over central India and a fresh western disturbance as an upper air system would affect western Himalayan region from Monday.Rainfall in isolated parts of Jharkhand has been predicted for Sunday and Monday whereas the state is likely to get scattered rainfall on Tuesday with warning for hailstorm in some parts.However, Wadood said that the rain will not impact the crops much but if hailstones are there, vegetables would be damaged considerably.

I'm just a pohawala."" The man who says this is Keshav Mankar. Yes, The Keshav. And that's why, we can almost hear legions of his fans mock-booing in disagreement.For Nagpurians who have been living on may be Mars for the last 25 years, Keshav Mankar has been selling poha tarri and only poha tarri from a tiny shop at Deo Nagar. In a city where you can find a pohawallah before you can say 'Hao', Keshav's Poha has earned something of a cult status, as much for its taste as for the shop's singularly eccentric business hours. The shop opens around 6.15am. On a brisk day, as is usually the case, Mankar will turn you back if you reach at 7:30am. That's right: In a city notorious for being on snooze mode until 11am, Keshav Mankar manages to get people out of their beds at the crack of dawn.He views the adulation with a mixture of bemusement and pride. He took over the shop in 1991 after the death of his father Jayram, who had set up the business in 1974. ""He sold misal, batata wada and poha,"" Keshav remembers. For many years, Keshav and his brother Ashok would sell batata vada and poha. A few years ago, they stopped selling the vada. ""Fights would break out between customers over who would get it first. Tarri would be flung on shirts. It happened once too often and our landlord gave us an ultimatum,"" Mankar recalls, his matter-of-fact tone banishing any comical vada war images forming in one's mind.So, what's the secret recipe of the tarri that's worth fighting for? ""Onions, ginger, garlic, tomato (not a lot), red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder,"" Mankar rattles off. The most ingredient, however, seems to be oil. ""For 2kg of watana, I use 2.5kg oil,"" he says. The tarri is enough for 10kg of poha. Mankar does all the cooking himself 'to ensure that the quality remains exactly the same.'The oft-quoted factoid that he goes for his job at a school or college after closing the shop is a rumour, he says, adding that that even though he does business for less than two hours, the preps and cleaning up take up the remaining part of the day. ""I go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 4am,"" he says, complaining that the younger generation is just not ready for this kind of dedication. He's 57 and he says he can go on for 10 more years at most. ""I don't think my sons will carry on the business,"" he says.Note to fans: Eat all you can while it lasts."

SM Deshmukh, assistant commissioner, FDA, Kolhapur said, ""Besides using palm oil for making food, they were also continuously reheating it, which is dangerous to health.""All the charges are finalised after the inspection report was shown to the officials present at the food outlets and hotels and after their confirmation.A copy of the notice is being served on the outlets and hotels.A notice issued on January 7 reads that a fastfood outlet had not displayed the board declaring what type of oil is being used for cooking. It was violation of the very first condition of licence under the Food Security and Standards Act 2006.Continuous heating and reheating of oil leads to formation of trans-fatty acids, which is dangerous to health.This is also in violation of the Schedule 4 of part 5 of regulation II-3 (j) of the Food Security and Standards Act 2006, the notice states. A copy of the notice is with the TOI.In case of a multinational outlet that boasts about its high standards of hygiene and cleanliness, the report says that it has not kept the document certifying that the packing material used by them is of food grade quality. Hence, there are doubts about the quality of the packing material.The food serving trays were kept near cleaning and sanitary equipment; edible and non-edible items were stored very close to each other in the store rooms.As per the Act, there has to be sufficient distance between such items. The dust bins in the kitchen had no cover, while raw food items like tomatoes were kept in the open at the entrance of the kitchen.The notice was served on the food outlet on January 7 and it was given 21 days to respond.The notice also states that the outlets and hotels have to comply with the recommendations and submit a report accordingly.If any party fails to do so, it may lose its licence, Deshmukh said.A former mayor who owns the property of one of the hotels under scrutiny confirmed that his hotel has received a notice from the FDA. He said, ""I owned the property but it is being managed by another group. The issues raised are minor such as cleanliness and covering some items properly. We will comply with it and submit the report.""Cleanliness, use of packed items past expiry most common violations: In most of the cases, the FDA officials have said that cleanliness, use of package food items that have crossed expiry dates are the common violations.

Though the latest letter to schools is not the first time CBSE has raised this issue, the urgency and seriousness is prodded by a central government report slamming the ""easy availability"" of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) in school canteens. The report, prepared by a working group constituted by ministry of women and child development (MCD), has suggested a complete ban on HFSS not only inside campus but also within a 200 meter periphery (during school hours).Stepping up pressure on schools, CBSE secretary Joseph Emmanuel on Thursday wrote that ""it is expected that all schools affiliated to CBSE will take the necessary measures"". While the board has not mentioned what penal action it will take against erring schools, the letter's tone clearly suggests that it means business. Schools have been asked to constitute a School Canteen Management Committee (SCMC), which will take charge of menu preparation. Emmanuel wrote that the SCMC should have ""about 7-10 members including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators. The committee will coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food available to students in the school"".The MCD report said child obesity is one of the biggest concerns in India and suggested that ""incorporation of healthy snacks needs to be right at the top of the agenda and intensive intervention should be undertaken by the government along with active involvement of parents, teachers and community as a whole"".Well-known city-based paediatrician Dr Rajiv Mohta agrees, saying, ""Healthy eating is a lifestyle and that has to be practised by parents, which eventually children will follow. Once in school, the availability of food items can be controlled and snacks like poha, upma etc should be made available. Even when serving idli, sambar dal must be compulsorily mixed so that it's a perfect combination of carbs and proteins."" Even the MCD report suggests that the above mentioned items along with cutlet, stuffed paratha, dalia, pulao etc can be introduced as healthy options on the menu.Schools too welcomed CBSE's push in this regard and accepted that they have a key role to play. Sumathi Venugopalan, principal of Centre Point School (Wardhaman Nagar), said, ""It is possible to implement this change in schools because if we don't provide unhealthy snacks students will not buy it. There are a variety of options available in Indian cuisine, so it shouldn't be difficult to substitute unhealthy options with healthier ones.""Akhilesh Chaturvedi, principal of Delhi Public School, said, ""This option is feasible and we are trying to implement this in our school by banning such items from our canteen. We do not promote the consumption of unhealthy snacks but if students bring those items from home, we can't possibly check lunch boxes of all students.""IS Tuli, director of Edify School, said, ""It is practically not possible to ban all unhealthy options, but we can control them. Heeding the advice of CBSE, we have hired a caterer and by doing this we give our students homemade snacks, which are more beneficial for their health.""Shashikala Naidu, principal of Jain Heritage school, said, ""It is an extremely positive step taken by CBSE because children today practically live on junk food. We confiscate any junk the students carry, so that at least for the majority of their day they stay away from unhealthy choices.""Ensuring that snacks prepared in canteen are not only healthy but appealing is key according to Bharti Bijwe, principal of Sandipani School.

""Under the smart city mission, we are working on framing bylaws to make city terraces green. We picked this cue from some foreign countries where partially covering the rooftops of new buildings with plants or solar panels is a must. We are planning to replicate the same in Jaipur,"" says Ashutosh Pednekar, chief executive officer (CEO), JMC.Some demonstrations on how to grow vegetables on rooftops have already been done at JMC headquarters here.For this, what is required is a plant-growing kit comprising light-fibre `grow bags'. A variety of vegetables, including leafy ones, tomatoes, brinjal and chillies can be grown on the terrace with the help of the kit. ""We have received a proposal from six companies so far out of which three have started the demonstration process. Other companies that are interested are welcome.We will award the work to the company we find is best-suited,"" said a senior JMC official.The official further said a variety of vegetables, including leafy ones, tomatoes, brinjal and chillies can be grown on the terrace with the help of the kit, which is available in the market.As of now, the vegetables consumed in the city are fed by the `polluted' waters of Dravyavati river. ""There is no use of chemicals or pesticides for home-grown vegetables. Organic methods will be used for this green endeavour. We are also planning to rope in consultants to guide people on this. Besides, we are considering subsidy to residents who would be growing vegetables at home,"" the official said.""The cost of a `grow bag' depends on its size. The cost of a 6X10 feet bag is about Rs 15,000,"" the official said."

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchThanks a lot. Thank you very much."

This has affected the quality and quantity of vegetable and fruit crops.Heavy showers and lack of sunlight has led to discolouring of the veggies and fruits, their nutrient levels have also dropped and the size and shape has also been affected.Moreover, the bad weather has led to huge losses to the farming community as most of their produce has got spoilt and had to be thrown away.The change in rainfall pattern has also affected the consumers who have to pay more for the vegetables and fruits. The prices of cabbage and cauliflower have almost doubles. While the price of cabbage was Rs 20 and cauliflower was Rs 15 till last week, this week the rates have gone up to Rs 40 and Rs 30, respectively.""The prices had to be increased as the demand is high and the produce is low. Even the prices of tomato, onion and chilli has doubled. The rate of coriander has soared by over 200%. A bunch of coriander which was sold at Rs 20 or Rs 10 for a bunch till just a week back is now being sold at Rs 60 to Rs 70. The reason for the increase in rate is that these vegetables get spoilt soon and we have to make special arrangements to store them till the fresh stock arrives,"" said a vendor Kamlesh Singh.While the retail prices have gone up, the cost of vegetables at the APMC market has decreased. ""Though the production has not been hit till now, the continuous rains have affected the produce and quality of crops. Everyday, around 100 to 150 trucks carrying vegetables are unloaded at the APMC market. But the prices of leafy vegetables have shot up by almost 200%,"" said secretary of Kalyan's APMC market Yashwant Patil.Due to the hike, many farmers at the weekly market at Gaodevi have stopped selling vegetables like methi, palak and coriander."

Water scarcity has affected production, thus affecting inflow into the city. The upward spiral of prices is likely to prevail for at least a month. The quality of vegetables available, however, has largely been unaffected.While tomatoes are selling for as much as Rs 60 per kg in some parts, prices of beans, cluster beans, lemons, green chillies, ginger and garlic too are skyrocketing. French beans are selling for a whopping Rs 150 per kg in many area. Kitchen regulars like ladyfingers, brinjal, cauliflower, bitter gourd and bottle gourd are commanding at least 30% more than their usual rates.Officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee attributed the the surge in prices to diminished supply from regions supplying to Pune.Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section, estimates that inflow of vegetables has dropped by almost half. Warning of a further hike in prices, he said, ""Most vegetables reach us from Nashik and Karnataka and the drought and water scarcity is wreaking havoc on the farms. The inflow is unlikely to increase for at least a month, till the monsoon sets in and farmers are able to reap more abundant produce.""Supply of vegetables sourced from within Pune district has not not been affected as much as that from Solapur or Satara, said Amol Tambe, cofounder of a company selling agricultural produce at farm rates in the city. ""Farmers in Solapur are really strapped for water, which is supplied just twice a week. The situation is similar in Satara district, from where Pune gets its beans. There is a sharp drop in output and this demand-supply gap is causing the prices to escalate,"" he said.Prices have gone up more in the last two weeks, said Anup Gupta, a retailer on Sus Road, who admits that his sale has largely remained unaffected. ""Tomato prices have shot up since the week began. Prices of most other vegetables, too, have increased more in the last two weeks. The drought has affected production everywhere and limited stock is reaching the wholesale market every day,"" he added.Customers have no option but to buy vegetables at the prevailing rates, Pashan resident Varsha Vora said. ""I have a family of four. Rates have changed drastically since Sunday when I last bought vegetables. Tomatoes are an essential for all types of cooking so we are helpless about the prices, which keep oscillating for some or the other reason,"" she said.The rising prices of vegetables have the residents of Pimpri Chinchwad worried too. Sunita Deshpande, a resident of Pradhikaran, said, ""I bought vegetables on Wednesday and found tomatoes to be the only item to be a little overpriced at Rs 40/kg. Most of the other vegetables are in the usual range of Rs 60/kg. Thankfully, onion prices are keeping low so that balances things out."""

Many go for a package, which has three or four treatments and it helps them save around Rs2,000. He advises people to take treatment at 15 days interval for a better result.Those who cannot afford the expensive facial, could simply go for de-tan face pack, which is available in the Rs300 to Rs600 range.Anju, who has been a practising beautician for the last 20 years, says the facial after de-tan treatment is a good way to relax and pamper oneself. ""In facial, we give different services, which include cleansing, scrubbing, massaging, applying serum and pack. It is done for 60 to 70 minutes and it lightens the skin colour and removes the dust particles deposited in the pores.""Meghna Rajvanshi, a beautician at a unisex salon on Fraser Road, points out how men have outnumbered women recently in her parlour. ""Gone are the days when only women were obsessed with their skin colour and texture. Now, men, too, are rushing to beauty salon for better looks,"" she said.Meghna, apart from a practising beautician, is also doing research in Ayurveda. ""Those who have time can prepare their face pack at home with natural ingredients. For example, mix half tomato with two drops of lemon and half papaya and smash them properly. Then apply this pack on face and massage for ten minutes with the finger tips. Leave this pack for two more minutes and rinse them with plain water. Another pack could also be prepared with egg white, milk powder and lemon. After applying this, leave it for ten minutes and make sure that while the pack is on the face, do not talk.

The reason for such high rates for the green chilli is lesser produce arriving in the market  a mere 25 truckloads came in APMC market this week, lesser than the usual 40 trucks. Many retail chains and supermarkets have already run short of green chilli.Experts attributed the hike to scanty supply from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, as production was hampered due to unseasonal rains. ""As local supply from Maharashtra is almost exhausted, the market depends on supplies from south, where production was hampered due to rains,"" said Balasaheb Bodle, a trader. Traders are apprehensive that the prices would escalate another 15% until the supply is augmented. While leafy vegetables prices rose slightly, other vegetable rates remained constant and there was a drop in prices of some items, including tomato, which is being retailed at Rs 20-30 per kg."

Called 'rural tourism' or 'community tourism', the activity is about living the farmland life for a day or two, where you actually learn to drive a tractor, plant crops and harvest some, too! Say hello to the farm escape that's giving folks an insight into local village life, food and more...Plenty! And it's like a complete return to nature. The idea of just going on a nature trail, having breakfast with butterflies, sleeping in a wooden hut and learning ways to save the environment has caught on. Says Rashmi Sawant of an enterprise dedicated to promoting sustainable rural tourism. ""Citygoers are now looking at leisure breaks that offer offbeat activities. Most travel for aesthetic purposes, which may not really teach you much. But connecting with a local experience like this satisfies the soul. They get a feel of community activities in a rural atmosphere and this makes for an unforgettable memory.""Visitors to such farms also pay a visit to the local cashew and other plantations, they can bathe a buffalo, spend time with rural home-makers, go fishing, visit paddy fields and even have lunch with a potter! What's very popular, especially with kids is to try rangoli and garland making as well as see the pinguli (puppetry) performances. ""Parents are increasingly realising that kids must understand the village set up and way of living,"" she adds.At a farm at Vikramgarh, Palghar district  just two hours drive away from the city  you enter through a mud path, into a 6,000 sq foot area of tribal built mandaps or shamianas made from bamboo and teak leaves. There are waterfalls here even in summer, one learns. Founder Hemant Chhabra says it's quite the antidote to the gadget-hungry crowd. ""More people are opening to a pure honest hands-on farm experience as it is so different,"" says Chhabra. Society folk can live the rural life here  learning to bake bricks, weave bamboo baskets and pick vegetables for the daily meal. ""At a mental level people want to experience what a farmer's life is all about  right from farming, to cooking the food in the right way so as to get the highest nurition from the soil and more, plus on another level it touches the five senses.""Farms like this also grow their own crops and prepare fresh frood using them. One can relish fresh nautral traditonal Indian foods here like bhakri, unpolished rice and local chutneys like khurasini (made of a nut) or even til chutney. A big part of the fun is to harvest fruits. ""Families love to go fruit-picking,"" says Chhabra. ""They pick chikoos and bananas (20 varieties are grown here) as well as apples, starfruit and cherries. They also plant seasonal palak, ambat chuk (sour spinach) and local tomatoes."""

In the retail market, the price touched Rs 80/kg and it could well shoot up to Rs 100.Usually, the Belagavi vegetable market depends on Karad tomatoes in summer because of decrease in tomato production in the region.

""The advantage of textiles is they already have a 3D structure so they are great at absorbing light, which in turn speeds up the process of degrading organic matter,"" Rajesh Ramanathan from RMIT University said.The researchers, including Dipesh Kumar and Vipul Bansal, also from RMIT University, worked with copper and silver-based nanostructures, which are known for their ability to absorb visible light. When the nanostructures are exposed to light, they receive an energy boost that creates ""hot electrons."" These release a burst of energy that enables the nanostructures to degrade organic matter.The challenge for researchers has been to bring the concept out of the lab by, working out how to build these nanostructures on an industrial scale and permanently attach them to tex tiles. The team's approach was to grow the nanostructures directly onto the textiles by dipping them into a few solutions, resulting in the development of stable nanostructures within just 30 minutes.When exposed to light, it took less than six minutes for some of the nano-enhanced textiles to spontaneously clean themselves.""Our next step will be to test our nano-enhanced textiles with organic compounds that could be more relevant to consumers, to see how quickly they can handle common stains like tomato sauce or wine,"" Ramanathan said.The research was published in the journal Advanced Materials Interfaces."

And they are all spread out as offering at the Jagannath Temple in Hauz Khas. The Saturday evening aarti is in progress. A group of priests are chanting hymns. Devotees stand reverentially in attendance with folded hands, some with eyes closed. Outside on the terrace, the sounds of mridang, jhaanj and bells ring loud and clear.The setting is perfect for an intersection of food and faith - where every morsel nourishes the body, purifies the soul. And that is what the latest edition of Times Passion Temple Food Trail is all about.Raj Jain, CEO Times Group , put the concept of food trail in perspective. He said that the role of a newspaper is not just to ""talk politics"" but also help everyone ""understand our heritage and culture"". The temple food trail was born out of this idea to provide a platform where everyone could do so, he said.Renowned food historian Pushpesh Pant, who's involved with the initiative as an Experience Architect for the participants, explained the concept of chhappan bhog or mahaprasad.He said that the concept came from the simple mathematical calculation of seven days a week and eight prahars, a three-hour period. He dwelt at length on the 17th chapter of Gita where food is discussed in detail. Pant said that the prasad is satvik in nature with no chillies, potatoes, tomatoes, onion or garlic. ""The prasad is for everyone,"" Pant said referring to its egalitarian character.Some items on the Chhappan bhog list are: dahi bara, peeta, khachudi, khaja, puri, dalma, khua, moog dali and papudi.The participants in the temple food trail also visit temples in Mathura, Vrindavan, Jaipur and Nathdwara. ""In Mathura too, the prasad is called 56 bhog but has a predominance of the madhur ras. The emphasis there is on sweets,"" Pant said. He also pointed out that the nature of the offering changes with the geography of the land.Ravindernath Pradhan, secretary, Sri Nilachal Seva Sangh, spoke at length about the challenges in organizing the event. ""The preparation for the chhappan bhog started around 3am and was over only by 7pm. In all, it took about 16 hours,"" he said. A six member team came especially from Jagannath Temple, Puri to prepare the mahaprasad. ""Satvik bhojan guides us our mind and body in the right direction,"" said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, a senior member of the team.Akrita Kalra, who's participating in trail, said that the evening felt like ""the discovery of a whole new world. ""Even looking at the varieties of offering before the Lord was a feast for the eyes. One got a sense of fulfillment just by looking at it,"" said Kalra, an education counselor by profession.Another participant Smita Dugar said that listening to Pushpesh Pant on food was like hearing a voice right out of a history book. ""I am a pure vegetarian and being a food consultant as well, I wanted to learn about temple food, its origins and history. Mr Pant puts everything in perspective,"" said Dugar."

The organic farming programme was kicked off in the campus on World Environment Day.On Tuesday, power minister Kadakampally Surendran inaugurated the vegetable harvest in the college by plucking ripe tomatoes and brinjal.""Toxic vegetables are one factor that makes people prone to lifestyle diseases like cancer. I request all the students in this campus to start a kitchen garden in your homes so that you can produce your own organic vegetables,"" said the minister after taking part in the first day's harvest.The students have cultivated vegetables in 50 cents in the campus. ""As many as 21 departments are there in this college. We have divided the work of maintaining the organic farm among departments. NCC cadets and teachers also helped us a lot. During weekends, college union office bearers took care of the farm,"" said SFI unit secretary Thasleem T.The idea of the organic farm was mooted by the SFI college unit and was supported by Tropical Agro, an organic company based in Chennai.According to SFI unit president Visakh M S, the organic farm is cent per cent a students' initiative. ""We did everything from setting the ground, planting seeds, watering and now harvesting,"" he said. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan launched the project on June 5 and told the students that he would keep a tab on the progress being made.Students plan to sell the produce and reinvest the money for the next round of farming."

There are still many farmers here who have sowed ragi and are growing vegetables, as BDA contractors go ahead and build shoulder drains along roads that crisscross the layout, readying it for the first 5,000 allottees.A relative of land loser Nagabhushan pointed out to TOI, ""What is the point giving sites to people here? Look at neighbouring Visvesvaraya Layout. More than half the sites are lying vacant. People just buy sites and wait for the value to go up. Are they not speculators? That land is cultivable.

Blame it on shortage owing to the drought-like conditions or the recent traders and commission agents' strike, supply of fruits and veggies in the city has been affected. Plus, the common man has to bear the brunt of the proceedings. Taking cue from all this, a growing number of Puneites are increasingly turning to home gardening, an organic way of life, in order to rely less on the market.It's been four years since Sunita Gaikwad, a retired teacher, stopped heading out for her daily requirement of fruits and vegetables. ""Prices were escalating even then. That's when I decided to turn to home growing produce,"" said Sunita, who converted her 2000-sqft terrace into a garden. From coriander and chillies to fruits like pomegranates and figs, Sunita's garden is home to a variety of produce. She's found difference in quality and taste while cooking with home-grown produce. ""Besides the obvious joy of eating from one's own garden, the vegetables are fresher and high on taste, sans pesticides,"" said Sunita, who sources good-quality seeds from a local nursery, at a minimal cost.If you thought growing at home is only possible with the luxury of a sprawling space, think again. Anuradha Sawhney, a resident of Uday Baug, achieves similar results in a small space. ""For my food service, my focus was on using organic ingredients. I was never sure if what was availalbe in the market was organic,"" said Anuradha, who turned to growing produce in her limited terrace space. Learning to use the limited space was a challenge. But she adopted methods like vertical gardening and 'living pots'. ""It's a myth that space is a constraint. One needs to use what's available, effectively. I grow everything, from capsicum, asparagus, rajma and spinach, to the exceptionally hot bhut jolokia chilli,"" she added.Individuals turning to home gardening isn't new in town, but several housing societies have taken to gardening in community. For Nina Shah and Kalpana Lapsiya, residents of NIBM area, the idea of a common terrace garden happened by chance. ""Our major need was to minimise the wet garbage being generated daily. After necessary permission, we initiated the pilot project on our building terrace first,"" said Kalpana. The building members began generating vermicompost from their wet garbage in the 25 odd bins provided by the society and local corporator. When seeds in the wet garbage began germinating, they decided to use the facility to grow produce. ""We've grown brinjal, tomatoes, curry leaves and lemon grass and fruits like mangoes, papaya and jamun. The process was however hampered by the drought. We are tying up with an NGO that will provide basic training and a volunteer who'll monitor the compost generation daily and will resume work soon,"" Kalpana added.Today, there's nothing one can't learn online. But just last week, a group of city gardening enthusiasts, met at Kamala Nehru Park near Deccan Gymkhana, to share gardening tips and exchange plant seeds and cuttings. ""Our online group that started this year has over 90 members from Pune alone. We felt the need to meet in person because there's much to learn from each other in practice, beyond the photos and links online,"" shared Sadhana Sarpotdar, who spearheaded the meet of over 20 members.Besides sharing tips and exchanging seeds, gardening expert Ashok Marathe shared insights on the kinds of produce that could be home grown. ""Every meet now will be dedicated to training members to become better gardeners. The meet next month will focus on effective vermiculture,"" Sadhana added. ""Gone are days when growing at home was restricted to few people. With access to knowledge online, anyone can start off now. Many people I know grow their own produce. Whenever we meet, we also exchange seeds or cuttings. Chat groups to guide each other have also gained pace,"" Anuradha added.Not just individuals, but city chefs also rely on home-grown produce. For Tanuj Sinha and Swati Jindal, who run a meal kit service, quality and freshness are key. ""We source ingredients like lemon and mint from friends into home gardening. Besides these, we rely on larger enterprises for other farm-fresh supply,"" said Tanuj, adding that space is the only reason they haven't started growing their own produce yet, but they are open to the idea in future. Now running a pure vegan service, Anuradha continues to grow Thai basil and spearmint that find place in her recipes. Chef Ajmer Singh, a city bistro chef-incharge, also goes for produce from his herb garden, for sheer freshness sans any harmful pesticides. ""Growing herbs like thyme and rosemary isn't difficult. They require the right amount of water and sunlight,"" he shared.Growing produce at home works on the lines of zero budget farming, say these enthusiasts. ""There's minimal expenditure as compared to yield. Seeds are reasonable and kitchen waste serves as an ideal fertiliser that I then blend in with coco peat and cow dung,"" shared Wanowrie-based Prescilla Braggs, who recently turned to home growing produce. Besides pureeing and introducing vegetable and kitchen waste into plants as a fertiliser, Anuradha suggests that some everyday items, like white vinegar, neem and turmeric are effective pesticides. ""One does not need huge earthen pots that cost money and take up space. Sturdy gunny bags can do the job,"" said Anuradha."

Unable to marry her because his wife was not granting him divorce, he hatched a plot to bump her off.In late 2009, Dedhia, who then lived in Meghchhaya Apartments, Lalbaug, with his parents, wife and son, was led to Hasruddin Malik, a tomato vendor, by a vegetable vendor, Rajnikant Wagh. Malik, in turn, made him meet Nazim Khan, a taxi driver. On October 4, Dedhia, Malik and Khan met at Lalbaug and worked out the particulars of the conspiracy. Malik and Khan were to carry out the killing. The amount offered for the 'supari' was Rs 1 lakh.Early morning on October 27, Dedhia prodded Beena to go on their usual walk. Around 5.30am, Malik and Khan, who were on a motorcycle, with Khan riding pillion, attacked Beena. She was stabbed on the neck, but afraid that she may not succumb to her injury, Dedhia told Khan to finish the job properly. Khan then stabbed Beena twice in the stomach. Jitendra made himself suffer minor injuries and made the crime look like an incident of chain snatching horribly gone wrong. The police initially probed the chain snatching angle, but about a month later received information that the murder was contract killing (after solving the case, the police said that three previous attempts had been made on Beena's life).On December 17, 2009, acting on a tip-off, the crime branch arrested Khan, who used to live in Vijay Nagar, Antop Hill. The police said that during interrogation, he revealed the name of Malik. It was Malik who spilled the beans on the conspiracy.Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian told TOI that the clinching evidence was Dedhia's call data records, which showed that he had contacted the killers half an hour before the attack, telling them about the area of the morning walk. She said what sealed the case was the recovery of the murder weapon, a knife, from the killers, an advance payment of Rs 29,000 made by Dedhia and a photograph of Beena provided by him.The quantum of sentence against the three convicts will be decided by sessions Judge Sanjay Patil after prosecution and defence present arguments on Monday. The maximum sentence under the charge of murder is death while the minimum is life imprisonment. Wagh had been earlier acquitted. The Dedhia couple's son was 11 when the crime was committed. Dedhia hails from Kutch, and owned and ran a grocery store in Lalbaug."

Kudumbasree units will be roped in to make compost. This will be sold or used by the units involved in farming. Non-biodegradable waste will be collected at regular intervals and taken to a collection centre where a recycling mechanism will be set up, or it will be handed over to some agency. Use of compost and biofertilizers for farming will help soil conservation.The Kudumbasree members hope Poliv will prove to be a success, more than their earlier initiatives such as making soaps, lotions, or even mushroom farming which did not find a large enough market.Last year, the panchayat got the award for maximum output at the district agri fete held in connection with the District Kudumbasree Mission anniversary."

Photo: AFPTheres not a lot of green in the urban jungle of Sao Paulo, but thanks to Fernanda Danelon, restaurants in the Brazilian mega-city are turning their waste back into food at innovative gardens tucked amid the skyscrapers.Ms. Danelon, a 43-year-old journalist by training, quit her day job two years ago to launch the Guandu Institute, which recycles restaurants food waste and helps them set up gardens to put all that compost to good use.Cities in Brazil, the economic giant of Latin America, throw out more than 75 million tons of trash a year, according to the Brazilian Association of Public Sanitation Companies (ABRELPE).About half of it is organic waste, according to the Brazilian environment ministry.There are no municipal recycling or composting programs to reduce all that garbage, and triaging trash is a foreign concept to most Brazilians.The country recycles about three per cent of its waste, according to ABRELPE.To fill the void, Ms. Danelon decided to put her passion for composting and gardening to work on behalf of restaurants in her hometown.Turning into compostHer organisation collects restaurants food waste at their doors, turns them into compost over the course of three to four months, and delivers the compost back to the restaurants to fertilize in-house gardens  which the institute also helps them set up and maintain.She started with just one restaurant. Today, she has 17, and is in talks with 10 more. At first, I collected the trash myself in my car, Ms. Danelon said with a laugh as she turned over dirt with a shovel in the leafy courtyard of her house in Sao Paulo.But now weve grown, and today we recycle 30 to 40 tonnes of organic waste per month.Her partners include French restaurant Le Bilboquet, in the chic downtown neighbourhood of Jardins.With Ms. Danelons help, the restaurant now has cherry tomatoes, lemons and lavender plants growing on its rooftop, a stones throw from the skyscrapers of the Brazilian economic capitals financial district.Its French chef, 34-year-old Julien Mercier, signed up for Ms. Danelons program six months ago.What we grow here isnt enough to supply the whole restaurant. But the important thing is to understand that were part of a process. These things are growing here, and we can also boast that we recycle a tonne-and-a-half of organic waste every month, he told AFP as he inspected his vegetables and herbs.The waste is composted at a facility about 50 km (30 miles) outside the city, where it is mixed with earth and allowed to biodegrade over the course of months.It is a traditional composting technique, without enzymes or earthworms to accelerate the process, said Ms. Danelon. But with a little patience, all that waste turns into rich, nutrient-packed compost.The average 50-table restaurant pays 900 reals ($275) a month for the composting and gardening service  about the same as the municipal waste collection fee.We have to look squarely at our own waste, value it and know that it can be reused, said Ms. Danelon.Starter kitsShe offers starter kits for people looking to make their own compost at home. More and more people are contacting her to ask about setting up communal gardens on the roofs of their apartment buildings, she said.At Mesa III, a deli in a working-class neighbourhood, customers are greeted by basil, sage and rosemary plants ever since the Guandu Institute trained the staff.If we as a society realise how much trash were producing, well see its just atrocious, said owner Ana Soares, 63.Her restaurant has installed a recycling system for glass and switched to cardboard take-out containers to cut down on plastic. Thats why we joined this beautiful project, she said. We have to learn to look at things in a new way.  AFP"

But there is no provision to award compensation to crops damaged by monkeys. But at least 30 per cent of crops are damaged by the primates.Officials of the Forest Department told the farmers to give a representation through the farmers association. Following this, the farmers at the meeting passed a resolution and handed over it to the district administration seeking steps from the government to make crop damage caused by monkeys eligible for compensation.Wild boarsFarmers from various areas complained that wild boars were continuously entering into agricultural lands causing damage to crops such as groundnuts. They said that the population of wild boars is on the increase in certain pockets.S. Kalanithi, district forest officer, said following representation from farmers, an enumeration of wild boars was taken up in the district. This has been sent to the government. The government will take a policy-level decision on how to control wild boar population. Till then, we will be able to compensate for damages caused by the animals.

While Karnataka is the largest producer of arecanut and coffee in India, it stands third in coconut production. The market turmoil has hit arecanut and coconut right around harvest, when supplies are most abundant and grain prices are at seasonal lows.""For the last 15 years, farmers in western ghats and the coast have benefited from both increased production and higher price - leading to rising rural income and declining poverty rates. That happy story may now be nearing its end - which could be the precursor to a renewed crisis in the agriculture sector of the state which is struggling to overcome from the spate of farmer suicides last year,"" N Raghavendra, agriculture expert from Shivamogga, said.The price of a quintal of high-quality red arecanut has plummeted to Rs 24,000-Rs 25,000 from Rs 35,000 last year, while other normal varieties ranges from Rs 18,000 to 20,000. The crisis, the growers complain, is due to abundant supply from Saarc countries after India opened up the market last year.""We have been getting cheap quality arecanut from Sri Lanka and it's being procured by Gutka-manufacturing companies. More than 1.01 lakh tonne of arecanut was imported till August 2016,"" said Ravi G, a member of Malnad Arecanut Marketing Cooperative Society.The situtation of coconut growers is no different. They are in a deeper crisis owing to price crash partly because of imports and bumper harvests in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The price of coconut, which until recently cost between Rs 20 and Rs 30 in the wholesale markets, crashed to below Rs 10, the lowest since 2006. A quintal of copra was hovering around Rs 6,500- Rs 7,000 in Tiptur, a major copra market of the state, while it was Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000 a year ago.The coffee season has also ended on a tepid note for growers. The farm gate price of the new arabica parchment is still hovering between Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,500 per 50 kg bag compared to Rs 10,000-Rs 11,000 last year. Attributing the current downtrend to excess global supplies and recession, Naveen Somaiah, a grower in Kodagu, said: ""The future looks bleak for us considering the problems we have been facing with shortage of labour and high production cost.''MSP for cash cropsWhile the Centre has assured it would look into the request to restrict import, chief minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with growers last week, told them that the state could not intervene since there's no provision to declare minimum support price (MSP) for cash crops. The growers want the state to set up revolving fund to tackle the crisis.Tomato growers see redThe price of tomato has plummeted to Re 1 per kg following heavy arrivals at wholesale markets across Karnataka. At retail shops in tomato-grown villages, it was being sold at Rs 5-Rs 6 per kg while in the wholesale market, the price was Re 1 per kg on Sunday, said APMC officials. Farmers held a protest in some places by spilling the vegetable on road demanding government's intervention.State bags awardThe Karnataka government has bagged the 'DL Shah Award-Platinum' at the 11th national quality conclave hosted by the Quality Council of India. Rashtriya e-Market Services MD and additional secretary, Manoj Ranjan, who spoke on 'Online agricultural markets-Karnataka model' highlighted the problems plaguing the marketing sector. He deliberated on the model's success in ensuring transparency in the functioning of markets by adopting better technology options.Of the 157 agricultural markets, 142 transact online, a first-of-its-kind in the country. The online markets have 25 lakh registered farmers.""Till date, we have traded 49 lakh lots with cumulative volume of 320 lakh quintals, valued at Rs 26,000 crore on the electronic platform."

When he increased the quantum of fertiliser used, the yield increased. However, his fertiliser costs increased from 6,000 to 15,000 a year. Sensing that something was amiss, he sent soil samples from his field for testing.That's when he found out that his soil had low nitrogen and carbon levels. Thangaraj is not alone in his dilemma. Nitrogen and organic carbon levels of much of the agricultural land in the district has plunged over the past few years.An analysis of the soil across across the district has revealed that 90% of the samples tested were found to be short of nitrogen and organic carbon, critical elements for healthy growth and absorption of nutrition for agriculture and horticulture crops. The agriculture department started testing soil samples under the Mission Soil Health Card' scheme in 2015 and so far has tested 26,000 samples.""On a scale of 1, organic carbon content was found to be less than 0.5, the desired level, in 11 of the 12 blocks in the district,"" said soil scientist and tester, Gurusamy.""This means that the crop will not be able retain essential nutrition from the soil like phosphorus, potassium and calcium, and thus humans and animals too miss out on those nutrients when consuming the crop,"" said Arumugam Karthikeyan, plant pathologist and scientist at the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding.As part of the study, the agri department had divided 3.3 lakh hectares of cultivable land into grids of 10 hectare. To identify soil health, all a farmer needs to do is submit his land survey number to the block's agricultural department, and based on the grid his land falls under, he will get the results. ""We can prescribe the sort of crops he can cultivate, ways to reverse a bad situation like low nitrogen, carbon or phosphorus content and the inputs he requires,"" said the deputy director of the agriculture department, Coimbatore, Mohammed Iqbal.""While one hectare of land is supposed to have 280kg of nitrogen, in many parts of the district the nitrogen content was as low as 90kg. In fact, the average content was only 100kg,"" said Gurusamy.One of the main reasons behind this situation is intensive agriculture practices, say officials. ""Cultivating throughout the year without giving the soil a break, cutting and removing all leaves instead of putting it back into the soil, or even choosing varieties with low leaf production, has depleted the soil of its nutrients,"" said Iqbal.Restoring the nitrogen in the soil is a complicated process. ""The easiest way to deal with low carbon or nitrogen content is planting green manure crops for a couple of months, then mixing unused parts of the crop into the soil as it encourages growth of organisms,"" said retired soil scientist V Krishnamurthy. ""Farmers should also follow crop rotation,"" he futher said."

The nadan variety is locally available and the shelf life is too short. However, the market price for it is nearly half of the apple variety. The apple variety is in high demand in the market, he says.Shift in cropsTomato farmers of Vattavada and Kanthallur say that they shifted to other vegetables due to lack of timely procurement.Unlike other vegetables such as cabbage, potato, beetroot, and carrot, the harvest of ripe tomatoes cannot be delayed even for a day.We have to harvest them even if there is no demand for it, says Planisami of Vattavada. He added that it was one of the reasons for the farmers to abandon tomato cultivation.He said that timely procurement and proper storage facility were the need of the hour.

Experts say no change is likely for at least a month.The city's supply of tomatoes is down by almost half, largely because of limited cultivation this year in areas like Nashik and Narayangaon. Other vegetables particularly cauliflower, green leafy vegetables, capsicum, chillies and garlic also face a similar scenario. Their rates have also soared over the past few weeks.According to those dealing with the commodities in the wholesale market, the situation is particularly worrisome this year with rainfall hardly picking up evenly across the state. Some express fear of a further upward spiral in prices, with supply coming from Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and even northern parts of the country selling at high rates. in the wholesale market.So limited is the stock reaching the city that the wholesale market clears out in just a few hours, said Anna Gule, who is in-charge of the fruits and vegetable sub-section of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Describing the problems affecting the supply, Gule said, ""The inflow of vegetables is down by more than 40%. Besides tomatoes, prices of coriander and other green leafy vegetables are sky-rocketing. The problem is the lack of water in all vegetable growing districts. Unless the monsoon compensates for the drought, the situation is unlikely to change.The only saving grace has been onion, which has been cultivated in abundance this year, so its prices are stable till now.""The situation this year is completely different from the summer of 2015, when tomato growers sold their produce at throwaway prices, said city-based retailer Amol Tambe. , a city-based retailer who buys directly from them. ""Such was the glut of the tomato crop last year, that farmers actually got very poor market rate for their produce in the summer months. Prices, however, had surged around October and November 2015. This year water scarcity has meant dry fields for long stretches. As a result, the quality selling for Rs 45-55 a kilo hardly has any takers. Prices could stabilize by mid-July if it rains sufficiently in the next few weeks,"" he said.The steadily rising prices have already impacted the Consumer Price Index for May. Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed food inflation shot up to 7.55% in May, from 6.32% a month ago.Consumers, though unhappy, have no option but to adjust. City resident Seema Mangaonkar said, ""With the surge in prices, there are many things that are currently out of reach for me. We have no option but to adjust with the spiralling prices"".Another citizen Anshula Madan said, ""Tomatoes are a must in our cooking, so we buy and use them in limited quantities. Some of the really expensive vegetables are not even in season, so I pick what is easily available and reasonably priced."""

The past week witnessed the election campaign of Donald Trump descend into a vortex of violence against protestors and the media, to a point where the candidate had no choice but to cancel a major rally in Chicago.Those observing Mr. Trumps campaign know that the wave of intolerance characterising it has been, for months, laced with a snarling undertone of aggression towards critical opinion in general  aggression that was focussed on the media until recently.Speaking of political journalists earlier, Mr. Trump said: I do hate them... Some of them are such lying, disgusting people [Theyre] among the most dishonest groups of people Ive ever met.At the receiving endLast week, the media continued to face his wrath, though he has arguably been the biggest beneficiary of news media coverage of the Republican presidential campaign.Last Tuesday, Michelle Fields, reporter with the conservative Breitbart website that is friendly towards Mr. Trump, said that her arm was violently pulled by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as she was trying to ask Mr. Trump a question.Although Mr. Trumps campaign denied the accusation, Ms. Fields tweeted a photograph of the bruise on her arm and this week she and one of her colleagues resigned from Breitbart, saying the site should be ashamed of the way she was treated. One week before this, a photographer for Time Magazine was subjected to a chokehold by a Secret Service agent in Virginia after he stepped outside the press area to photograph protesters.While Mr. Trump has made no bones about his distaste for the media, of late he has also turned his ire towards protestors at his swelling rallies, reprising his famous Youre fired! punchline from The Apprentice, the U.S. reality game show that he created, with Get em out of here!, a signal for Secret Service agents to eject protesters from his rallies.That somewhat jarring, but relatively contained, spectacle has acquired a menacing edge in the past few months as Mr. Trump has apparently started encouraging his supporters at rallies to hit back.In early February in Iowa, Mr. Trump said: If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the [expletive] out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay?... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees.During a rally in Las Vegas last month, he said about protesters: You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? Theyd be carried out in a stretcher, folks... Id like to punch him in the face...Earlier this month he said during a rally in Warren, Michigan, Get him out! Try not to hurt him. If you do, Ill defend you in court.In the past week, he has reprised his promise to pay the legal fees of a man who was arrested after throwing a face-punch at an unsuspecting Black Lives Matter protester.The man got carried away, Mr. Trump said in media interviews after the assault, adding: He obviously loves his country, and maybe he doesnt like seeing whats happening to the country.Perhaps bristling at having had to cancel his Chicago rally because he didnt want to see people hurt or worse, Mr. Trump attempted to blame Vermont Senator and Democratic Party underdog Bernie Sanders for the protests.While both Mr. Sanders and Democratic nomination front runner Hillary Clinton have blasted Mr. Trump for fuelling violence amid his supporters, even Mr. Trumps Republican rivals such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz have come out saying Mr. Trump has created a toxic environment at rallies.At the heart of Mr. Trumps campaign rhetoric is a constant allusion to the U.S. having become a weak and scared nation, the reason his campaign promises to Make America Great Again. Yet, many wonder if this notion of an angry America  a pejorative assessment of the grand strides made by the Obama administration after the Great Recession  could ever set the tone for a successful Trump presidency, terrifying as that prospect seems to many Americans.Apart from the media, protesters at Trumps rallies have been at the receiving end of his ire"

He received a subsidy of Rs 9.35 lakh under the National Horticulture Mission scheme (2013-2014) for his 2,000 sq. metre poly green house.He gets a premium price for the flowers (Rs. 150 to Rs. 180 per bunch of 20 flowers) during Valentines Day, New Year and Christmas festival and a nominal price of Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 / bunch during the rest of the year.Mr. Reddy, a pioneer in this poly green house cultivation, motivated nearly 15 farmers in this village to take up cut flower production under poly green houses. As such, an area of 30,000 square metres has been brought under poly green house cultivation. And, the village is now a cluster for poly green houses, according to S. Raja Mohamed, Joint Director of Horticulture, Krishnagiri.Inspecting cultivation of roses in poly green house and implementation of various horticulture schemes in Hosur block on Saturday, S.

With conducive agro climatic conditions, Krishnagiri District, considered the hub of poly green houses, has the largest area under mangoes, tomatoes and roses in the State. Horticulture crops are grown on 57,414 hectares and production is to the tune of 4.71 lakh tonnes. In the district, nearly 27 lakh sq.metre area was brought under poly green house cultivation especially in blocks like Hosur, Thally, Kelamangalam and Shoolagiri, Mr. Mohamed said.Cut flower roses are being exported to countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and United Arab Emirates and a variety of roses are cultivated here."

We serve a wide range of food items - tomato rice, curd rice, vada. We have it all, says Saraswathi, who is part of a self-help group that prepares and sells food out of mobile vans. The food is prepared at home, loaded in large containers, and taken to different locations.The sales used to be high when the concept of selling food out of vans started in the city. But now-a-days we are facing stiff competition. Nevertheless, we usually have an agreement among ourselves not to sell the same item, says the driver of a food van near GKNM Hospital. Another problem that the owners of these vans face is packets that remain unsold.They also say that sales are usually low during the summer months compared to the rest of the year. We get about 70 customers a day. The group members invested the initial funds. After that, they received financial support from the government. Now, it is a profitable venture, says Saraswathi.There are about 2,000 such vans in the city and many of them are run by women self-help groups. They need to get a licence for this from several departments. In any given location, only one mobile unit functions within one km radius.A. Mujibur Rahman and G.

It is becoming popular now as customers get a wide variety at prices lower than that of hotels, says Ms. Begum. Since food is prepared and served by a group or a family and there is a continuous demand, it is a profitable venture, she says.Like hotels, we do not need tables, chairs and fans. That is the reason why the price is lesser by Rs.5 to Rs.10 compared to hotels and we will not function on Sundays, she adds.Some serve non-vegetarian dishes too. At the beginning, we would cook meat around three kg. But customers order biryani more than any other variety, and now we cook 10 kg of meat every day.Some vans donate the remaining food to non-government organisations for distribution to the needy.(With inputs fromS.

There is crop loss in many districts of Tamil Nadu leading to a dip in availability of select vegetables here, said a vendor.Its not vegetable prices that are going up. The price of chicken has also gone up, with a kilo being sold at Rs.135 in retail poultry outlets in Ernakulam. Chicken was sold in the Rs.100 range earlier. Sales have been affected in view of the increase in prices, said a trader in Aluva.Customers have no relief as the prices of fish varieties seem to be scaling up.

Prateep Kumar, has been supportive in guiding her to use the right texture of soil and quality vermicompost to grow organic vegetables. It took me three months of groundwork for the first harvest. A full-fledged garden needs a lot of planning and organising, says the homemaker.From sourcing quality seeds to sowing them, personally tending the plants to distributing the produce to workers and neighbours along with promoting organic food in a big way, Ms. Prasuna pays personal attention to every step of gardening. I derive immense satisfaction in the process. The more we consume organic food; the better will be our health. Moreover, it is an effective workout and an excellent relaxation technique, she says.The harvest not only caters to Ms. Prasunas kitchen needs but also to a number of staff members.Earlier, this backyard was dotted with snake pits and weeds. Today, the same place has beds of coriander leaves, spinach, tomatoes, mint, bachala and other varieties that will yield not less than 200 kg. Sustained efforts help in understanding the technicalities of gardening.For instance, the kind of soil required for assorted vegetables.Over a period of time, we will come to know scientific farming dynamics, adds Ms. Prasuna, who spends four to five hours a day in her garden.Nelli Prasuna says from just a hobby, gardening has become a part of her life"

Kolar Deputy Commissioner K.V. Trilokchandra has conceived an idea of converting tomato into animal fodder. He has submitted a plan to the State government, which has given the green signal for setting up a plant at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard in Kolar.Mr. Trilokchandra got the idea after seeing a huge quantity of the vegetable being abandoned at the yard, one of the largest tomato marketing yards in Asia. On an average, transactions involving 150-200 tonnes take place every day during lean season. About 15 tonnes are wasted during loading and unloading. At the same time, farmers dump huge quantities of tomatoes on the roadside when there is a glut. Now, this will be fed into the plant that will turn it into a lycopene-rich meal for poultry, cattle, pig, and fish. The plant is coming up on a 5,000 sq. ft. site at a cost of Rs. 1 crore and expected to produce around 20 tonnes of fodder every month, Mr. Trilokchandra said told The Hindu . The plant would be the first of its kind in the country, he said and added that the State government will provide money under the Challenge Fund, which is meant to encourage innovative projects.The methodLycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, which gives the red colour to tomatoes. It would be the main ingredient to produce the feed.The manufacture of fodder from tomato involves the following steps: Crushing waste through a roller, expeller and vibrator; dewatering of solid residue using a water extractor (centrifuge); cooking of solid residue using microwave reactor and dehydration of the cooked solid residue using alcohol in a microwave reactor."

The deceased was identified as Purushottam Dehuri who hailed from Janardanpur village under Sadar Block. According to sources, Dehuri consumed poison on Tuesday night and was admitted to the district headquarters hospital at Keonjhar town. He breathed his last in the morning. The deceased had taken loans amounting to Rs.40,000 from different sources, and had cultivated tomato in two acres of land. But the crop was damaged due to scanty rainfall.Of the three other cases, two were reported from Balangir and Bargarh districts in western Odisha where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally a few weeks ago, and one from Dhenkanal.The State government, however, has not admitted a single such death of farmer to be due to crop loss or debt burden although it has admitted in the State Assembly a few days ago that 175 farmers had committed suicide in the State during 2015-16.Enquiries by the respective district administrations showed that none of the farmers ended their lives due to crop failure, said School and Mass Education Minister Debi Prasad Mishra while making a statement on behalf of Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy in the House.Mr. Mishra had said that the State government was not in favour of giving compensation to families of farmers who committed suicide because the move may encourage others to end their lives.

It was done in association with the Consulate of Israel in Bangalore.The festival spread included Mediterranean, Arabic and East European cuisines, made from local ingredients.In an interview with City Express, Chef Shachar Aschengrau spoke about different aspects of Israeli cuisine.Chef Aschengrau started his culinary journey 25 years ago, at an Israeli coffee shop and since then has been through different geographies and jobs. I have worked in several countries, even in Japan and Mexico, trying my hands at several things like TV shows, teaching at gastronomical schools, training teams at restaurants and even writing about food for blogs and newspapers, he says.But through it all, his love for Israeli cuisine remained. I am constantly intrigued by its diversity and sub-cuisines, he says. The chef keeps trying variations of the recipes, without straying too far from the traditional.His idol, in cooking, is the famous Israeli chef Haim Cohen. Chef Haim was among the very first ones, outside of Middle East, to use local ingredients to create traditional Israeli food, says Chef Aschengrau .Despite being inspired by the local, Chef Aschengrau knows how important it is to tailor traditional dishes to suit different palates. I have learnt a great deal just by observing my culinary comrades, says the chef. The most significant takeaway was learning and acquiring the skill to differentiate the same dishes in order to match the palate of local diners.Israeli cuisine has a tremendous variety in traditional foods. We often eat them at home because they are easy to make and quite filling, he says. A chopped Israeli salad is often served on the side. Some of the other dishes are bourekas, falafel, hummus, pita bread, shawarma and sahlab among others.People in Bengaluru love experimenting with their food and different cuisines. But, Israeli cuisine is less familiar. Will it be appreciated by diners here? When it comes to food, it is nearly impossible to educate someone, says the chef. If you are a food enthusiast, the dishes will definitely appeal to you.The ingredients used in Israeli cuisine  cinnamon, cardamom, garlic, tomato, olive oil, chilies and sesame seeds  are similar to ones that are used in India. In the food fest, the texture and blend of spices will be different, says Chef Aschengrau. The well-travelled chef finds it fascinating how every ingredient influences the dining experience.Israels culinary tradition has a history of three thousand years, he says. Over this period, our cooking has been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, even by religious and ethnic groups. But, some ingredients, such as olives, figs, dates, pomegranates, wheat, barley and grapes, have stayed.People prefer healthy, organic and more local foods, and I am serving these, he says . I believe in the best quality ingredients that will suit diners palate... It is time to go back to basics, offering dishes that are simple, yet exotic.The food fest, at Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, will be on till August 26."

That is a one time bonanza; our government is using the money to spend three times as much on rural roads, crop insurance and other means which will have a more long term effect on rural Indias well being, he said.Mocks RahulMr. Jaitley mocked the Congress vice president, the great grandson, grandson and son of former prime ministers of India, over his reeling out the price of staples in the Parliament.Any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics, he said, and referred to how everyone seems to be giving the impression that they go to the market everyday.Hopes of good monsoonInsisting that the government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Mr. Jaitley said he expected it to reduce further with a good monsoon.

Paddy cultivation has been affected extensively in Alappuzha and Malappuram districts, the total estimated area under the crop hit by the heat conditions being 604 hectares.Bunched bananas in an area of more than 230 hectares have been lost, mostly in Thiruvananthapuram. Seventy-one hectares of non-bunched bananas also have been hit by the persisting hot weather conditions.Reports from Thiruvanthapuram, Kollam and Alappuzha districts said that around 11 hectares under betel vines had been hit.Around 60 per cent yield reduction is the least of the fallouts of the heat conditions, said a department official, who pointed out that vegetable cowpea, tomato and brinjal would be the most-affected vegetable crops.The most visible effect of the dry condition is the sharp drop in neera production. Production of the unfermented sweet sap from coconut flowers has fallen by about 65 per cent over a month, said Biju John, chief executive officer of Thirukochi Coconut Producer Company (TCPC).The average yield of around two litres of neera per day per tree in wetter conditions has fallen to between 600 and 800 ml a day, he added. The situation is difficult for companies like TCPC because the business is just taking off the ground and there is a big demand for neera in the market, said Mr. John.K.

In a wholesale outlet in the Chala market, beans were being sold at Rs.130 a kg, and tomato at Rs.40.The price of salad cucumber has shot up to Rs.38 from Rs.15, and beetroot to Rs.45 from Rs.28. In retails outlets, beans are being sold for anywhere between Rs.120 to Rs.135. The variation in prices depended somewhat on the wilting and damage to the vegetables, retail shop owners said.Those looking to savour the crunch and flavour of coriander as garnish are being forced to think again before buying the leaves, as the prices are hovering around Rs.160 a kg. Lemon prices traditionally increase in summer, but this year has seen them rise to Rs.12 for a single lemon. Lack of stock was to blame, a vegetable vendor at Karamana said.Chilli and capsicum too are expensive, while a host of veggies have shown minor price increase. The quality of vegetables was poor and a lot had to be thrown away because they started rotting quickly in the heat, the vendor said.There was not much decline in arrival of stock, but for veggies such as salad cucumber and capsicum that came from Bangalore. We did not get a load on Saturday and Sunday from Bangalore, as there is no stock there, the wholesaler outlet owner said.Vegetables such as tomatoes and ladys finger were particularly vulnerable to the heat, he said.While prices are a tad less in Horticorp outlets, they suffer from stock shortage and poor quality, and make up for it with purchases from Chala.Beans cost Rs.98 a kg in Horticorp outlets, and lemon Rs.140 for a kg. Salad cucumber costs Rs.42 a kg, and coriander Rs.120.Fruits such as oranges, guava, and pineapple too have become costly. Oranges cost Rs.120 a kg, pineapple Rs.50 to Rs.60, and guava Rs.100, a vendor at Poojappura said.Shops, both wholesale and retail, are stocking only what is needed.

Telegraph picture Finally, things have started moving in the right direction at the Jharkhand Mega Food Park at Getalsud, on the outskirts of capital Ranchi, providing a much-needed impetus to the long-delayed facility that is eyeing debut in the next couple of months. Kitchenmate, a firm owned by Ranchi-based entrepreneur Seema Jain and one of the first six companies to have shown interest in setting up shops, held bhumipoojan at the food park in Angara block, around 25km from the city, on Sunday. The Rs 4.75-crore unit, which has been allotted a one-acre plot, is likely to come up in five-six months. Kitchenmate managing director Seema (51) said the unit would process tomato, green chilli, garlic, tamarind etc for preparing paste/pure, ketchup and batter for idli, dosa, and bada under ready-to-cook and ready-to-serve categories. ""It will take another five-six months to complete the construction and start operations. We will procure vegetables from Bundu and Tamar blocks of Ranchi district, apart from Gumla and Lohardaga, for the unit with an installed capacity of 5MT ready-to-cook produces per day and 4MT ready-to-serve products per day,"" she told The Telegraph. Seema, a postgraduate in applied chemistry from Bhopal University, is a first generation entrepreneur. She and her husband Suresh Jain, who is a PhD in environmental sciences, are very enthusiastic about this venture that proposes to employ 20 local people for operations and maintenance. Food park project manager Rakesh Sahay said the Kitchenmate unit would help farmers earn better returns on their vegetables grown in different parts of Jharkhand, apart from making better use of forest produces. Kitchenmate is one of the six food processing companies, with interests ranging from tomato puree to green peas and cashew nut processing, that are expected to set up units soon at the 56-acre park, which can accommodate as many as 30 units. The other five - Eastern Manufacturing & Exports (frozen potato patties), Raha Enterprises (frozen snacks), Vijay Cashew Processing (cashew nut processing) and Mishti Foods & Engineering (tomato powder and vegetable dehydration) and Jharkhand Green Peas (green peas processing) - are likely to follow suit soon. Their cumulative investment will be around Rs 20 crores. Sources said the Rs 114 crore mega food park, the foundation of which was laid way back in 2009 by then Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay, was likely to be inaugurated within a couple of months. The park will have facilities like cold storage, warehouses, ripening chamber, water storage, power supply and effluent treatment plant (ETP) for the use of food processing units."

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam said the thorny brinjal was cultivated in many parts of the district such as Kollaimedu, Usoor and Chenganatham.People in Vellore mostly prefer to eat thorny brinjal than those supplied from other parts of the State such as Krishnagiri and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. It is like Vellores own variety and is fast-moving as it is fresh when brought to the market. However, the yield is poor due to rain, as the flowers are damaged.Hence, the rate has gone up from Rs.30-Rs.40 to Rs.60-Rs.80 per kg, he said. Apart from this, the rates of majority of vegetables continue to be normal. A kilo of tomatoes is priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while onions cost Rs. 12 to Rs. 18.

Although pre-fried, the potato chunks are grilled and heated at the caf, and retain their crunchy cover.We spot a baked vada pav (Rs. 70), and give into temptation, adding an indulgent order of mushroom black pepper petit (Rs. 110), which is a Danish open bread topped with mozzarella.

""We used to live in abject poverty... travelling to Burdwan four times a year in search of work. We used to survive on a swill of wheat and maize... we had it on salpata, once a day. Sometimes, we would go to the forests and gather leaves,"" Tudu, 45, said. Four years ago Trickle Up, a US-based NGO, met Tudu at her Mahuldanga village in Purulia's Boro block. Officials of the NGO urged Tudu and her neighbours to form a self-help group. ""We were apprehensive. How would we give Rs 10 a week to form a group?"" she said. Trickle Up gave them Rs 11,280 as seed money. Officials told Tudu and the others that they would help them farm, rear livestock and sell their produce if each of them could save Rs 10 a week. So Tudu and nine of her friends formed Maranguri Mahila Samity. They bought goats, chickens and ducks. ""We took land on lease and started growing gourds, chillies, tomatoes and ladies fingers. We take our produce to the Jan Bazaar haat,"" Tudu said. ""Sometimes, Trickle Up takes our produce to bigger markets in the city. We made a profit of Rs 36,000 over three years."" Tudu, Anima Manna from Sambhunagar, Rina Das from Gosaba in the Sunderbans and Pushpa Dherkuri from Sundargarh in Odisha shared their stories at a city hotel. The family income of each of these ""ultrapoor"" women ranges from Rs 100-150 a day. ""The ultrapoor have two primary issues - food security and continuous employment,"" said Amalendu Pal, Asia regional representative of Trickle Up. The NGO encourages multiple skill development such as farming and rearing livestock while providing access to financial services in three of the poorest states - Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha.

""NRLM was launched in 2011 with the idea of establishing effective financial institutions for the poor and building a cadre of rural women who can drive the programme further,"" said Paritosh Upadhyay of Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society. It is imperative to keep a watch on the most vulnerable families in these self-help groups, he said.

Agriculture professors and farmers on the ground hailed the pro-agrarian sweep of the Union Budget. Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) professor A. Wadood, who was admittedly overwhelmed with Jaitley's proposals, said, ""Notwithstanding several other grey areas, for a change, we should all be happy that farmers' priorities were the high-point of the budget this time. In Jharkhand, barely 10-12 per cent cultivated land has irrigation facilities. No wonder, in spite of good or poor rain, droughts often dog the state. So, it's a welcome step to focus on improving capacity for better farming."" Agreed BAU soil department chief scientist Vinay Aggarwal. ""This is for the first time, any Union government looked seriously towards agriculture. An allocation of close to Rs 36,000 crore, Rs 500 crore for improving pulse output, introduction of unified market, Rs 20,000 crore initial corpus for a dedicated long-term irrigation fund in NABARD, farmers have all the reason to rejoice,"" he opined. Farmers were happy too. Jai Prakash, a Mandar-based progressive farmer, said they were particularly pleased with the Prime Minister's crop insurance scheme and subsidies on fertilisers which would be credited directly to banks. ""We have experienced how subsidies were being openly looted by middlemen in the past. This promises to curb this trend,"" he said. About the concept of a unified market, which was expected to be launched later this year, Prakash said it would help them get proper market prices round-the-year. ""For example, there are times when farmers of Jharkhand have to sell tomatoes at 50 paise or Re 1 per kilo. On several occasions, they have had to throw away produce, suffering heavy losses. A unified market, as I understand, will help us give due prices all year round,"" he hoped. Dileshwar Sahu maintained that the unified market concept would reduce suicide rates and encourage farmers to take up crop diversity. ""Proper rates and a market for all sorts of agri-produce will encourage farmers to do all sorts of farming"" said the farmer. Prakash wanted fair price shops to be able to sell their produce 365 days a year at villages. ""Funds from Krishi Kalyan cess can be utilised for this now. Also, the need of the hour in Jharkhand is to have agriculture land clusters with all facilities so that fragmentation of farmland can be stopped,"" he said, adding that besides investments and better funds allocation, both the state and Centre should also focus on farmers' capacity building."

Picture by Prashant Mitra In a double delight for farmers, chief minister Raghubar Das on Thursday morning commissioned Jharkhand's biggest dairy plant in Hotwar, Ranchi, and in the afternoon, laid the foundation of a fruits and vegetables processing plant in Kanke block of the district. Touring the dairy before the formal launch, Das hailed it as a state-of-the-art facility. He said they were planning to set up similar plants in Deoghar and the Kolhan region in collaboration with NDDB ""to lay a network of milk routes and turnaround the socio-economic status of farmers living in the remotest parts of the state"". Built with an investment of Rs 19 crore, the fully automated dairy plant boasts an expansion capacity of up to 1.2 lakh litres, officials said. The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) completed the project, sprawling over 47 acres, in record time of a year. While the plant has a one-stop control hub, it is equipped with modern conveyor belts and a pasteuriser unit that can kill bacteria in 10,000 litres of milk at a time. Among the units that are ready is one where paneer, curd, lassi and ghee will be produced. Also ready are three cold storages with a combined capacity to hold 1.10 lakh litre of milk and its allied products. Dedicating the plant to dairy farmers in the state, the chief minister urged every citizen and villager to drink milk and eat milk products under Medha, the indigenous brand under Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation. ""When you start consuming, the money will go to our poor farmers. You get quality milk and milk products and farmers get a livelihood. This circle will put the state on the road to progress."" Sharing a thought from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Das said, ""When the government gives rebate to industries, it is called incentive; but when it gives the same to the poor, why is it called subsidy? I think the subsidy culture should end. From now on, we will focus on giving incentives to farmers."" Present on the occasion were NDDB chairman T. Nandkumar, state agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, Ranchi MP Ram Tahal Choudhary, agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni and the chief minister's secretary Sunil K. Barnwal, besides hundreds of farmers from across the state. Nandkumar underscored that no one should think that the plant belonged to NDDB. ""It is your plant, your property, we are only caretakers for five years. Our aim is to ensure scientific and transparent collection of milk and make payments to you weekly, bi-weekly. So, you should connect with us and form a co-operative,"" he told farmers. Das agreed. He said through the government's ""cow distribution scheme"", farmers would be motivated to form co-operatives. On the food processing plant, managing director of Jharkhand milk federation B.S. Khanna said it would be set up by Mother Dairy on 27 acres in Titratoli village of Nagri in Kanke block. Mother Dairy will invest around Rs 70 crore for setting up the plant to yield products under Brand Safal or a new local brand if decided later. ""Initially, peas and tomato will be marketed. Frozen peas, tomato puree and pastes are some of the items that will be made available first. Later, vegetables like cabbage and beans will be available along with fruits like mango and guava,"" Khanna said, adding that tentatively it would take around two years for the plant to start functioning."
58f4cfd560de470aa339bfe6,The unhappy city,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160416/jsp/opinion/story_80304.jsp,2016-04-16,,Telegraph,"There is a German word: unbehagen. Often mistranslated as 'discontent', its meaning is much more nuanced. In the last century, amid the death and destruction of the two World Wars, Sigmund Freud used it to denote the fundamental 'discomfort' that arises when an individual's quest for instinctive freedom clashes with society's demand for conformity. A similar 'discomfort' seemed discernible in the many of the works showcased at the 3rd Emami Annual Exhibition 2016 (February 26 to March 31). The 'discomfort' appeared to be directed towards baneful urbanization, the decrepit city space and the dissonance generated by city life. The exhibition saw the submission of around 1100 entries by new artists out of which an initial selection of 200 was made. A three-member jury of Jogen Chowdhury, Shuvaprasanna and Prayag Shukla hacked these down to 95, among which were contributions in painting, sculpture, photography, drawing and print making. The urban landscape, depicted in muted tones of grey, black and white dominated the work of Debajyoti Das. In his work, Identity dissolved in motion, the ominous structure of Howrah Bridge stands in the backdrop as apparition-like figures of men with missing torsos roam around on the streets. It is as if the city has literally robbed these men of their identity and turned them into ghostly automatons. The desolation of the industrial space is captured in Bharat Dodiya's surrealist etching, Devoid of being (picture). An enormous, barren factory is contrasted with a small bin in the foreground filled with discarded sickles. The barrenness is both a commentary on the loss of human labour and that of industrial work. The repressive apparatus of the State, particularly its police system, is hinted at in Ritwik Kar's mixed media work, Eradicator of Maladies, while in Anjan Modak's creation, the modern real estate developer's demonic figure looms large over urban shanties. The sculptures were a telling mix of political commentary and personal recollection. Bikram Das's impressive bronze work, Hungry, is an upside down grotesque figure with emaciated limbs and a humongous mouth. K Sirish Reddy's miniature version of a rickety autorickshaw is an ode to urban decay, while Phalguni Samanta's poignant ceramic work, Shoes, is evocative of the weariness of human life. In contrast, the familiar 'hurricane lantern' of our childhood days gets a colourful remake in Sudipta Ghosh's Nostalgia. Apart from the artists in competition, there was a selection of work from a range of invited artists. There were the usual suspects: Ganesh Haloi with landscape in abstraction, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay with his characteristic doe-eyed, voluptuous women and Shuvaprasanna with the familiar crow, an enduring leitmotif of the city and its will to survive."

Earlier this month, the state tourism department had asked hoteliers to list at least one dish made of organic vegetables in their menu. The Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association, an apex body of hoteliers that has around 300 members, has agreed to the proposal. State agriculture minister Somnath Poudyal today said he will request each hotel and restaurant owner to adopt at least one village and procure organic items directly from the farmers there. ""I held a meeting with the association in Gangtok recently and requested the members to adopt at least one village (each) so that middlemen can be avoided. Farmers would be able to sell their produce to hoteliers directly,"" Poudyal said in a press conference today. ""Hoteliers have agreed in principle to include an organic dish in the menu but for that, they need regular supply. By adopting a village that practices organic farming, both farmers and hoteliers would be in a win-win situation."" Sikkim banned the use of fertilisers and pesticides in farming in 2008 and now, 74,000 hectare has been brought under organic cultivation across the state. Some of the locally grown organic vegetables are potatoes, spinach, peas, beans, tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers. On January 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Sikkim as the first state in the country to practise organic farming. However, the hotels and restaurants mostly use vegetables and fruits brought from Siliguri. ""We are yet to ascertain the total requirement but we are confident that locally grown vegetables are enough to cater to tourists in peak seasons. Organic items have high nutritional value"" said agriculture secretary, Khorlo Bhutia. President of Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association, Pema Lamtha, said they will discuss the proposal to adopt villages. ""We have agreed to include organic food in the menu although it might be slightly more expensive. We will hold a meeting with farmers to work out the modalities. The rates could be worked out later,"" he said. On February 8, tourism minister Ugen Gyasto Bhutia had requested hoteliers to serve organic food. ""We want at least two-three organic dishes in the menu. Items can be decided by the hoteliers,"" he said. He added that a notice with the appeal would be issued by the end of the month."

A source said the herd was straying into the area, which falls under ward No. 3 of the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, for the past three days. A stray elephant seen near Cuttack on Saturday.Picture by Badrika Nath Das Three elephants have been spotted nearly 4km from the present campus of the National Law University. The herd, however, has not yet crossed the Mahanadi. Resentment was brewing among the villagers since they feared that the elephants might stray into human settlements as the forest department had yet to drive it back either towards Athgarh or to Khuntuni. ""It is for the second consecutive day the elephants have been spotted in the region. They have destroyed a large portion of standing crops such as tomatoes, potatoes and brinjals,"" said 58-year-old farmer Ganesh Das. Das said a lot of villagers from Brajabiharipur had cultivated vegetables on the other side of the river and it was for the second time in the past one year that elephants had been spotted few kilometres away from Cuttack city. The herd has already wrecked havoc on the open fields situated on the other side of the Mahanadi river by destroying vegetable plantations in nearly three acres of farmland. ""We have not seen any measure on part of the forest department to drive back the herd and ensure that they do not cross the river and enter our area,"" said local resident Gauranga Barik. Forest officials suspect the herd is frequently using the Mahanadi river bed due to shortage of food.

But Safal outlets like this one will take another two years to come up, even though a 27-acre land for a fruits and vegetable processing plant at Kanke is being handed over to Mother Dairy on February 11. Picture by Prashant Mitra If milk, veggies and fruits are the mainstay of a healthy diet, then Jharkhand is set to have ample supply of all three soon. February 11 is a red letter day when the chief minister will lay the foundation of a 20,000-tonne plant, set to be the home of Safal products, ranging from fresh vegetables to all kinds of fruits, marketed under the over-reaching arm of Mother Dairy. Das will, on the same day, also inaugurate a 1.2 lakh litre automated dairy set up for around Rs 19 crore under the aegis of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). ""Yes, February 11 will be a great moment for Jharkhand. Besides the dairy, we will also kick-start work to set up the food and vegetable processing plant. We have been trying for this project for a long time. Finally, with the chief minister's nod, it is off the ground,"" B.S. Khanna, MD of Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, told The Telegraph . The action is shifting to Kanke, where the Safal fruits and vegetable plant would come up, and Hotwar, where the milk plant is coming up. Both are on the outskirts of Ranchi, about 25km and 6km from the district headquarters respectively. The state cooperative federation, popularly referred to as Jharkhand Milk Fed, is managed by NDDB as a part of Jharkhand's tie up with the autonomous entity to boost the milk sector. Besides milk promotion, NDDB is also marketing other agrarian products and facilitating linkages. Brand Safal is owned by Mother Dairy, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of NDDB. Mother Dairy is investing around Rs 70 crore for setting up the plant across an area of 27 acre. To begin with, Khanna said, peas and tomatoes would be marketed. Later, vegetables like cabbage and bean would be added along with fruits like mangoes and guava. ""Frozen peas, tomato puree and various pastes are some of the items which will be made available first,"" he said, but added that it was yet to be decided whether these would be sold under the Safal brand or a new local brand. It would take around two years for the plant to start functioning. ""Two years is the buffer time. We expect it to be ready in one-and- a- half years,"" Khanna said. At Hotwar, the Rs 19 crore dairy, spread over 47 acres, is ready. Once operational, it will be the biggest milk processing unit with production capacity of 1.20 lakh litre. The three other state dairies at Ranchi's Ormanjhi, Koderma and Deoghar have a combined capacity of 40,000 litres. The Hotwar dairy boasts a programmed logic controller (PLC), which functions as a one-stop control hub. It is also equipped with modern conveyor belts and a pasteurizer unit that can kill bacteria in 10,000 litres of milk at a time. Among the units that are ready is one where paneer, curd, lassi and ghee will be produced. Also ready are three cold storages with a combined capacity to hold 1.10 lakh litre of milk and allied products. NDDB appointed plant manager Manoj Kumar said another unique feature of the dairy was its linkage with an effluent treatment plant (ETP). ""The ETP will recycle waste water from the dairy and make it suitable for irrigation. Thus, each and every drop of milk will be used,"" he said. After the new Hotwar dairy is in operation, Jharkhand's dependence on Bihar's Sudha brand of milk and milk products would come down drastically. ""Currently, Jharkhand requires 3 lakh litres of milk daily. The three existing dairies at Ranchi, Koderma and Deoghar produce 40,000 litres in all. Another 10,000 litres are procured from local dairy farmers, while the rest is imported from Sudha Dairy,"" said an agriculture department official."

A total of five research professionals would be engaged in the project. Apart from assessing the arsenic contamination in groundwater of Bihar and Bangladesh, we aim to provide arsenic-free water in one of the villages of Bhojpur district, which has the highest amount of arsenic presence in its groundwater. The amount of arsenic is 1,861 parts per billion (ppb) against the permissible limit of 10 parts per billion. An arsenic-free borewell would also be dug up in the village."" Ghosh said his department was working on this issue for over a decade during which 18 districts were found to have high levels of arsenic. The districts include Darbhanga, Supaul, Purnea, Begusarai, Bhojpur, Munger and Lakhisarai. Ghosh said: ""Arsenic contamination in water is a grave issue. In Maner, when we carried out a project, we found at least 35 people suffering from diseases related to arsenic contamination in water. People were found suffering from melanosis (abnormal dark pigmentation of skin), keratosis (rough patch on skin) and skin cancer. We hope the project brings out many more aspects of arsenic contamination."" Ghosh said in another research conducted two years ago, it was found that arsenic contamination was affecting agriculture in the state as well. He said: ""Among the various rice varieties, arsenic was found in Sonam, Sarna and Turantha among others while among edible crops, arsenic was found in tomato, maze, wheat and spinach among others."" Ghosh said this was not the first time that his department was collaborating with foreign universities. ""Sandra Downes, a professor at the University of Manchester, has earlier worked with the faculty members of Water and Environment Science Department of AN College to find the solution of fluoride contamination in groundwater in Bihar. Fluoride is the second most contaminating factor after arsenic in the state. Excess fluoride content is dangerous for human consumption because it leads to problems such as accelerated tooth decay, painful warping of bones and skeletal as well as dental fluorosis,"" said Ghosh."

The show, which runs until April 16, consists of recent work by five artists making inventive and incisive use of quotidian life in and around provincial Bengal. There are photo etchings designed with Odia mud and iron ore; objet trouve such as common neon plastic toys; and paintings that take industrial tarpaulin as their canvas or traditional needlework as their mode of composition. Shreyasi Chatterjee, Kingshuk Sarkar and Sumitro Basak all make a return to CIMA after having had solo shows at the gallery in recent years, while the other two artists in this exhibit, Sangita Maity and Pitambar Khan, were both young winners of the 2014 CIMA (Jury) Award. Taken together, these artists' motley assortment of new work shows that a great fecundity of inspiration and idiom is locally available. Accordingly, the subject of many of these works can be found in the source of their materials. Maity has been studying the mining industry in land occupied by the Santhal tribes of Odisha and Jharkhand. Calculative Divisions, one of Maity's photo etchings, transposes a picture of a local forest scene onto an iron plate drawn from the mines. The metal has been manually rusted by the artist, and visible specks of iron burn through the otherwise Arcadian image. The mines employ Santhal workers while also doing harm to their traditional crops, and Maity's work suggests a documentary concern with what is being lost. Basak and Khan find their medium in cheap, mass-produced synthetics, material that is acquired provisionally, used offhandedly, and discarded unthinkingly. In addition to his Pop Art paintings, CIMA is also exhibiting an array of pieces by Basak that feature flimsy, brightly coloured plastic toys of trucks, houses, and people. They are the sort of trinkets a child would use whose parents could not afford something better. What might seem harmless and playful, however, is revealed to be something more sinister: the bendy toy men are stuck onto cars in one composition as if in an accident; in another, piles of the figurines trail a toy truck like so much dumped sand. Are there actual men and women as deprived of agency as these two-bit automatons? Khan's paintings, which make use of the imagery and language painted on the back of buses, trucks and auto rickshaws, vividly pop out from their tarpaulin canvases. His large and clearly delineated illustrations of everyday sights such as wire boxes, pipes and brand insignias suggest an impulse to subdue and classify the urban pell-mell. But his unframed paintings are also unfussy: the edges of the hung tarpaulin curl casually outward. If Khan's appropriation of the style of truck art is an index of the road, then Sarkar's blurry, violent street scenes, painted on stretched silk or jute, point to the chaos of the street. One of the only well-defined items in his Public Moods and Mass Melancholia series of paintings is a sneaker that clearly evokes the urban sidewalk. Nearby is a fuzzily rendered naked man struggling to break free from shackles as an indistinct crowd seems to call for his lynching. Sarkar, who grew up amid strife in Assam, portrays a world in which violence seems routine. The disorder of the lives of many in villages and towns outside of Calcutta is made evident by all these artists; Shreyasi Chatterjee's lovely stitchings show there to be harmony as well. Her landscapes, both woven and painted, depict towns and fields in verdant green, rosy pink, and chartreuse. The mood of the little structures and figures that dot these scenes is set by the balance of colours that surrounds them."

To start with, Vocational Rehabilitation Centre for Handicapped (VRCH), in association with National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities, had launched a programme four months back where around 20 disabled youth and children were engaged in Khandagiri. ""The beneficiaries are already growing vegetables such as coriander, lady's finger, tomatoes and radish in a kitchen garden. They are maintaining all the records of sale and already making profits. Now, that the government has identified the land, the same project will be substituted there. We will include more youths,"" said rehabilitation officer of VRCH, Ram Kishor Sharma. The youth work for the entire day and also undergo therapy, said Sharma, who was speaking at a programme held here on the occasion of World Down Syndrome Day yesterday. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, social security and empowerment of persons with disabilities secretary Niten Chandra said: ""There are about 100 special schools in the state now and we are planning to come up with more in future,"" he said. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder and individuals with the symptoms display some degree of mental retardation or cognitive disability or other developmental delays. The day aims to raise awareness about what it is all about and how people suffering from it can play vital roles in our lives. The theme of this year's event was ""My friends, my community,"" which urges people to include those suffering from the syndrome in our lives. Eminent paediatrician Arabinda Mohanty spoke about the need for work inclusion as per abilities. ""Early intervention and diagnosis is very important for the development of children having Down syndrome. Such children must be sent to early infant stimulation programmes for better development,"" said Mohanty adding that parents must provide exposure to the children by taking them out on a regular basis, especially to social functions. Social security and empowerment of persons with disabilities minister Usha Devi said the state government was committed to address the varied rehabilitation needs of the intellectual disabilities. The day was observed for the first time in Odisha and was followed by an awareness workshop. A short film on Down syndrome was also showcased. On Sunday, the department had also organised a campaign on down syndrome during Raahgiri where children participated."

Smith, who wrote the immensely popular How to Be Both (2014), and her editor were strolling through London's Covent Garden when they chanced upon a building with the word, 'LIBRARY', clearly visible above the entrance. Their interest piqued, they made their way inside to investigate further, and found themselves in a dark, modish hallway. ""Is this a library?"" they asked the woman at the reception desk. ""No"", she replied coldly. ""Was this a library once?"" The answer to that, too, was no. LIBRARY turned out to be a private members' club, with luxurious suites and spa treatments. ""Have you actually got actual books?"" Smith asked. ""We do do some books as a feature,"" was the terse reply. Smith glanced at the business card handed to her, and noticed that a thin, poker straight line skewers its way harshly through the word ""LIBRARY"". This is the visual metaphor that is echoed throughout the rest of the book, and one that is uncomfortably true: Smith reveals that in the years she took to write this book, ""draconian and politically expedient cuts"" resulted in the closure of about 1,000 libraries in the United Kingdom. This is a distressing reality, and one that many authors, including Smith and Julian Barnes, have protested against vociferously. With the 12 stories in Public Library, Smith has committed further to the cause - this book, she says, is about ""the ways in which our public library tradition is being traduced, pressurised, changed and taken from us without us seeing it - and also quite visibly with us seeing it."" Now that book stores and libraries are rapidly shutting down, some of our most cherished pleasures are in danger of disappearing - the joy of idly browsing through library shelves, exploring those intimate spaces, and then suddenly stumbling upon something precious that you did not even realize you were missing. These are pleasures that one will never find online. In spite of the title of the book, no story in Public Library is actually called ""Public library"". The tales are neither set in a library, nor do they openly talk of one. Each piece, however, is a lament and a plea for those magical spaces; to this end, Smith has incorporated reflections from her friends into the collection, to hold it together and to enhance the themes of her own stories. Placed in italics between Smith's tales, these are all reflections of lovers of books on the libraries that shaped their lives; some of these people are not well known, while the others are (for instance, the Scottish poet and novelist, Jackie Kay, and the Canadian writer, Miriam Toews). They talk about the importance of libraries, as well as the ""recent spate of closures""; the nostalgia in their words is sharp. A number of these reflections hark back to the days of youth - one of Smith's friends remembers feeling overjoyed and very important for having been awarded an ""adult ticket"" at the age of six for borrowing lots of books, while another talks about the excitement of turning seven and finally being allowed to use the library. Anna James remembers how a tiny library gave her ""access to worlds and lives that a child growing up in rural Northumberland could never have hoped to experience anywhere else."" A passionate will to defend the written word underlines these reflections. However, Smith's own stories provide a far more powerful defence. She highlights the democratic, liberal spirit of the public library, a space where everyone can have access to learning in order to educate and empower themselves, a space where readers can pick what they want to read, for free, and be at liberty to re-imagine each book with each re-reading. The collection itself is political and also profoundly democratic, since Smith shares her privileged position as the author with her friends. She has called public libraries 'division melting places', and with this work she shows that books and shared civic spaces resolutely tear down walls. Her stories create an animated puzzle where quotes and writings fit together, weirdly and beautifully. In ""The beholder"", the vocabulary invented by John Milton - Smith observes that he coined the words ""fragrance"", ""lovelorn"" and ""padlock"" - struggles against the staccato, brusque sentiments of medical lingo: ""'Results, hospital, inconclusive,' the voice said. 'Urgent, immediate, straight away.'"" Smith delights in the contingency of language and the changing meanings of words: readers are taken through the origins and the different usages of ""stamina"" and ""buxom"", and are informed that in Shakespeare's works, ""stone"" often meant ""mirror"". Smith also reminds one of the tale of Ariadne, Theseus and the Crete labyrinth when she reveals that the word, ""clue"", originated from ""a ball of thread"". In ""Good voice"", a deceased father hands out life advice to his daughter. Moreover, fragments of deceased writers keep peppering the book: readers are left to wonder whether D.H. Lawrence's ashes may be floating around, undetected, in the ocean, and whether film rolls of Katherine Mansfield - she sits giggling on a park bench in one story - may have been melted en masse and used to coat the wings of aeroplanes. Smith's stories leap with abandon across physical and virtual spaces, and are filled with the joy of unexpected, unlikely connections. Her characters are transported out of their daily routines with the help of dreams, hallucinations, unpredictable events (a wheelchair-bound woman is trapped on a train that has finished its run; the imaginary friend of a toddler refuses to get up and leave the table) and conversations with the dead. A character walking into Regent's Park wanders past the pond where Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley set sail to their paper boats, and across the hilltop once shared with a past lover: ""...endless stories, all crossing across each other"". All of Smith's tales are jagged, breathless and incongruous, every situation rendered interesting by sardonic humour. The author's frustration with the idiosyncrasies of modern bureaucracy is evident: there is a famous media house's security system that tells a living man that his records show that he is dead, on account of which he will not be granted entry until a meeting with the company's lawyers is convened; there is also the ""matey automaton"" which is unable to comprehend the simple command, ""I'd like to speak to someone"", over the phone. It is this officialdom, all-powerful and faceless, that is ruining library services on account of its obsession with order and efficiency at the cost of common sense and happiness. Smith also laughs derisively at bureaucratese when she writes about the thuggish tone of a sign at a railway station: ""If we find you trespassing you will be fined."" ""I found I was thinking about the person, or people, who'd originally worded that sign. Had there been special meetings held to decide the wording? Did they or he, or she, pause for a moment at all over find and fined?"", she wonders. Above all - and rather appropriately - Smith makes readers want to visit a library to find the books she writes about (instead of just searching for them online). In ""The poet"", the searing poetry of the Scottish poet, Olive Fraser, is discovered alongside music hidden beneath the dusty spines of old novels. In ""Grass"", the accidental discovery of a book of Robert Herrick's poems takes a character back to boyhood afternoons; the book itself thinks about being read in the future among the wild grass and flowers in a village lane. Smith's politics result in her investing physical copies of books with magical powers; this turns public libraries into places of worship or treasure troves, sacred places where one is miraculously changed or healed upon contact with the artefact - the book."

The prices of quality Dutch roses have risen from Rs. 3-4 to Rs. 8 per piece in a span of a few days.This is the beginning of the wedding season  we send them (Dutch roses) across the country for decorative purposes. This demand is what pushes the prices northwards, said Jayaprakash Rao, general secretary, The South India Floriculture Association.Meanwhile, the price of Kanakambara has shot up from Rs. 1,000 a fortnight ago to Rs. 2,000 per kg . An arm-length of strung flowers is retailing at Rs. 100. Every flower costs 100 per cent higher now  prices could increase further by Thursday evening and Friday morning, said S.

Picture by Prashant Mitra Seasoned Ranchiites have always advised visitors to Rashtriya Khadi and Saras Mahotsav at Morabadi grounds to carry with them an empty shopping bag. But this year, they're adding one more piece of sage advice: go with an empty stomach too. Some of the state's yummiest snacks - gulgula, marwa pitha, sarli soup, dhuska, pakori, chilka roti, barra - can be had at the Jharfoods stall set up by Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society at the ongoing khadi fair from February 5 to 17. Twenty-one sari-clad women, their aprons, caps and gloves giving them a professional air of competency, are serving these Jharkhandi delicacies at Jharfoods stall. Of the 30 food stalls put up at the mahotsav, the stall catches attention for authentic snacks prepared and served by the women from remote districts. Kumar Vikas, programme manager of Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society, said the register kept at the stall was bursting with compliments from customers. ""The food was really good. I am impressed because the stall is controlled only by women,"" wrote one Soumyadeep Bhattacharya. ""We tasted sarli soup, which is one of the best soups we have had,"" wrote one Akit Jain. ""The taste of dhuska and barra was very good. Keep it up,"" wrote one Snehlata Surin. So, who are these women rustling up culinary magic? ""Of the 21 women at the stall, four each are from Simdega and Pakur, six from Chaibasa in West Singhbhum and seven from Ranchi. Many either run food stalls at marketplaces, or are part of self-help groups who run eateries. We have pooled culinary talent from districts through our ongoing livelihood promotion programme and trained them jointly with Kerala-based Kudumbashree, a national resource hub under Union rural development ministry,"" Vikas said. It's a red-hot idea, going by the demand for sarli soup. Customers at the stall said they were ""repeaters"", having tasted it once, they had come again with family and friends for the tangy soup prepared from sarli leaves, tomato, garlic and ginger, at Rs 10 per glass of 150ml. "" Sarli leaves are good for digestion and effective in fighting cancer,"" said Shimla Banra, a resource consultant, who keeps an eye on hygiene, preparation and service at the Jharfoods stall.

Photo: AFPScientists unveiled on Monday the gene in carrots that gives rise to carotenoids, a critical source of Vitamin A and the pigment that turns some fruits and vegetables bright orange or red.Un-poetically dubbed DCAR_032551, the star gene emerged from the first complete decoding of the carrot genome, published in the scientific journal Nature Genetics .Vitamin A deficiency is a global health challenge, the study pointed out.Its plentiful carotenoids make carrot an important source of provitamin A in the human diet.Carotenoids were first discovered in carrots (hence the name), but which among the vegetables newly tallied 32,115 genes was most responsible for their formation remained a mystery. The researchers sequenced the genome of a bright orange variety of the vegetable called the Nantes carrot, named for the French city.Daucus carota now joins a select club of about a dozen veggies  including the potato, cucumber, tomato and pepper  whose complete genomes have been sequenced.Laying bare the humble carrots genetic secrets will make it easier to enhance disease resistance and nutritive value in other species, the researchers said.Having identified the mechanism controlling the accumulation of carotenoid, it may be possible  through gene-editing, for example  to import it to other staple root vegetables such as the cassava, native to South American and widely grown in Africa. These results will facilitate biological discovery and crop improvement in carrots and other crops, said Philipp Simon, senior author and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Among vegetables spinach and peas are widely associated with growing up strong, but its hard to beat the carrot when it comes to health boosters.Carrots are loaded with beta-carotene, a natural chemical that the body can transform into Vitamin A.The deeper the orange colour, the more beta-carotene.Carotenoids are also antioxidants, which are thought to protect against heart disease and some forms of cancer by neutralising so-called free radicals, single oxygen atoms that can damage cells.Some of these compounds can prevent disease, Mr. Simon said.Carrots are an interesting crop to work on because of their wide range of diversity. They are familiar to everyone, and generally well-regarded by consumers, but like most familiar things, people dont necessarily know the background stories, said Mr. Simon, led the study published in the journal Nature Genetics .Interestingly, carrots  along with many other plants  have about 20 per cent more genes than humans.Looking back at the plants family tree, scientists have been able to determine that it split with the grape about 113 million years ago and from the kiwi about 10 million years after that, when dinosaurs still lorded over the planet.Originally white, the wild ancestors of the carrot likely came from central Asia. The earliest record of carrots as a root crop dates from 1,100 years ago in Afghanistan, but those were yellow carrots and purple ones, not orange ones. Paintings from 16th century Spain and Germany provide the first unmistakable evidence for orange carrots. Global crop production of the root has quadrupled in the last 40 years and is today eaten everywhere in the world.  AFP/Reuters"

Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income.""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha. We don't have money even for transporting them,"" said Kamal Singh.""Almost 5,000 farmers in the entire district are facing this problem while, Prime Minister Modi launched the National Agriculture Market on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar'', Vidisha district panchayat member Kailash Raghuvanshi told TOI.He said farmers are in a poor condition and cannot get money in return as so many of them have not availed crop insurance policy due to administrative hassles. ""Chief minister Chouhan had sowed tomatoes in a 10 acre area. Initially he sold 15 quintals at a high price but the moment price crashed, he asked for free distribution in slum areas,"" said Raghuvanshi.The cost of sowing tomatoes in one bigha (2.5 acres) is estimated to Rs 40,000. As the district recorded a bumper crop, one bigha received 17,500 kgs of tomatoes. But at a rate of Rs 2 a kg or less, the farmers are not getting even Rs 35,000 from a bigha.""The farmers are compelled to throw away their crop in the garbage or feed the cattle. There is no alternative,"" said Radhuvanshi, adding, many farmers were also cheated by middlemen who pay less than Rs 2 for a kg and sell the crop in retail markets of Bhopal and nearby cities at Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg.With government making efforts to double the income of farmers, the new crisis will not only hit the farm community financially but also mentally, who were looking for 'ache din' after numerous schemes announced by the Centre.-----------Photo caption :Workers distributing tomatoes grown at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's farm house, to poor families on Friday------"

""The price of every commodity has shot up, and we too are bleeding. We can't manage to run a household if we don't keep profit margins"" said Mangalram, a vegetable vendor at Raja Park."

At the same time, at least two ultra-mega food parks are also expected to take shape in the next couple of years.Apart from the eight mega food parks, five mini food parks, six cold chain projects, four primary processing centres, 22 new mega food processing units, six expansion units and six processing units in the aqua sector are on the anvil.Speaking to TOI, CEO of AP Food Processing Society YS Prasad said while two mega food parks are being planned in Vizianagaram, one each will come set up in Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari. Also, one mega food park each are being planned at Chittoor, Kurnool and Nellore. A mini food park is also expected at Anantapur.""Mega food parks will entail investments of around Rs 120-150 crore and in the coming two years, we want to see at least Rs 3,000 crore investments materialising in the state. If we have food processing facilities in our state, then farmers can reap huge profits,"" said Prasad.The first projects expected to take off include a state-of-the-art mega food processing park in Kurnool by Jain Irrigation Systems, spread over an area of 600 acres for banana tissue culture and also for processing onion, tomato, mango, papaya and banana.Apart from this, Britannia Industries is expected to set up its first unit in AP near Kuppam with an investment of around Rs 150 crore and its facilities are likely to be spread over an area of 50 acres.Similarly, in Srikakulam district, Nagarjuna Construction Company is likely to develop a mega food processing park on an area of 150 acres, whereas Northeast Impex is considering an integrated food park for cashew processing.In Visakhapatnam district, Srinivasa Hatcheries is planning to set up a mega food park for processing egg, meat and horticulture products near Nakkappalli area. Egg powder, which has a huge demand abroad, is expected to be the focus area for the park."

This should please cotton farmers in Punjab and Haryana, one of the worst hit by the pest attack over the past couple of years.A team of NBRI researchers led by senior scientist P K Singh has even introduced it into cotton and successfully completed its trial for three years and over six generations, thus proving its efficacy. This means farmers will get whitefly-resistant cotton seed in the next five years.""The process of transferring the technology to Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) in Ludhiana is on. We are taking legal advice and both the institutions have started seeking permission from the Union government's Review Committee of Genetic Manipulation (RCGM). There is no monetary transaction involved and we hope to be able to transfer the seeds to PAU by January,"" says Singh.Last year, the whitefly outbreak caused devastation of cotton crop in 1.5 million hectares in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The revenue loss to farmers was estimated to be Rs 10,000 crore, despite the use of pesticides worth Rs 500 crore.""Around September last year, I wrote to the Punjab chief minister, chief secretary and several other people. PAU vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon responded.

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives. RSN MKJ ABI"

Although the registration is under the Companies Act, the companies will operate on co-operative basis, where farmers will be made shareholders. The primary objective of the project is to create an ecosystem for farmers by providing them backward and forward integration.As part of the backward integration, an agri-mart under the brand name Ginkgo Plus would be set up, which will procure quality seeds in bulk thereby reducing the input cost. Farmers will also be given facilities such as warehouses, pack houses, research and development as well as farm mechanization services.""Apart from this, we will form joint ventures to sell the farmers' products. Swedish firm Plantagon has already evinced interest in tying up with us,"" said Jagat Shah, promoter of Cluster Pulse .The project also envisages creating retail and food outlets, to be known as Food Mart.The forward linkage includes retailing, exports, processing, value addition and brand creation for farm products. According to Shah, entrepreneurs will be encouraged to set up units for value addition and the target is to have 10,000 such agripreneurs.The project is mainly aimed at organic farming and deal in commodities like paddy, castor, cumin seeds, guar seeds, chilli, tomato, brinjal, potatoes as well as fruits.""There is a huge demand for organic farm products in the international market,"" said Shah.Gujarat State Co-operative Bank will also be roped in for financing farmers and agripreneurs.The project proponents plan to bring in 20,000 hectares of land in the first year and 40,000 hectares in five years under this initiative."

Now the Sahrawi people are trying to break the deadlock themselves - in the courts.The mineral-rich country on Africa's north-west Atlantic coast is bounded by Morocco in the north, Mauritania in the south and Algeria to the east. All three countries have taken an active interest in the fate of the Sahrawi - not always altruistically. Spain, the former colonial power, relinquished the territory in 1975 to Morocco, which has formally claimed the land since 1957, and Mauritania.Then there was conflict between the two countries and the Polisario Front - the Sahrawi liberation movement. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, leaving Moroccan security forces in nominal control. Controversially, an extensive wall was built through the desert to exclude Polisario fighters accused of coming into the country from refugee camps in neighbouring Algeria.A national referendum was promised after a UN-brokered ceasefire in 1991, in which the population could vote for complete independence or integration with Morocco; but the plan stalled when Rabat and Polisario disagreed over who was entitled to vote. Morocco remains implacably opposed to independence but says it is prepared to talk about ""autonomy"". The UN continues to push for a negotiated settlement. In December, Christopher Ross, personal envoy in the dispute to the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, admitted the situation was at a stalemate.France, which has strong historical links with Morocco, has consistently opposed calls for UN action against Rabat by exercising its veto in the Security Council. Now Polisario is finding new ways to put pressure on Morocco to come back to the negotiating table.In December it managed to put a stick in the spokes of the European Union's agriculture agreement with Morocco. Many of the tomatoes sold in British and European supermarkets are labelled as Moroccan produce, but most are grown in Western Sahara.The EU's Court of Justice ruled last month that the favourable tariffs Morocco enjoys should not apply to goods from the territories it occupies. The EU failed to consider the impact on the rights with the Sahrawi people when it signed the deal, the court ruled. Campaigners in Britain are taking legal action to stop Moroccan exports to the UK enjoying similar tax breaks.Buoyed by its successes, Polisario has brought a further case to the EU courts over an EU-Moroccan fisheries deal, which includes the territorial waters of the Sahrawi people. Norway has already started fining any of its vessels which trawl in Western Saharan waters. Oil companies such as Total which have explored for off and on-shore oil fields are facing growing local and international criticism, as are companies that import Western Sahara's minerals, including its massive phosphate deposits. United States, Canadian and Australian miners have all been blacklisted by Scandinavian pension firms.Polisario and its supporters are also keeping up the political pressure. Adala, a British NGO, recently submitted a report to the European Parliament and the UN Commission for Human Rights highlighting the regular human rights abuses taking place in the region. Sahrawi protestors face persistent harassment and persecution by security forces. Peaceful demonstrations are routinely disrupted by state violence and those taking part have been illegally detained.Beccy Allen, of Adala UK, said it was essential the UN mission in the territory was given a human rights mandate. ""There are plenty of white UN vehicles around but they don't intervene on human rights issues. They are the only UN mission around the world without one and that has to change,"" she said."

After the first round in which two bids were received, Patanjali emerged as the sole bidder and bagged the deal in third round. Sources said Patanjali had quoted around 5% above the reserve price. The reserve price was lowered on grounds that land offered in the tender was not developed.In order to compensate its loss, MADC has hiked the rates for rest of the land by 15%. The matter was reported by TOI on August 12.Balkrishna said the company wanted land cost to be low but had gone through all formalities and had bagged the deal in competitive bidding. It is ready to give away the land at same rate at which it got from MADC if any other company was ready to do business following the same terms and conditions as Patanjali."

The recent rains had resulted in almost all the farmers going in for tomato cultivation in addition to other crops, which has resulted in the high supply to markets.He said that even farmers in Chekkanoorani and Alanganallur in Madurai, Theni and Andipatti in Theni district, had cultivated tomatoes in large areas, resulting in the high yield.Even two weeks ago, a 15 kg box of tomatoes had sold for Rs 60, but now it has come down to just Rs 15, and the wholesale price in the market on Saturday was Rs 4 per kg.

After we returned the fire, the armed assailants fled the spot,"" ASP Ashwini Mishra said.In a daylong operation backed by two special action teams and a CRPF company, a group of policemen destroyed crops on around 100 acres of land. ""The operation will continue till the crop on the remaining 400 acres is destroyed,"" said Chatra SP Anjani Kumar Jha.Police said Maoists patronize opium crop cultivation in inaccessible terrains to make money to fund their struggle. In some places, however, criminals have also got into this illegal trade to make moollah. ""Only two shots were fired by the criminals whereas Maoists generally fire multiple shots. The objective was to discourage our team from destroying the crop,"" the ASP said.A police officer said the cultivation of opium crop on one acre requires an investment of Rs 30,000. An acre of crop yields around five to six kilograms of raw opium, which fetches Rs 25,000 per kg in the market. The growers pay Rs 10,000 to the local police for each acre of harvested poppy crop. Ultimately the grower ends up earning Rs 60,000 mullah from every acre of poppy crop.ASP Mishra said the raw opium is preserved in households in Maoist-hit areas before being divided into small packets and finally being loaded into trucks passing through the GT-Road and crossing Chatra to reach Punjab, Haryana and other north Indian cities. In the past, raw opium packets being transported via GT Road have been seized.""The poppy plants look similar to tomato plants in the initial 20 days of their 30-40 day life.

Similarly, Gandhi market also received a few loads in addition to the regular arrival. A senior official of the Department of Cooperative said that this was the first time that the farm fresh outlets received vegetables from Krishnagiri. The Department had alerted the salesmen of farm fresh outlets about the possibilities of further arrival of loads from Krishnagiri.However, the sudden arrival has not had its impact on the rate of carrot, which was sold between Rs.30 to 35 per kilo in the retail market. But, market sources said that the rate might come down a bit if Tiruchi market got more loads in the next few days.Meanwhile, various associations of Gandhi Market have expressed solidarity to the bandh call given by a section of farmers associations.A wholesale tomato merchant in Gandhi Market said that all whole sale and retail outlets would be closed for a day on Friday. Most of the associations had supported the decision."

In the US, it caught 10 thieves; in Australia, it caught 100. In China, it caught 1,000. In India, someone stole the robot. You may want the joke to come true because robots are coming to steal your jobs, particularly if your work is mostly repetitive, mechanical, motorised; something that is programmable.It's no secret that automation is taking over low-wage jobs, but as robots and drones get increasingly sophisticated, a White House economic report released on Monday has put numbers on a trend that should give pause to anyone who thinks low-wage manufacturing is the panacea to economic salvation in India, or anywhere else for that matter.In the US, there's an 83% chance that automation will take a job with an hourly wage below $20, a 31% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage between $20 and $40, and just a 4% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage above $40, a report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) warned. The risk of having your job effectively taken over by a robot, CEA chairman Jason Furman told reporters on Monday, ""varies enormously based on what your salary is."" In other words, the more skilled, creative, and high-earning you are, less likely your job will be taken over by automatons.Mechanical and assembly-line tasks, from laying bricks to making cars and even driving them, are already being taken over by drones, robots, and other ""intelligent"" forms even as scientists are trying to infuse them with intuition and emotions, their memory and computing power long having surpassed that of human beings. Furman said the risk of many current jobs being performed by robots is another example of why it is important to invest in education that helps people have skills that complements automation.Developments in US industry serve as a warning against over-reliance on low-grade, assembly-line manufacturing that can be replaced by robots. Even some of the low-level service jobs, such as dispensing food or gas or money, have been destroyed in the US with the advancement of automation - from ATMs to self-serve kiosks for photographs.Manufacturing jobs have declined by more than 7.2 million, or 37%, since employment in manufacturing peaked in 1979. In 1965, manufacturing accounted for 53% of the US economy; by 1988 it only accounted for 39%, in 2014, it accounted for less than 9%.Not all of the destruction is accounted for by flight of jobs to China or Mexico. Lurking in the background, technological advancement. University of Oxford researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne estimated in 2013 that 47% of total US jobs could be automated and taken over by computers by 2033. Even jobs in medicine, law, and education are not immune. Remarkably though, even as employment is shrinking, productivity is growing, thanks to the technological advancements. So, while the GDP is soaring, median income in many jobs is falling even as the job market itself is becoming smaller."

The move is expected to generate employment for around 1,000 people.""These units will process frozen foods, mango & other fruit pulps, raisin, onion powder, biscuits, cookies, papad pickles, tomato products, bakery & confectionery products and fruit juices among other items.The state government set up the Godavari Wine Park at Vinchur near Nashik in 2001 in a bid to promote wine industry. Of the total 133 hectares (332 acres) land, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares (208 acres). As only five wineries became operational in the wine park, the industries had demanded the government to allow food processing units on the remaining 50 hectares (125 acres).During an industrial exhibition in April last year, Nashik-based industrial associations had approached state industries minister Subhash Desai with their demand. Desai too had given positive response to the industrial associations. Accordingly, the MIDC gave approval in September for allowing industries to set up food processing units at Vinchur.Now, the MIDC is in the process of developing infrastructure such as roads, water supply and streetlights among others and is also conducting a survey for the purpose.

The tension has brought down tomato prices to a low of Rs 6 a kg in the wholesale market.Villagers of the taluka said they had decided not to export tomatoes to Pakistan. This has kept traders away from taluka's villages, a villager said. The farmer's decision has boomeranged on farmers and the result is that tomato prices at the beginning of the season itself has fallen below Rs 10 a kg.Nagjibhai Takore, sarpanch of Lakshmipura village, said the prices will further fall when the tomato season is at its peak in the last week of November.""As of now, the tomato crop which is arriving in the markets in Ahmedabad is coming from Nasik apart from Kadi area. Once the crop from Kadi starts flooding the market, the prices will fall further,"" said Takore.Sarpanch of Yashvantpura, Dashrath Patel, said lack of exports is making tomato an unprofitable for farmers in the region. ""The are many reasons for this,"" said Patel. ""The first is that exporters who usually arrive have not come this time. Moreover, there has been a bumper crop in Nasik and other areas. Also this year the the climate was hotter than last year and, hence, the quality of our tomatoes suffered.""Takore said that several villages had announced that they would not sell their produce to traders for Pakistan. ""Hence the traders from Delhi and Punjab have stayed away from the villages,"" he said.However, sarpanch of Vekra village, Nikul Patel, said prices being offered for tomato are very low and hence the farmers are incurring huge losses. The farmers are not even able to recover their investment, forget profits. At least six traders from Punjab and Delhi come to the village regularly by the last week of October but this year they have not come because trade with Pakistan has almost come to an end due to tension on the border.Chairman of Khadi Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Vinod Patel, said the quality of the crop is also not good. ""Apart from quality, the traders from Punjab are keeping away from the region this year as there are no exports to Pakistan,"" Patel said.Ramesh Patel, member of Kisan Agro, says that sowing of tomato takes places in nearly 5000 bigahs of land.

Inspecting the trading outlets and dumping of tomato produce at the market yard, the Minister observed that Chittoor district holds the best potential to become a horticulture hub.Though the price of tomatoes was plummeting from time to time, the crop had turned into a good business in the region.He said that when the prices of tomatoes were stabilised, the farmers would reap rich benefits and escape the threat of falling prices. The farmers said that they never craved for bumper benefits, but were bogged down with sudden dropping of prices which would force them to abandon the crops in the fields as the scenario would throw them into a quandary with the labour charges becoming more than the tomato market price.They informed the Minister to take measures for stabilising the prices at at least Rs. 350 per crate with 30 kg of tomatoes. Responding to their plea, Mr Pulla Rao said that he would place the same before Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.Later, the Minister inspected the rain guns at K.V.

In the south, levels failed to rise enough to fill dried-out rivers and aquifers.The drought crisis -- which has caused wildfires, decimated forests, threatened animal species and deprived thousands of homes of access to clean water -- is far from over, and the authorities of this vast West Coast state say its 39 million residents had better get used to the new reality of climate change.A quarter of the Sierra Nevada Mountains' snow cover -- essential for feeding rivers and maintaining groundwater levels -- will disappear by 2050, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) predicts on its website. Half will vanish by the turn of the century.That prospect is especially worrying because rising temperatures are also increasing soil evaporation in America's most populous state.Californians aren't ready for ""an increasingly dry climate with a population that is continuing to grow without a long-term strategy to address the imbalance,"" Emile-Geay says.Others agree.Heather Cooley of the Pacific Institute praises California for ""tremendous progress"" by decreasing water use to less than its level 30 years ago.But she says the wealthy state has yet to turn the page on its culture of abundance.Governor Jerry Brown's mandatory 25 percent water savings enacted a year ago signaled the end of an era and earner widespread praise.But the state still sees a huge amount of water waste.In the middle of the Californian desert, golf courses in the opulent resort city of Palm Springs abundantly water their greens during the heat of midday while drainage pipes pour rivers of water down the middle of streets.- Need for reflection -The authorities must employ financial incentives to encourage adoption of more efficient toilets and appliances -- otherwise drastically increase the price of water used after a certain limit is reached, experts say.In a region where most urban consumption comes from watering gardens, maintaining green lawns could become an unaffordable luxury.Among other failures, Californians do nothing to collect their rainwater.Worse still, ""everything has been designed to drain water as quickly as possible to avoid flooding,"" Emile-Geay says. ""The water doesn't have time even to wet the soil before it flows into the ocean.""California must accelerate recycling, desalination, and generally ""reflect"" about its system of water rights, which he criticizes as inequitable, archaic and encouraging of ""more use than needed.""Farmers, who consume some 40 percent of California's water, are also coming under fire.Fewer than half have invested in water-conserving micro-irrigation systems. Many grow water-intense crops such as almonds and alfalfa in the middle of the desert.Wholesale water rationing for many has done little to discourage irrigation because revenues from agriculture have stayed level and even reached record levels in 2014, chiefly thanks to soaring commodity prices.Bill Diedrich farms walnuts, almonds and tomatoes in central California -- whose abundant agriculture has earned it the nickname ""salad bowl of the world"" and where each farmer decide decides what to grow according to what's profitable.He believes the solution must come from ""engineering to better collect and distribute the water we have.""Emile-Geay says that won't be enough.""If you compare GDP per liter of water, growing alfalfa in California is very inefficient"" and viable only because of cheap prices for water.""Silicon Valley consumes much less and generates more revenue,"" he says. ""If the agriculture industry paid the real price for water, it wouldn't make sense to grow certain things.""ved/grf/mdl"

Rajendran, Deputy Director, Horticulture, said they proposed to cultivate high-density mango on 100 hectares, hybrid papaya, introduced for the first time in the district, on 70 hectares and high-density guava on 20 hectares in S. Pudur, Singampunari, Sivaganga, Kallal and Tirupattur areas.The department, which organised block-level melas in the first week of August, had selected about 700 farmers, he said adding these farmers were taught canopy management of high-density crops in the seminar. The fruit saplings were ready at State Horticulture Farms at Devakottai and Nemam near Kundrakudi and the cultivation would begin in September ahead of northeast monsoon, he said.Mr. Rajendran said the department would organise a workshop on hi-tech horticulture at Kalayarkoil on August 18 to train the farmers on cultivation using poly houses, shade nets, plastic mulching (to suppress weeds), anti-bird nets and protected cultivation practices of all crops.The department also proposed to cultivate hybrid vegetables, especially tomato, brinjal and green chilly, on 120 hectares. The department had kept ready about 40 lakh seedlings and the farmers would be given an insight into the scheme at a seminar to be held at S. Pudur on August 24. The department also proposed to cultivate cashew on about 100 hectares in Sakkottai, Devakottai and Kallal areas this year, he added."

Mohinder Singh Sidhu's attempt to get out of the conventional crop cycle about two decades ago in Sheron village of Sangrur has been a fully spiced-up example of it.Sidhu started planting red chillies in his village known more for wheat and paddy rotation, season after season. Today, farmers from even Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of neighbouring Haryana come to Sheron to buy chilli seeds from Sidhu. For the forthcoming planting season, he has prepared seeds for 200 acres.Even near home, farmers of his village plan to have at least 50 acres under red chillie as planting starts in a week from now. Till a few years ago, chilli were planted over 10-15 acres. Sidhu's advice to his fellow farmers and higher prices fetched by his crop are the key reasons for the shift.Known as 'chilli king', 53-year-old Sidhu is, however, not limiting himself to one crop only. He also grows various vegetables and oil seeds, including tomatoes, grams, mustard and potatoes in half of his 30-acre landholding.His tryst with the spice crop began in 1995. A trendsetter, Sidhu are first in the area to set up net house at his farm to grow vegetables and chillies.Speaking about his foray into spices and vegetables, Sidhu said, ""A farmer has to spend nearly Rs 30,000 for sowing chilli in one acre and can get an average yield in the range 80-100 quintals. Going by today's price of about Rs 14-15 per kg, one can easily earn up to four times of the total input costs, which is roughly over Rs 1.2 lakh per acre. Having seen the high returns, more than a dozen farmers in my village alone have decided to grow chillies in the season which starts from the middle of February.""He says his motivation to diversify into other crops was simple. ""I wanted to increase my income from existing landholding. That's the reason I decided to grow chilli in 1995, and soon started reaping benefits of my new venture and carve a niche for myself in Punjab. Recognition followed sometime later as I was conferred with the state award for progressive farmer in 1998 from PAU. Next year, I received the Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal Award, and in 2000 PAU bestowed 'Chilli King' title on me. In 2005, I got the Chief Minister's Award."""

Ultimately, the aim is to provide top-class players for Manchester United who can go on to win the Champions League.""Times may have changed since the likes of Butt and Ryan Giggs were cleaning mud off the boots of the seasoned professionals as part of their footballing education.""You don't really want your top young players climbing over the rood to retrieve balls"" -- but knows the danger of producing Academy 'robots' with little intuition,"" Butt said.Great United winger George Best learned his skills dribbling a tennis ball around parked cars on the streets of Belfast.These days of health and safety overload is a challenge for Academies, meaning a little creativity is required.Head of Performance Tony Strudwick recently introduced gymnastics to the club's nine-year-olds with British Olympic athlete Beth Tweddle taking the sessions.""We've also got plans to develop climbing areas, we want to create an environment of controlled chaos where players can start to express themselves,"" he told Reuters.""You look at the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani, they were instinctive athletes, gymnasts. Nani grew up doing back somersaults on the beach.""It's a big challenge for all academies. You don't want automatons. We have to do things differently. Make them strong enough so they don't break.""Nicky's appointment was great for the club,"" he added.""The future is bright and we have some real young dynamic kids here."""

Sadashiva, one of the main criteria for the award was the social and economic impact the research work had on society. These tomato varieties are not only high-yielding, but also show high resistance to three major diseases.This reduces the cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards the cost of fungicides and pesticides, he noted.The fruits of these varieties are suitable for long-distance transportation as they are firm and have a shelf life of 15 to 20 days as against 10 to 12 days of other hybrids, and six to eight days of ordinary tomato varieties, Dr. Sadashiva added.Arka Rakshak, which gives a yield of up to 19 kg a plant, is already sought after by farmers and traders in eight countries.The award for the year 2013-14 was presented recently at a programme held in New Delhi to the nine-member team led by Dr. Sadashiva, principal scientist and Head of the Division of Vegetable Crops, IIHR.The other members of the team are Dr. Peter Hanson, Dr. M.

A more recent survey has shown that over 36% of children in the state are stunted. A meeting on Tuesday of NGOs, which health minister Rajendra Singh Rathore also addressed, dwelt on nutrition financing in the state. The one speaker who had much to offer in terms of learning was Suprabha Agarwal, head of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra.Jack Clift of international NGO Results for Development said his studies had shown that there was a 69% shortfall in nutrition financing in the state. Not only is the allocation insufficient, what money is indeed allocated is not entirely utilized. Under the ICDS programme, for instance, figures for 2014-15 showed 41% underutilization of funds in Rajasthan.Suprabha Agarwal, director of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra, said the nutrition mission in her state was not an implementing agency - it was concerned with proper utilization of resources and strengthening the work of field workers. The mission was launched in 2005, and in the first phase, the emphasis was on strengthening ICDS. In the second phase that began from 2010, the need for effective communication was understood; some feedback received from the community was worked into the programme. It was also recognized that malnutrition cannot be 'treated' - it was best to work for prevention, and for that, women in the fertile age range needed to be properly nourished. The programme has now entered its third phase.Agarwal said the mission worked with a slim team of less than 10 experts for the whole state. However, working with grassroots level workers and encouraging them to adopt imaginative ways to resolve problems has shown great results.""We asked communities to contribute, and received Rs200 crore. We told our anganwadi workers that they should hang out baskets in front of their anganwadis and encourage people to contribute whatever they could. A farmer might only put in one tomato and another might deliver two brinjals - all this could go into the meal cooked for children. The response has been phenomenal. We thought we might only gather enough material for the use of the angwanwadi on one day, but we find we are gathering a surplus and have now devised local earthenware-made refrigeration to store vegetables. During the drought, some farmers told us that they could not offer vegetables, and so gave us some grain. We now have a storage problem to deal with!""Agarwal spoke of effective partnerships with corporate firms under the CSR head, and also networking and collections from communities. ""However, even now, we often have to explain the need for our work to other departments of government. That is one challenge, working in coordination with different wings of the government whose functions overlap. And we need our experts to serve longer terms so that there is continuity in our work. We also feel the need to develop a robust database so we can validate the data we receive from ICDS and other government efforts. "" she said."

The lack of proper planning often leads to such a situation. The crop has to be planned to meet the needs of the market, he said.The price of tomato had shot up sharply because of extremely poor output during the summer days. A large number of farmers cultivating it in a big way has resulted in the glut.Earlier, farmers used to grow tomato only in small plots of land. But now, we have farmers growing tomato in 50- and 100- acre plots in different parts of Mysuru district. Cultivation of tomato is not restricted to rain-fed areas.

Vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed around two weeks ago, have now declined.Chillies and tomatoes, which were selling for as much as Rs 200 per kg and Rs 120 per kg, respectively in the retail market, now cost around Rs 80 per kg and Rs 50 per kg, respectively. Onion prices, too, have dropped from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 15 per kg in Nashik's retail market.Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik Agrucultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), told TOI, ""The supply of vegetables had been affected in Nashik APMC due to the strike by traders and incessant rain around 12 days ago. The supply was already poor due to drought. This, overall, had led to high vegetable prices. But supply has regularised because of the rain and because the strike has been called off by traders, leading to a drop in prices.""He said the vegetable auction process has normalised in the APMC, with farmers bringing their produce for auction regularly. The supply is likely to improve further after a month, given the good monsoon till now, Kale added.Laxman Gade, a farmer, reiterated that vegetable arrivals would increase in around one-and-a-half month's time.""After the rains, vegetable supply has increased to some extent. I sold 25 crates of tomatoes for Rs 600 each (20 kg a crate). Moreover, I also did not have to pay commission to the agent.

On the 18,000-strong Nagpur Foodies group on Facebook, effusive praise of how Param ennobles the humble lentil dish into something sublime is common. At Satranjipura on Old Bhandara Road, inquiry about the dalwallah prompts almost reflexive pointing in the right direction. And yet, for a first-timer, the place might as well be invisible.Reason? The eatery has no real name. No board, however tiny or rickety, announces its presence. ""It's the place where all the big vessels are kept out front,"" a paan seller says.Like quite a few eateries in the West which similarly choose to make themselves obscure by not having any signage, Param remains hidden in plain sight, a haunt for only those who care to seek it out.And when they do, they can't stop licking their fingers. The tiny, ramshackle place with four tables and benches and a vestibule for a kitchen serves all of three things: Dal, tandoori rotis and a fried rice with tomatoes and onions, fried in butter until it goes a mellow brown. No wonder, the wait for a table can be as long as an hour and a half. Taking a parcel is the most sensible thing.Every other restaurant makes dal that is more or less tasty. So, what exactly is it about Param ki dal that draws the people here from far and wide? ""I honestly don't know, baauji,"" the painfully reticent owner, who identifies himself as only Param to this journalist, says. ""You will have to ask that to our customers."" Those who love it say the charcoal-fired tandoor gives it an unparalleled smoky flavour, and that the balance of flavours is perfect.Keeping an eye on a large vessel containing boiling dal and kneading dough for the roti, Param reveals that the eatery has been running since 45 years. ""My elder brother, my four sons and I run it,"" Param, a spindly Sardar with a silver beard and his trademark orange turban, says.Despite the rundown appearance of the place, Param insists that even families don't hesitate coming here to eat. ""The only problem is drunkards from the bars nearby,"" he says. True enough, a tipsy man soon totters in and demands food. He is promptly shooed away.Why don't they spruce up the place or move to a bigger location? ""No, no, we have a small business. We make a limited amount every day. This place is enough,"" he adds.It's true. The joint remains open for only five hours a day: 1pm to 3pm and 5pm to 8pm, or until stocks last. They never do. And when they run out, foodies fondly remember Param saying apologetically: ""Baauji, khana khatam ho gaya.""No matter. Tomorrow, they will return, like they always do, to the dal shop with no name."

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166. The maximum prices of tomato and potato was Rs 80 and Rs 35/kg, respectively."

The price of lady's finger varied between 29 and 44 while native tomato was priced between 14 and 22.These prices are even higher than those quoted at the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Retail Market on Friday. At the retail store, high quality brinjal and lady's finger were priced at 30 while the native tomato cost only 10 per kg.Uzhavar Sandhai was started in 1999 by the state government to promote direct contact between farmers and consumers. Though it was called off between 2001 and 2006, it was revived in 2006 and has been continuing since. The prices are fixed by the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board, based on the day's wholesale and retail prices. The aim of the initiative is to ensure fresh vegetables and fruits are sold to the public at a reasonable price daily.Customers who regularly shop for vegetables and fruits at the farmers'markets say that it has not been the case for many months now. ""We regularly visit the Uzhavar Sandhai at Vadavalli to buy vegetables, but when we go to Pazhamudhir Nilayam to buy certain fruits, we notice that the prices are hardly 2 more per kilo there,"" says S Saritha, a domestic maid in Kurumbapalayam. ""In fact, if you visit Anna Market in the morning, vegetables are often the same price as Uzhavar Sandhai and often even cheaper,"" she says.The agriculture officers posted at the farmers' markets however deny that their prices could be as high as retail prices. ""We usually take the previous night's prices from Thyagi Kumaran Market, the morning prices from Anna Market and Thondamuthur Market and retail prices from Saibaba Colony,"" said an administrative officer at R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai, who refused to be named.""We take an average and fix the price 20% higher than the wholesale price and 20% lower than the retail price. If the farmers insist, we increase the prices by 2 to 3 above the fixed price. But it cannot be more than the prices in retail supermarkets,"" he insists.Consumer activists say that a 20% mark up gives farmers an undue advantage. ""The bus fare for farmers and their vegetables is free. They have no rentals or commission to pay for the stalls. Thus, they basically have no expenses. If they are bypassing traders, their prices should at least match wholesale prices,"" says secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Voice, N Logu.""The men selling vegetables and fruits there are not farmers but traders or people who make use of their identity cards, claiming to be their employees or relatives,"" says G A Wahab, secretary of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Traders Association. ""They claim to be selling better quality vegetables at a higher price. This is not true. They sell surplus and trader rejected vegetables and fruits at a higher price,"" he added.Farmers however say their profit margins are not high. ""We usually get 5 more per kg when we sell directly at the Sandhai. Sometimes, we procure the vegetables from neighbouring farms and sell them at these markets. My onions are priced 5 lower than the retail price,"" said D Pandiavel, a farmer.Saravanan, another farmer in Vadavalli market: Our land and cultivation practices were seen by the horticulture officer in our block who gave us the ID cards. It was also seen by the village administrative officer who verified the ID card. It also mentions the specific vegetables we grow. We do admit that we sometimes buy a few vegetables from Ooty farmers and sell them here. But we are farmers."

On Thursday, as hungry consumers walked into certain stores of the world's largest burger chain here, they were surprised to find their burgers and wraps bereft of the familiar vegetable.A notice displayed at the out lets by Connaught Plaza Restaurants, which operates McDonald's stores in northern and eastern regions of the country, explained that the company was unable to add tomatoes in various products due to temporary unavailability. Unpredictable conditions have impacted the tomato crop, its quality and supply, the notice said.In the past few months, tomato prices in the country have spiked. The latest wholesale price inflation data showed vegetable prices jumped 17% year-on-year in June. Retail prices also revealed a similar stubborn trend. On Thursday, online grocer BigBasket listed the price of tomatoes as Rs 69 per kg on its website.However, senior executives at McDonald's India said the move to curtail the use of tomatoes in its offerings was not the result of high prices but poor quality . ""We are working towards resolving this issue,"" said a spokesperson for McDonald's India (North & East).Executives at several McDonald's outlets in the capital that TOI spoke to said the company was currently not using any substitute for tomato. ""We are making do with lettuce and onions.

Veggie prices have not just hit the roof but blown a hole right through it with green peas and beans touching Rs 190 per kg, putting them beyond the reach of the common man.Prices of vegetables have swung wildly from one extreme to the other in the last few months. In March, prices crashed with most vegetables selling at even Rs 10-15 per kg but that was before the onset of summer. Traders blamed the soaring temperature for pushing up prices to record levels, saying that supplies had reduced as vegetable crops have wilted under the scorching heat.""The rates will remain high for at least a month till the city receives steady supplies from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka,"" said Vegetable Market Association advisor, V R Soundararajan. He said a box of tomatoes weighing 14kg was sold in the wholesale market for Rs 800 while the retailer was selling it at around Rs 80 per kg.In branded supermarkets, even green chillies are selling at Rs 120 per kg. ""The prices of vegetables are so expensive that even a bunch of coriander costs Rs 10.

Though it's all in jest, Rakesh knows it's their way of winking at the dark cloud that settled over their family in June last year. A medical test revealed that their obedient son - who had pursued mechanical engineering to join the family's steel manufacturing business - didn't quite see the world the same way they did. ""We had all only heard of night blindness,"" says Rakesh, who was diagnosed with colour blindness. ""It was as if the world blacked out for me,"" says the engineer, who realised he won't be able to gauge the differences in metal at various stages of steel processing and would have to kiss goodbye to his dream.A resident of a small city in North India, Rakesh is now sitting in a family-run medical centre in Chembur where hope has drawn him. Though there is no known cure for colour blindness, he wants to believe in the clinic's claim of reversing fate within months. Here, in a test that asked Rakesh to pick up two matching crayons and draw parallel lines with them, there is a green line next to a red one. Previously, a doctor he approached had compared the retina to a TV with three antennae - red, blue and green. ""If one of them doesn't work, it could damage how you see all shades,"" the doctor had told Rakesh who suffered from red-green colour blindness, the most common variant. He often tries hard to recall if he ever painted skin blue or mixed colours wrong in art class but only ends up confused. Someone up there had messed with his antennae but, to him, the transmission always felt normal.Globally, nature is known to fiddle with the colour palettes of one out of every 12 men and one of 200 women. While describing this genetic condition, doctors are wary of using the word 'blindness' and prefer 'deficiency'. ""It's not that patients cannot see colour at all,"" says opthalmologist Kavindra Rajoria. ""Due to deficient photo-receptors, they are not able to see certain hues and tell the difference between them."" Among the visuals explaining what the world looks like to patients, a local clinic uses a Tom and Jerry screen grab in which both cat and mouse look jaundiced. ""It's like tone-deafness,"" says a colour-blind musician in the international short 'No Such Thing As Color'. ""Colour is an artefact of perceptions. Who's to say what you are seeing is really the colour you say it is?"" he rationalises.Philosophy, however, is a poor comforter for patients in India, who grapple with a bleak future. It isn't until later in life, when they appear for medical tests for government jobs that most Indian men realise they have a problem and many have to abandon dreams of joining the army, navy, aviation or jobs involving chemicals or colours. For 26-year-old Sarvesh, who grew up in Jabalpur and now lives in Mumbai, the verdict came in 2005 when he couldn't pass the medical test for aviation in India. ""Before that, I had been flying in Australia on a pilot's license,"" says the well-built pilot, who was forced to look for new career options on moving back to his home country. ""I don't know why India sees it as an impediment for pilots. There have been no accidents in Australia and in fact, during World War II, colourblind people were used in spy planes as they could see contours better,"" says Sarvesh, who usually boasts a thick skin but recalls not being able to laugh off deliberately-posed questions like: ""Can you get that blue bag for us?""While coping with the invisible condition, desperation takes over. ""Many break down,"" says opthalmologist K K Goyal, recalling a phone call from Kerala at two in the night. ""I am going to commit suicide,"" said a despondent man who had spent nearly Rs 30 lakh on aviation training before the diagnosis clipped his wings. Goyal has also met patients from small villages who have sold their lands for the sake of education.Problems could range from everyday situations such as not being able to see the queen on a carrom board to not being able to read traffic lights. Besides an aspiring cricketer who complained that he could not see the ball, Goyal has also come across an exporter of green tomatoes in Gujarat whose business suffered because of his deficiency. ""If there happened to be a red tomato in a vehicle full of green ones, his eyes would see the entire cart of tomatoes as red,"" says Goyal.Many prefer hiding the deficiency from the world like stutterers, some fear it hurting marriage prospects and others hate the questions. ""People's usual reaction,"" says 28-yearold Pradeep, ""is to point at things like walls and bedsheets and ask what colour they are."" For this Delhi-based power system consultant, the diagnosis in 2009 brought with it genuine confusion. Today, he has learnt to be smarter. Pradeep, who drives from Noida to Sector 15 daily for work, has memorised the order of the traffic signal and knows that the arrow denotes green and the circle, red."" Someone told him that wearing glasses of the colour that poses a problem would help but he has yet to try it.In retrospect, Rakesh, clinging to hope at a Mumbai clinic says he would have studied chartered accountancy if he had discovered his problem earlier. The treatment promised is costing him Rs 2 lakh. ""It's a small price for not ending up as a watchman outside my dream firm,"" says Rakesh, as he awaits the green signal.(Names have been changed to protect identity)"

It now costs Rs 30-35 at the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai. This is due to a shortage as the yield has been low.Tomatoes are sourced from Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border and the central and southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Since the yield is low, some tomato consignments are being diverted to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where there is a shortage. So the prices have increased in Tamil Nadu. Retail prices in different parts of Chennai varied from Rs 60 to 90 on Monday. In Madurai, tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kg in May last year now costs as much as Rs 70.Experts are blaming climate change for the price rise. Tomato crops in thousands of acres were lost due to high afternoon temperature that prevailed in the months of February and March, says project officer of the Center of Excellence for Vegetables K Srinivasan. ""Tomato is a temperature-sensitive plant. The flowers open up and pollination takes place during the Feb- March season when the afternoon temperature is around 35 degree Celsius. But this year, temperature had soared to above 40 degree Celsius in many places, affecting the crop,"" he told TOI.Such a change in temperature has not been witnessed in the past five decades, he says. ""The stigma of the plant has to be supple to aid pollination, but this year, most of the plants developed rigid stigmas, which affected the flowering process,"" he added.In the southern region tomato is cultivated in about 8,000 acres in Dindigul district, mainly in Palani, Reddiarchathiram and Oddanchathiram blocks. However, the area under cultivation was reduced to less than half because the plants were not able to survive the heat, farmers said. One such farmer, K Sundaramoorthy from Dindigul, lost his entire crop due to the prevailing temperature and lack of rain.In Madurai, another vegetable that has become costly is the green chilli, which is selling at Rs 90 in the retail market and Rs 70 in the wholesale market. ""This is due to the high temperatures, which has affected the flowering of crops,"" says K Vivekanandan a farmer from Theni. The supply to the market had come down from 10 truck loads last week to just two to three loads now.Farmers say that the price of the tomatoes will come down only after the monsoon sets in, in June. ""The prices are going to keep skyrocketing because there is no production of tomatoes throughout Tamil Nadu at present to meet the market expectations,"" added Thiagarajan.In Trichy, the areas around Vaiyampatti near Manapparai account for a considerable production of tomatoes. According to horticulture department officials, around 50 hectares in Vaiyampatti are involved in tomato production during March, April and May."

The duty is, however, lower than 25 per cent proposed by the Food Ministry.India, the world's second largest sugar producer after Brazil, has exported 1.6 million tonnes of sugar so far in the 2015-16 marketing year (October-September). Further exports are unlikely to take place with this decision.With retail sugar prices soaring to around Rs 40/kg from Rs 30/kg six months ago, the government has taken various steps to contain prices including withdrawal of export-linked production subsidy and imposition of stock limits on traders.Last week, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan had announced that his ministry has proposed to ""levy 25 per cent custom duty on export of sugar"" to keep exports under control.""Global sugar prices are rising and therefore traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" he had said.Industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) did not offer any comments immediately.However, a senior industry official welcomed the decision in view of tight demand-supply situation expected in the next 2016-17 marketing year starting October.With imposition of export duty, the official said that exports have become unviable.An increase of 50 per cent in global sugar prices in last three months due to disruption in supply from Brazil had made exports viable.The country's sugar production is estimated to decline to 25 million tonnes in 2015-16, as against 28.3 million tonnes last year. The annual domestic demand is pegged at 26 million tonnes.Moreover, the government has forecast further decline in output in next year at 23-24 million tonnes. However, it has maintained that there would be no shortage as the country would have the opening stock of 7 million tonnes at the start of the next marketing year, taking total availability to 30-31 million tonnes."

The wholesale rates are much lower, so why are we paying twice as much in retail?"" asked Suman Gupta, a resident of Patparganj.Wholesalers said that the high prices will remain for some more time, especially since more rain has been predicted for the coming days.""It is not unusual for vegetable prices to rise during the monsoon. Fields are flooded and it is very difficult to bring vegetables out of the fields,"" said Mahinder Sanpal, member, APMC Azadpur.""Also, the vegetables start rotting because they get wet. It is the green vegetables that are affected the most. Another problem is that vehicles carrying vegetables are not being able to reach Delhi in time due to waterlogged roads,"" Sanpal added.The other reason for shortage of vegetables and consequent rise in price is the flooding of the Yamuna banks because of which local produce has been ruined."

As a result, a full meal which used to cost Rs.60 at a conventional mess till recently, now costs Rs. 80.Generally, escalating prices of vegetables, pulses and other commodities have an impact on the costs of meals. This year, along with these factors, mess owners are forced to hike the meals charges due to the abnormal rise in rents in the city.It is a general practice for landlords to revise rents by 10 per cent every year. But ever since the government announced Vijayawada as the temporary capital of the State and has been focusing on shifting the durbar from Hyderabad to Amaravati, rents have been jacked up drastically.This was anticipated. My landlord increased the rent abnormally and I had no choice but to pass on the increase in the operational costs to consumers. Hence, a meal now costs Rs.80, said an owner of mess on Tikkle Road. The worst thing, most owners are demanding the tenants to vacate the premises in hope of getting higher rents from their next tenants. We are on a sticky wicket. After establishing the business, neither can we vacate the premises for the fear of losing income nor can run the business from a fresh location as it will cost even more, adds another mess owner.It is not just mess owners, hotels and restaurants too are planning to revise the charges shortly. Escalating rents are definitely a factor, but one has to consider the rising prices of pulses, labour costs, vegetables too. A kg of red gram still costs more than Rs. 160 and the price of a kg black gram continues to hover around Rs.170, explains a member of Vijayawada Hotels Association.This apart, prices of tomatoes, carrots, ribbed gourd, lady fingers have increased drastically when compared to last year. Vegetable traders inform that it is mainly due to poor arrivals. Earlier, vegetables used to be supplied from rural areas like Mylavaram in Krishna district and neighbouring areas but now most arrivals come from Prakasam district. Citing transportation costs, traders have increased the vegetables prices, he informs.Sharp increase in rentals andhike inprices of essential commodities make eatery owners in the city pass the rise in operational cost on to consumers"

A number of shops were seen dealing with endless customers who have been swarming to meet their last-minute needs. Vegetable vendors were striking a fair deal with the visitors who were stuffing their bags with brinjals, tomatoes, onions and potatoes.This was the early morning scene at Peethalavanipalem located between Sivajipalem and Pithapuram Colony. This century-year-old village, where the locals once grew crops like maize and tobacco, is now a bustling colony. With a perennial stream flowing through the area, the place was once a convenient place for farming. As one explores deep into the neighbourhood, some of the original residents talk about how the colony has been witnessing accelerated growth in terms of urbanisation for the last six decades. Though the entire colony stretches up to four acres, there are about 7,000 people who live in this locality. Today, there is no trace of the natural stream as it has been replaced by a number of concrete structures. Cattle rearing and farming used to be the prime sources of income for majority of people.However, with urbanisation taking a toll on the natural rural setting, there is barley any original landmark existing in Peethalavanipalem, says Peethala Sanyasi Naidu, who has been living here for decades.There are several multi-storeyed group houses that dot the area. Sri Krishna Nilayam school, a Shiva temple, a number of grocery stores, health clinics, and a cancer screening prevention research centre cum Translational Research Institute of Molecular Sciences form a part of the map. People say major portion of the site was once owned by Peethala Paidiah, a colony resident. His descendants, who continue to live in the same place, reveal that the neighbourhood suffers from poor sanitation.Since there is no proper drainage system in place, the area is flooded with sewage water during rainy season. In addition to this, the open drains that pass through the lanes have been blocked at several points as many residents conveniently dump their domestic waste into them. Sanitation workers who visit the area are not equipped with adequate bins, brooms and other necessary equipment. As a result, the cleaning process takes a beating, says Botta Neelima, former corporator who plans to create awareness campaign on health and hygiene involving GVMC workers across the ward.Zone II Commissioner: P.

But due to the declined flow, the markets are no more the centres of activity. Tomato used to arrive here from Madanapalli in Chittoor district. But following the recent rains and floods in Chittoor, farmers lost their crop resulting in no supplies for the district. Decline in production leading to shortage of vegetables is not just the only reason for price rise.

A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest. He said that imported tomatoes should be randomly checked for infection and infected fruits destroyed. He also said that farmers should be trained to detect the symptoms of attack by tuta absoluta.Deploying pheromone traps in all stages of the crop has been found effective against leaf miner.Use of sticky traps or water-oil traps with pheromone bait; deployment of parasitoids and predators too are effective."

""I could cultivate all the vegetables I need in my little terrace garden,"" he told TOI. Along with vegetables and greens, Jayasimman is also raising various medicinal plants and even a cherry fruit tree on his terrace garden. ""As my garden is producing abundantly, I get all vegetables for the daily needs from there and hardly goes to the vegetable market any more,"" he says.The department will complete the distribution of 15,000 kits in the next six months, Poopathy says. ""With the gaining acceptance of terrace gardens among public, we are optimistic of completing the annual target very soon,"" he added."

Acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to Rs80 a kg. Although it is much less than the record high of over Rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. There may be no respite till the winters. Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar."

Not only the tomatoes, wholesale price of onions too have plumetted to 20 to 30 paise a kg, almost negligible, in several districts including Vidisha, Neemuch and Mandsaur, where farmers cannot afford even transportation cost.Vidisha, also the parliamentary constituency of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, reported a bumper harvest of tomatoes which has resulted into low demand, leaving the farmers in tears. Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income. ""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha. We don't have money even for transporting them,"" said Kamal Singh.""Almost 5,000 farmers in the entire district are facing this problem while, Prime Minister Modi launched the National Agriculture Market on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar'', Vidisha district panchayat member Kailash Raghuvanshi told TOI.He said farmers are in a poor condition and cannot get money in return as so many of them have not availed crop insurance policy due to administrative hassles. ""CM had sowed tomatoes in a 10 acre area. Initially he sold 15 quintals at a high price but the moment price crashed, he asked for free distribution in slum areas,"" said Raghuvanshi. The cost of sowing tomatoes in one bigha (2.5 acres) is estimated to Rs 40,000. As district recorded a bumper crop, one bigha received 17,500 kgs of tomatoes. But at a rate of Rs 2 a kg or less, the farmers are not getting even Rs 35,000 from a bigha."

The buyers too lovingly select each piece and judge it for its colour , juice and taste, as it will enhance the flavours of gravies and salads. But with the price of tomato shooting up to Rs80 per kg, nearly double of what it was selling for just a month back, the average housewife is either giving it a miss or picking up just a quarter of a kilo. As bank employee Laxmi Sreedhran puts it, ""Maybe I don't know how to prepare curries without it.""Frowning at the off colour and blemished tomatoes available currently and also costing a bomb, businessman Rajeev Sharma, who shops for vegetables for his family, says, ""Our monthly budget are forever being ruined by the prices of either tomatoes, coriander and onions.

""The vendor says that its due to poor rains so we are just waiting for prices to dip again.""Though families may adjust, those in food business bear the brunt of such sudden spike in prices.

Only last evening I was selling tomatoes for Rs 60 a kg. When I went to buy a fresh stock this morning, they had jacked up the price to Rs 70 per kg, compelling me to raise prices as well.I suppose the reason for the increase is that most crops have failed due the heat.

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down.

The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high.

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

Mercury, the green planet that rules Gemini and Virgo, makes them prone to skin disorders, according to astrology and they are advised to increase intake of cucumber, mango panna and mint extract.Cancerians are believed to be moody because of the moon sign so best for them is coconut water. Leos, should take orange juice, said the astrologer.""Capricorn and Aquarius are governed by the planet Saturn, which is black, so phalsa, beetroot and blackberry are ideal for them,"" said Varshney, adding, mango shake, and sugarcane are best suited for those born under Sagittarius and Pisces."

In retail markets on Sunday, beans was being sold at more than Rs 100 per kg depending on varieties, while tomato was priced at Rs 90 per kg. Online retailers were selling them at around Rs 180 and Rs 60, respectively.However, prices of carrot and capsicum were holding -- around Rs 50 and Rs 70 per kg, respectively. Ridge gourd, bitter gourd and raddish prices are hovering around Rs 40 and Rs 10.RV Gopi, president, Vegetable Merchants' Association, said the prices of vegetables like tomato and beans were high because of excessive heat in summer which had dried up water resources, thus affecting the yield drastically.Vegetables like cabbage had become costlier, up from Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg, because it was off-season.Traders said vegetables like ridge ground, bitter gourd and raddish were unaffected by the blistering summer heat because they are grown in horticulture gardens and on a very low scale, unlike beans and tomato that are cultivated on a large scale. There's also a dip in the supply of tomatoes from various places in Karnataka and the vegetable is being sourced for Bengaluru from Maharashtra, they added.Gopi, however, said online retailers are making a killing on select vegetables that some households consider essential with profit as the only motive.Choudhury Md Idrees, secretary Russel Market Traders Association, said though Hopcoms prices are cheaper compared to other open retail markets, consumers, including large-scale buyers like restaurant owners, still prefer the latter as it meet the demands for both quality and variety."

The tusker could not make its way back into the forest because of an elephant-proof trench and solar fencing. After failing to get into the woods, the panic-stricken elephant went on the rampage, bringing down trees and an electrical pole near the village.An official admitted that the elephant got angry and went on the rampage in panic. Then, it accidentally stepped on a live power cable of the pole lying on the ground, leading to its death.The tusker, which was suffering from an infection in its teeth, was moving around in villages along the forest border for the past fortnight, feeding on crops grown there. The infection came to light only after its post-mortem. The officials were also surprised to find tomatoes in its stomach. They also discovered that the pachyderm had infection in its teeth because of which it could not have food available in the wild.Elephants mostly eat hard food like grass, tree leaves, wild fruits, twigs, shrubs and bamboo. The tursker may have ventured out of the woods in search of a soft diet.Vet D N Nagaraj told TOI that they found only tomatoes in its belly.

In May, tomatoes were priced around 20. Vendors say the prices are expected to fall from this week.Farming community sources said freaky weather has affected cultivation in the region. While rain has affected the yield, the intense heat after a short spell of rain prevented tomato plants from flowering. ""The supply has shrunk due to lack of production. For a short while farmers who cultivate tomatoes will get good prices,"" commented K Devaraj , a farming community leader. However, the farmers are paid hardly 25 to 30 as farm gate prices, while a major portion of the retail price is enjoyed by middlemen, farmers said.The skyrocketing prices of tomato and other vegetables are burning a huge hole in the pockets of middleclass families.""In the last few weeks, all vegetable prices have gone up many folds. The tomato price hike is the worst because hardly any curry can be prepared without adding tomatoes,"" said P Dhanlakshmi, a housewife in the city.Vendors are optimistic that the prices will start falling from this week. Currently tomatoes are sold at 80 and above per kilo. The Tamil month Vaikasi has many auspicious days where marriages and family functions were fixed. Not just lack of production but increased demand also contributed to price hike.""Once Vaikasi month ends, the prices of all vegetables will start falling because the next two Tamil months of Aani and Adi are considered not so auspicious and demand will shrink. The production will also increase in the meantime,"" said M T Sethupathi , a vegetable vendor at Madurai Central Market."

But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up. The purple coloured kala khatta which is sweet and tangy is a universal favourite. We procure the ice from the Besant Nagar depot. It is made with clean water,"" says Shaktivel."

Ramamoorthy, the protesting cadre said that people who voted for the BJP government felt cheated because the promised jobs were not coming. Instead, prices of essential commodities had increased and there was no sign of the government retrieving black money. By presenting fudged statistics to the people, the BJP government tried to deceive the people. The Tamil Nadu government was no different.At the time of the 2014 Parliamentary election, the BJP promised that if it were to be voted to power it would control prices. But today, the prices had skyrocketed. Tur dal that sold at Rs. 70 a kg two years ago was now priced at Rs. 240 a kg, a kg of tomato had touched Rs. 100 now and in the last three months vegetable prices had increased 120 per cent. The price of sugar had tripled and all this led to the common man shelling more money out of his pocket.The BJP claimed that Prime Ministers foreign visits brought foreign direct investment into the country and that it led to job creation. But the reality was very different. Young people were either unemployed or underemployed. Plus the jobs that were being created were not permanent. Most of those were temporary or contractual in nature.The CPM cadre also said that the jobs in labour-intensive sectors like textile, spinning mills, leather, transport, etc. had fallen."

The price of tomatoes has gone through the roof.A few months back, farmers in Haveri and other areas were tomatoes are cultivated had thrown a huge quantity of their produce onto the roads and destroyed crops when the prices dropped to Rs 1 kg. But now everything has changed. Earlier, tomatoes were priced between Rs 10 to 20 per kg. Now the price is between Rs 60 to 80 per kg. Many people have stopped buying tomatoes and are switching to tamarinds as a substitute. Despite being an essential ingredient, most households have reduced the quantity of tomato purchase.Manjunath Banidani, a vendor in Hubballi, says many vendors have stopped buying large quantities of tomatoes from wholesalers since the price has gone beyond the reach of the poor.

File PhotoIt is the marriage season, with exciting fare in feasts to look forward to.Despite elaborate arrangements, some families find their best-laid plans washed away by unexpected rise in prices of vegetables.Vegetarian feasts include beans and carrots. But with the prices of beans skyrocketing these past several weeks, chefs have had to replace it.Radha Varadarajan of Arr Vee Caterers says that when he catered for a wedding recently, beans was included despite the steep price.But if the client is flexible, then they replace it with yard-long beans or broad beans.Of course, we will make sure to provide the best of taste, he says, adding such a steep increase in price was witnessed last in 2012.But one of the highest I have seen in my 30-year career was in 1994 when one kg cost Rs.180. Yet, we served beans since the client was very particular, he says.Though caterers can replace plantains with potatoes, tomatoes and onions are a staple, says M. Krishna Rao, who runs Sree Durga Caterers. We cannot do without tomatoes and onions for rasam and sambar. But more than often than not, we do not pass on the price rise on the clients final bill, he adds.A. Selvaraj, general secretary of Chennai Koyambedu Periyar Market Tomato Merchants Association, says beans sold at Rs.80-100 per kg at Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday. Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop.The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

The method was simple research analysis to highlight key economic policies.He said, ""While the country had left behind the licence-quota-permit raj and opened up for foreign direct investment in greater number of sectors, what had come to afflict the economy was the 'exit problem'."" He was referring to how loss-making firms found it difficult to exit and citied the example of fertilizer sector. The inefficient firms were not even employment-intensive and so it was easy for them to shut down. ""There is a need to readjust and recalibrate exit,"" he pointed out.He further said he was excited about the clothing sector to bring in growth and social transformation; it was much more labour-intensive than sectors like auto and steel and had the potential to empower women by creating jobs for them. He also said it was one of the areas where shrinking share by the Chinese could be cornered by Indian firms.Subramanian said Brexit was one of the significant developments with serious political and economic consequences for both the UK and Europe, but India would not be affected by it due to its solid macroeconomics.""Brexit is a setback for liberalization. It is a landmark moment in history since World War II,"" he said. Brexit has reversed the experiment by European countries for togetherness as a collective entity.The CEA blamed under-cultivation and inadequate production for rise in prices of pulses. In the backdrop of surge in tomato price, he said fluctuation in vegetable prices was linked to market forces rather than cultivation. ""The markets should be made better to stabilize vegetable prices,"" he said.Subramanian also spoke on the need for strengthening the state's role in bridging fiscal relations between the rich and poor people and regretted low fiscal capacity of the country due to unusually low base of taxpayers. The ratio of voters to taxpayers in the country stands at 4%, but it should be 23% for a country at its level of economic and political development.As a legitimate tool to reduce gap between the rich and the poor, the state should build a mechanism under which there should be delivery of public goods for all, but the bounties for well-offs must be reduced and they should be taxed regardless of source of income, Subramanian said. Stating that the state is spending Rs 76,000 crore on the well-offs by way of various subsidies, he suggested such dole outs should be done away with.He also emphasized on spreading JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) for financial inclusion of the poor and said the government was moving in the right direction by spreading Jan Dhan and Aadhaar schemes.He said the government has three pending agendas  GST, strategic disinvestment and twin balance sheets. On inequality, he said the debate in the West might be misleading in the Indian context as the Indian economy needed education, health and employment."

But with the prices of beans skyrocketing these past several weeks, chefs have had to replace it.Radha Varadarajan of Arr Vee Caterers says that when he catered for a wedding recently, beans was included despite the steep price. But if the client is flexible, then they replace it with yard-long beans or broad beans. Of course, we will make sure to provide the best of taste, he says, adding such a steep increase in price was witnessed last in 2012.But one of the highest I have seen in my 30-year career was in 1994 when one kg cost Rs.180. Yet, we served beans since the client was very particular, he says.Though caterers can replace plantains with potatoes, tomatoes and onions are a staple, says M. Krishna Rao, who runs Sree Durga Caterers. We cannot do without tomatoes and onions for rasam and sambar. But more than often than not, we do not pass on the price rise on the clients final bill, he adds.A. Selvaraj, general secretary of Chennai Koyambedu Periyar Market Tomato Merchants Association, says beans sold at Rs.80-100 per kg at Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday. Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop. The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

In some cases, even apple-growers have taken to cultivating vegetables like tomato, cauliflower and cabbage.

Many claims have been made about natural ingredients that possess powerful anti-cancerous properties and do not have any side-effects. One of the more popular substances in this regard is quercetin, a naturally occurring compound in several fruits and vegetables.How it worksA team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) explains the quercetin phenomenon. Quercetin, known to cause anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activity, reportedly induces apoptosis, a process by which cells commit suicide in a controlled manner. The compound is also said to prevent multiplication of cancerous cells by blocking the process of cell division. It can even kill the highly aggressive leukaemia cell line K562, which is resistant to most anti-cancerous drugs.Quercetin is abundantly found in commonly available food items such as tomatoes, broccoli, raw asparagus, raw red onion, red and black grapes, apple, apricot, cherry and coriander.It is an originally purified compound, which is now also commercially purified and sold. There are many compounds like quercetin, but it is one of the most common ones, said Satheesh C. Raghavan, Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, IISc.The team conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of the compound by not only looking at the cancer cell line, but also by inducing cancerous tumours in mice.What was found was that quercetin treatment significantly reduced the size of the cancerous tumour in the experimental animals. The compound also interacted with the mices DNA, which is one of the mechanisms by which it can destroy cancerous cells.Significantly, quercetin was found to have no adverse effects on the non-cancerous cells even while killing the cancerous ones, including in the experimental animals.Another studyA second study conducted on extract prepared from the medicinal plant Vernonia condensata, which is used in the treatment of cough, pneumonia, stomach ache, digestive problems, muscular pain, liver problems, snakebite and diarrhoea, also exhibited a similar cancer cell-killing effect.Though its potential as an anticancer drug is clear, Prof. Raghavan said its effect could be limited when used in isolation. It would vary from person to person, as is in the case of any regular treatment, he said, adding that it could work better in combination with other treatment."

Edible fish are grown in a tank. Their poop enriches the water with nutrients. This water is pumped into gravel beds with edible plants rooted in them. As the water flows through the gravel beds, the plants roots and the bacteria that grow on the gravel take nutrients from the water. This nourishes the plants and cleans the water. The clean water then flows back into the fish tank. To find the feasibility of raising various types of vegetables in aquaponics, studies have been conducted at Hi-Tech Research and Training Unit, (HTR-TU), Kerala Agricultural University, Vellanikkara, said P. Suseela, Associate Professor, HTR&TU.Here crops like salad cucumber, tomato, yard long bean, cabbage, cauliflower, mint, lettuce and palak have been raised successfully. It doesnt need acres of land. The space required for aquaponics is much less than a traditional garden. After the system is set up the maintenance cost is comparatively less. In this system, we will get healthy, fresh organic food and fresh fish. Water and nutrient delivery to the plants is completely automated. Water need of aquaponics is less than 10% of traditional farming and pest attack is less. Plants grow twice faster, she said."

A kg of beans will set you back by Rs. 130, which is a Rs. 44 jump over a one-month period; it was Rs. 86 in the first week of April. In some places, it is retailing at Rs 160 per kg.All-time highThe price of several vegetables has reached an all-time high since January 2016. One of the reasons is a shortfall in supplies, say retailers.Even root vegetables, like beetroot and radish, which usually sell at less than Rs. 20, have crossed the Rs. 40 mark while a kilo of garlic has gone from Rs. 80 per kilo to Rs. 140.A procurement official from a leading retail chain said that supply had dipped to a meagre 35 to 40 per cent of normal. The fall has been attributed to the unusually hot weather during the last two weeks of April and the first week of May when the temperature crossed the 39 degree Celsius mark in many parts of Karnataka. This resulted in crops failure.Vegetables from other StatesWhat has actually kept the prices in check is the supply of certain veggies from other States. Every day, around 150 tonnes of tomatoes are being pumped into the Bengaluru market from Nashik in Maharashtra. Significant quantities of carrot and beans are being supplied from Tamil Nadu. However, the quality of tomatoes from Nashik is not good, owing to which prices are yet to stabilise, a senior Hopcoms official said.The market is yet to reap the benefit of the recent spell of rain.The recent spell has pulled the mercury level down and made water available, but the impact will not be felt on prices for another two weeks, said a senior Hopcoms official.G. Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, said that soaring temperature is not the biggest problem.Even if all other factors are favourable, there is no regular power supply to draw water from tubewells, he explained. Unless power supply improves, veggie prices are unlikely to stabilise soon, he added."

Last year, when a group of homeopathy students from Malaysia and Iraq were in the city at the Shaad Homoeopathic Hospital and Research Centre for their residential training, an informal visit to a village in Umrer triggered an experiment in using homeopathy in agriculture.During the visit organized by Rotary Club of South East, the students happened to compare the size and quality of Bhiwapuri chillies at Manora village near Umrer, just for fun. Then, suddenly one of the students thought aloud whether homeopathy would work on plants. This led to the experiment to check the effect of homeopathic medicines in improving yield and quality of vegetable crops. The experiment got reasonably good results in six vegetables.""I had heard and read some basic literature about Vaikunthanath Das Kaviraj from Netherlands using homeopathy for agriculture diseases. Hence, when this idea came, I decided to give it a try. Agro-homeopathy is in its infancy. But I feel that in the days of organic farming, homeopathy could improve yield and minimize costs,"" said Dr Aadil Chimthanawala, who has published the team's findings in the National Academy of Homeopathy, India (NAHI) Times.The entire Chimthanawala family; Aadil's father Dr Kasim Chimthanawala, wife Dr Fatema Chimthanawala, and mother Dr Sagira Chimthanawala, was excited with the idea. They first experimented in the laboratory at Shaad Hospital in Itwari, and then replicated it in the fields and obtained good results there too.The father-son duo, Dr Kasim and Dr Adil, both are qualified allopaths but have been practicing homeopathy for decades, are very open to any scientific criticism or trials by others. ""We wish some agriculture scientists takes up the project and validates the findings. We are not agriculturists or even scientists. We wish the department of Ayush nominates some university or scientist to further the research,"" said Dr Kasim.The two doctors have always believed in scientific treatment of patients. Hence, they studied basic medicine (MBBS degree) to understand the functioning of the human body, the anatomy and physiology. Now, they want science to take its own course in establishing their findings and hence are not making any tall claims.The experiments included use of potentized doses of silicea (silica), sulphur, magnesium pros, phosphorous, calcarea carbonicum on methi or fenugreek, tomatoes, green chilli (capsicum annum), brinjal, French beans and spinach or palak respectively as liquid sprays. The experiments resulted in not just increase in yield of vegetables, but also bigger, thicker and greener leaves in the leafy vegetables.Dr Aadil doesn't hesitate in admitting that, for reasons unknown to him, homeopathic medicines didn't work in certain crops. ""We got very bad results with potato. They didn't germinate. But there is no harm in continuing the experiment further on other crops like grains and fruits etc. We would be happy if some agriculture scientists join us and guide us. At present, we have just tried to increase the yield but can try them for controlling diseases too,"" he said.Explaining some of the homeopathic medicines used, Dr Kasim Chimthanawala said in animals or humans use of silicea helps improve assimilating capacity of any substance or elements in the body of the person. For example, in human body it helps absorb calcium better.* Homeopathic medicines were either dissolved in water or applied to the plants or used as sprays* All experiments were conducted using non-manured soil* In fenugreek or methi, plants became stunted but their roots had much better grip in soil and leaves were greener and thicker* In chilli, use of magnesium pros couldn't produce any changes and could not control the leaf curl syndrome in plants* In French beans, medicine instilled enough immunity to survive rust disease with better yield"

Now, the 86-year-old is back in the city she was born taking the community count up by one. And, she has taken upon herself the onerous task of keeping the authentic Jewish flavours alive for her nine-member strong community. Yes, you read it right: nine.Demographers put the strength of the Jewish community in the city at less than 20, but the members are rather strict about who they call ""pure"". Those that have married ""outside"" the community are strictly not ""pure"" Jews.""I have come back to the city because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most...but I am keeping the flame alive,"" she says.Silliman also happens to be among the last keepers of the community's ancient recipes and has decided to chronicle the unique tastes for posterity.""Even the food that Jews here have today is not what we are permitted by our religion. There's so much of mix and match that most of the authentic cuisine that is over 5,000 years old and has its roots in the Middle East, is lost. I am trying to keep the tradition alive by documenting the recipes and rustling up dishes for feasts,"" says Silliman.Jewish food is special because Jews just can't eat cause Jews just can't eat anything and everything, Silliman says. Their food -kosher -has to abide by strict dietary laws which not only lay down what is forbidden but also the process of cooking, the ingredients and the kitchen specifications. Kosher, for example, does not permit meat to be mixed with milk or milk products.So, neither can you mix the two while cooking, nor can you consume milk or milk products after having meat. Flower Silliman says: ""Judaism has a great similari ty with Hinduism so far as its antiquity and dietary specifications go. It's another matter that most followers of both religions have drifted away from these guidelines... perhaps because they have often found it difficult to cope with such restrictions. I am not saying this by way of criticism, but the fact is that cuisines, and even cultures, become extinct because of such interpolation.""A traditional sit-down Jewish feast on Friday night can ideally start with beet khatta with koobah (beet soup with chicken or vegetable balls), followed by Jewish roast chicken, which is different from the European roast in the kind of marinades and spices used. ""The authentic Jewish roast will be far milder, both in flavour and sharpness, compared to the European roast,"" Silliman says.Kosher allows Jews to only have fish that have scales, and not those with shells (prawns, crabs or lobsters). ""So you have items like fish shoofta, which is minced fish skewers. Vegetable lovers have choices like vegetable mahashas, which is stuffed tomatoes and capsicum.But the magic is in the recipe for the stuffing. The authenticity of the dish is heightened when served with aloo makalla (a special potato fry), hulba (a sort of fenugreek, mint and coriander chutney) and cucum ber zalata. Another speciality is mutton or vegetable ingree -a layered meat dish baked with brinjals, tomatoes and potatoes -not unlike the Greek moussaka, but without dairy to keep within kosher limits,"" Silliman explains with the lucidity of an expert.And why not? While abroad, Silliman served as a souschef at the Plaza in Jerusalem and launched the world's only kosher Jewish restaurant, Maharaja. She taught cooking and ran masterchef shows in US and London and authored two books. ""I have come back to Kolkata because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most... but I am keeping the flame alive."""

It wasn't too long ago that the Clintons and Trumps professed to be friends, with Clintons attending Trump's third marriage, Trump donating to the Clinton Foundation and playing golf with the former president, who had appointed Trump's sister as a circuit court judge.

Their supporters are now clashing angrily and violently. A skirmish in San Jose, California on Thursday outside a Trump rally resulted in a barrage of tomatoes, eggs, and heated words.Hours before that, in what was presented as a major foreign policy speech delivered in San Diego , Clinton let loose a fusillade of scornful putdowns and scorching slights of the kind seldom heard in the higher reaches of US politics, which is generally governed by an unwritten civil code of conduct, broken largely in 2017 by the tempestuous Trump. Clinton hit back forcefully.""Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different - they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas - just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies,"" she began at the top of her 30-minute speech, much of which was aimed at demolishing the maverick billionaire's obvious lack of depth and substance. She added: ""He is not just unprepared - he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.""Cautioning Americans that electing Trump to the White House would be a ""historic mistake,"" Clinton pointed to his testy, knee-jerk, off-the-cuff responses, warning that ""This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes - because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin."" Trump publicly gets snippy at anyone asking him questions pretty much about anything.""We cannot let him roll the dice with America... he believes we can treat the US economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world,"" Clinton said, adding, ""The stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table - bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets - I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.""Hours later, an obviously stung Trump responded petulantly: ""After what she said about me today in her phony speech - that was a phony speech, that was a Donald Trump hit job - I will say this: Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, okay?""""She has to go to jail.

The Centre announced that it is looking at importing pulses from Myanmar as India stares at a huge gap between demand and domestic availability. ""If the private players are not importing enough, then we have to take the necessary steps to reduce the gap,"" food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.In 2015-16 crop year, production of pulses is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes while demand is pegged at 23.5mt. Even after imports by private firms, the country is staring at shortage of about 18 lakh tonnes.Soaring food prices, particularly pulses, vegetables and dairy products, has been the key driver of both retail and wholesale price inflation.Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 5.8% in May from previous month's 5.5% increase. The food price index jumped 7.6% in May from April's 6.4% year-on-year increase.The increase was led by a surge in price of pulses and products, which shot up 31.6% in May while sugar and confectionery prices rose 14% year-on-year.Prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish also firmed up, exerting pressure on overall numbers.Prices of vegetables jumped 10.8% year-on-year in May .""The three steps decided at the meet will be taken immediately. Though price of pulses is comparatively little less than last year, we are taking necessary steps. States must also do their bit, put their demand to get pulses from the central buffer stock,"" Paswan said.He said the Centre is ready to provide unmilled pulses at subsidised rate to states and they must sell the processed dal at not more than Rs 120 per kilogram. In recent weeks, prices of arhar and urad have touched Rs 170 and Rs 196 per kg respectively . The food minister said that prices of no other food item was discussed at Tuesday's meeting.""Prices of tomato and other vegetable increase for a few months because of seasonal issues. But we must understand that the prices differ from place to place and that can only be addressed when we have common agriculture market enabling farmers to sell their produce according to their choice,"" Paswan said.In fact, prices of tomatoes across the country showed wide variation with 1 kg tomatoes costing between Rs 20 and Rs 80. In cities including Kota, Nasik, Gwalior, Ludhiana, Meerut and Bhopal, tomatoes were retailing between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg and in Surat and Thiruvananthapuram 1kg tomato cost Rs 80. In the case of potatoes, while the average price was Rs 15 and maximum Rs 35 a kg, the key kitchen item was selling at less than Rs 10 in Nashik and Indore.Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre for ""unprecedented"" inflation, saying there was ""highest-ever surge in food prices"" while the Modi dispensation was busy spending crores of public money on its second anniversary bash. Party spokesman Ajay Maken said food inflation at 7.55% in May had hit a 21-month high."

Following demand from industrial associations, the state government agreed to develop a food processing park for food processing industries on 50 hectares.Sanjiv Narang, president, Nashik Industries & Manufacturers' Association, said, ""There is huge scope for food processing industries in Nashik and the proposed park will definitely boost the industry here. This will not only fetch investment, but will also create employment at large,"" adding that since Nashik, known for producing vegetables and fruits across the country, is also called the kitchen of Mumbai, the food processing park will also benefit the farmers."

The local residents say the foul smell has intensified after the recent rain and charge that the authorities failed to put in a proper system to collect and dispose garbage being generated from the residences of Periya Chetty Street and the neighbouring streets. The daily vegetable market on the corner of the street, which is functioning in the morning and the evening, seems to be the major factor for dumping of waste in unauthorised locations. Besides vendors of tomato, brinjal, cabbage, ladies fingers, coconut and others, there are a few meat stalls in the area. Traders dump the vegetable waste in the open plot. Moreover, they indiscriminately dump rotten vegetables and fruits causing stench. There are instances of people throwing food waste in the dump. Since the food waste rots quickly, it emits unbearable stench.It is stated that there was a dustbin in the locality a few months ago. It was not known why it was removed. Besides, the public and the traders did not follow the basic sense of dumping waste in the dustbin. They used to throw the waste into the bin by standing at a distance causing spill over all around the bin.It is a menace. It is posing a big problem to the residents. We have been undergoing miserable life due to the issue for quite some time, said C. Mariappan, a resident of Periya Chetty Street.If the issue is a headache for human beings, it has become a blessing in disguise for stray cattle. At least 10 to 15 cows are roaming around the dump. Moreover, the dump space has become a convenient place for them to spend night time also. Locals demand that the Corporation authorities should study the issue to find a solution. A mechanism has to be found for enabling the local residents and traders to dump the waste in a safe manner."

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly.

Traders blame poor supply and the holy month of Ramzan for the sudden hike in prices. Onion is the only commodity which isn't bringing tears to consumers with it being priced Rs 16 per kg.Tomatoes are priced at Rs 65 to Rs 75, beans at Rs 80 to Rs 125, lady's finger Rs 60, cabbage Rs 40 and potatoes Rs 26 to Rs 31. Merchants say excessive rain damaging crops in some parts and dry spell in other parts is the reason behind this price hike.Central Market merchant David D'Souza says: The prices of many vegetables have gone up though not many functions are happening due to excessive rains in Chikkamagaluru which has resulted in crop loss.The price of tomato which was Rs 40 per kg last month has gone up to Rs 65 to Rs 75 in the retail outlets.The price of beans varies across retail and super markets. While the wholesale rate of beans are at Rs 80, its retailing at Rs 90 to Rs 125 depending upon the place from where the beans are purchased.Hoteliers are also a worried lot. ""We don't have any other option than to accept it like we do when there is a seasonal variation,'' a hotelier averred. Homemaker Sunitha from Valencia said, ""Looking at the prices of vegetables and fruits I now buy them in small quantities. Though it means that I have to visit the stores twice or thrice a week, but it does not pinch that much when small quantities are consumed without getting wasted.Fruits have seen a significant rise in prices by at least 25%. Washington red apples retailing at Rs 150 per kg last week is now selling at Rs 200 a kg. Bananas too are pricey. The popular 'kadali' variety which was selling at Rs 60 per kg is now retailing Rs 70 to Rs 75 per kg."

Every day since 2005, she has been setting aside Rs 5 out of her earnings from selling vegetables to buy books. By now, she has an enviable collection of 900 books and thousands of newspaper supplements, all bought from her hard-earned money.""I was in Std V when I read the entire collection of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule's writings. It changed my life. I had to leave school after Std IX to look after my siblings in our 20-member joint family. But my parents, who were illiterate, encouraged me to continue reading,"" Babytai says. She was the first woman in the family who could read.In April 1993, Babytai married arts graduate Anil Gaikwad from a village in Pathardi taluka. Within a year, husband and wife had to migrate to Ahmednagar because of the severe drought. ""My husband got a job in a factory, but the salary was meagre. I started selling vegetables near the school where I had enrolled my four-year-old daughter, Ashwini. In 2005, my husband lost his job as the factory closed down and we were literally on the streets. It was then that we set up this vegetable business,"" she says.Babytai's husband used to give her Rs 10 to buy biscuits for Ashwini and son, Gaurav. ""I used to buy only one packet and spend Rs 5 on buying two newspapers. Soon, I started saving Rs 5 every day to buy books. During Diwali, I would tell my husband to buy me books instead of a new sari,"" she recalls with a smile.The first three books she bought were 'Krishnakath', an autobiography of Yashwantrao Chavan, 'Agnipankh' (the Marathi translation of Wings of Fire by A P J Abdul Kalam) and 'Aai Samjoon Ghetana' by Uttam Kamble.Soon, Babytai started telling women customers, her daughter's friends and even the farm labourers who came to shop for vegetables to read books. ""I started lending them my books. I now ensure that each book is read by at least 10 people before it comes back to me. I tell them that books can change one's life. They have taught me to never give up hope and fight against adversities. In fact, I now plan to approach drought-affected farmers with the same message. I want to tell them not to commit suicide,"" Babytai says. She has also started spreading the word about various government schemes for the poor.Another turning point came in 2012, when she read about the work of reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. ""That year, I invited only widows for my Sankranti 'haldi kumkum' ceremony (tradtionally, a get-together for married women) and gifted them books. There was a tremendous backlash and my vegetable shop lost almost half its customers. As a protest, I stopped putting on the toe rings that every married woman is supposed to wear. Women taunted me, but I did not give up. It took me four years to turn them around. I recently resumed wearing the toe rings when I saw that society is now accepting widow remarriages,"" she reveals.Babytai set up Krantijyoti Mahila Sanstha and Swayamsiddha Foundation in 2000 and 2015 respectively to nurture the reading habit among rural women. ""Marathi language is so rich and beautiful. Unfortunately, many of us feel ashamed to speak in Marathi. I don't understand why children are taught to address their parents as mummy and daddy instead of 'Aai' and 'Baba'. Our love for Marathi is displayed only on Marathi Language Day. We need to change this,"" she adds.Babytai is often invited to schools and colleges to give lectures on books and the habit of reading. ""I tell them I am no PhD holder, but a simple vegetable seller. I tell them how books have helped me in life. And I always gift a book to the school or college before I leave,"" she says, adding that till date she has given 200 lectures.Last month, the state government presented the first Mangesh Padgaonkar State Award for nurturing Marathi language to Babytai. ""This is the biggest honour I could have received. It carries the name of my favourite author-poet. His poem 'Bhatukalichya khelamadhali...' is my favourite and so is his compilation of essays 'Nimbonichya Zadamage',"" she signs off."
58f5cc367be9e01a17ca0cee,Waste to compost to grow veggies,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Waste-to-compost-to-grow-veggies/articleshow/51302753.cms,2016-03-08,,The Times Of India,"Pune: Her residence near Deccan Gumkhana, especially the ground floor that houses sacks full of leaf litter, discarded kitchen waste and vegetables, and dry coconut peels, may be a bit confounding to first-time visitors. Many may assume that the collection is garbage on its way out of the fourth-floor home of the Bhide family.The reality is exactly the opposite.Priya Bhide, a qualified paediatric physiotherapist, along with her chartered accountant husband Sunil and two daughters, will soon lug all of these sacks - left there by friends, neighbours and a nearby vegetable vendor - all the way up to their roof to convert the waste into compost.To many, the idea of a rooftop garden may be to enjoy the best of flowers and greens in times of leisure. For Priya, it's actually a mini garbage treatment plant where she uses biodegradable waste to make her own soil through vermiculture, using earthworms and mixing it with coco-pith, neem cake, cow dung and water. She uses this organic nutrient-rich soil to cultivate fruits and vegetables like bananas, papaya, chillies, cauliflower, tomato, brinjal, gourds, spinach, lettuce, amla, spices like turmeric and even flowers and greens, some of which the family occasionally distribute among friends and well-wishers.The Bhides have been doing this since the family shifted here in 2006. Priya said, ""I was passionate about gardening, but did not want to bring in soil from outside as that would mean disturbing the ecology of the source. So we thought of making our own soil. We now collect leaf litter typically during November to April. Kitchen waste comes not only from our house, but also from neighbours and a vegetable vendor nearby who gives us the things he may have discarded. The actual work is done by the earthworms that decompose all the waste.""Some people approached the family with the leftovers of coconuts, typically the dry brown shavings on top, which they could not dispose of naturally. After experimenting with different ways of utilizing them, the Bhides came up with a use for that as fuel for their indigenous stove (chulha). Several times a week now, the family prepares its dinner not in the kitchen, but on the rooftop, sometimes in the company of inquisitive friends who drop in for a taste of the traditional style of cooking.""It's a pleasure activity for us and a break from monotony. Peels of four coconuts are enough fuel to make 'khichadi' and 'usal' for seven people. The best part is that nothing goes waste. More than waste management, we feel this is resource management,"" Priya adds.She stresses on the importance of waste segregation. ""And composting is simple and can be done by anyone, even if it's only in four small pots at home. If the correct technique is followed, there is no chance of any foul smell or anything else going wrong as nature takes care of everything. In the end, it's a great feeling of being able to do something for society. Everyone thinks they generate too little waste. But all combined, it becomes almost 1,400 tonne of trash every day and needs a sustainable solution,"" she adds.Priya also conducts lecture demonstrations for groups interested in her rooftop garden. She adds that every person wants the city to be clean. And they can be the change through their actions and inspire the younger generation too."

Rodents thriving on the waste mounds started entering their cars and gnawing at the wires.""People would get their vehicles fixed and a few days later, the situation would be back to square one,"" said Shivakumar, a resident. It didn't take them long to realize that garbage dumped at vacant sites was at the root of the rodent menace.When everyone, from BBMP officials to corporators, failed to address the problem, residents decided to take matters into their own hands. This was the beginning of the waste management task force in Murugeshpalya. It started 10 months ago with 12 members, who took on the problem one street corner at a time. Today, about 100 residents are part of it.From monitoring dumpyards to spreading awareness on segregation, they have changed the face of the neighbourhood. Today, more than 800 houses in Murugeshpalya are segregating waste at source. A site which was earlier used to dump trash is now a community garden with flowering plants, bananas, aloe vera and tomatoes. The proceeds go to the neighbourhood. The dead soil is nourished back to life using compost from homes. Two sites have been converted into parking lots.Aravind, an architect and resident, said it was far from easy. ""We knocked on many doors. From municipal authorities to elected representatives, we approached everyone. They knew about the problem but with the Mandur landfill and Terra Firma unit being closed, they couldn't do much,"" he said. As the word spread, residents of Murugeshpalya realized their counterparts in Mandur and Mavallipura were also in the same boat. ""At first, we wanted strangers to stop dumping waste near our homes. But we realized if not Murugeshpalya, people would find other places. Segregation at source seemed the only solution,"" he said.""Only a handful of the residents were segregating waste. We couldn't wait for the government to act,"" said Prashanth, a craftsman and one of the founders of the task force. ""Garbage was coming from two sources - houses which were not segregating it and residents of areas like Marathahalli who disposed it off near our homes,"" he said.""We took on the role of watchdogs - we stopped vehicles and confronted people who were littering the locality,"" Prashanth said. Members witnessed both apathy and lack of awareness among the litterbugs. Both were tackled. ""We wanted people to take ownership of their garbage. As long as the waste was inside their house, it was theirs. The minute it was brought outside, it became a community issue. When caught dumping waste, sometime people snapped and asked me if it was my site. I said yes. They were at a loss for words,"" he added."

In rare cases, a few have come down with typhoid too.In fact, the situation is worse at the Gandhi Hospital mess above the emergency block, with the doctors claiming that it is infested with rodents.""It's the worst place to have food, but we are helpless as 70-80 duty doctors working for 24 hours at a stretch cannot bring food from home. I have an upset stomach now,"" said a senior doctor at Gandhi Hospital on condition of anonymity.The mess at the hospital neither has a fridge to store vegetables nor proper containers to store cooked food. One can see rotten tomatoes, chillies and other vegetables left to dry on pieces of paper and half-eaten food kept in dirty plastic containers without lids. Leftovers from lunch being served for dinner is also quite common. Adding to the troubles is the fact that the wash basin is situated in the common eating area itself.""Poor quality food in unhygienic conditions could lead to acute gastroenteritis, hepatitis infection, food poisoning, fever and typhoid. Though we are supposed to be served eggs, milk and fruits every day, it's never followed,"" said Dr R Raghu, general secretary of the Gandhi Hospital unit of Telangana Government Doctors' Association. He also alleged that inspectors from the food safety department have never come to test the food samples.The situation at the Osmania General Hospital is much the same. ""Two months ago, I was down with abdomen pain and fever after eating at our mess. We brought up the issue of unhygienic condition at our mess with the authorities, but to no avail ,"" said a third year postgraduate medico at OGH.Doctors also alleged that the menu card, which was prescribed by the director of medical education (DME) for duty doctors in teaching hospitals, is only on paper.""It is quite unfair that the government spends a measly Rs 82 per doctor to provide them food during duty hours. It must be hiked to Rs 150 per day so that better quality food can be served in hygienic conditions,"" said Dr G Srinivas, president, Telangana Junior Doctors' Association.However, when contacted, both OGH and Gandhi Hospital authorities denied the allegations. ""The hospital food is served to both doctors and patients only after it passes quality tests every day. However, if any individual doctor has any issues, it can be brought to our notice,"" said Dr G V S Murthy, superintenent, OGH.In the case of Gandhi Hospital, Dr S V Masood, deputy superintendent, said there was no problem. But he promised to get food samples randomly picked and tested at their microbiology department from now on."

To keep the competition alive, all major parties like AIADMK and DMK have fielded heavyweight candidates.Pennagaram is known for abject poverty and lack of employment as well as lack of educational opportunities. Though the constituency has more than 2.26 lakh people, about 50% of them migrated to other districts and states in search of employment. About 10% have shifted to neighbouring towns for higher education.This constituency had seen 14 general elections and one byelection since its formation in 1971. Of them, DMK has won 4 times while PMK, AIADMK and Congress won twice each and Gandhi Kamarajar National Congress (GKNC) and Janata Party won one time each. Vanniyars form the majority of the population here. Senguntha Mudaliar, Vaniba Chettiyar, Muslims and SC/STs are also present.Ramadoss won the 2014 Parliamentary election with a margin of 77,146 votes against his rival AIADMK candidate P S Mohan. Of the 4.68 lakh votes that Anbumani got, more than 90,000 were from Pennagaram constituency alone and he got over 34,000 more votes than the AIADMK candidate. ""Keeping this in mind, Anbumani is contesting from Pennagaram constituency as it should be a cakewalk for him,"" said a PMK functionary.Jayalalithaa, who was rattled by Anbumani's victory in 2014 election, has fielded K P Munusamy, former minister for municipal administration and rural development of Tamil Nadu. Though he is from Krishnagiri district, he rented a house in Pennagaram once he was announced as the candidate for this constituency.Former MLA P N Periannan's son P N P Inbasekaran of DMK is contesting for the second time from this constituency. Though he was defeated in 2011 election by CPI candidate N Nanjappan, this time, Inbasekaran and DMK party supporters are hoping that the anti-incumbency factor may work in his favour.The sitting MLA of the constituency N Nanjappan is also contesting with support from DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance. He is confident of repeating the 2011 results where he got 80, 028 votes while DMK candidate Inbasekaran secured only 68,485 votes. ""With the DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance, our victory is even more secure this time,"" said K Rajasekaran, a CPI cadre.Pennagaram, a backward constituency, mainly depends on agriculture. Acute water scarcity has forced many farmers to give up agriculture and migrate to other towns or Karnataka in search of employment. All contestants have promised to take steps to reduce water crisis and increase employment.Anbumani assured that he would open a government arts college, a military research centre, processing units for tomato and tamarind and SIDCO for employments. ""We really hope that he will keep his promises. Most of the villagers have decided to cast our votes in favour of Anbumani,"" said K Balamurugan, one of the villagers.K Mahaboob Basha, an autorickshaw driver said he would support PMK candidate Anbumani this time as he was dissatisfied with the work of the sitting MLA. ""Most of our MLAs have failed to fulfil their promises and this time many of the Muslims in the constituency have decided to support Anbumani,"" he said."

Located next to the hustle and bustle of corporate Connaught Place is Informal, and as the name suggests, this is the place office-goers should visit to leave behind the hurdles of work.A mid-priced alcohol menu and some delicious finger-food, this gastropub, which can seat up to 120 people, hits the right note in many ways.Informal, from the House of Imperfecto that has outlets in Hauz Khas Village and Gurgaon, opened its doors last September.Sprawled across two floors and a terrace, wood and plush leather dominate Informal's interiors.But the tough look is softened by the use of white curtains and fairy lights.Taking pride in charcoal-grilled items and wood-fired pizzas, the menu offers world cuisine ranging from a Spanish paella, a parma ham pizza, to a very 'desi' non-vegetarian kebab platter.It has also introduced a Rs. 99 menu under which selected food and drinks, including beer, are served. This menu is generally aimed at the nearby office-goers coming in for a quick lunch.To start off, we were served their signature cocktails. What an Idea! - a vodka based drink infused with red berry, thyme, grenadine and lime juice. Reminiscent of the classic cosmopolitan cocktail, but nevertheless yummy and very pretty in a deep-reddish pink. Girls, now you know what to order here!The second cocktail was the Candy Garden, also a vodka-based drink mixed with pineapple juice and peach liqueur, and topped with red wine. Undoubtedly this was one of the most pretty drinks, with the mix of sunset orange, topped with a layer of pale red. However, do not go by the name, it is nothing like candy, but very potent yet refreshing.We were served an array of dishes out of which some were definitely worth coming back for and the others were a bit of a letdown.The dishes which stole the limelight were dahi ke sholey with roasted onion sauce, pepperoni and parma ham wood-fired pizzas, charcoal grilled chicken lollipops , fish fingers with chips and tartar sauce and the non-vegetarian shahi platter.Dahi ke sholey was similar to croquettes but the yogurt filling made these deep fried goodies one of Informal's must-try dishes. It could be a little on a heavier side due to the generous amount of filling, but this paired with a glass of chilled golden beer on a hot summer evening is just the perfect way to beat the work blues. The charcoal-grilled chicken lollipos were melt in the mouth perfections. The chicken was soft, juicy and the charcoal flavour gave it a very rustic feel.People often say that wood-fired thin crust pizza are the real deal and the ones here actually proves this fact. Both the pizzas were smeared with a sauce made out of 'pelati' or peeled tomatoes which added a little sweetness. So every crunchy bite was the perfect melange of sweet and savoury.The fish fingers and the chips were fried to a golden perfection and the tartar sauce elevated the flavours. A great dish while waiting for a friend or something to just start a conversation with. The non-vegetarian shahi platter had tandoori chicken, malai tikka, chicken tikka and mutton seekh. A little too salty but the charred flavour was very tasty and the meat was again melt in the mouth category.However, the few dishes that failed to make a mark were the ham croquetas, charcoal broiled chicken wings with barbeque sauce, paella and the chicken scallops.The speciality of the ham croquetas is that it had parma ham in the filling which has been imported from Spain and is cured for 16 months but when you bite into this cheesy deep fried roll, there is absolutely no sign of the ham. On closer inspection, there were pieces of ham which were tinier than the nail on my pinky finger. Very disappointing. If it wasn't for the parma ham treasure hunt, the dish would be a tasty vegetarian starter.Chicken wings are something that one does not always go wrong with, but in this case the chicken was chewy and it was not quoted well with a nice sticky barbeque sauce.The paella could be mistaken for a sea food risotto. It had the same texture as that of the risotto, but flavours were not bad. The chicken scallops again has the charred taste, a little on the blander side. But the stir fried vegetables were a good accompaniment.For the ones with a sweet tooth, there are no desserts in the main menu, but the Rs.99 menu has brownie with ice cream.Overall, Informal has stood true to what it aims to achieve.FAQs:Where: 52, Tolstoy Lane, Janpath, New DelhiMeal for two: Rs.2,000 (with alcohol)Timings: 11.00 a.m.- 1.00 a.m.(The writer's visit was at the invitation of Informal.

Although Aparna Pawar and her husband Mohan had fulfilling, lucrative careers as a civil engineer and a drug analyst respectively, the distress in the village where they had spent their childhoods directed their thoughts home. Or, as Aparna says, they found their calling in life.The couple has now set up a successful horticulture farm in their native village of Madalmohi in Gevrau taluka in Beed district, and has helped around 20 distressed farmers turn their fortunes in the wake of one of the worst droughts in the region's history. They also managed to export pomegranates to Dubai this year. Their journey had begun 5 years ago.""Madalmohi is a small village, just about 19km from Gevrai taluka. This year January to May 13, 2016, as many as 9 farmers committed suicide in Gevrai, while over a dozen ended their lives last year. The taluka also recorded less than 50% average rainfall and recorded less than 50% of anewari (crop yield), which was just 37%,"" said Gevrai tehsildar, Balasaheb Pakhale.""Debt-trap, falling crop prices, deficient rainfall and lack of access to best farming practices has made the situation in the entire village grim. There was also no direct access to the market and the farm-produce had to be routed through middlemen. This forces many farmers to migrate to cities and do menial jobs just to survive,"" he said.It was this, perhaps, that hurt. ""Most of us experience a calling at some point in our lives, something like Mother Teresa had in a moving train. Yet many of us fail to respond to it. My husband and I were deeply disturbed to find the state of farmers in our village. Since Mohan owned 17-acre land at Madalmohi, we decided to organise the farmers of the village to tide over the drought and also earn a dignified earning,"" says Aparna.The first task the couple did was construct a farm pond on a two-acre land, about 38 feet deep and with a capacity of 3 crore litres so that it could store rain water. The next step was to decide the crops which could be lucrative and required less water. ""We chose horticulture farming since it requires less time to cultivate and reaped vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, drumsticks, cabbage and pepper. We also planted fruit-bearing trees like pomegranates and watermelon. The pond has been a tremendous boon. We get a good quality yield of pomegranates that we exported to Dubai since past three years,"" says Mohan.The Pawars have a motto born from experience. ""Pre-planning, water management, water audit, farm ponds, crop-patterning and drip irrigation are the ways to survive drought conditions. To improve water use efficiency, farmers should use the 'More crop per drop' farm model,"" says Aparna.The couple also trained over 35 farmers in the village to install horticulture projects in their farm. ""We trained the farmers, especially those who are small land-holders to adopt alternate cropping patterns. We advised them to avoid cultivating crops such as cotton and sugarcane which gives yield after a long time, about six months. Farmers in rain-fed areas should cultivate alternate crops three times in a year's span. Especially, vegetables and fruits which give yield in three months,""says Mohan, adding that drip irrigation is the best way to tide over water scarcity.The Samaritans have their share of testimonials. Jeevan Pawar, a farmer who had been experiencing loss since many years said after he emulated the measures, he has been getting good yield of vegetables and has also not incurred any losses. ""This year, I have a good yield of vegetables which have fetched me a decent income to survive the adverse conditions,"" he says.Another farmer Babanrao Muley said, ""Every year, I would cultivate cotton hoping to get a good yield but ended up facing losses due to deficient rainfall. But since past two years, I switched to horticulture. It has helped me get my daughter married."""

Surrounded by tall coconut trees amidst which cows and sheep roam, the open air jail at Ondipudur could easily be mistaken for a breezy farm house but for the'farm workers' clad in typical prison uniform made of coarse white cotton.In a paradox of sorts, while other prisons are teaming with inmates, the number of prisoners in this open air jail has thinned from an average 25 to just 4. One upon a time, the agricultural field was abuzz with activity.Now, the land remains dry and uncultivated for more than a year. The coconut trees are desperate for attention. ""The coconut trees used to yield 20,000 nuts per year. This has dwindled to 5000 nuts. Besides, there's hardly anyone to pick this meagre yield,"" said a prison staff.The statistics reeled out by prison authorities are mind-boggling. During its heyday, when the 30 acre jail was abuzz with agricultural activities, vegetables like tomato, ladies finger, brinjal, beetroot and spinach were cultivated.The vegetables grown here were used to cook food for inmates of the central prison. During the peak yield years, there were 100 inmates working in the open air jail, which has seen over 1,000 prisoners reformed over the last three decades.Now the jail has 943 coconut trees, 26 cows and 63 sheep. The wilted branches of coconut trees are not removed and the animals don't get the attention they used to get. ""Earlier we used to work for eight hours. But now the work extends till 11pm. We have to wash the cows, bring them fodder and clear the dung,'' says an inmate.Inmates with a clean track record and those who are about to complete their conviction with no tendency to escape are sent to the open air jail. While offering them an opportunity to reform, the farming activities also give them a chance to learn a means of livelihood, which will go a long way in helping them integrate with mainstream society after their release.An inmates will get 50 percent of his sentence remitted if he comes to the open air jail. But an alleged escape by a prisoner from another open air jail in Tamil Nadu has put curbs on inmates being sent to the Ondipudur prison.Last year, only 12 convicts were staying in the open air jail. This year, there are just four, even though the prison department has allotted 12 staff to man the jail. One convict takes care of the cows and another oversees the sheep. Coconut trees are maintained by one convict while the fourth takes care of cooking.""We have short-listed 30 inmates to be sent from the central prison to the open air jail. The decision now rests with our superiors,"" said a prison staff."

PHOTO: A. MURALITHARANCelebrating Pongal festival this year has proved to be dearer, with prices of sugarcane, vegetables, and turmeric bunches shooting up.The edible variety of sugarcane is an essential part of the festival and the demand has peaked. Apart from whole sale traders in the Gandhi Market, a large number of vendors had set up at every lane and by-lane in various parts of the city.The produce cultivated in Tirukattupalli was much sought-after among members of the public, though it is a bit dearer.R. Murugan, a vendor at Khajapet in Sangiliyandapuram, said he had invested Rs. 24,000-Rs. 21,000 towards the cane and Rs. 3,000 for expenditure for transit by carriage van from Tirukattupalli to the city to purchase 1,000 canes. Thus my investment on a single cane is Rs. 24 and I sell it for Rs. 30, he says.As compared to last years rates, the price had shot up by Rs. 10 a cane. Mr. Murugan says the rise in price was because of inclusion of sugarcane as one of the Pongal gift in the State governments package.Another dealer from Iluppur C. Vendan says he had to invest Rs. 16,000 this year against Rs. 10,000 last year to buy the sugarcane. He had brought the cane from Andakulam in Pudukottai district and has set up his sales units in four centres in the city.The sudden spurt in the price has come as a shock for the customers who make a hard bargain, he said.Stiff competitionBoth Mr. Murugan and Mr. Vendan say they face stiff competition from the new entrants. I have utilised my experience in selling eateries near a school, for marketing the sugarcane, he says.Traders say although the sale would continue for three more days, it was during the Bhogi and Pongal festival they can realise maximum sales.The prices of vegetables shot up by 20 to 30 per cent over the usual rates. Traders said that bulk and simultaneous demand for horticultural crops particularly vegetables and flowers would register an increase with the dawn of Thai month. The price per kg of carrot, tomato, potato, and beans had shot by at least Rs. 10.There was a scramble for turmeric bunches. The price which stood at Rs. 10 a bunch in the morning shot up to Rs. 20 a couple of hours later."

It helps to improve concentration and self-esteem in children and enables the elderly to cope with depression. It is a medicine without prescription.""According to officials in the horticulture department, they have distributed nearly 2,500 kits to households in Trichy district.The department has launched the project under the Urban Horticulture Development Scheme (UHDS) in the district in February 2016 and began distributing the kits, officials said.Each kit comprising coco peat, compressed bricks, vegetable seeds - brinjal, ladies finger, tomato, beans and chilly - bio-fertilizers, bio-pesticides, along with pamphlets costs Rs 500, they said.The organic fertilizers include ashosphyrillam, phosphobacteria, bio-fungicides-pseudomonas and trichoderma viridi and water soluble fertilizer.""Residents from Srirangam have bought the largest number of kits.

This has had a cascading effect on retail prices which, in case of patotatoes and onions, have shot up by anwhere between 50% and 100%.""I bought potatoes for under Rs 30 a kg on Friday.

Shukla, a resident of Sector 4.Vegetable prices, both wholesale and retail, soared within days of demolition of all the 175 makeshift shops in the Khandsa market on Saturday by the agricultural produce marketing committee. The space was cleared to set up an open-shed agricultural mall here.President of the Khandsa market association Inderjeet Thakran told TOI, ""While the authorities have razed the makeshift shops, they have no alternative arrangement in place to shift the wholesale vegetable market until the open-shed mall comes up. Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984.

58f5f4b7a3d24b0b70c26798,The man from Porto Empedocle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-man-from-porto-empedocle/article8661508.ece,2016-05-29,,The Hindu,"A new book by the 90-year-old Andrea Camilleri, in an English translation, is a great event. Montalbanos First Case and Other Stories is a collection of stories about Sicilys most celebrated police inspector. After millions of copies and an immensely popular television series, a bronze statue of Inspector Montalbano now faces that of the playwright Luigi Pirandello in Camilleris birthplace, the town of Porto Empedocle. Or, as the town is now popularly known, in honour of the fictional setting of the Montalbano novels: Porto Empedocle Vigata.One knows not to expect tidy endings in a Montalbano story. In the old days, detective fiction provided reassurance that in times of disorder, someone capable would come along and fix everything. Thats how it was in the golden age of the detective novel, between the wars: cosy mysteries in country houses, footprints in the flower bed, and denouements in large room with fireplaces. Very posh and Downton Abbey.Change in crime fictionSince then, times have changed, and so has the crime novel. In Salvo Montalbanos Sicily, we find an ancient Mediterranean landscape now beleaguered by corruption, trafficking, immigration issues, drugs, environmental degradation, and the mafia. The first time we see Montalbano summoned as a witness in court, the accused is a mafia scion and the public prosecutors statement sounds like a defence argument. In his first year on the job, we are told, Montalbano dived headlong into these Mafia murder cases, only to come up empty-handed. Nobody had seen anything, nobody had heard anything, nobody suspected anything, nobody imagined anything, nobody knew anyone.Yet against this background, we see Montalbano and his colleagues doggedly climbing up hillsides to talk to shepherds, visiting hospices to listen to dying statements, taking the train when the airlines are on strike, standing in line before court clerks, and generally trying to do their best in an imperfect world.G.K. Chesterton once wrote that the detective novel expresses some sense of the poetry of modern life, and that the policeman, trying to deliver justice to ordinary people, is a poetic figure in the city. In the wasteland of contemporary urban life, Montalbano finds his identity in his work. Im like a photograph, he says to his girlfriend Livia. I exist insofar as theres a negative made up of crimes, murder and acts of violence.A facet of Montalbanos character is that he reads and rereads, often obsessively. His reflective temperament makes him think of stories by Borges and quotes from Roland Barthes. In a Pirandellesque twist in one story, Montalbano finds the details of the crime too oppressive and telephones his author to say so. His name itself is a feat of inter-textuality: Camilleri named his fictional detective after the Spanish writer Manuel Vazquez Montalban, the creator of the witty private eye Pepe Carvalho.Sicilian charactersUnlike the infallible detectives of earlier crime fiction, Montalbano is all too human: beset by bad dreams, self-doubt, mood swings, an irascible temperament, a kind heart and a weakness for good food. He often lies, bends rules, and hates signing papers. At the same time, he has an unshakable sense of duty and responsibility. When he sees an old lady walking home at two in the morning, he insists on dropping her home. When an elderly small-time burglar calls him one night with information, he takes coffee for him in a thermos. In Montalbanos view, everyone deserves a fair chance. Sometimes I ask myself what proof God had to accuse Cain of murdering Abel, he tells a priest in one story. If I could, I swear Id reopen the case.Unforgettable Sicilian characters shine through Camilleris stories. In Montalbanos first case, his boss is described as unfit (for the job) because he wasnt afraid of anybody. In another, a villager wrongly accused of murder is described by the locals as a shepherd king, one who would never cut down a nettle, let alone kill a man.And then there is Montalbanos cook, the incomparable Adelina whom we rarely see except through her heavenly food. Montalbano has one eye on her wastrel sons and the other on her caponata. On New Year eve she writes a note to Montalbano, inviting him home for dinner: Botha my boys are free and I gonna meck arancini rice balls wich they lika so much. Despite his belief that the best meals are eaten alone, Montalbano decides to accept the invitation. Only one question still nagged him before he fell asleep: would both of Adelinas delinquent sons manage to stay out of gaol until tomorrow?Camilleris inventive, ironic prose, in a unique mix of Italian and Sicilian, comes to us through the elegant translations of Stephen Sartarelli, an American poet based in France. His translators notes are a pleasure in themselves. When we read that old issues of Topolino covered the floor, Sartarelli explains that Topolino is Mickey Mouse in Italian, a popular fortnightly that still exists today.Adelina will not cook pasta in Trapanese pesto sauce and Montalbano must therefore organise it for himself.

This wasn't a routine celebratory excursion to celebrate a win, however. Ranieri had a surprise for his players when they landed at the pizzeria: they had to make their own pizzas.Into the kitchen they all went, where waiting chefs and staff had the necessary ingredients and utensils lined up. And so the entire Leicester squad - star strikers Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez included - dipped their hands into dough and cheese and marinara sauce and proceeded to toss their own pies in the air.Ranieri, an Italian who loves his pizza and pasta, likened football to pizza. ""The most important ingredient is team spirit and the second is they enjoy training. That is important. Also to sprinkle a little luck is important, like salt. The fans are the tomato. Without the tomato, it's no pizza,"" he said.Following that outing tossing pizzas, Leicester have had 13 'clean sheets' out of 29 games - that is, they have not conceded a goal in 13 games. It is a statistic that gives Ranieri immense pride. And now, with Leicester being crowned Premier League winners to cap one of the most memorable seasons of English football ever, the fairytale has reached its pinnacle. You don't have to be a dedicated football follower - this writer is not one such - to be swept up in Leicester's amazing run to an improbable and historic Premier League title. One that started at the end of the previous season when the Foxes scripted a great escape from relegation.In a column last month, Ranieri describes arriving at the club between seasons and looking at ""players who were considered too small or too slow for other big clubs"". He was referring to Vardy, Mahrez, N'Golo Kante, Wes Morgan and Danny Drinkwater. Looking at these players, Ranieri felt Leicester ""had a chance to survive in the Premier League"".Survive? They have dazzled the football world with their magnificent run to the title for the first time in 132 years of playing, providing English football with its biggest shock since 1992 when Ipswich won the title just 12 months after gaining promotion. Before this season, there were reports of some bookmakers marking Leicester at odds of 5000-1 to win the EPL. They have taken the form book and tossed it out the window, in the process scripting a stunning tale of success in the face of history and heavyweights with several times larger bank balances and star-studded lineups. What Leicester paid to acquire its squad's starting 11, football's richest teams often spend on one player. Remarkably, they have outperformed such giants in the league.Vardy is the third most successful goal-scorer of the competition, with 22, and has provided six assists for his team-mates. Mahrez - voted PFA Player of the Year - has 17 goals to go with 11 assists, the fourth most this season. Drinkwater has seven goals, Morgan has been a key ingredient and Kante is arguably the most valuable midfielder of the league, if not the most durable. The startling success of Vardy - Ranieri's ""fantastic horse"" who a few years ago was working in a factory and playing football by night - has included a record-breaking feat of scoring in 11 consecutive games and his work in tandem with Mahrez is unparalleled. Heck, we're talking about a player whose remarkable journey has seen him go from non-league to the international stage, with England calling for Vardy. How's that for fairytale?On top of all this is the stability that resonates from Leicester's campaign. Ranieri - the man nicknamed 'The Tinkerman' for constant shuffling at past clubs - has made just 27 changes to the starting lineup this season. Taking over from where Nigel Pearson was cut off at the end of the 2014-15 season, Ranieri immediately identified the mood within the Leicester camp and decided that he would change little. He focused on trust, and how to build it. In between his pep talks and strategizing, the Italian threw in the lure of additional days off for players who put in the hard yards. Then there was that pizza dinner after the team's first clean sheet. Such deft touches made a difference, and how.That the dream didn't fizzle is what makes Leicester's run this season even more remarkable. Indeed, one of their strongest assets is the ability to come back from draws and the odd defeat. A 4-1 win over Bury in the Capital One Cup came after a 1-1 draw with Tottenham; a draw at Bournemouth was followed by a 3-2 win over Villa, when they at one stage fell behind 0-2; when their hopes of avoiding relegation receded with a 2-5 loss to Arsenal, Leicester's reply was a 2-1 win over Norwich; a 1-1 final score against Manchester United was backed by 3-0 at Swansea. In mid-April, Leicester's biggest win of the season (4-0 over Swansea) came without Vardy, serving a suspension. Since April 14, they are 7-2-0 while outscoring opponents 15-4. Incredible, really.And yet this isn't the story of a never-say-die bunch of underachievers. Yes, finances were thinner than in most other clubs - when Mahrez was drafted into the side two years ago from French second-tier side Le Havre, it cost Leicester an approximate 400,000 and Kante was signed last summer for 5.6m - and Ranieri written off by many. Yes, this team had to rise above and put behind them off-field issues such as Vardy's racial slur at a casino and the sacking of three reserves over a racist sex tape before the season.This is about a serious bunch of football players pooling their collective skills together under the attentive and scheming gaze of a tactful Ranieri, with his 15th football team. It's about Vardy pushing himself to achieve the unthinkable, of the likes of Mahrez and Konte and Mark Albrighton being given the room to play as they wish. It's about the team owners creating an environment of camaraderie, which Ranieri was quick to encourage and build on. No team has created more chances, no combination has scored more goals than Vardy and Mahrez. This is a secure unit, put in the right space.Whatever happens to the fabric of this history-defying Leicester City squad during the months to come - several bigger clubs have targeted Kante and surely giants like United and Chelsea will bounce back hard - one thing is certain: nothing will ever top what they experienced this EPL season. English football fans have been treated to an indelible run since Ipswich soared to glory four British Prime Ministers ago. It could be the most significant ever.So then, over to you, Gary, come the first weekend of August. Maybe someone from Ranieri's camp will send over a slice of pizza to make the moment tastier."

As a first step, it was decided to eliminate the use of plastic bags in the uzhavar sandhais, where the vendors used to hand over vegetables in plastic carry bags to customers. These vendors were urged to give up the use of plastic bags and were given cloth bags, which the customer could purchase for 5 each. A cloth bag can hold 4-5 kg vegetables.Almost five months hence, the use of plastic bags has come down drastically. ""It is a good thing the vendors do not keep plastic bags. I did not think they would follow this rule so seriously,"" said K Ganeshan of Chokkikulam, who has now started bringing his own bag to the market for the past three months.Saying 'no' to plastic or polythene bags has always been more a slogan than the norm in the city. The civic body occasionally conducts raids and makes seizures, but the uzhavar sandhais have been able to implement the ban on plastics without much supervision. ""The supervisor will come and take action against us, so we do not keep polythene bags any longer,'' said Rani, a vendor at the Anna Nagar uzhavar sandhai. Though no fine is specified, these vendors are threatened with cancellation of their shops' membership if they use the bags.Founder of the Centre for Environmental Services SV Pathy says this is one initiative that has yielded result. Vendors in the markets purchase plastic bags of less than 3 micron for as much as about 20 for 100 bags. Tomato vendors are frequent users of these bags, but now they too have stopped using them. He said these markets used not less than 1,000 of these bags on a daily basis. These may be less in weight, but could cause a lot of environmental damage.The uzhavar sandhais have set a good example, as segregating plastic bags from vegetables waste in the market used to be a big problem. ""It will be better if the same rule is implemented in the central market, where the use of plastic bags is much more. Also, the collector can ensure that the use of the black polythene bags in meat shops is banned,"" he saidThe collector said the response from the public and vendors in farmers' markets was encouraging and the district administration was now exploring ways to implement the plastic ban in other places in the district also."

The combination of a shallow fault and old, unreinforced masonry buildings led to widespread devastation in the earthquake that struck central Italy early Wednesday.The magnitude-6.2 quake killed at least 247 people and left hundreds more injured. Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings.Like other villages and towns in the mountainous area, Amatrice, where the mayor lamented that ""half the town no longer exists,"" has stone churches and other buildings that were constructed centuries ago, when little if anything was known about earthquakes. Unless they have been reinforced in recent years, such structures are easily damaged or destroyed by shaking.""Even 100 years ago, they didn't know how to build structures to withstand earthquakes,"" said David A Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England.The earthquake was less powerful than many recent deadly quakes. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Nepal in April 2015, for instance, killing 8,000 people, released roughly 250 times more energy.But the Italian quake was very shallow: According to the U.S. Geological Survey, it occurred about 6 miles below the surface.""Shallow earthquakes cause more destruction than deep earthquakes because the shallowness of the source makes the ground-shaking at the surface worse,"" Rothery said.Video from Amatrice and other towns near the quake center showed heaps of masonry rubble from buildings that had been shaken apart.Earthquakes are set off by the movement of the earth's crust, which is divided into large sections called tectonic plates. The Apennine Mountains, where the quake occurred Wednesday, are in an area where one plate, the African, is moving under another, the Eurasian.Because of the complex interaction between the plates, the basin of the Tyrrhenian Sea, off Italy's west coast, is spreading. It is this spreading, and the tension it creates in the Apennines, that led to the quake.The area of Wednesday's temblor experienced significant earthquakes in the past, including one with a magnitude of 6.3 near the town of L'Aquila in 2009 that killed at least 295 people, injured more than 1,000 and left 55,000 homeless.The two quakes had much in common, said Massimo Cocco, a geologist with the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome.""In terms of genesis and depth, they are rather similar,"" he added.After the 2009 quake, seven members of a national commission on risk prevention were arrested on charges of failing to adequately warn L'Aquila about the earthquake risk. They were found guilty of manslaughter in 2012 and sentenced to six years in prison, but they were cleared in 2014 by an appeals court.Cocco said that Italy had anti-seismic construction laws for new buildings, but that little has been done to reinforce existing buildings that make up a vast majority of Italian structures.""Resilience is just too low compared to the frequency and the high impact of natural phenomena determined by the seismic risk of our country,"" he said.RELATED STORIES Italy quake kills 159 as rescuers race to find survivors6.2 magnitude earthquake +BACKGROUND X Italy earthquake death toll rises, towns reduced to rubble Rescue crews using bulldozers and their bare hands raced to dig out survivors from a strong earthquake+ that reduced three central Italian towns to rubble.

As of Thursday morning, the deaths totaled at least 247, officials said.""Half the town no longer exists,"" Mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice told reporters Wednesday morning.He might have been too optimistic. By midday Amatrice, a quiet mountain town about 100 miles northeast of Rome, felt more like a ghost town.Ambulances raced along windy roads clogged with traffic and rubble as rescue teams searched for survivors. Using picks, shovels and hands, they scrabbled through the dust and debris of crumbled homes. They brought in dogs to sniff for the dead and injured beneath collapsed concrete and stone.A soft white dust was still swirling about the rubble piled waist-high in Amatrice. Stunned survivors - some with tear-streaked cheeks, others still wearing pajamas - wandered through the streets, unsure what to do.A father, holding a small child, pushed a wobbly stroller piled with plastic bags of clothing over a rocky path. A young girl sobbed into her mobile phone.""It's all gone, the bar, the house, everything,"" she said.The initial quake was comparable in intensity to one in 2009 in the central Abruzzo region that killed more than 300 people.and aftershocks were felt as far away as Bologna, Rome and Naples. Camps were set up to house hundreds of homeless, and authorities were also trying to account for an unknown number of tourists.""The number of missing people is undefined at the moment,"" Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit at Italy's Civil Protection Agency, said at a news conference in Rome.With a permanent population of about 2,000, Amatrice is a place where people know one another. Many had ties to Rome in one way or another, working there in the winter, running restaurants, bars and hotels, as food has always been part of the town's culture.""If you closed the restaurants in Rome run by Amatriciani, you'd close half the restaurants,"" said Maria Prassede Perilli, a resident who had been visiting her sister in Rome when the quake struck.Perilli said she had rushed back after her husband, Giacomo, called in the middle of the night in a frightened voice, telling her, ""There's been a terrible earthquake, you can't even imagine.""Her husband survived, she said, but his sisters and niece did not. The couple's house was crushed. ""It's flat, like a book,"" she said.For many residents who worked in Rome, August was the traditional month of rest and relaxation, enjoying Amatrice's mild climate and fresh air after months of Roman smog.""You had dinners in the piazza, long tables with lots of people, someone would bring out a guitar to sing,"" Perilli said. ""It's the mountain, it's a good place to be.""It was especially wrenching for her to bump into shocked friends and acquaintances.""They can't find Alessandra, they can't find Alessandra,"" one woman who approached said of her niece, buried under the rubble along with her mother. Perilli commiserated.""I don't want to listen to anything any more. It's all: 'Did you hear that he died, did you know that that entire family was buried; wife, husband, child.' I just can't take it,"" she said, eyes tearing. ""I feel as though I am in a dream, and I'm hoping that one moment I'll wake up.""Nearby, diggers were lifting rubble into trucks.""Will they ever be able to rebuild this?"" Perilli said. ""It seems like the end of an era.""Rescue teams representing a spectrum of police and armed forces, local civil protection agencies from around the country, as well as medical staff members worked through the day searching for survivors, but more often finding the dead.""This is positive; as soon as the earthquake struck, people came from all over to help,"" said Riza Sinani, a nurse from the nearby town of Rieti. ""That doesn't happen in every country, this outpouring of humanity and good will.""Several people in Amatrice said the town had been full of tourists who came for the coming weekend's annual Sagra dell'Amatriciana festival, which celebrates Amatrice's native pasta sauce, using cured pork cheek known as guanciale, and grated pecorino cheese. The festival has been canceled.As sympathy and offers of support poured in from around the world, Pope Francis led pilgrims at St. Peter's Square in praying for the victims, clutching a rosary in his right hand, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi went to Rieti.Renzi praised rescue workers and volunteers and vowed to rebuild  a promise particularly important for Italians still furious about the long delays in reconstruction after the 2009 quake.The area's most significant monument, the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, was unharmed, as were monuments in the city of Perugia.""We were saved by a miracle,"" said Stefania Proietti, the mayor of Assisi, where in 1997 a devastating earthquake caused casualties and extensive damage to the city, destroying frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue in the basilica.For those in Amatrice, the immediate focus was on essentials: who was alive, and who was dead, or missing.Among those awaiting information was Laura Besanzoni, who stood behind a ribbon that cordoned off the main street, the Corso Umberto. A few palazzos still stood along the street, but piles of rubble lined both sides, offering glimpses of bright blue sky.""It's like being in one of those countries at war,"" Besanzoni said, looking at the devastation. Her family's palazzo was left standing, she said, but she had no news of an aunt and two cousins.""We don't know if they are dead or alive,"" she said.Makeshift human corridors were created to bring people out. Some were alive, others were not. As one body was passed, wrapped in a plastic cover, one woman wailed: ""That looks like Manuela's hand!""A three-story convent on the edge of town was virtually destroyed by the quake, the top two floors crushing the bottom. A young nun managed to escape, but said she feared that three nuns and four retirees had been buried.A high school teacher from Rome who vacations here every August said her home on the central Corso Umberto had been severely damaged but had not collapsed. The teacher, who identified herself only by her first name, Ilde, said the quake had struck with a loud bang.The buildings across the street from her and next door were destroyed.""Only the town tower was standing,"" she said, describing scenes of panic, her neighbors screaming for help in the dark.""It was Dante's 'Inferno,' it was apocalyptic, I don't know,"" she said. When rescuers came to escort her from her home, she said, she walked on rubble at least 10-13 feet high.In one square, families waited for news while diggers began tackling a pile of bricks and stones that had once been a home. One man had lost his father. Another, an uncle.""I can't think of how many may still be in the rubble,"" said one woman whose house withstood the quake while the neighboring ones did not. Amatrice is in an area prone to earthquakes, she said, ""but we've never felt anything as violent as this.""In the nearby Marche region, the village of Arquata del Tronto and the hamlet of Pescara del Tronto, also suffered major destruction.""When I arrived at the break of day, I saw a destroyed village, screams, death,"" Bishop Giovanni D'Ercole of Ascoli Piceno, who visited Pescara del Tronto, told Vatican Radio. ""I went to bless the bodies of two children buried under the rubble."""

This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain. K Arumugam, agriculture officer, in-charge of Chockikulam farmers' market said the unseasonal rains had resulted in poor production of vegetables grown in hill stations."

Sakthivel, a floriculturist in Sempatti, who has raised jasmine and tomato in one acre of land. To get the first yield in jasmine, I have to wait for a year. My investments will not stop till harvesting. I receive no returns in the period. Raising tomato helps me maintain my income. I start harvesting tomato from the 40th day. Harvesting will continue for 140 days. I raise two tomato crops in a year. Later, jasmine will fetch me income. Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, we can maximise income. Instead of tomato, chilli can also be grown in jasmine field. But brinjal should not be grown as it will affect flowering plants, he adds.Small onion (shallot) can also be raised on bunds of irrigation channels. No additional water is necessary. Adoption of simple technologies will also improve the quality of vegetables. After harvesting onion, cauliflower can be raised in the same field. Such cropping method will enhance the quality, colour and taste of the flower, he says.Sakthivel gets Rs. 350 per a bag containing 20 cauliflowers in Madurai wholesale market.While inspecting his farm on Wednesday, Collector T.G. Vinay said farming should be carried out scientifically, especially raising of hybrid crops as they were sensitive to climate, soil and water condition. Any deviation in cultivation pattern would affect its growth and yield. Farmers should grow as many crops as possible to make agriculture remunerative, he added.Deputy Director of Horticulture Suresh Sri Ram said saplings should be planted in all available space to generate desirable yield and income. Acute care was necessary while raising hybrid crops, he added.Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, farmers can maximise income"

About 100-150 farmers have registered with the cooperative.The farmers are assured market prices for their produce sold through us, said Vijayan T., president of the cooperative. Vegetables cultivated on 45 acres of farms in Kalliyoor and Kottukal panchayat are sold here.The major crops cultivated are brinjal, bitter gourd, cucumber, vegetable cowpea, tomato, snake gourd, melon and banana.Banana that costs Rs. 58 a kg is bought from the farmers at Rs. 57 a kg. It is sold to wholesale buyers at the same rate whereas in retail, it is sold at a profit of Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 a kg, says secretary Rejikumar, one of the farmers who took the initiative. People from households anywhere in the district who wish to sell any vegetables, from jackfruit or Rs. 25 worth chillies are welcome here.The farmers use organic pesticides such as grinded chilly of a variety called Kanthari and poultry and dairy farming in nearby areas as manure for the crops. Kerala State Horticulture Mission supports the venture by providing subsidies.The cooperative, which began with an initial investment of Rs. 25,000 by each of the nine farmers, has a turnover of over 2 lakh. The outlet at Kalliyoor has sales worth Rs 50,000 daily.Excess and untimely rains pose a great challenge. Many of them are shifting from risky vegetable cultivation to safer and more profitable banana plantations, Mr. Rejikumar says.

The vegetable, official sources said, is cultivated over a duration of 120 days, and yield could be harvested from the 50th day onwards. The hybrid variety could be maintained for even a six-month duration, department sources said.But, when the price plummets in-between, farmers let the crop to wither since they will not be able to cover even the labour costs. This results in enormous loss to them.The departments initiative to promote utilisation of cold storage in this backdrop is expected to enable farmers sustain their activities with a sense of certainty, a senior official of Horticulture Department said.Tomatoes could be stored for a maximum of one month, Chairman of Erode District Agricultural Marketing Committee Kulandaisamy added.According to the officials, sudden escalation in the cost of tomatoes during summer months is not unusual.In Erode district, the nurseries were damaged due to unseasonal rain a few months back, creating supply shortage in the current cycle due to considerable decrease in area of cultivation.The current price of Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg is likely to sustain for at least a couple of weeks in view of the occurrence of auspicious days, officials said."

On Friday, the price per kilo was around Rs. 80.Added to the failure of crops is the reduction in supply from Nashik in neighbouring Maharashtra.Suppliers in Nashik are getting better rates there. As a result, supply to Bengaluru has reduced, experts say.There was no flowering in April-May. There was crop damage due to high temperatures. Then there were heavy rains, which led to sand being deposited on leaves and further damage to the crops. Now the rains have stabilised and production is improving, said a senior official with the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS).However, there is some relief as stable rain over the past few weeks has led to a small reduction in retail prices.This trend is expected to continue in the coming weeks if the rain does not increase. Retail prices reduced by Rs. 2 on Friday (from Rs. 80 per kilo on Thursday).Before the spurt in prices, the average retail price was in the range of Rs. 25 to Rs. 35."

There was a fall in the arrival from the regular farms in Rayakottai, Soolagiri, Hosur and Sudanur in Krishnagiri district.

We used to cultivate crops such as bitter gourd, snake gourd, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, green chilli, onion, leafy vegetables, fruits, and a variety of flowers in Undavalli, Penumaka, Chandarlapadu, Kanchikacherla, Uddandarayunipalem, Neerukonda, Thullur, and other areas on the Krishna riverbed.

It's unbeatable.""He cannot imagine Volkswagen without the sausage, which is even listed as an official VW component with the product code 199 398 500 A.""Without their curry sausage at 9:00 am, the employees would go on strike immediately,"" he says, only half joking.This delectable delicacy ""is an integral part of the corporate culture of Volkswagen,"" says Tina Berthold, curator of an exhibition dedicated to the cult sausage at the Volkswagen Museum in Wolfsburg, which is running to the end of May.Martin Cordes, director of VW's gastronomic division, says the company's Currywurst has half the fat of most rival products and is made from the finest cuts of meat, making it ""very healthy and easy on the stomach"".Since the mad cow disease crisis of the late 1990s, it no longer contains beef but only pork -- a change that some fans initially found hard to swallow, says the master butcher.The manufacturer used to slaughter its own animals on company farms but now uses pork from regional suppliers. VW also launched a vegetarian version in 2010 and a vegan Currywurst in 2015.""Whoever tastes our Currywurst falls in love with it,"" insists Lo Presti.And the numbers seem to back him up: in 2015, Volkswagen sold about 7.2 million curry sausages, twice the number sold in 2008.esp-fz/hmn/hmw/eb"

While farmers occasionally raked in the moolah, they were often let down by the cropping pattern in vogue in the district.Major marketsTirupati, Kalikiri and Madanapalle are considered the major agricultural market yards in the district. Farmers from the mandals bordering Karnataka and Anantapur prefer selling their produce at Madanapalle while those in the central areas like Chittoor and Piler go for Kalikiri market which is considered to be strong enough to tilt the price balance. The Tirupati market yard is more accessible to the farmers of the eastern mandals.A 30-kg box of tomatoes was sold for Rs.100 at Kalikiri on Friday. Pegged at Rs.250 a fortnight back, the price of the tomato box witnessed a rapid slide within a short time.Maqbool, a farmer from Kalikiri, who invested Rs. 45000 for growing tomato in his one-acre farm land burnt his fingers by losing half of his capital, leave alone getting a profit.We invested Rs. 2 lakh on our two acres only to lose everything, laments R. Ramakrishna, a dejected farmer of Kamalla village in Yerravaripalem mandal. Already reeling under losses, the farmers are in no mood to bear the labour, transportation cost and market commission and hence are either leaving the crop in the fields or dumping it on the roadside.A gambleTomato cultivation has become such a huge gamble in Chittoor district that farmers seldom feel sad about the mounting losses, but hope against hope to strike it rich in the elusive next season. Though we suffered losses this time, we are planning to go for tomato again. As the northern states witness floods and huge crop losses by November, we hope to see the prices soar and recoup the lost money, reasons Rayavaram Srinivasulu, a life insurance agent who turned into an agriculturalist of Piler.Such wild guesses and weird predictions are common for the farmers who prefer not to deviate from their age-old farming practices."

Or, as Aparna says, they found their calling in life.The couple has now set up a successful horticulture farm in Madalmohi village in Gevrau taluka, Beed district, and has helped around 20 distressed farmers turn their fortunes in the wake of one of the worst droughts in the region's history. They also managed to export pomegranates to Dubai this year.Their journey began five years ago. ""Madalmohi is a small village, just about 19km from Gevrai taluka. This year, from January to May 13, as many as nine farmers committed suicide in Gevrai, while over a dozen ended their lives last year. The taluka also recorded less than 50% average rainfall and recorded just 37% anewari (crop yield),"" said Gevrai tehsildar, Balasaheb Pakhale.""Debt trap, falling crop prices, deficient rainfall and lack of access to best farming practices has made the situation in the entire village grim. There was also no direct access to the market and the farm produce had to be routed through middlemen. This forces many farmers to migrate to cities and do menial jobs just to survive,"" he said.It was this, perhaps, that hurt. ""Most of us experience a calling at some point in our lives, something like Mother Teresa had in a moving train. Yet many of us fail to respond to it. My husband and I were deeply disturbed to find the state of farmers in our village. Since Mohan owned 17 acres of land at Madalmohi, we decided to organise the farmers of the village to tide over the drought and earn a dignified earning,"" says Aparna.The first task the couple did was construct a farm pond - about 38 feet deep and with a capacity of three crore litres - on a two-acre plot to store rain water. The next step was to decide the crops which could be lucrative and required less water. ""We chose horticulture farming since it requires less time to cultivate and reaped vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, drumsticks, cabbage and pepper. We also planted fruit-bearing trees like pomegranates and watermelon. The pond has been a tremendous boon. We get a good quality yield of pomegranates that we exported to Dubai for the past three years,"" says Mohan.The Pawars have a motto born from experience. ""Pre-planning, water management, water audit, farm ponds, crop-patterning and drip irrigation are the ways to survive drought conditions. To improve water use efficiency, farmers should use the 'More crop per drop' farm model,"" says Aparna.The couple also trained over 35 farmers in the village to install horticulture projects in their farm. ""We trained the farmers, especially small land-holders, to adopt alternate cropping patterns. We advised them to avoid cultivating crops like cotton and sugarcane which give yields after a long time, about six months. Farmers in rain-fed areas should cultivate alternate crops three times in a year's span. Especially, vegetables and fruits which give yield in three months,""says Mohan, adding that drip irrigation is the best way to tide over water scarcity.The Samaritans have their share of testimonials. Jeevan Pawar, a farmer who had been experiencing losses for many years has emulated the Pawars. ""This year, a good yield of vegetables fetched me a decent income to survive the adverse conditions,"" he says.Another farmer, Babanrao Muley, said, ""Every year, I would cultivate cotton hoping to get a good yield, but ended up facing losses due to deficient rainfall. But for the last two years, I switched to horticulture. It has helped me get my daughter married."""

The prediction of a good southwest monsoon has led agriculturists and farmers to believe that there will be an increase in yield in vegetables this year, which in turn will lower market prices.A bumper harvest and stable vegetable prices can be expected this year if the weather experts' predictions come true. Farmers in Thondamuthur block have begun sowing small onions, tomatoes and turmeric in the block, to use the rainfall being received by the district. ""The soil preparation activities usually begin around mid-May and sowing of these vegetables begins in the last week of May,"" said the horticulture assistant director for the block Vasanthi Gnansekar. ""However, the lack of summer rain delayed this process by around 10 days. Since the pre-monsoon rain began around 10 days ago, soil preparations began around June 1 and the seeds were sown earlier this week,"" said a senior officer in the department.According to the department data, small onions have been cultivated across 50 hectares of land and turmeric across 20 hectares of land. Land under tomato cultivation is yet to be calculated. ""Vegetable cultivation usually begins in Thondamuthur, before it spreads to Madukkarai and Karamadai,"" said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association A Kandasamy. While the district saw 1,295 hectares of small onions being cultivated in 2015-16, it saw 1,212 hectares of turmeric. ""This includes vegetable cultivation during either Thaipattam or Ravi and Aadipattam or Kharif season,"" said the officer. ""If the rain is good during the monsoon, we will match the acreage under cultivation this year and the yield will be higher if they have good water access,"" said Kandasamy.The chances of acreage going up is low, because agricultural land is not increasing, said vegetable farmer T Kadhiresan. ""While agricultural land is only getting converted into real estate, no new land is being cultivated. However, there might be a shift in the sort of vegetables getting cultivated depending on the price that September harvest yields,"" he said.Weather experts have predicted normal rainfall in the areas surrounding Coimbatore district during the monsoon. ""The rain should be moderate, not too much or less, because water inundation or dry sand will reduce the yield,"" said Kadhiresan."

Prices of most vegetables will come down now that it has started raining, said Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary of agricultural produce market committee (APMC) Vashi, Mumbai.Mr. Pahinkar said that vegetables planted in March will be harvested in mid-July and fresh plantations will be undertaken during the monsoon. He said that rain in other parts of the country will also bring down prices of staples such as green chillies, sourced from Karnataka, which are being sold for as much as Rs. 150 a kilogram in the citys retail markets.Household budgets have gone for a toss with vegetable prices going through the roof. Tomato prices have remained sky-high for over a week, between Rs. 100 and Rs. 120 per kilogramme having gone up from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 in the beginning of this month. While there has been some relief with onion prices dropping considerably, green vegetables have become a luxury of sorts with cluster beans selling for as much as Rs. 160 and the humble okra at Rs. 80 a kilogramme.We cant stop eating these vegetables, but high prices are forcing me to cut down their consumption. I cant spend Rs. 100 to buy a kilogram of tomato, so I buy half a kilogramme or lesser, said Adagadu Ambarle, a security guard.Ramji Maharaj, who runs a mess in a hostel at Mumbai Central, said, Tomatoes are the key ingredient in most of the dishes. So I cant avoid using them. This rise in prices has disturbed my whole years budget.Traders said the rise in prices has only brought down the demand by a small 5 per cent to 10 per cent, which has ensured that prices remain high.Our sale has gone down.

Veerapur in Ballari taluk, who was among the many early birds to take advantage of the scheme, was able to harvest around seven quintals of tur per acre in about six acres of land with the help of water augmented in the pond dug in mid-2015.Getting the cost of cultivation back, leave alone profit, was a major worry for me all these years when monsoon rain was the only source of water. Protecting the crop from withering due to failure of timely rain posed a bigger challenge. But after the pond was dug, protecting the crop, by watering it with the help of sprinklers operated with diesel generator sets (provided by the government under the scheme) two or three times when the standing crop is in a critical stage, not only saved the crop but also ensured a good harvest, he told The Hindu .Happy with what he could get, he has plans to take up inter-cropping during the kharif season by cultivating tur, chilli, brinjal and tomato in his land with the help of water accumulated in the pond.I have also requested the Agriculture Department to provide drip irrigation system instead of sprinklers which not only helps utilise water optimally but also enables cover more area, he said.Sharnappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the purpose of Krishi Bhagya has been served to a great extent.

That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

This saw retail prices of onions fall to Rs 18-22 from Rs 20-25 on Wednesday and potatoes to Rs 24-30 from Rs 30-35. Market experts say prices will return to normal with additional supplies on Friday.Sanjay Pansare, a leading fruit trader in the APMC , said, ""Unlike vegetables, fruits could not reach the market today as producers learned late on Wednesday that the strike had been called off.

Later, the intervention of APMC officials resolved the issue.To break the deadlock, it was decided that though farmers have been exempted from shelling out commission, retailers were also given relief from commission for the day.

It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

After all, it was the nuptials in two erstwhile royal families of India: the groom was from Mysore's Wadiyar lineage and the bride from Rajasthan's Dungarpur dynasty.Mysore, which recalls the royal era once a year during Dussehra, came to life on Monday when Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar tied the knot with Trishika Kumari Singh in a traditional ceremony at the iconic Amba Vilas Palace in Mysore.The wedding rituals  held at the 100-year-old Kalyana Mantap inside the palace after a hiatus of several decades  were officiated by a team of priests.Clad in pink angrakha and jharipeta, Yaduveer arrived at the mantap in a 1953 vintage owned by Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the only son of the last ruling Maharaja of Mysore. He was accompanied by his aunt Indrakshi Devi. Arriving at the Madanavilasa entrance of the hall, Yaduveer was given a traditional welcome at the courtyard.Trishika Kumari arrived, dressed in traditional saffron Mysore silk sari.(TOI photo: Nethra Raju)Both Yaduveer and Trishika completed the rituals that took more than an hour with shloka chanting and guidance from the priests. Around 10.24am, Yaduveer tied the 'mangalyam' to Trishika during the auspicious Savithri Muhoorta of Karkataka Lagna.The couple, after completing the ritual of 'Sapthapadi', obtained blessings from Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, the wife of the late Narasimharaja Wadiyar.The couples tied the knot at 10.22 am and performed a series of pujas and other rituals which were stretched over for four hours. (TOI photo:Nethra Raju)The Boston-educated Yaduveer (24) was adopted as the scion of the former Wadiyar dynasty in May 2015 in an elaborate ceremony, again to re-emphasise the point that it is a 'royal' tradition. Sources in the family revealed that Yaduveer was engaged to Trishika much before his adoption as the scion of the ""royal family"".Colourful headgears - in both Rajput and Mysore tradition - dotted the palace. State chief minister Siddaramaiah, cabinet colleagues, diplomats from various countries, and erstwhile royal families from across India came for the nuptials.(TOI photo)The Amba Vilas Palace is witnessing the second wedding in the erstwhile royal family since 1976. Though there have been a few weddings related to the ex-royal family members, the last wedding witnessed in the palace of was that of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar in 1976 to Pramoda Devi.No Hindu wedding in the 'royal' family is complete without the mangalasutra being tied twice. It's a ritual unique to the descendants of the former Mysuru royal family, one that Yaduveer too followed on Monday.The south Indian Hindu wedding custom of the groom offering a silver toe ring to his bride gets a tweak. Back in the royalty days, it was gold, not silver, toe ring. And that's what Yuduveer did too.Many believe that Yaduveer and his bride Trishika were courting each other. Yaduveer's father Swaroopananda Urs put the rumours to rest and said the wedding was ""arranged"". Both families matched horoscopes and only then proceeded to fix the alliance.More than 200 chefs were roped in for the vegetarian feast on Sunday. On the menu were such delicacies as kashi halwa, kheer, badam kheer, pheni laddu, tomato yennagayi, channa batura masala, bisibele bhaat, tovve, rasam, majjige huli.The wedding of Yaduveer with Trishika upholds an old Rajput-Mysuru 'royal' family connection. The Rajput alliance started in 1900 when Krishnaraja Wadiyar married his bride from royalty in Gujarat  Prataparudra Kumari. This was followed by Chamaraja Wadiyar marrying Satyaprema Kumari of Bundelkhand and now Trishika comes from Dungarpur family in Rajasthan.No wedding crashers could have made it here. Entry was strictly by invitation. Only two persons per invite were allowed. The whole of the Mysuru city was decked up for the wedding  the palace especially was a sight to behold.Mysuru police commissioner B Dayanand and deputy commissioner of police HT Shekar supervised the bandobast. Three ACPs, six inspectors, 40 sub-inspectors and assistant subinspectors were on duty. Apart from them, 300 police personnel were deployed to beef up security since a huge number of VIPs were expected to turn up.Representatives from the erstwhile royalties of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur and Rajkot came for the wedding."

But many just skip buying the fruit at open markets, the super stores provide shoppers with other options  canned tomatoes, puree and pastes  but they too come at a price. The available pastes and purees are both locally manufactured as well as imported, but the taste is not quite the same, say many.""We try to keep the prices low, but it is still around Rs 80 a kg.

""With sales being at an all-time low, we sometimes buy less than five kilos to get through the day,"" said Ramesh Salve, another vendor.Unlike onions and garlic, the tomato is a flavourful ingredient. While some communities omit the rest for religious reasons, there is no discrimination against the tomato.Sangeeta Kulkarni, a home maker from Vashi suggested using roasted red bell peppers as an option to this costly ingredient. ""Mangoes and pineapples are also good choices since they have the sweet and sour flavour,"" she suggested.But, according to her, Indian grown tomatoes have an unusual flavor, which cannot be replicated by the commercially available pastes. ""Ketchup would also work, but it has many preservatives,"" she added.Nerul resident Nirmala Kashikar makes do with a jar of pasta sauce. ""The sauces, both Indian and foreign, have herbs and spices, so it does add some nice flavour to the dish.

N. Narasiah of Kallem village in this mandal reaped rich harvest growing vegetables through drip irrigation method after having vexed huge losses in cotton cultivation.I have been growing vegetables since the past five years. Last season, I got a profit of Rs. 2 lakh from tomatoes, he told The Hindu during his recent visit to his fields.Having tasted small success with drip irrigation and growing vegetables, he has now taken up cultivation on his 12-acre land. He grows tomatoes, brinjal, bitter gourd, and tobacco, among others.According to him, paddy and cotton crops required more water, and due to seasonal failure, he could not reap good harvests. The ground water was very low and he had to dig three borewells, which now yield water for about two to three hours a day. He alternately draws water to wet his fields. Things are little better as we now have power supply. In the past, electricity was a problem too, Mr. Narasaiah said.In addition to low rainfall, extreme heat wave dealt a blow to farmers who opted for paddy and cotton crops in these rocky mandals. The crops withered away and along with it the hopes of farmers.Mr. Narasaiah advised fellow farmers to utilise every drop of water using drip irrigation and growing short-term crops like vegetables. Vegetables give regular and steady income for about three to four months. If we grow two or three varieties, we can see some money, Mr. Narasaiah explained.According to him, through drip irrigation, he could save water and increase productivity by about 50 per cent. Digging up farm ponds and trenches across the field would also help retain water when it rained, he said.We now have support of the government under the MNREGA scheme to dig farm ponds. There is no need for farmer to invest money, he said."

Hybrid seedlings were introduced to Goa during 2011-12 to encourage local farmers to grow tomatoes and chillies. While the experiment was successful in certain areas, the initiative by the state's horticulture department helped in dispelling the wrong notion from the minds of farmers that tomatoes and chillies don't grow in Goa.Tomatoes grown through polyhouse cultivation and in some open areas in the state resulted in a produce of 927 kg that was procured in the financial year 2015-16.Resultantly, the horticulture department is now looking at introducing more vegetables to enhance the cultivation of the state.Besides the chilli variety called UG66009 planted last monsoon, which yielded a very good crop; the department will be distributing seeds of chilli varieties, Sai Priya and S78, among farmers this season.Goa's requirement of chillies is eight tonnes per day. Currently, approximately six tonnes of green chillies are being produced by the state, per day. Notably, 253 tonnes of green chilli was procured in the financial year 2015-16.""We're trying to diversify by convincing farmers to go for dry chillies, chilli flakes and chilli powder,"" said horticulture department, managing director, Larry Baretto.Additionally, the cucumber variety called Radhika, cluster bean variety called hybrid milan, bottle gourd variety called hybrid wardhan, and lady finger variety called Jai Kissan 62 are being planted.""The new varieties will most likely be grown in the Rabi season after rice/paddy crops have been harvested from the fields,"" said department of agriculture, managing director, Ulhas Pai Kakode.Introducing a new crop variety to the state is rife with challenges. For the department, testing the crop's quality, shelf life, prospect of damage while transportation from field to market, and consumer's acceptance of the new variety is a Herculean task.""We have to test the crop in our fields under various climatic conditions for one or two seasons.

""We might shrink the rupee margin, but the increase in volume covers the cost which makes it a win-win situation,"" he added.However, the models might vary from one player to another. Satvacart, for instance, explains the lower prices due to the price point availability because of the optimised supply chain and cut-down of middlemen in procurement.""Yesterday I was reading about the price hike and then I checked online and found out I was getting half a kilo of tomatoes at just Rs 20,"" said Pooja Garg, a communications professional working with a finance company.However, some suspect the portals are also witnessing heavy traffic as customers get curious and compare prices across portals."

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

But crop damage has impacted supply and the government may have to revise the estimate.States have been told to keep vigil on veggie prices and ensure improved supplies amid reports of tomatoes selling at 80 a kg in certain parts of the country.""Increase in vegetable prices, including tomato, is seasonal and area-specific. Still, we've asked states to take steps to ensure traders aren't inflating prices artificially. Every stakeholder must ensure there's no wastage during transportation and handling,"" said Pandey. Pandey also said the government does not want to increase procurement of pulses from the domestic market beyond 1.5 lakh tonnes to ensure market stability.""I have asked the Maharashtra food secretary to explore the option of selling pulses at subsidised rates in Mumbai as is being done in Delhi and we will provide them pulses at subsidised rates. We will release the pulses available with us in the next four months,"" the secretary said.The Centre has about 48,000 tonnes of pulses in stock and imports of another 20,000 tonnes are in the pipeline.The government is pulling out all stops to ease the pain of spiralling prices of pulses and has included FM radio channels to spread awareness."

Inflation in retail dal prices remains stubbornly high, climbing to 32% in May 2016 from 7.94% in September 2014, even as the price rise of items such as oils, eggs and veggies ranges in the 5% to 7% band.Meat and fish rates too are creeping up -inflation moving from 6.94% in September 2015 to around 8% now. This rise along with the surge in price of oils, eggs and vegetables -the last affected by seasonal surges (tomatoes moved from -10.21% in March to 9.50% in May) -is creating inflationary pressures.Though food inflation is well below the levels when NDA assumed office, it's begun eating into household budgets and threatening to give the government a political headache.The need to manage pulse rates has seen the government offer large jumps in minimum support prices, hike imports, create a contingency fund and use mobile delivery vans.Food prices not only affect the poor but also the middle class. And, this can affect the government's ratings when the BJP has reasons to feel satisfied at having completed two years in office and tasted recent electoral successes. High food inflation was seen to have hurt the UPA along with corruption cases -areas of vulnerability the Modi campaign zeroed in on in 2014.Initiatives in irrigation, a national farm market and a shift from MSP-driven policies will take time to show impact. The Centre needs to be wary about public impatience over its inability to smoothen price fluctuations.Expectation of a robust monsoon has wiped off some worries. But the impact of two consecutive patchy rainfall years must be dealt with when both retail inflation and wholesale price inflation data point to build up of pressure points on food items.Aware that spiralling prices may hurt economic recovery, measures to ease pressure on pulses include negotiations being initiated on long-term contracts to improve supplies.Interestingly, the inflation rate of cereals has hardly changed, indicating the effect of massive buffer stocks and the rising demand for pulses, fruits, meat, milk and eggs while per capita consumption of wheat and rice is declining. ""The government should cut import duty , remove stockholding, build buffer stock through imports and resume futures trading in pulses,"" said Ashok Gulati, Infosys chair professor at ICRIER.The RBI has already paused its rate cutting cycle, will watch the government's supply management as well as progress of the monsoon before it moves on interest rates.Economists say they expect prices to remain firm in June and July with added pressure coming from the hike in service tax rate and the increase in fuel prices.But things may reverse as the skies open up.""CPI inflation is expected to print in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% in June-July , with food prices likely to remain firm during those months,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA.""Moreover, the rise in service tax rate and retail prices of petrol and diesel would add some upward pressure to CPI inflation.""August 2016 onward, food inflation is likely to soften, Nair said. ""Moreover, data on the distribution of rainfall and pace of sowing may dampen food inflation, particularly if higher MSPs can boost acreage of high-inflation items such as pulses.Lower temperatures may douse the prices of perishables and non-vegetarian protein items,"" she added."

Death, like what happened in 2004 when five people of the Sabar tribe died of starvation, might not be a frequent occurrence. But the humans you see around are shadows of death - ill-fed and ill-clad.But, there is a In the midst of this frozen picture of horror, you cannot miss a glimmer of hope. A tank here, a pit there and a clutch of green in between. The Maoists have stopped visiting the Sabars and Mundas, the two main tribal inhabitants here. Instead, a new band of workers has started visiting them. These people talk to them about food and water and try to teach them ways of earning a livelihood. Some have decided to trust these babus and are gradually hobbling their way to a semblance of life.Amlasole is one of the villages that the scientists of Bose Institute have adopted as an experiment to turn them green. There are at least 20 tribal villages in the Binpur II block of the Jhargram sub division, including Kakrajhor and Bhulabheda , that have been selected for this project which is being sponsored by the department of science and technology (DST) under the aegis of the ministry of the same name. Some tribal villages in Purulia, Bankura and Birbhum have also been included in the project.The idea came from a study conducted by the Bose Institute experts that said even Amlasole, which is considered to be one of the most arid places in the state, gets about 1500 mm rainfall on an average, but this water is mostly lost because of the porous nature of the soil. If the families living here are able to ""capture"" this water, the age-old problem of lack of water for cultivation leading to droughts can be addressed. The study had also pointed that tribals should not only grow paddy but also other crops have to be weaned out of the habit of growing only paddy and should be trained to grow crops that need very little water for sustenance.Impressed with it, DST has sanctioned Rs 8 crore to Bose Institute, with which they are turning these villages green. The formula is simple. A 20 feet by 20 feet tank, that is eight feet deep, has been dug to collect rainwater for each family that's willing to let the scientists use its land. The base of the tank has been covered with thick polythene sheets so that the rainwater collected here is not absorbed underground. ""Each such tank is about to hold 90,000 litres water - enough for year-long cultivation. Instead of paddy, we are training them to grow crops like pulses, millets and corn and vegetables like different types of gourd, - striped, ridged, bitter and bottle, chillies, tomatoes and onions. But it is in growing fruits that we have made a breakthrough really,"" said Samir Sikdar as he showed the acres of orchards that have come up in the past one and a half years in different patches of Amlasole. Sikdar, a bio-scientist and the registrar of the Bose Institute.There are healthy guava, mango, mausambi plants all ready to flower in the next season. A simple formula again has been used to make this possible. An earthen pot with a small pinhole is sunk into the ground next to the plant. Eight litres of water are poured into it. The water seeps in gradually and keeps the ground wet for the plant for a whole week! ""We have to do this for one more year. When the plants are two years old, they will sustain themselves,"" Sikdar explained.There are many villagers who have been trained to prepare vermicompost and do bee keeping. ""I have already started selling my earthworms at 50 paise each and I have sold at least 4000,"" said Jagadish Munda , an Amlasole villager who has started eating twice a day now.His father has been growing vegetables and selling them in the local haat these days.""We used to eat mushrooms that grow in the forest and fall ill most of the time, but now with the help of this water storage tank, we are growing vegetables that are selling well. Seeing us many others are now asking the babus to help,"" said Lakshmikanta Sabar The work is not easy especially because the tribals are extremely wary about changing their cultivation patterns or lifestyle. ""We are trying hard to break the pattern...it will take time but we have made a beginning,"" Sikdar said.BOXSize of tank specified : 20 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet (deep)It can hold 90,000 litres of rain waterThis water is enough to cultivate a one bigha plot for the entire yearHowever paddy cannot be cultivated in this method because it needs a lot of waterThe two scheduled tribes in West Midnapur who are being helped are Sabar and MundaVegetables and fruits are grownTribals are being trained to make vermicompostMany are also into bee keeping."

Like cauliflower, whose wholesale prices are Rs 50 per kg, is being sold at Rs 75 per kg in retail with hawkers making cut of Rs 25 on each kg.Similarly, beans is rallying at Rs 60 per kg in wholesale but hawkers are charging Rs 80 per kg from consumers."

Ambient lighting, costumed serving staff and floor-level seating (complete with canopies draped in shimmering curtains) aim to make the visitor forget Tiruchi for a brief while.Moroccan cuisine has been shaped by all its interactions with other countries over the centuries, chef Rajprasad Radhakrishnan said. You will find dishes here with a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine.Theres also an influence of Moroccos colonial heritage, with a small selection of French recipes.The buffet starts off with a salad table that has some staples of Middle Eastern cuisine  steamed couscous (semolina granules made from durum wheat) with finely-chopped fresh vegetables, tabbouleh (cracked wheat mixed with finely chopped ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, and parsley) and Hummous dips made with chickpeas and black beans.Fatayer (mini minced mutton pies) have been given a vegetarian twist with a potato and peas filling, and Manakish, small pita flatbreads topped with zatar spice mix of cumin, oregano and olive oil, and sambouseh add to the variety of the bread counter.Grilled meats feature prominently in the Moroccan palate because of the nomadic lifestyle of its people. We have tried to include the commonly barbecued meats in our festival, with a live station that will serve customers the cuts of their choice. We marinate the lamb for at least one and half days before we grill it, said Mr. Raj. The whole lamb being barbecued at one end of the pool makes a dramatic visual statement at the festival. Small charcoal braziers are placed at customers tables to barbecue chicken, quail and kababs.Tagine, the slow-cooked stew of meat and vegetables that is distinguished by its earthenware dish topped with a conical lid, is available at the festival too.The golden glow of saffron tints everything from rice dishes to gravies and desserts in the festival. At the rice counter, Moroccan versions of biryani and pulao are available. Spaghetti tossed with cheesy white sauce brings a French touch to the table.Date halwa and roz bil haleeb (rice and milk pudding) are among the treats that mingle with some Indian offerings at the dessert table.The buffet dinner is priced at Rs. 600 plus taxes for adults, and Rs. 400 plus taxes for children."

Traders and experts blamed poor supply of almost all kitchen essentials for the surge and have ruled out a price correction any time soon because of rain-related problems of supply and spoilage. The supply of vegetables continues to be about half of the usual arrival, said Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section at the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee.""The monsoon has arrived, but that has so far not translated into a sizeable stock reaching the city. So far, the drought-affected crop is being harvested and received. Crop sown now will be better, but that will reach the city only after a month or so. Green leafy vegetables, though, could see a price correction faster. Thankfully, the rain is good so far. So, there is a hope for a good harvest,"" he said.In the retail market, vegetables like tomato, ginger, green chillies and even beans, capsicum, cauliflower and ladyfinger continue to command high rates. Good quality tomato is still selling for almost Rs 80 per kg in most areas. Beans, too, have not registered a price correction and are being sold for almost Rs 70 per kg, while vegetables like cauliflower and ladyfinger are selling at more than Rs 50 per kg. Green leafy vegetables are being sold at premium rates as well. While a standard bunch of coriander is commanding Rs 25, fenugreek is going for Rs 20 a bunch.The rates are unlikely to fall any time soon, Rajendra Sahu, a vegetable retailer, estimated.Customers don't have a choice but to buy the vegetables, even at high rates. ""The only change is that people are cutting down their purchases,"" Sahu said.Asha Patel, a tiffin provider from NIBM Road, is hoping prices fall soon. ""Before buying vegetables, I have to think if it will upset my monthly budget. Actually, I have stopped buying tomatoes as I just can't afford them any more.

Farmers would be roped in to raise these varieties in their field to produce seeds of these varieties and preserve them, he added.With limited water sources and shortage of labour, poly house has become the ideal option for horticulturists to get better yield and profit in a small area of land. Poly house helped farmers overcome shortage of water and labour.These progressive farmers not only adopted latest technologies but also used hybrid seeds to get better yield on small area. Farmers have been raising cucumber, tomato and other vegetables in poly houses, he pointed out.Vertical farming method under weather-controlled atmosphere helped them harvest large quantity of cucumber.

Even as I grumbled to my friend who had suggested the morning expedition, I found myself heading to Nariman Point two Sundays ago for the Sant Shiromani Shri Savta Mali Athavda Bazar, Vidhan Bhavans farmer-direct market. The weekly market that has been set up across the State by the Maharashtra State Agriculture Produce Marketing Board.Of course, I was armed with cloth bags and plenty of change. Since mid-August this year, every week, the lot between the Vidhan Bhavan and Inox theatre is transformed into a bustling bazaar of more than 30 stalls with farmers selling a staggering range of local and seasonal produce.We joined the throng of people shopping for their weekly veggies, and marveled at the glistening tomatoes, fat sitaphals, fresh cluster beans, and pumpkins the size of Ravanas head, that jostled for space with mounds of lettuce, stacks of asparagus, and luscious-looking purple cabbage.Apart from the usual suspects, there was some wonderful indigenous produce. We found some early green mogri (as the Gujaratis call it), which I had last eaten in Delhi. Winter vegetables, these radish pods are spicy: the purple ones add a nice bite to raitas while the green ones are cooked into a vegetable, usually with brinjals. Though, these are just as delicious when eaten alone.The market also sold fresh kidney beans in their pods, khatta sorrel leaves, and colocasia leaves for patras and stir-fries. We also found wild chikoos and guavas that when sliced open revealed a soft pink flesh. Flowers such as marigolds and asters were also available.I went back to the Sahyadri Farmers Producer Co. Ltd. stall multiple times for their glorious pesticide-free black raisins, plump and sweet. My friends kept texting me that they also wanted a packet, and so I would return to the stall to buy yet another kilo, while sampling more of the raisins. The same stall promises chemical-free bananas as well, and are considering home delivery in the future. Another farmer who stocked garlic showed us how to plant the pod to grow it.The haul from the market was a reassuring one, given that just the other day, my friends and I were bemoaning the lack of good produce available in our bazaars. The prices at the Sant Shiromani Shri Savta Mali Athavda Bazar are more than reasonable, and for those tired of the usual apples and bananas, theres much diversity in the produce available. This is a definitely affirmative step by the government in enabling fair trade, by cutting out the middle men, and letting people buy directly from the farmers.Dont forget to carry your own cloth bag though.Bijal Vachharajani writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security.

""Commodities such as potato, pumpkin, bottle gourd, that are supplied from surrounding districts, are available at reasonable prices,"" Kailash said.The consumers, however, are complaining.

Pressure was also building up within the retailers' community with many members, especially women, complaining about loss of business and livelihood.The retailers have been demanding elimination of agents' commission. Representatives of the retailers' associations and Agriculture Produce Market Committe (APMC) attended the meeting with the minister.The retailers' representatives claimed after the meeting that the government had assured them that it would study the feasibility and take a decision by August 21.Till the retailers made the welcome announcement of calling off their strike, citizens suffered because of vegetable shortage, high prices and poor quality. Most markets in the city were closed for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday. A few retail outlets open sold four-day-old stocks.Several tiffin providers in the city were mulling over suspending their services till Wednesday evening because of vegetables' short supply. ""I was lucky enough to know about the strike a day in advance. So, I stocked up vegetables for a few days.

Lahu Balwadkar, an organizer of the Shree Sawmi Samarth Athawade Bazaar, said, ""We started this exactly a year ago with the idea of connecting the farmers directly to the consumers. Around 2,000 farmers are working with us. This helps in providing vegetables at a cheaper rate to consumers. At the same time, farmers' profit margin also increases.

Manuel Jayaraj said 14 different types of associations, which were functioning at the Central Market (now not in existence), near Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, came together under a single umbrella and got registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975.It did not stop there. The association purchased 15.25 acres of land near Paravai and, with the assistance of Union Bank of India, big, medium and small merchants set up shops to deal with vegetables at wholesale prices. We procured in big numbers from hundreds of farmers and sold them, in turn, to merchants from different districts. Many wholesale merchants from as far as Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam too procure vegetables from our market regularly, Mr. Manuel Jayaraj added. Though not all the merchants, who were selling produce at the old market near Meenakshi Temple came here, a majority among them, say 75 per cent, have come.There are close to 650 shops/outlets, measuring in different sizes such as 1,000 square feet., 500 square feet., 200 square feet and 100 square feet are operated from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m since July 2009 at the Paravai market, as it is popularly known.Rajapandi, a supervisor of a wholesale merchant, said they mainly procured tomato, carrot and beans from farmers in the nearby region in bulk and sold them to buyers in Thiruvananthapuram. We despatch close to three tonnes in goods vehicles every alternate day. The payment is either credited in our bank account or we send our collection agent, he noted.Road to be laidThe market was solely established by the promoters, who could not get any assistance from the government or the local bodies in any form. Thus, the funds to be spent on infrastructure was huge and burdensome for the members. As the truck movement inside the market was heavy, roads had to be laid. Some of the executive committee members appealed to the government to help them in laying roads and disposal of vegetable waste, which too, they did on their own.Apart from the shopkeepers, hundreds of loadmen, workers and merchants visited the market throughout the night, association treasurer A. Arumugam said.Traffic reliefIn the last nine years, vehicle movement around Meenakshi Temple had fallen with the shifting of the vegetable market to Paravai, a police officer said. Even today, we experience traffic jam in Vakkil New Street, Yanaikal, East Masi Street and Simakkal in the early hours, but the shifting of 14 vegetable vendors associations to Paravai from Meenakshi Temple was a great relief from the traffic point of view. Imagine, if they too existed in the same place, it would have been highly impossible to move around the temple, a senior traffic police officer said."

But, growing up in Midnapore, he didn't have a daak naam (nickname), that most endearing of Bengali traditions. Doesn't matter. His fans have given him one. To them, he is Bangali Babu.In the labyrinth that is Itwari , street-style sandwiches are synonymous with Bangali Babu. From 4pm to 11.30pm, his modified rickshaw, and the knot of customers around it, further constrict the already clogged Dharaskar Galli . On offer are five-six varieties of sandwich , some of which have decidedly curious names. (more on this later). He even serves a veggie pizza topped with crispy vermicelli and fresh herbs. Okay, okay, with 'sev' and coriander leaves.""I started 15 years ago. My circumstances weren't very good then. Now this has turned things around,"" he says, turning sandwiches around on the hot tawa.A typical sandwich gets a slathering of butter, green chutney, tomato sauce and cheese spread before the filling and sev is added to it. The 'garam' version is then toasted with more butter on the tawa. Once ready, it is buried under a blizzard of grated cheese, sprinkled with coriander leaves and grated carrot and served on newspaper squares.His pizza-making process - Bangali Babu calls it 'technology' - is equally interesting. To 'bake' the pizza without an oven, he places a perforated steel disc on the prepared base and places the whole thing upside down on the hot tawa for a few minutes until the cheese has melted.Students, local residents and businessmen are his biggest chunk of customers. He also takes pride in the fact that he gets some high-profile guests, including union minister Nitin Gadkari (who is something of a patron saint for popular eatery owners in the city).Bangali Babu might revel in the attention today, but it wasn't always like this. Thirty-one years ago, but in what seems like another life, he completed a course in first aid from Midnapore. In 1987, came to Nagpur to escape poverty and 'do something on my own'. ""I assisted a gynaecologist for a few years. But since I was always interested in cooking, I started working as an assistant cook in a restaurant,"" he remembers, adding that his financial condition still remained precarious.""I decided on sandwiches since this was something that I could manage on my own,"" he says. ""The Bombay sandwich is a common recipe, but the rest, I developed on my own. I keep thinking about new flavour combinations all the time,"" he says. He tests out the new recipes on 8-10 regular customers and only after getting feedback does he add it to the menu.So, which sandwiches has he created? ""Tichkule,"" he says, cryptically. Relishing the quizzical look this elicits, he goes on: ""There was this character called Sachin Tichkule, played by Akshay Kumar, in the movie 'Khatta Meetha'. This sandwich is also khatta meetha (tangy) and fills you with energy. Hence the name,"" he explains.Another of his creations is 'moov'. Quizzical look, check. The explanation? ""That is because, like the relaxing cream, this sandwich also relaxes you and comforts you,"" he adds.For someone who didn't have a nickname of his own, Tapas Chakraborty aka Bangali Babu has come a long way. Even his sandwiches have daak naam now.(This occasional column looks at some of the old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved. Do you know of any?

Two months ago, following a price hike, vegetables were sold for a fortune at the markets. Now, shopkeepers in town are of the view that the prices will shoot up again for Onam.Tomato is one such item whose prices escalated and fell in a space of two months. Data available with the economics and statistics department showed that tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 32/kg last Onam, was priced at Rs 48 in May. However, this week it sold for half the price, around Rs 18-20.But, making Erissery is going to be more or less expensive as the price of pumpkin is rising steadily. Pumpkin - which was sold for Rs 18/kg last year - was priced at Rs 20/kg last May and is sold for Rs 22 in local markets.If you love 'Vendakka pachadi', do not wait for Onam.

Though the price of cabbage has fallen by Rs 3/kg compared to the price a couple of months ago (Rs 30), it is still higher than last year's figure of Rs 23.The prices of one of the most expensive item - bitter gourd - dropped recently. The vegetable, essential for kichadi and the crunchy fried delicacy, was sold at Rs 52/kg this May, while the price was Rs 38 last year. The current price is Rs 30/kg.It would be a safe bet to choose out-of-the-box dishes this season and go for dishes like 'Vazhuthananga theeyal' as the price of brinjal has fallen. The veggie now available for Rs25/kg was sold at Rs 32 a couple of months ago.Vegetable dealers said this fall and spike is quite normal. They claimed that cooperative societies and other government entities, running special stalls to control price is inadvertently increasing the price.""Temporary retail outlets at regional levels are run by those who have no market experience. When they purchase items in bulk without knowing the exact requirement or pricing, there will be a shortage. The artificial price hike is usually blamed on wholesalers, but shortage can happen this way too. This results in a temporary hike during festivals,"" said K Shaji, a vegetable dealer who has been running a stall at Broadway market for 30 years.Consumerfed MD Mehaboob M rubbished the claim that 'involvement of government entities contributed to the sudden hike in price. ""Consumerfed stocks product by calling tenders. Our aim is to rein in the hike in price. It is to be noted that production has increased this season.

Currently, gastropubs and watering holes seem to be on a back-to-the-basics-at-home mode, with the most popular Indian pedestrian food, chaat, making its way into their kitchens. Food watchers and chefs believe that this trend is only going to grow bigger and is something that would work well with Indians who are also returning to their roots.Restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani says that going desi was inevitable. ""A bhel puri can work as both an appetizer and a salad. Come to think of it, it is fresh, nothing is cooked, has bold flavours and, without potato, it makes for a healthy snack. Given our palates, it makes for a good accompaniment with alcohol or, as a meal by itself. The industry has fast caught on to serving more chaats on the menu, though we have taken it a bit too far as well, with ingredients such as liquid nitrogen being infused in them, for instance. But given the way the people are headed, why not go desi with our food? It does work, after all,"" points out Riyaaz.F&B consultant Aslam Gafoor says that fusion food, especially chaats, is going to stay. ""While we can trace the first instances of this trend making an appearance to a couple of years ago, it has permeated to our city recently, with many quirky stand-alone restaurants having them on the menu. It is a case of chefs and restaurateurs wanting to give back to consumers what India has to offer. From humble chaats such as jhal muri or bhel puri and puchkas or golgappas, to the Mumbai favourite vada and kheema pav, there is a lot of Indian street food making its way into these kitchens. And they are served in interesting fusion avatars, which make them all the more exciting to the people frequenting these hotspots, as opposed to the same old bruschettas and other European dishes that have been on the menus for a while,"" he adds.Actor-turned-restaurateur Likhit Shetty adds that it was this experimental feeling that got him and his partner to introduce some fusion chaats to their menu. ""I am a Mangalurean and I love chicken sukka. My partner loves chaats, especially pani puri. When planning our menu, we decided to try something new and different, which was when we got to adding Chicken Sukka Golgappa to our menu. Also, we have a Chicken Bhel. We were unsure how people would react to it, but people's response shows that they are game for more such experiments. The cosmopolitan crowd in the city likes the mixed flavours and techniques,"" says Likhit.The fact that chaats are familiar to Indian diners, who do not have the time to go to small chaat restaurants in bylanes, is also why they are a big hit. ""The past couple of years have seen the idea of small plates become popular with people who dine out. Chaats are a perfect sync with the concept of small plates as they offer a reasonable amount and can be shared by 2-3 people. This is another reason the trend has picked up, and has given chefs the chance to plate them innovatively, adding some creativity with the cutlery,"" reasons Aslam And there are some gastropubs that add a bit of drama too, which includes live mixing of chaats at tables. Chef Sombir Chaudary says, ""Instead of serving a soggy version of jhal muri, guests are awestruck when they are served improvized versions live at tables, with spice, onions and tomatoes based on their tastes. Meat versions like chicken and prawn are popular. Mixing cuisines also helps  for example, a papdi-chaat version of nachos, which is a favourite pub snack. I think this trend will stay for a while in Bengaluru, because people seem to like everything to have a twist and are always game for something new."""

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N.

The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already written to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology.Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Mr Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.If the Government of India approves GM crops such as GM mustard which is an important crop for States like Bihar, the State will not be able to escape the consequences of the technology as we are also the leading producer of honey in India and honey production depends on mustard crop, he said.He urged the Prime Minister to see that no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, which can harm the interest of farmers and the people of India at large.The interested parties are trying to push in an unproven technology. The States must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on the farmers, he said.The government of India should mandatorily consult and seek no objection from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop, Mr Kumar urged Mr Modi.He also sought the Prime Ministers intervention to see that the attempt to commercially release genetically modified mustard variety in the country should not proceed any further without prior consultation and consent of the state government. - PTI"

Forty crops, including the upland paddy of Jyothi rice, are cultivated here.The vegetables sown here includes potato, cabbage, tomato, beetroot, carrot, onion, beans and green chilly. Some vegetable will always be ripe for harvesting at the farm round the academic year.When the initiative was launched, the school authorities were not sure whether they would be able to grow all the vegetables available in the market. But now, almost all varieties are grown here, making it a model farm. Both hybrid and traditional crops are grows here, says Siby K. George, convenor of the farm club. The farm is fully organic; pest-control and the application of manure is minimum.A lot of effort, from the children as well as elders, has gone into the farm, which is on a slope.

Most of us, these days, for lack of time, or due to sheer laziness, find it easier to pick up vadam packets from the stores. But remember the excitement of a summer holiday morning  when we were young  when paati was all set to lay out the vadams on the terrace to dry, and all the kids were given the task of keeping the squirrels and crows at bay? Recall tasting the semi-cooked vadams, and waiting impatiently for them to be fried the next day? These days, with most women working, and compact apartments being the preferred residences of many, the art of making vadams is hardly a much-awaited summer activity anymore. Plus, with the appalam and vadam industry getting commercialised, today's generation doesn't mind picking up a packet of vadams or appalams off the shelf. But then, it is not a lost art, for bucking the trend are those Chennaiites who still follow the tradition of making these eats at home.Television anchor and actress Ramya Subramanian, and her mother Vasanthi never miss a chance to prepare vadams when the sun is shining bright. Vasanthi, who makes vadams every year, says, ""Making appalams and vadams was once restricted to women in agraharams, especially among widows, who used to make a living out of this. Later, it became a hobby for women during summer. I grew up in Mannargudi and saw our grandmothers preparing it by observing madi. The daughters-in-law later picked up by watching them. I was interested in cooking even as I was a child, and started helping my mother when I was as young as 10 or 12. I learnt how to make vadams from her, and till today, I ensure I prepare different varieties every summer."" Her daughter Ramya has the fondest memories of helping her with the process. ""The maavu itself is very tasty - there have been times when my father and I have half-emptied the maavu. Despite her warning us that eating too much of it would hurt our stomachs, we love having spoonfuls. My other duty is to go to the terrace with a long wooden stick and keep the crows from eating what's laid out to dry,"" laughs Ramya.What started off as an individual interest turned into a small-scale business for Narayanan. ""I am from Kerala. Even though no one at my house makes appalams, I got a bit curious about how this was made, when I was a child. I used to see my neighbours doing it and picked it up from them. Later, I moved to Chennai and began experimenting with appalams, until I finally learnt the trick. Even though I began making it for my house, my tasty appalams were demanding to be sold,"" says Narayanan, who has been making appalams for the last 30 years.The problem with buying it outside is the quality, he says. ""They add a lot of sunambu (slaked lime). So, it becomes less tasty and don't last long, which is why, making them at home is a lot better. However, I must say that unlike vadams, making appalams is quite difficult. But once you know the technique, it is relatively easy,"" he says.K Jayalakshmi's shares a similar story. A government employee, she began making vadams as a hobby, and soon turned it into her business, post retirement. ""I have been making vadams since I was young. But I was not able to do it frequently since I was working. But once I retired, I took it up pretty seriously. I make javvarisi, tomato, onion, murukku, and ela vadams. I also do ulundhu and arisi appalams. Apart from this, I make a variety of vathals and mor molaga. It was through word of mouth that I began making it for outsiders. At 70, I am not as active as before, but my son and his friend take care of it these days,"" she says.Homemaker Uma Rajendran, who has been making vadams at home, says that there is a lot of difference between homemade vadams and the ones purchased at stores. ""I have been making them for the last 30 years. When you do it by yourself, the quantity is more and you ensure the salt and amount of spice is added accurately. If you pick it from the shop, it will hardly last for two months. They get spoilt quickly because they don't dry it sproperly. When we make it at home, we dry it at least for four or five days and I store them until next summer. But yes, it is indeed a tedious process, especially since you have to stand near the stove all the time to check the consistency. But then, this used to be a fun activity for all of us when we were growing up,"" says Uma.Vasanthi also points out that today's generation doesn't have any interest in making these at home. ""The appalam and vadam industry has become commercialised. They don't want to make it at home and simply buy them off the shop. They have become lazy and think that it is a difficult process. They don't make an attempt to learn. The reason why these are made during summer is that when we have dal-based recipes during winter, these accompaniments help digest the food better. Also, today all the women go out to work and live in compact apartments. There isn't much time or space for them to dry them,"" says Vasanthi.While the current generation might be enjoying this process, the next generation might not even see mothers making vadams at home, says Ramya. ""Even though they are served just as an accompaniment to a meal, I like how our mothers take time to prepare this with love and affection. I am happy to be a part of this generation, where I have seen her making these, and learning from her. But I don't think the next generation will be able to see all this."""

V. S. Nagireddy has said.Addressing a press conference at the partys district office here on Friday said Mr. Nagireddy said that several factors that included lack of money to buy inputs, reduction in availability of water and last but not the least lack of remunerative prices for their produce were pushing farmers into a severe crisis, he said. He wondered why Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was advising bankers not to give gold loans to farmers. He asked in what capacity the Chief Minister was making such recommendations to banks. Nothing short of a parliamentary Act could prevent bankers from giving gold loans to farmers, he said. The Principal Secretary was on the other hand contradicting the Chief Minister by telling the bankers that farmers were resorting to suicide because the banks were not giving them loans.The Chief Minister was ordering law enforcement officers to invoke the PD Act to curb trivial crime, but was not suggesting the same for persons involved in sale of adulterated agricultural inputs even though they were affecting several lives.Mr. Nagireddy said that onion crop had been raised in 30,000 hectares in the State, but farmers were being forced to dump it on the road side because there were not getting remunerative price. The situation was the same with tomato farmers. While 50 per cent of the mandals in the State were experiencing drought, the State government had not even written a letter to the Centre appraising it of the pathetic situation. Spurious seed was another factor that was affecting the farmers."

Judge Sanjay Patil sentenced Jitendra Dedhia (48), owner of a grocery shop in Parel, who had ordered the hit after his wife refused to divorce him.Dedhia had an affair with the sister-in-law of his wife, Beena, and wanted to marry her. Also, sentenced to life were the attackers -Nazim Khan and Hasruddin Malik.The trio was found guilty of the murder last Wednesday after which the court had posted the case for Mondayfor the sentencing. Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian sought the life sentence for the accused on the ground that, in keeping with the Supreme Court's guidelines, the case did not fall in the `rarest of rare' category to warrant the death sentence.The victim's sister-inlaw, who had also been made an accused in the case initially, was discharged by the Bombay high court a few years ago. A third accused, Rajnikant Wagh, a vegetable vendor who had introduced the killers to Jitendra, was acquitted by the court.The case initially garnered huge sympathy for Jitendra as he had made the crime appear like a chainsnatching incident that ended in the murder of his wife.However, a month later, the city crime branch of the city police cracked the case and found that Jitendra had promised the co-accused Rs1 lakh for carrying out the attack. He had paid Rs 29,000 to the accused which was reco vered from them.Acting on a tip-off, on December 17, 2009, the crime branch arrested Khan, a taxi driver who lived in Antop Hill. The police said that during interrogation, he revealed the name of Malik, a tomato vendor who allegedly told the cops about the conspiracy . This was the fourth attempt made by the men, the police had said.On October 4, 2009, all the accused met at Lalbaug where the conspiracy was hatched. On October 27, 2009, Jitendra prodded Beena to go on their usual morning walk. Around 5.30am, the couple was attacked by two bikers, Malik and Khan. The police later alleged that while Malik was riding, Khan stabbed Beena on the neck.They also alleged that Jitendra then ordered Nazim to finish his job properly, since, if she survived, the truth would be out. Nazim then returned and stabbed Beena twice in the stomach."

Both also seem trend driven and of the moment.Kitchen Garden, the new urban caf from the folks behind Suzette, translates healthy eating into an expansive salad bar and a menu that uses 90 per cent organic produce to prepare salads, smoothies and sandwiches.212 All Good, a new clean eating restaurant at Phoenix Mills, takes a different tack. Here you can get a cocktail, a snack or a meal made of ingredients sourced locally. There are also substitutes for everything from cola to ketchup.The motivationJeremie Sabaggh, one of the three partners behind the Kitchen Garden, says, We wanted to do something like a Subway, but with good ingredients. Romil Ratra, Group Director, Bellona Hospitality, says the impetus for 212 All Good was people realising there are huge benefits in eating the right stuff without compromising the meal experience. Without saying, I cant eat this. Fried is not bad. Cheese is not bad. It is like, alcohol is not bad. How do we make it better so that theres less guilt at the end of everything?The original idea for 212 All Good came from Deepti Dadlani, who heads marketing at Bellona. She says, Theres this whole other conversation where you can say what you eat is how you feel, and what you are.The scale of the undertaking cant be experienced in a single dish, though the Andaman Island Tuna Poke Bowl gives you a fair idea of the complexities involved: from sourcing and transporting fish from the Andamans to substituting traditional rice for red rice, to serving it with lightly fermented carrots. Seven months of intensive research have gone into formulating recipes for everything from soda to bread.The same can be said of the devotion put into sourcing the produce at Kitchen Garden. The crockery has been brought from Vietnam the bread is as a crusty sourdough is airy and moist (the breads are organic). The kitchen turns out only 20 loaves a day, though that is set to expand. Also on the menu is ciabatta bread, though not the flaky croissants that are available at Suzette. This is in keeping with the healthy focus of Kitchen Garden, where even the bread is made from three ingredients: wheat and rye flour, salt and water.Sabaggh says, I started attending bread classes in France in 2012, working on baguettes and everything like croissants for Suzette. And then I did some internships in Paris. This led to a second internship in Paris with a baker who is totally crazy guy, very passionate and working only with sourdough. Its this tutelage that has led to the sourdough that is served at the restaurant.Ratra and Sabaggh are committed to the quality of their product. Sabaggh says, With Kitchen Garden, the idea is to do something more urban, maybe a bit more young. More international, less French. Where we can do something like soba noodles, that we are doing here, or ciabatta breads or twisted hummus or have some edamame, or veggies, which were not exactly, fitting our Suzette concept.That said, there are some things from Suzette that theyre carrying over. The reason why we kept the by Suzette [label] is that we want people to know that this is the same way of making things, always from scratch, using organic products, never using shortcuts to make food, no artificial flavours, no ready-made stuff. We dont have ready-made stuff, I dont like that.Good for your gutThe focus of the food at 212 All Good is that it should be good for your gut. The team has worked on fermentation of vegetables as well as things like kefir, a fermented milk drink made with yeast. Tacos, all-day breakfast, salads are available for a dining experience that is similar to the one you would have at any of the malls other eateries, but with ingredients that are free from preservatives.Both restaurants work with suppliers to bring farm fresh ingredients to their customers. At Kitchen Garden, cherry tomatoes to cheeses are supplied from a farm in Gujarat. The vegetables, grains and meats are brought from farmers in Maharashtra and close by. If it is not possible to get quality ingredients locally, for example Haas avocados, Parmesan cheese, its imported.At 212 All Good, everything is sourced locally, be it cheese, fish or vegetables. Salmon was dropped from the menu as it could not be sourced from the country. Behind the bar, tetrapacks of juice have been banished in favour of freshly squeezed juices and even bitters are being made in-house.If this signals anything, it is that city consumers are looking to eat out, but not at the expense of their health. Sabaggh sums it up, What we discovered also from clients in Mumbai is that people really know what they want, and they like to experiment.Both restaurants offer something for everyone: catering to diets that range from vegan to keto to gluten free. And perhaps more innovatively, to those that arent on a diet; rather just choosing to watch what they eat.The author is a freelance writerTo make a reservation at Kitchen Garden, Bandra West; Call 26459775212 All Good opens on October 17 at High Street Phoenix; Call 62216020/ 8655012212"

The scheme is being seen as a boon for farmers in the arid region, who depend almost exclusively on scanty rainfall for cultivation during the rabi season.While the first stage of the scheme covered an area of 11,000 hectares, the project's second stage will bring a further 24,000 hectares of agricultural land under its ambit, making it the world's largest single drip irrigation project.Highlighting the advantages of the Rs 768-crore scheme, water resources minister MB Patil said, ""Around 15,000 small and marginal farmers in 30 villages of the taluk will benefit from the scheme.""Test run in September: A joint venture of Netafim India Private Limited and Jain Irrigation, it is being run on a build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) model.

58f6741ba3d24b0b70c2b9ee,Keep up the fair exchange,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Keep-up-the-fair-exchange/article15477879.ece,2016-10-10,,The Hindu,"Amid tensions between the two countries, it has been suggested that India should impose a trade embargo on Pakistan by suspending its most-favoured nation (MFN) commitment towards Pakistan in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The MFN provision, given in Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 1994, puts every WTO member (including India) under an obligation to extend any benefit (say, lowering tariff rates) accorded to one member (say, the U.S.) to all other WTO members (including Pakistan). This core non-discrimination principle is the cornerstone of the world trading system. Arguing for India suspending its MFN commitment towards Pakistan would mean India restricting imports from Pakistan without restricting imports of like goods from other countries, or/and India restricting exports to Pakistan without restricting the export of like goods to other countries. This can be achieved by imposing trade quotas, higher tariffs, taxes, or even totally banning some or all traded products. But is this economically and legally feasible?Economic and legal feasibilityAlthough bilateral trade between India and Pakistan has increased from $345 million in 2003-04 to $2.61 billion in 2015-16, it is abysmal compared to Indias total merchandise trade of $641 billion in 2015-16 and Pakistans total trade of around $75 billion, which includes exports worth $28.3 billion. Indias exports to Pakistan amount to $2.1 billion whereas imports from Pakistan are just $441 million, resulting in a trade surplus of $1.7 billion in favour of India. Given these numbers, assuming India were to suspend MFN status by stopping all imports from Pakistan, it would only result in a very marginal decline of Pakistans total exports and that too assuming that Pakistan is unable to find alternative markets. Even prohibiting all Indian exports to Pakistan, such as textiles, chemicals and agricultural products, will also not have any noticeable impact on Pakistan because Pakistan can always source these goods from other countries. On the contrary, restricting Indias exports, which have contracted considerably in the last 18 months, might hurt India more than Pakistan.Would India be able to justify its MFN violation if Pakistan were to challenge this in the WTOs dispute settlement body (DSB)? First, India cannot justify this on the pretext that Pakistan does not honour MFN obligations towards India. The correct recourse to Pakistans action is to mount a legal challenge in the WTO and not indulge in tit-for-tat.However, India can justify its MFN violation if it is able to make a case under any of the GATT exceptions such as the national security exception, most important in the current scenario. In the pre-WTO era, the U.S. in 1985 relied on this exception to defend its MFN violation when it imposed a trade embargo on Nicaragua to oppose the Sandinista government. However, given the weak and diplomacy-based method of resolving trade disputes then, the U.S. defence was never judicially tested. In the post-WTO era, in 1996, when the European Communities (EC) challenged the Helms-Burton Act of the U.S., enacted to strengthen the American embargo on Cuba, the U.S. again justified it as a national security exception. Even here, before the adjudicatory process could start, the U.S. and the EC reached a settlement.Article XXI (b) of GATT provides the most important national security exception. It states that nothing in GATT shall be construed to prevent any country from taking any action that it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests. Three questions are pertinent. First, do the words it considers necessary give full authority to India to enact any measure it likes without any scrutiny by WTOs DSB? Although Article XXI (b) gives a country very wide discretion to unilaterally decide its national security measures, a certain degree of judicial review is still possible. Thus, at a minimum, India will have to provide a reasonable explanation to the DSB as to why restricting export of cotton and tomatoes to Pakistan or/and restricting imports of dates, light oil and portland cement (these commodities constitute almost 50 per cent of Indias imports from Pakistan) is necessary to protect Indias essential security interests.Second, is Article XXI (b) a general national security exception? No. This exception can be invoked only if the measure adopted relates to fissionable material, to traffic in arms or other related material, or is taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations (EIR). India will most likely try to make a case in the EIR category. Even here, though India will enjoy a wide discretion to define EIR, this cannot be unilaterally determined to ensure that Article XXI is not used for political or punitive purpose.Third, does the current situation fall under an EIR? This is difficult to answer. Notwithstanding recent escalations, both countries continue to have diplomatic relations, cultural and social ties have not been snapped, transport links continue to exist. Also, both countries have seen far worse days in the past and yet trade and economic ties deepened.Pushing for deeper trade tiesTherefore, given the negligible economic impact and potential legal problems, suspending MFN to impose trade sanctions on Pakistan will only escalate tensions without much benefit. Instead of weakening trade ties, India and Pakistan should pay heed to this famous claim that when goods dont cross borders, soldiers will. Free trade connects countries, and thus incentivises peace. Empirically, it has been shown that higher levels of free trade reduce military conflicts. India and Pakistan should boost free trade amongst themselves, Pakistan should honour its MFN commitment to India in the WTO, and India should use the SAARC platform to push for deeper trade ties.Prabhash Ranjan is an Assistant Professor of Law, South Asian University. Views are personal.If India were to suspend MFN status by stopping all imports from Pakistan, it would only result in a marginal decline of Pakistans total exports"

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all-India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham secretary general D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives."

Cut to 2014 when it bagged the geographical indication (GI) tag giving its growers here the sole right to use the words 'Nagpur Orange'. Little has changed after that. Though not as worse as the cotton grower who is often pushed to suicide, the orange farmer is also not spared by the vagaries of nature and uncertain market. Last year, a glut led to rates crashing to Rs4 to5 a kg.If the Alphonso mango grown in Konkan region and grapes of Nashik have an established export market, the Nagpur Santra remains their poor cousin.The orange crop grows twice a year. The fruit available from September to December is Ambiya which has a slightly sour taste. It is followed by the sweeter Mrig crop in January. Normally, farmers go for either of the two varieties. In the last 10 years, large-scale orange cultivation has begun in Rajasthan too, giving Nagpur Orange some competition.The demand for setting up a major processing centre in Vidarbha is an old one. Two years ago, a facility by Citrus India Private Limited started at Nanded in Marathwada region where orange growing is a recent affair. Now, as Patanjali Ayurved plans to make juice out of the oranges grown in Nagpur district and other regions of Vidarbha, there is much hope for the farmers, even though earlier players have failed to successfully market the same product.The first organized attempt was made in the 1960s when farmers came together to form the Nagpur Orange Growers' Association (NOGA) with its plant at Motibagh in north Nagpur. NOGA ran into losses and the government took over it in 1972, bringing it under the Maharashtra Agro-Based Industries Development Corporation (MAIDC).NOGA, with its new plant in Hingna, was once known for its bottles of orange squash and juice. Now, tomato ketchup is its mainstay product. NOGA's line of juices, which are sold in cans, are out of the shelves in shops and are now sold only to institutional buyers like hotels and government agencies. Squash has a small retail market with 50,000 bottles made in a year. There are 3-4 smaller units which hardly have any influence.Sources say NOGA could not compete with juices in tetra packs which took over the market. Cans became old fashioned and NOGA did not have enough funds to invest in a tetra pack unit. The golden days of NOGA ended more than a decade ago. A plant started in Katol in 1998 is also shut.The Nagpur orange has a peculiar feature of leaving a bitter taste in the juice. Limonin in the fibre and seeds brings about this taste. In a commercial unit, the seeds and fibre cannot be removed, or consequently, the bitterness reduced. At least NOGA couldn't and thus lost out to competition. ""The squash which is sweetened with chemicals sells more,"" a source said.""These days, de-bittering units are available, again a major investment,"" said the source. Industry experts say limonin is present in other citrus fruits too and the problem has been addressed long back.The National Citrus Research Centre (NRCC), which has its experimental farms off Amravati Road, was set up in 1985 after a major pest attack in the early 1980s. Now upgraded to a central institute, some say here that it has not come up with a counter to the bitter taste so far. Though a seedless variety has been developed, it is expected to be available for commercial cultivation only after a couple of years.""De-bittering facility is easily available in the market so it should not be a constraint anymore. Like Nanded, a plant can also be set up in Nagpur,"" says Manoj Jawanjal, the director of Mahaorange , a state government marketing agency, and also an orange grower.At present, the majority of units making juices import the fruit contents. Imports are cheaper due to low customs duty. ""In order to protect the local growers, government should impose a higher tax on imports,"" he said.""The orange lobby has not been as strong as grape growers of western Maharashtra. A market for pomegranate and grapes was created by the growers there. Initially, the growers also paid for the losses incurred by traders who exported their produce. Now, there is an established market for these fruits. Those in Western Maharashtra had a political backing. It can happen for oranges too but there has to be support from the government,"" said Jawanjal.""Mahaorange recently exported oranges to Sri Lanka but there is s a long way to go. For getting the advantage of GI tag, an export market has to be established first. At present, the local farmers do not have much awareness about GI and its advantages,"" he said.""It's not juices alone, even orange peel and seeds can get a good price for the farmers,"" says Amitabh Pawde, an engineer-turned-farmer in the orange belt of Narkhed, over 60 km from Nagpur.""The peel can be used for making high-end cosmetics. Orange peel oil is a costly product and, once dried, talcum powder too can be made from it. At present, the raw materials are imported. There are small units which do not make any difference. Any major player in personal care segment, buying the raw material from Vidarbha, can change the dynamics of orange growing here,"" said Pawde.Pawde cited a recent research which says limonin, the bittering element in oranges, can cure kidney stones too.Even as bigger plans may still take some time, farmers say even their day-to-day problems have not been addressed entirely. ""A large number of farmers are close to forest areas and Nilgai (blue bulls) are a major pest destroying the orange trees which are short in height. Subsidy for drip irrigation is also is not available,' says Sanjay Dhote from Katol."

This season, farmers in Bodi, Melasokkanathapuram, Silamalai, Markandeyankottai and Kundalnayakkampatti cultivated the crop expecting high returns. Most of the farmers had grown the variety that gives yield in 90 days. As the climatic conditions were also conducive, they got a good yield.Tomatoes cultivated in the region are sold in the markets in Trichy, Dindigul and Oddanchathiram apart from Madurai. However, this time, it looks like the traders are not keen on them.At present, a box of 15 kilograms of tomatoes, which have not been segregated based on the quality, is selling for 30, while the slightly higher quality boxes selling at a price between 40 to 50. But, the farmers say that the traders are getting a better deal, because they are selling the tomatoes in a prices ranging from 5 to 8 based on the size and skin. In Madurai, the better quality tomatoes are sold for 10 in the farmers markets, while retailers hiked it to 12.Farmers say that the traders make good money even when there is a good yield, because they do not even bother to come to purchase the tomatoes from the farm. The farmers are forced to take them to the markets as the produce cannot be maintained for long.A Sekar, a farmer, says that they spend about 6,000 for cultivating tomatoes on one acre. ""A ten-gram packet of tomato seeds cost 400. The maintenance per acre comes to about 30,000, including pesticides and weeding. We make some profit only if a box sells for about 60. But now, we suffer about 1,500 loss per acre. Loss or profit, we have to pay the people to pick the fruits, which would otherwise start rotting as the rainy season is setting in. Thus, once again, tomato farmers in the region are suffering in spite of a good yield,"" he told TOI."

Today, she has 17, and is in talks with 10 more.""At first, I collected the trash myself in my car,"" Danelon said with a laugh as she turned over dirt with a shovel in the leafy courtyard of her house in Sao Paulo.""But now we've grown, and today we recycle 30 to 40 tons of organic waste per month.""- Gardens in the sky -Her partners include French restaurant Le Bilboquet, in the chic downtown neighborhood of Jardins.With Danelon's help, the restaurant now has cherry tomatoes, lemons and lavender plants growing on its rooftop, a stone's throw from the skyscrapers of the Brazilian economic capital's financial district.Its French chef, 34-year-old Julien Mercier, signed up for Danelon's program six months ago.""What we grow here isn't enough to supply the whole restaurant. But the important thing is to understand that we're part of a process. These things are growing here, and we can also boast that we recycle a ton and a half of organic waste every month,"" he told AFP as he inspected his vegetables and herbs.The waste is composted at a facility about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside the city, where it is mixed with earth and allowed to biodegrade over the course of months.It is a ""traditional composting technique,"" without enzymes or earthworms to accelerate the process, said Danelon. But with a little patience, all that waste turns into rich, nutrient-packed compost.- Seeing things differently -The average 50-table restaurant pays 900 reals ($275) a month for the composting and gardening service -- about the same as the municipal waste collection fee.""We have to look squarely at our own waste, value it and know that it can be reused,"" said Danelon.She offers starter kits for people looking to make their own compost at home. More and more people are contacting her to ask about setting up communal gardens on the roofs of their apartment buildings, she said.At Mesa III, a deli in a working-class neighborhood, customers are greeted by basil, sage and rosemary plants ever since the Guandu Institute trained the staff.""If we as a society realize how much trash we're producing, we'll see it's just atrocious,"" said owner Ana Soares, 63.Her restaurant has installed a recycling system for glass and switched to cardboard take-out containers to cut down on plastic.""That's why we joined this beautiful project,"" she said. ""We have to learn to look at things in a new way.""nr/jhb/sst"

We've had enough of those, really . Newage eateries are using a host of exciting ingredients from across the world and far-flung corners of our country  from Bulgur wheat to kokum, unagi to chorizo and more -to rustle up lip-smacking delicacies that will leave you surprised, excited and craving for more! Check these out...SRIRACHA, FROM ASIABUFFALO WINGSBODEGA CANTINA Y BARSriracha, a spicy sauce, is definitely one of the biggest food trends in India this year. Sriracha is highly flavoured, and is used extensively in Thai cuisine. For Bodega Cantina's Buffalo wings, they home-make the Sriracha. ""Our Sriracha is inspired by the original and made with different kinds of chilii and vinegars and then fermented for a long time,"" says owner Urvika Kanoi.LAVASH, FROM WEST ASIALAVASH CRACKERSCRAVE FOODWORKSLavash is a kind of flatbread that is widely consumed through the entire region. Though it is commonly believed to be Armenian in origin, food experts also claim that it has Iranian roots.The lavash crackers at Crave Foodworks are a relatively newer take on the soft flatbread, that's crispy and spicy, and can be had with or without dips or sauces. In this restaurant, it is served with classic hummus or labneh.GUNKAN AND NORI, FROM JAPANIKURA GUNKAN MAKIFUJIGunkan maki is a more complex kind of sushi, commonly known as battleship or warship sushi. Ikura, which is salmon roe or the fully ripe egg mass of the fish -just like caviar -is one of the more uncommon soft toppings used to make this sushi. Another uncommon ingredient used is the nori -a Japanese edible seaweed which comes in sheets. If you are all for gastronomic adventures, this one should be on top of your must-check-out list.KOKUM, FROM THE WESTERN GHATSKOKUM RITASPICE KRAFTIf you are a fan of the ubiquitous margarita, but also have a taste for the indigenous, Chef and owner Sambit Banick will recommend to you the Kokum Rita.""To the classic cocktail, we had a very interesting twist -that of the kokum fruit. I get my kokum saar, which is the extract of the Indian fruit from Khamkaar in Mumbai, a very old and well-known shop that stocks all kinds of pickles and spices. It is authentic and we use to it serve our indigenous take on the Margarita,"" says chef Sambit.BULGUR WHEAT, FROM WEST ASIATABBOULEHCALCUTTA STORIESBulgur wheat originated in Bulgaria and is a broken wheat rich in fibre. Bulgur is a common ingredient in Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Syrian, Israeli, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. For Tabbouleh, which is essentially a salad, the wheat is steamed and tossed with three-coloured bell peppers, cucumbers and black and green olives. Now that's what you call a bowl of freshness.CHIA SEEDS, FROM MESOAMERICASUGARFREE FIG AND DATE KULFICAFE PRANAHChia seeds come from a flowering plant of the mint family, which is native to Mexico and Guatemala. Rich in B vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and loads of other healthy stuff, these seeds are traditionally used in drinks and sherbets. At Cafe Pranah, they use it in the sugarfree fig and date kulfi. ""It is a body coolant and adds a beautiful textural contrast to the richness of the kulfi,"" informs Rahul Arora, chef and owner of the cafe.QUINOA, FROM LATIN AMERICAQUINOA SALADHAKUNA MATATAGradually, but steadily, Kolkata is waking up to the quinoa phenomenon. A gluten free, organically grown seed, it is used in food in the capacity of a grain. The history of this seed goes back to the Inca empire, when it was known as the mother of all food, given its nutrient-rich status. At Hakuna Matata, the quinoa salad also has rocket leaves, grilled veggies, tomato, cucumber and pomegranate yoghurt dressing.PS: Nasa scientists are reportedly looking at quinoa as a plant to be grown in space.DUXELLE FROM FRANCE & MIRIN FROM JAPANSTIR FRIED SCALLIONS WITH MUSHROOM DUXELLE, SPICY MIRIN REDUCTIONSPICE KRAFTAt Spice Kraft, chef and owner Sambit Banick makes it a point to mix and marry cuisines. For their stir-fried scallions and mushroom duxelle, with spicy mirin reduction, the marriage is between classic French duxelles and a spicy Asian sauce. For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.WILD RED RICE, FROM NORTHEAST INDIAWILD RED RICESANTA'S FANTASEAA tribal dish, the wild red rice is big in the northeast food scene. It's unpolished, unlike the white rice we commonly use. ""The unpolished dhenki-chhaat chaal is full of nutrients. It might not look very shiny, but it is much better for our health,"" says Kaushik Ghosh, owner of Santa's Fantasea. In this restaurant, it is served with a gravy that is made from traditional northeastern herbs and the superhot bhut jolokia, or raja mirchi, as it is known in Nagaland.CHORIZO, FROM SPAINCHICKPEA CHORIZOBODEGA CANTINA Y BARA Spanish pork sausage, chorizo is increasingly becoming one of the staples at new-age restaurants in Kolkata. It is spicy, made from coarsely ground pork and seasoned with chili and paprika. It is widely used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. ""Chorizos are centuries old, but it is relatively new on India's palette. We buy it from a Spanish couple in Bangalore, who make the chorizos themselves, to preserve the authentici ty. The spicy pork goes wonderfully with the flavours of chickpea, and present it as tapas,"" shares Urvika Kanoi, head chef and owner of Bodega Cantina Y Bar.CHIMICHURRI, FROM ARGENTINACHIMICHURRI PRAWNSSMOKE HOUSE DELIThis is an Argentinian sauce, which is used as a dip with fried fish or grills. In Smoke House Deli, they make it from scratch, which is their take on the original chimichurri, and use it as a marinade for prawns.""The prawns are marinated in this sauce for 30 minutes, before being grilled and baked,"" said head chef Fatik Mir. Apart from infusing the prawns with a burst of flavours, the vibrant green chimichurri contrasts with the slight pinkish shade of the prawns.UNAGI, FROM JAPANUNAGI NIGIRIFUJISorry to burst your bubble, but Unagi is not the total state of concentration that Ross of FRIENDS claimed to have mastered. It is actually a freshwater eel that is a very common component of Japanese seafood. If that makes you squeamish, remember that Fuji uses this fish with wasabi, gari, rice and sushi vinegar to make a nigiri, which is also another form of sushi. Not take a look at the plate, doesn't this look like art on a plate?RIBOTIDE, FOOD ADDITIVENACHOS WITH CHEESE SAUCECREAM CENTREThe controversy surrounding MSG, a flavour enhancer widely used in southeast Asian cuisine, came as a huge blow to Chinese restaurants and food manufacturers. But then, as they say, when one door closes, another opens up. So now there are powder flavor enhancers in the market, known as Ribotides. These can be used in a way similar to MSG and are considered safe. It is a Japanese derivative and is used in the cheese sauce of Cream Centre, which is served with their nachos. Though the nachos cheese and mozzarella cheese here are both customized with secret ingredients, at least we know that they use a highly expensive flavour enhancer, which accounts for their huge fan following!COUSCOUS, FROM NORTH AFRICAVEGETABLE TAGINE WITH COUSCOUSTHE FACTORY OUTLETCouscous has been a part of Kolkata's menu for quite some time now. However, with the trend moving from traditional grains such as wheat and rice to uncommon ones such as quinoa and buckwheat, couscous is also getting its share of limelight. A traditional North African dish, it is made of moulds of semolina and flour. A dish in itself, more and more restaurants are deconstructing it to suit Indian palettes. It can be served with broth, veggies or meat. Sometimes it's had just by itself -a bowl of comfort food. For the veg tagine with couscous at The Factory outlet, they serve the steamed dish with preserved veggies."

58f68b2e7be9e031f13b6fd9,Donald Trump's diet: He'll have fries with that,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Donald-Trumps-diet-Hell-have-fries-with-that/articleshow/53611093.cms,2016-08-09,,The Times Of India,"NEW YORK: President Barack Obama is so disciplined that his wife has teased that he eats precisely seven lightly salted almonds each night.George W Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.But Donald Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation's fast food president.""A 'fish delight,' sometimes, right?"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town-hall-style meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald's. ""The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It's great stuff.""Trump's presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent.And so is his diet.In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn't have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House.But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Trump has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation  devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal), feasting on a McDonald's burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican presidential nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters).He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (""It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,"" his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See's Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol.But his highbrow, lowbrow image  of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seat belt buckles  is also a carefully crafted one.If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting ""a splash"" more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Trump's diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them.""There's nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,"" said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. ""It is the peculiarity of the brand that he's able to be on his multimillion-dollar jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC  and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal.""Or, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign, put it, ""It goes with his authenticity.""""I don't think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye's biscuits and fried chicken,"" she said.Last April, Clinton did, indeed, visit a Chipotle near Toledo, Ohio, stopping into the chain restaurant unrecognized, in black sunglasses, and ordering a chicken burrito bowl.And President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation's first fast food commander in chief, famous for ending his jogs at McDonald's. (Bill Clinton now adheres to a largely vegan diet.)Still, Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely.While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life  Mitt Romney's 2012 press corps coined the term ""slunch"" to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the ""second lunch""  Trump's reliance on high-calorie fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness.Though he often orders from the Trump Grill when working out of Trump Tower in Manhattan, he eats fast food several times a week while on the road because ""it's quick,"" as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger King on his Boeing 757-200.Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. ""We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table,"" he said.A man always prone to distraction and uninterested in small details, he has never approached food as anything other than a problem to be solved, quickly, as Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, an occasional dining partner, once told The Washington Examiner.As the two men ate at Jean-Georges in Manhattan in 2002, Trump ordered briskly and imperiously from the head chef and owner, Christie recalled. ""Jean-Georges, remember the appetizer you made for me last week when I was here?"" Trump asked the owner. ""We'll take two of those. And remember that main course you made, the special thing you made for me? We'll take two of those, too.""Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled. Trump looked at him and said, ""Don't worry, you'll love it.""But Trump, who frets about germs, also loves fast food because of the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene.""One bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald's,"" Trump told Cooper of CNN. ""I like cleanliness, and I think you're better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food's coming from.""Still, he added, ""I think the food's good.""Trump's dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism  the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan's glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the borough's haute cuisine.He once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a pizza restaurant in Times Square  and then proceeded to cut his slice with a plastic knife and fork.The Republican nominee's dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches  but also where to find the nearest drive-through.""There's never any real planning for food,"" said one. ""It's always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald's."""

Her victory in the women's singles event semi-final match against world No 5 Nozomi Okuhara of Japan on Thursday was savoured by countless people who sat glued to their TV screens and are now cheering for the ace shuttler to beat world number 1 Carolina Marin.But behind's successful run and turnaround from a mild-mannered shuttler to a hungry-for-win, roaring player is her coach and former badminton player Pullela Gopichand. He was earlier the coach of another Olympian Saina Nehwal who won a bronze medal at the London Olympics in 2012 but after the end of their partnership, Gopichand has focussed his energies on scouting for other players who can raise India's flag globally. And he catches them young.Gopichand is a tough taskmaster who always keeps pushing his pupils to achieve great heights.

However, for many from the community, who have made Pune their homes for several years, Durga Puja is no different. During the five days of Durga Puja, pockets of Pune shine like Kolkata, with as much grandeur as the City of Joy, giving Puneites a glimpse of what it feels like to be in Kolkata during Durga Puja. Greasy rolls and mishti to gorge on, pushpanjali and endless adda, the community lets people soak in as much Bengali-ness as they want in these five days. And ahead of the festivities, here's a look at the oldest Durga Puja pandals of the city that kick-started the celebrations in town.The Pune Kali Bari Durga Puja, as it is known now, began in 1939. Seventy-seven years ago, there weren't as many Bengalis in town, as there are now, but enough to start the first puja of Pune. Anup Dutta , from the Pune Kali Bari Durga Puja association, shared, ""In the 1930s, there were a lot of Bengali doctors and armed forces personnels who stayed in the Khadki cantonment area. They were mainly employed under the government and as it was difficult to go back to Bengal every year during that time, they began celebrating Durga Puja in a small school in Khadki.""Not all from the community could attend the festivities in Khadki back then. So, it was decided, that the Durga Puja will be held in the city area (the present Pune Municipal Corporation which was a barren land then) every alternate year. ""This is how the other oldest puja of the city, Congress Bhavan, came to existence,"" Dutta added. The celebration at these venues, every alternate year, continued till the 1960s, when Bangiya Sanskriti Sansad (erstwhile Congress Bhavan) branched out to have their own Durga Puja, without losing its essence. Bireshwar Mitra, president of BSS, said, ""As I get to know from my predecessors, the Durga Puja, that began with few people, gained popularity in no time. Gradually, more people settled at various parts of the city and branched out with their own Durga Puja celebrations at several corners."" With over 30 Durga Puja pandals in the city, a majority of them owe their allegiance to Pune Kali Bari and Congress Bhavan Durga Pujas.With carrying forward the legacy of puja celebrations, generations have also passed on their secrets when it comes to making the bhog for goddess Durga. The simple plate of khichudi, sabzi, kheer and tomato chutney, a quintessential Bengali's must-have during Durga Puja, has been passed on for generations in Pune, miles away from Bengal. ""Until very recently bhog was cooked with woodfire. But, with popularity, we switched to cooking gas. Like it was decades ago, the bhog comprises of khichudi, labra, payesh and chutney. We offer pulao to the goddess on Saptami, which is also served to devotees on this day,"" shared Dutta. Incidentally, the cook hasn't changed in Pune Kali Bari, for over a few decades now. It is no different in Congress Bhavan. ""As a tradition there are two types of bhog that are prepared. One is special for the goddess, which is made by the ladies of the association and offered to Durga. Later the part of this bhog is added to the bhog prepared as a prasad to devotees,"" said Madhumita Ghosh , a member of BSS.(With inputs from Anup.Satphale@timesgroup.com)"

One can just insert Rs.10 note and choose a code number for the specific seed and collect the seed packet dropped into a box. A salient feature of the facility is that one can even get minimum quantity of seeds required as people are forced to buy at least half a kg of seeds - over and above their requirement, according to Dean P. Pandiyarajan.The university has introduced the vending machine for supply of quality seeds produced by it in major towns and cities in the State. The first machine was commissioned on its campus in Coimbatore. The machine has a capacity to stock 1,800 packets of seeds and the university, to start with, has stocked 460 packets.The seeds dispensed by the machine included tomato (PKM); tomato hybrid (CO3); brinjal (CO2); Amaranthus; Bindi hybrid (OBhH1); cluster beans (PNB); chillies hybrid (CO1); and bitter gourd (CO1).The machine will update details of sale of seeds to the Seed Centre unit of the university. In case of demand for a particular seed, the machine would immediately alert the TNAU authorities through an SMS. Also, in case of any attempt to damage it, the machine would alert the police and TNAU authorities.The machine has a video screen through which farmers and members of the public are informed about latest research and development activities of the university. The service will facilitate residents in urban areas to buy quality seeds throughout the year, he said. The machine is refrigerated and maintained at 4 degrees Centigrade to preserve the seeds.Minister for Agriculture R. Duraikannu inaugurated the machine during his recent visit to the institute."

Each model has stood the rigours of previous competitions at the zonal level. As one walks along the aisles set up behind the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (VITM), it becomes obvious that the models reflect the issues that afflict their districts.Take for instance, the low-cost farming techniques showcased by Shravani P., a Standard X student of Chinmaya Vidyalaya in Kolar district where a persistent drought has turned the lives of many farmers upside down. Displaying multiple systems, including plants in artificial foam floating on water and a bubblephonics system to induce air bubbles into the water, she says productivity can be doubled and water consumption reduced.

""All three are out of danger and will be treated for another couple of days,"" doctors told police.After shifting their family members to the hospital, Rekha and Hemalatha went to the police station and filed cases. Rekha, in her complaint, accused Suhas of misbehaving with her minor daughter and police booked Suhas under IPC section 354 (outraging modesty of woman). Hemalatha accused Shivaram of threatening her and he was booked under IPC 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 337 (causing hurt by endangering act).According to police sources, Hemalatha and Rekha had earlier approached police seeking their intervention. ""Since it was a civil matter, we had directed them to advocates. After a few sittings, Rekha and Hemalatha had agreed to settle matter and the final talks were scheduled to Saturday. But everything went wrong on Friday night,"" sources said."

Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) have answered this and other zero-gravity gardening conundrums by growing the first flower in space.The orange zinnia looks like a daisy and has a reputation for being one of the easiest flowers to grow on Earth. In space, though, it was a challenge getting it to sprout.The flowers seemed doomed in December after four plants developed mould. But at the weekend, U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly, who has been taking care of them, tweeted a photo of a solitary blooming zinnia with the Earth in the distance behind it, with the hashtag #SpaceFlower and the words: Yes, there are other life forms in space!The flower is part of a wider attempt to grow food in orbit, using Nasas plant growth system Veggie, which was delivered to the ISS in April 2014. The Veggie team has already enjoyed a successful lettuce harvest and plan to have tomatoes too by 2017. Ultimately, the hope is to make possible a sustainable food supplement for a future manned mission to Mars.But space gardening is plagued with problems, including high radiation levels and temperature extremes. Fortunately, with the ISS in a low orbit, the Earths magnetic field shields plants from the worst radiation effects. Inside the station, the atmosphere can be tightly controlled.Experimentation onIts a relatively nice environment, with heat and humidity control, says professor Dhiren Kataria, who builds space instruments at University College Londons Mullard Space Science Laboratory, and is working on a new project to study the survival of seeds in space in collaboration with the seed bank at Kew Gardens.Its quite significant that we can do this now, says Prof. Kataria. If we can grow flowers, it helps in terms of the pollination process. And if you want a sustainable environment, you need cross-pollination. Plus, of course, nothing brightens up a space station like a nice bunch of flowers.   Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016"

A rich symphony of flavour, texture and spice, this repast will leave your table looking like a 'sufachat maidan'!Weddings or family celebrations; this sweet is specially prepared on auspicious occasions. Traditionally served with sweet curd (or mithoo dahi), the roasted vermicelli and dry fruits conjure up some magic in the presence of pure ghee. We particularly love the version available at Rustom Restaurant, MG Road, where it will feature as part of a larger New Year menu.Crisp outside and succulent within, the dish epitomises Parsis' love for all things eggy and meaty. Marinated in the goodness of chillies, garlic and garam masala, the tenderly-spiced chicken, balanced out by its lacy egg coating, is a story to experience with all your senses. Most Parsi joints serve this deep-fried delicacy, but we recommend sampling it at The Food Gallery, Lullanagar.A favourite at navjotes, fresh pomfret is smeared in rich green chutney and wrapped in banana leaves. The little parcels that are steamed to perfection are a poetic confluence of flavours. You must try this one at Dorabjees & Sons in Camp, where they bake the fish before steaming it to retain the firmness outside and succulence within.Hailing from the Persian scullery, this rich onion-tomato gravy of juicy prawns is a patent preparation especially during weddings. Served with maura dal chawal, most Parsis will have fond memories of their mamaijis preparing this comforting meal from a recipe passed down in the family. Relish it at King's, East Street.Ah, the much loved wedding custard! Milk, sugar and eggs, enhanced with hints of cardamom and nutmeg, come together for a perfect tribute to the newly-weds. Baked, don't confuse this with the steamed caramel custard. Oh, the joy of cutting through and tasting the firm top layer, down to the rich and creamy bit!"

After 10 days of prayers for muktad, Zoroastrians around the world are celebrating Parsi New Year with much gaiety and joie de vivre. Mumbai, which has a sizeable population of this vivacious community, will witness hordes of Parsis visit one of the many agiaries that dot South Mumbai  from the sea-swept Seth Jeejeebhoy Dadabhoy Agiary at Colaba to the grandiose Wadiaji Atash Behram at Princess Street and the Behram Baug agiary in Jogeshwari.Mumbai has 47 fire temples in all and you will see the Parsis dressed in their Navroze finery, thronging the sandalwood shops outside these fire temples, greeting and merrily wishing each other Navroze Mubarak . The day begins by waking up early, bathing, wearing new clothes and faithfully making a trip to the agiary to seek Ahura Mazda 's blessings. Entrances to homes are decorated with colourful chalk (rangoli), incense sticks are burned in the house, doorways are bedecked with fresh, colourful flowers and sprinkled with rose water.For Parsis, celebrating New Year is about eating scrumptious food and spending time with loved ones. The festivities kick off with a hearty breakfast that comprises Parsi Sev (sweet vermicelli) or Rava, which is sprinkled with almonds, raisins and rose petals, sweet curd, Parsi Poro or the Akuri.Lunch is a more elaborate affair with Sali Boti and Dhan Dal Patia with rice. The patia can be pomfret fillets or prawns, in tomato gravy. Some families prefer to have Mutton Dhansak  the Parsi rice and masala dal speciality along with spiced meat kebabs and kachumber. Beer, of course, is a must! Jalebi, Sutarfeni and Kulfi help finish off the meal.While the recent Akshay Kumar release is wooing the genteel community with its portrayal of controversial KM Nanavati case, there are a number of Parsi naataks and musicals that are also vying for attention.

Cold crops such as guavas are now being sold for Rs 40 per kg at the Koyambedu wholesale market.The prices had been dropping for the past few days at the Koyambedu market. Traders said that with Diwali round the corner, people were buying vegetables in large quantities.Added to this, the increase in yield too has contributed to the drop in prices.The prices are bound to fluctuate depending on the sales. Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association advisor V R Soundararajan said, ""The delta regions are suffering from drought due to shor tage of Cauvery water and farmers have stopped cultivating long term crops like paddy and turmeric. They are now looking at cultivating short term crops such as tomato, onions and other vegetables. With the rich yield, the prices could drop further.''Chennai gets its share of tomatoes, beans, carrots, cabbages and cauliflower from Karnataka, while a large quantity of coconut, lime and raw banana and other veggies makes its way to Bengaluru from Chennai.

In Goa, too, rice, in all its forms is a much-loved carb. While most people will swear by a good fish thali as the perfect lunch-time indulgence, rice in its other forms, is just as popular as a breakfast cereal or a tea time snack or even a post- meal sweet indulgence.Be it savoury or sweet preparations, beaten rice (fov) and puffed rice (chirmulleo) are a staple of most Goan kitchens. Pradnya Keni Naik lists out a host of traditional delicacies she makes using beaten rice. ""The all-time favourite undoubtedly is the godd fov made using beaten rice and jaggery. That apart, some of the other popular fov delicacies are batat fov, dudantle fov and rosantle fov,"" she says.The main difference between dudantle fov and rosantle fov is that while the former is made using milk, coconut milk forms the base for the latter. ""Also, in the coconut milk-based preparation, a turmeric leaf is used as a flavouring,"" Naik says.The key point to remember while making either of these two, Naik says, is to keep a little of the milk aside. ""The beaten rice is like a sponge and soaks up all the liquid. Hence, just before serving it up, the dish needs to be topped up using the liquid that is kept aside,"" she says.""Yet another popular savoury snack made using beaten rice is the tikhat fov,"" says foodie Neelam Dutta. Calling it one of her favourites, Dutta says that while most people these days make the dish using store bought beaten rice, using the traditional fullayle fov or rice that is puffed up using hot sand gives the dish an altogether different dimension. The other ingredients that constitute this dish are fine chopped green chillies, spice powders such as pepper, fenugreek, ginger and red chilly and dal or nuts for garnish.Puffed rice laddoos are one of the old favourites that homemaker Urvija Bhatkuly prepares. ""The dish comprises just two ingredients  the puffed rice and melted sugarcane jaggery. It is both, a tasty as well as healthy indulgence. Also, during the festival of Diwali, on the day of Laxmi puja, puffed rice with a dash of jaggery is served as Prasad,"" she says. Bhatkuly also combines puffed rice with jaggery (for sweetness) and tomato (for a dash of sourness) and serves it to her family as a breakfast dish."

Keshava, who grows tomato in 30 guntas of land, has earned about Rs. 3 lakh in the last couple of weeks thanks to a sudden surge in the price of tomatoes.Five months ago, tomato growers in Salagame hobli of Hassan, were forced to sell tomato at as low as Rs. 20 per bag of 15 kg. Many growers threw tomatoes on the road and distributed it to the public free of cost. Things have changed now. We have never got this kind of price in the past for tomato, Keshava said. He has spent about Rs. 50,000 to grow tomato. He has so far sold 1,000 bags this season alone. The highest price he got was Rs. 700 per bag.Tomato is sold at anywhere between Rs. 60 and 80 per kg in cities like Bengaluru. Merchants, who purchase the produce from farmers in small towns, take it to big cities.We carry our produce to the market in Hassan once in two days. It is true that we may get a better price if we carry them to Bengaluru. But, it is difficult to travel to Bengaluru, said Somashekhar, a tomato grower.One of the reasons for this sudden surge in the price is scanty rainfall in many tomato growing areas. Many growers in Halebid hobli of Hassan suffered loss as there was no sufficient yield due to deficient rainfall.Only those farmers with private borewells could get a decent yield. With good care and sufficient water, a farmer can produce up to 2,000 bags (each of 15 kg) in one season.We would be happy even if we get up to Rs. 150 per bag. But, we dont get it all the time. The retail sellers get better margin than us. In this season, we have sold tomato for Rs. 300 to Rs. 700 per bag. Whatever we earn, we spend it back on the field and try to improve its productivity, Somashekhar said.The growers find it difficult to protect the crop from diseases during the rainy season.We can get a good crop only if we apply medicines regularly. We spend a lot on medicines, besides the labour, said Puttaraju, who has grown tomato in 10 guntas of land."

There was an immediate impact in the number of people requesting entry visas to travel to Spain, the director of the London office of Turespana, Enrique Ruiz de Lera, who led the agency's talks with the producers of the movie, told AFP.The year after its release, 60,444 Indians visited Spain, nearly double the 2011 figure, according to the industry and tourism ministry. Last year 85,000 Indians visited Spain.The movie that did itLonely Planet in 2013 launched a guide to Spain aimed specifically at the Indian market and travel agencies still advertise tours to the locations featured in the Zindagi movie.Indias ambassador to Spain, Vikram Misri, said the film was single-handedly responsible for making Spain a household name in India and increasing tourism from India.Turespana suggested locations for filming but gave no direct financial aid to cover the cost of making the movie, Ruiz de Lera said.Instead it helped secure permits to film at key sites and negotiate deals on hotel rooms and transportation for the crew to lower production costs.We helped a lot with contacts so filming in Spain was easy, Ruiz de Lera said.In return the producers of the film agreed to include a short advertisement before the start of the movie promoting Spain by award-winning Spanish director Julio Medem.Spain and India signed a film coproduction agreement the year after Zindagi was released.Turespana regularly takes part in film location fairs in India to pitch the tax breaks and other incentives available to movie producers who shoot in Spain.Since Zindagi , another five or six Indian films have been shot in Spain although none was as popular at the box office.

In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

A kilo of tomato at Bowenpally market was around Rs. 25 a kilo while Rythu Bazars also sold without hike on Friday. Additionally, quantity of arrivals at these markets belies production shortage which retail and farm sources claim.Gajanand, a wholeseller at Monda Market, attributed increased price to stock shortage as production was hit by pre-monsoon rains in Kurnool and producing regions in Telangana including those in Karimnagar.We are now getting our stock from Nasik and Bengaluru. The price last week was Rs. 35 per kilo, he said.Price of green chilli too has shot up in retail stores but larger markets are continuing to sell stock at half the price. While Gajanand said the price of green chilli was Rs. 70 a kilo, an employee at a retail store in Sainikpuri informed the price was hovering at Rs. 130. Shrivatsa Ganeriwal, a techie-turned-farmer, blamed the harsh March heat for a poor tomato harvest in June. It takes tomato seeds 90 to 120 days to reach harvest. A poor yield now implies inappropriate conditions at the time of sowing, combined with erratic rains in May. On my farm, we had to clear the last produce without selling it and plant afresh as the crop yield was very poor, he said."

Regular visitors to these vans include daily wage earners and office-goers. On any given day, the customers are able to choose a variety and have a sumptuous meal at an affordable price.The minimum we charge is Rs. 20 a plate. We serve a wide range of food items - tomato rice, curd rice, vada. We have it all, says Saraswathi, who is part of a self-help group that prepares and sells food out of mobile vans. The food is prepared at home, loaded in large containers, and taken to different locations.The sales used to be high when the concept of selling food out of vans started in the city. But now-a-days we are facing stiff competition. Nevertheless, we usually have an agreement among ourselves not to sell the same item, says the driver of a food van near GKNM Hospital. Another problem that the owners of these vans face is packets that remain unsold.They also say that sales are usually low during the summer months compared to the rest of the year. We get about 70 customers a day. The group members invested the initial funds. After that, they received financial support from the government. Now, it is a profitable venture, says Saraswathi.There are about 2,000 such vans in the city and many of them are run by women self-help groups. They need to get a licence for this from several departments. In any given location, only one mobile unit functions within one km radius.A. Mujibur Rahman and G. Shakila Begum, a couple from Edayarpalayam, sell food packets near Nehru Stadium. The concept of selling food packets in a mobile van started in the city a decade ago. It is becoming popular now as customers get a wide variety at prices lower than that of hotels, says Ms. Begum. Since food is prepared and served by a group or a family and there is a continuous demand, it is a profitable venture, she says.Like hotels, we do not need tables, chairs and fans. That is the reason why the price is lesser by Rs.5 to Rs.10 compared to hotels and we will not function on Sundays, she adds.Some serve non-vegetarian dishes too. At the beginning, we would cook meat around three kg. But customers order biryani more than any other variety, and now we cook 10 kg of meat every day.Some vans donate the remaining food to non-government organisations for distribution to the needy.(With inputs fromS.

Vegetables and spices are stored in steel utensils covered with plastic sheets to preserve their taste and flavour. Hands are washed with liquid soap. At the counter outside, two servers ladle vegetables or meat in a thick, oil-free gravy onto plates, while the fresh, hot chapattis pile up on dishes behind them. In the eating area, four men with gloves on wheel trolleys down the aisles between tables, clearing leftovers.If the description evokes a swanky eatery, think again; this is the Mumbai Polices new canteen in the recently inaugurated new headquarters building of the Mumbai Police that is currently breaking stereotypes.Mumbai Commissioner of Police D.D. Padsalgikar says, The idea was to provide healthy food for personnel working on the headquarters compound and nearby establishments, and any personnel posted on duty nearby or visiting the compound. A large number of our personnel suffer due to unhealthy food, and many of them dont have a lot of options. We are starting with this canteen and are planning to implement the same model in other police canteens.Senior Police Inspector Dilip Shinde, under whose supervision the canteen operates, adds, We have hundreds of police personnel coming in every day for breakfast, lunch and snacks in the evening , and the food is a runaway hit. With minor changes to our methods, we have ensured tasty yet healthy food.The canteen is managed by a 10-strong team of police personnel who oversee procurement and preparation, hygiene and day-to-day work. Instead of using readymade flour, we buy wheat in bulk and get it ground at flour mills near the headquarters. Vegetables and meat for the day are personally selected and bought every morning, instead of contracting a supplier and leaving quality to them, Head Constable Sanjay Patil said.The kitchen staff comprise relatives of policemen and contract workers from the catering industry, all trained by Rajendra Mahadik, a sous chef with the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Colaba.Mr. Mahadik says, The first thing I did was to take the canteen staff to our hotels kitchen to show them our methods. For the next six days, I taught them how to cut down on the two chief ingredients that lead to health problems if taken in excess: oil and salt. I taught the cooks little tricks like adding lesser amounts of salt to plain rice, as it is going to be consumed with dal or gravy.The staff are also instructed to clean the exhaust grills regularly to avoid fires due to a build-up of oil residue, and using different amounts of ingredients like onion, tomatoes and coconut for the same dishes to lend a different taste to the gravy. Wives of the police top brass, including those of Mr. Padsalgikar and Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti, visited the canteen and instructed the staff on the importance of hygienic and healthy food.The evening menu included samosas and onion pakoras. We dropped the samosas and replaced them with grilled vegetable sandwiches. The canteen makes it so well that a lot of us, including myself, order them regularly in the evening, Mr Bharti said.The response has been tremendous, especially during lunch among policemen, particularly constables. I have been conscious of the hygiene of the place I am eating in, and the new canteen ensures cleanliness, said Constable Shashikant Gangawane, posted at the headquarters."

However, these crops are unlikely to be recommended for release anytime soon, officials told The Hindu .As part of an ongoing case on GM crops in India, a Supreme Court Technical Expert Committee has already recommended a ban on HT crops.A coalition of activists, opposed to GM crops, proffered evidence to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) on Monday to show that GM mustard being tested was not superior in yield to existing mustard varieties.Weve heard them out and a sub-committee will look into the concernsbut these are not HT crops, said a GEAC official privy to the discussions. One of the genes is a marker used to differentiate hybrids from non-hybrids. It wont require more or less chemicals than existing mustard varieties, the official said.Beyond GEACs scopeAnother official, who also did not want to be identified, said issues of yield were beyond the scope of the GEAC. There are already other committees [within the agriculture system governance mechanism] tasked with looking at whether their yields are superior or they are fit for commercial release. So far, no fresh tests appear to be needed, the official said. The GEAC is an expert body of the Environment Ministry tasked with assessing if GM crops risk. While the body must approve every application to test GM crops, the most contentious crop on its table now is a type of mustard that contains three genes sourced from soil bacterium.It has had a tumultuous history with activists claiming that it would be a gateway to other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in fields. The GM mustard has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at the Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology."

A total crop area of around 45 acres was covered in which lights were put up at intervals of 60 metres each on bamboo poles at a height of about 8 feet. The lights were placed at the eye level of elephants so that they can see them from a long distance.Elephants did come to the field where paddy followed by cauliflowers, brinjals, tomatoes, potatoes, pumpkins, and bananas were grown. The big mammals kept waiting at a distance from lights, but did not invade the crop field.Similarly, lights were put up during the mango season from April to June 2016 at an orchard spread over 12 acres at Ganjara village near Hindol Forest Range and 20-acre orchard at Patusahi Kateni village in Dhenkanal district.I used to incur huge loss when a big elephant herd used to enter my orchards and damage mango trees. But this year, the lighting system helped keep elephants at bay, said Jugal Kishore Nayak, orchard owner at Patusahi Kateni.The light system has been designed based on our field experience with elephants and their habits. We knew that the elephants will be scared of flashing lights instead of fixed and powerful lights. We developed this design using low power LED bulbs used as strobes and decorative lights, said Biswajit Mohanty, Project Director, WPSI (Wildlife Protection Society of India), who devised the system.We are delighted with the preliminary results but still believe that repeat trials are necessary before we can advise farmers to adopt them, said Mr. Mohanty.He maintained, we will develop a prototype self-contained unit including an in-built solar charger which should be low cost, maintenance free and easily set up with minimum technical support. This should be popularised among affected farmers so that they can sleep peacefully instead of chasing elephants all night.In one worst kind of man-elephant conflicts, Odisha has lost more than 700 elephants and 700 people since 2004. During the same period, elephants trampled ready-to-harvest crops over 90,000 acres of land. The experiment assumes significance as elephants have now started coming out of forest round the year instead of during harvest season in the past."

Rajendran, Deputy Director, Horticulture, said they proposed to cultivate high density mango on 100 hectares, hybrid papaya, introduced for the first time in the district, on 70 hectares and high density guava on 20 hectares. The fruit cultivation would be taken up in S. Pudur, Singampunari, Sivaganga, Kallal and Tirupattur areas.The department, which organised block-level melas in the first week of this month, had selected about 700 farmers, he said adding these farmers were taught canopy management of high density crops in the seminar.The fruit saplings were ready at State Horticulture Farms at Devakottai and Nemam near Kundrakudi and the cultivation would begin in September ahead of northeast monsoon, he said.Mr. Rajendran said the department would organise a workshop on hi-tech horticulture at Kalayarkoil on August 18 to train farmers on cultivation using poly houses, shade nets, plastic mulching (to suppress weeds), anti-bird nets and protected cultivation practices of all crops.He said the department also proposed to cultivate hybrid vegetables, especially tomato, brinjal and green chillies on 120 hectares.The department had readied about 40 lakh seedlings and the farmers would be given an insight into the scheme at a seminar to be held at S Pudur on August 24.The department also proposed to cultivate cashew on about 100 hectares in Sakkottai, Devakottai and Kallal areas this year, he added."

A group of scientists explained the procedure to be adopted to check the wilt.R. Gnanamalar, Professor and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, said brinjal, cultivated on 600 hectares in the district, was prone to bacterial wilt attack. The problem was more pronounced in Vallakulam Kothakottai village near Tiruvarangulam. She said continuous raising of brinjal, without crop rotation technique, often resulted in the problem. She advised farmers to adhere to crop rotation technique by planting cereals such as sorghum or pearl millet (kambu). Maize and cotton could also be raised.R. Manimekalai, Programne Coordinator, said water-logging was another problem leading to the bacterial wilt. She said the bacteria also infected chillies, ginger, radish and tomato crops.A demonstration was conducted in which scientists explained the symptoms of wilt and steps to control them. S.

Babu. The field day was organised by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), whose researchers have developed the hybrid.Arka Rakshak is being sought after by farmers in different States and a few foreign countries owing to its high-yielding potential, wherein farmers have collected 19 kg a plant. Another attraction is its resistance to diseases such as leaf curl virus, bacterial wilt and early blight, which helps reduce cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards cost of fungicides and pesticides, according to scientists. The third advantage is long shelf-life which makes it ideal for long distance transportation.G.

Now, there is no such facility, says B. Narasimhulu, a trader from Sattupalli.Petty vendors worst-hitPetty vendors are the worst-hit.

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMThe soaring mercury levels have made vegetables dearer.Most housewives across the city, who are braving the summer heat in their kitchens, have been forced to contend with the rising price of vegetables. The price of beans has almost doubled in the last one month, while tomatoes, green chilli, capsicum, cabbage, and coriander leaves too have become expensive, according to sources in HOPCOMS (Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society) in Mysuru.Worse, housewives find the shelf life of vegetables annoyingly short. Many vegetables become dry and tasteless within 24 hours, particularly if they are not refrigerated.Mysuru HOPCOMS president Bore Gowda told The Hindu that the increase in prices and shorter shelf life were a summer phenomenon. Poor rainfall leads to a slump in production.President of the Devaraja Market Vegetable Vendors Association, Dinesh, said there had been a dip in the volume of vegetables arriving in the market, while demand has increased. Most people, including non-vegetarians, preferred vegetarian dishes during summer, he said.Mr. Gowda, however, hoped the prices would come down after the rains."

Today, the Noida boy doesnt want to come down. No, not from the treesfrom the roof of the world. At 23, Arjun has climbed four 8000 metre peaks, a world record, and is now eager to complete the grand slam by scaling 14 such peaks. People often ask me, dont you feel lonely there, I say, I feel at home. My soul takes me there. Here the society has been given to me. Mountaineers get to pick their own social group and then they work towards a common goal, says Arjun, who has just returned from Nepal after climbing Mt. Makalu, the fifth highest mountain in the world.In fact, Arjun says, one of discussions that mountaineers often indulge in is how the society looks at them. People often say why we go through this kind of suffering. I say people in cities lead a physically comfortable life but mentally their lives are stressed. In the mountains, we are physically uncomfortable but there is complete peace of mind. Physical stress will pass but memories will stay forever. We humans dont have the capacity of unlearning experiences. We can pretend but they stay somewhere.Profound words from a boy who refuses to read books because they carry someone elses experiences. It is another matter that he has penned his own experience of scaling the Mount Everest in On Top of the World: My Everest Adventure. Like a character of a page turner, he wants to live a life where every few months he is on the edge, where he doesnt know what lies at the next turn. Like every explorer, I want to be at the outermost rim of the society from where I want to reach where nobody has been there before. Most virgin peaks are in India and if you can climb them, you can name them, gushes Arjun, now sounding more like his age.We meet at Made In India, the fine dining restaurant of Noidas Radisson Blu and one is eager to know what does he eat up there. With watermelon juice in hand, Arjun recounts, the process starts with drinking lots of water to get acclimatised to the low oxygen levels. White ice has lot of air content, so as soon as we reach the base camp we look for blue ice to satiate our thirst. One is expected to drink at least five litres of water a day. Arjun also carries specialised stoves which run on butane gas to heat pre-cooked food and water. The problem is the water has to be boiled and over a period of time it takes away the ability to taste from taste buds. To resuscitate them, Arjun carries his mothers lehsun ka tikhat (garlic chutney), which is super spicy. It has lot of zing. Then I carry namkeen and nutcrackers which are very popular among my fellow climbers from Austria, Spain and China. In return Arjun gets lots of chocolates, which are gold in higher altitude region. Europeans offer exquisite cheese, speck and salami and the Chinese come up with octopus meat and dried fish.Here the chef comes up with non vegetarian kabab platter to spice up our conversation. Arjun starts with galauti and soon polishes off tilasmi mahi tikka as well before telling us how, at times, one has to go back to primitive ways of food collection as well. During the descent from Makalu, when we started from the base camp the weather suddenly deteriorated and the helicopter could not reach us for three days. During this period we had to capture lambs from the wild and consumed fresh mutton to keep going.The real challenge, though, begins once they leave the base camp for the peak. The supply of fresh food dries up and they have to rely on ready-made noodles, dry fruits and chocolates. Here training comes to the rescue as from 10000 to 12000 calories in a day the food consumption comes down to 3000-4000 calories. There is extreme weight loss. The altitude is so severe that you dont like eating. We carry dry fruits and lots of chocolates  things that give instant energy because body needs carbohydrates. In his expeditions, Arjun, trained at Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, has lost 9 to 18 kilos in two months. That is why in my resting period I just eat and sleep, he chuckles.To counter the effect of weight loss on climbing ability, Arjun gains a lot of weight before going for the expedition. It is to ensure that there is no muscle loss. In the training you have to develop muscles and over that the right amount of fat. I gain fat towards the end of the training so that it doesnt stay on the body for long. However, the weight gain should not be at the cost of endurance levels. Thats why all along we try to simulate the environment that my body is going to face at 25-26000 feet. However, in the same vein, Arjun adds that physical exercise can take you only up to a point and after that mind takes over. You cant train for every challenge. After a point you have to leave it for the mind. It does wonders. It defines us as human beings. During the Nepal earthquake, I was on the way to Mt. Makalu and I had only 12 cashew nuts left. I had to convince myself that I have to survive on one nut a day.For him, says Arjun, who also gives motivational talk in corporate houses, a mountain is like a living entity, whom one should not challenge without proper preparation. Has he given them a gender as well? Oh yes! The kind of mood swings they have, they have to be female. Most mountaineers would agree with me. Thats why in Hindu and Buddhist mythology they have been named after goddesses.On the lighter side, Arjun, now digging into jhinga kali mirch, says he often gets fed up with the watery Nepali dal and undercooked vegetables. So the moment I reach home, I ask my mother to prepare karhi chawal and aloo ka parantha. He is adept at cooking as well. I can survive. I am good at curries, something my fellow climbers love to try. Because only Indian curry has tomato puree and ginger paste. But sometimes, it gets too spicy for my Chinese and Spanish friends and they have to often rush to the makeshift loo.After a months break, Arjun will return to training. He is aiming at K2 but before that he wants to climb Kanchenjunga and Annapurna. It is not about the height alone. Climbing a mountain is like solving a puzzle. Over the years, the riddle of Mount Everest has almost been solved. No Indian has climbed K2 yet. In terms of terrain it offers a different kind of challenge. Its base camp is almost 1000 metre lower than of Mount Everests. So you need to have better stamina. Annapurna has a higher fatality rate. There is a gully where avalanches get triggered very easily.Very much like the kulfi on our plate. As I also get to break some ice literally, Pahari, as Arjuns friends call him, has the last word for young climbers. It is not an expensive sport, to begin with. I have done 6000 metre backpack climbs within 10-12000 rupees. Also it is the only sport for which the government has created a separate category. So give it due respect. Dont fake the results and dont depend on sherpas to push you up. It creates a bad name for Indian mountaineering community. In my second attempt at Makalu, I had to return when I was just 60-70 metres away from the peak. I wore a 3D spot detector, so that everybody would know my position. I returned and climbed it on the fourth attempt. In our society, a mountaineers word has lot of respect and we have to live up to it."

Since 2013, scientists have been experimenting with outdoor cultivation at two sites with areas of approximately 550 and 420 square metres in Chongqing, where scientists simulated desert landform conditions.The scientists said the plants survived the heavy rain and high temperatures, the typical climate conditions in Chongqing. The crops, including rice, corn and potatoes, flourished in the converted soil.  PTI"

58f76824a3d24b0b70c3487e,Super sesame,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/super-sesame/article8118802.ece,2016-01-18,,The Hindu,"In Mumbai, sesame comes into its own in til laddoos and chikkis, offered during Sankranti with the words  til gud ghya, god god bola  (eat sweet and speak sweet). But going beyond these popular sweets and the culinary versatility of sesame will thrill the cook in you. Sesame indicum , the cultivated type, which originated in India, continues to be an ingredient of significance today.A wonderful ingredient, sesame is extremely versatile, lending itself to both sweet and savoury dishes. Sprinkle it whole on salads, or knead into chapati dough. Make spice mixes to fortify the flavour and health of your meals. One sprinkle Im hooked to is gomasio, a condiment from Japan, in which toasted sesame is ground coarsely with salt. I just combine coarse sea salt and toasted sesame in a bottle and keep it within reach. Its perfect with anything from a simple bowl of brown rice to salads, noodles, steamed vegetables, even khichdi. Another favourite is the Middle Eastern zaatar (a mix of herbs and spices), a condiment popularly combined with olive oil and smeared on flat bread. Zaatar is also used to flavour meat and vegetables dishes, on labneh (a thick hung yogurt cheese) or fried eggs as a garnish. I toast sesame with dried thyme and salt and grind with amchur instead of the sumac that is traditionally used but not easily found in India. It works perfectly on naans, kulchas, and in raitas. I also like to sprinkle it on chunks of paneer or chicken and grill them.Grinding toasted sesame opens up many more options. Although south India is best known for its use of sesame, I discovered, after I married into a Garhwali family, that the cuisine of Uttarakhand uses a lot of ground sesame in its winter dishes. Crushed sesame adds a nutty accent to lobia khichdi. The piquant khatte aloo is made of potatoes tossed in yogurt, toasted sesame and chillies. And then there is addictive til ki chutney in which toasted sesame is ground with toasted cumin, ginger, green chillies, and the juice of the bada nimbu (large wild lemons that come into season in the winter). Another lovely dish is the earthy pinni ka saag that is made from pinni or compressed seed cakes left over from the oil extraction process of sesame. With the oil removed, these become extremely high in protein and dietary fibre. Grind sesame until it gives forth oil and you get tahini or sesame butter, a staple ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. Stir it into soups, or dips, or add honey to make a quick spread for toast or dip for fruit. I am endlessly confounded that we have been pressing sesame for oil for millennia but never thought of toasting the seed prior to extracting its oil, something that the rest of Asia has savoured for centuries. Toasted sesame oil is the most magical ingredient. The roasting process intensifies the inherent flavour of sesame and is used more as a condiment or flavouring oil. It quickly grows into being indispensible: drizzle over fried eggs, add to vinaigrettes for a delicious variation, swirl a few drops into soups it pairs well with any flavour but is especially good with Asian, tomato and clear soups.And we already know sesames nutty flavours work wonderfully in sweet dishes; our laddoos and chikkis are testimony to this. But sesame is also popular in sweets around the world. In the Middle East you will find sesame halva; which, unlike Indian halvas, come in large dry blocks from which portions are sliced off. They literally melt into a nutty, sweet toffee and glide down your throat. Addictive! In Asian cuisine, a favourite dessert is the sweet black sesame soup of Cantonese cuisine. Asian supermarkets worldwide usually carry instant mix packets but I have made it at home by boiling crushed black sesame or toasted unhusked sesame with water, sweetened with honey or jaggery. It is a great dessert for children.We should be eating a lot more of this super food, not just saving it for festive occasions.If you hate milk like I do, sesame offers a great substitute with three times the calcium content of milk. Plus, one tablespoon of sesame contains 52 calories, 88 mg calcium, 1.3 mg iron and 32 mg magnesium. Why look to the west for health-boosting foods when we are so fortunate in our own home-grown bounty?(The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That )"
58f76b65a3d24b0b70c34a2c,On an organic quest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/on-an-organic-quest/article8635129.ece,2016-05-23,,The Hindu,"Theres an annoying self-satisfied swagger about hipster organic stores; the ones with artfully-lit, Instagram-ready baskets of fastidiously rustic fruit. Exotic vegetables flaunting back-stories more romantic than anything you could ever find on Tinder. Boasting of lovingly hand-pounded, responsibly made, locally-grown, ethically produced, vegan, wild honey-laced breakfast cereals that taste like diligently toasted sand.Lets not even get started on their star customers, swathed in overpriced ethnic handloom, diamonds and self-congratulatory smugness. They dexterously manage to post virtuous Facebook updates about changing the world, one organic carrot at a time, even as they fill their baskets with home-grown quinoa, designer ghee and gently wilting broccoli.Indias burgeoning organic food market, slated to grow by 30 per cent every year, offers wide variety today: ranging from the stolidly indigenous to wildly exotic. With bohemian chic farmers markets springing up in every big city, and swish neighbourhood stores advertising responsibly-grown produce, it has never been easier to eat clean and simultaneously assuage our conscience. After all, if its good for us, it must be good for the planet, right? As for that hefty price tag? Well, clever marketing has us convinced that good food cannot possibly be cheap. Granted, most people who are going organic now are doing it with genuinely good intentions. However, in a trend-obsessed world, it is easy to get overwhelmed.If you truly want to change the way you eat, what should you be looking for? Choitresh Kumar Ganguly of the Timbaktu Collective seems like the ideal person to ask. The collective, which works in over 150 villages in drought-prone Anantapur, has taken unproductive land and, using organic farming, transformed it into fields of flourishing millets over the last 25 years.Ganguly begins by emphasising how important it is to eat food that is indigenous. Millets, for example. Foxtail barnyard millets grow in high-lying marshes as well as low-lying deserts. They are climate-resilient and can survive on very low rainfall. Since these are local species, theyre also rarely attacked by pests.As for that organic quinoa, carefully imported and grown in India? Its all bull, he snorts. Thats the tragedy of us Indians. We dont give importance to what we already have.Remember that any imported seed needs protection, since it is not naturally immune to the local environment and pests. Over a few thousand years, they become resilient, like our chillies, potatoes and tomatoes. But in the meantime, it may destroy a lot of our vegetation by activating pests, or affecting our pollination system.So how do you define organic? The primary meaning, to me, is when all the inputs are produced by the farmer himself or herself. From seed to fertilizer to pesticide everything.After all, natural is an easy term to manipulate: bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides are technically natural too. When the farmer controls the entire process, using dung from village cattle, neem cakes and local earthworms, its a simpler, cleaner, and more straightforward process. It also means that the farmer has full control. Sovereignty is what is important here.Your next step? Cut out the middleman. As a consumer, you should know who is producing your food. Most of the people selling organic food are aggregators; they have little or no contact with the actual farmers. Conventional certification is not always reliable. We have been fighting against third-party certification. All kinds of scams can happen and it is very expensive.Instead, they use a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) where groups of farmers guarantee each others produce. (The Government of India has recently introduced PGS as well.) So look for PGS on produce that you buy.Even better, get to know your farmer. Its increasingly easy these days, as more urban city slickers are swapping their laptops for shovels.Like 51-year-old S. Madhusudhan, who gave up a high-powered corporate career to start a farm six years ago in Bengaluru, after he collapsed in his office. That was my wake-up call, he says, discussing how he taught himself organic farming. My best teachers were Google, Wikipedia and YouTube. Over the past six years, he has tended about 200 acres at Back2Basics, lavishing his land with equal amounts of care and gobar (cow dung) slurry. We use about 24,000 litres of gobar slurry per acre. We use oil seed cakes made with neem, honge and sesame. We used a bore, and struck water at 550 feet. Today, after rainwater harvesting, its risen to 50 feet. I truly believe that the land returns what you give to it. Economically, he says, there is no reason for organic food to be more expensive. I sell a coconut at Rs. 19. The market price is Rs. 30. How do I do it? I just cut out the middleman.His farm has been so successful that he recently launched a service supplying customers with freshly-harvested produce.

The bunny was born of South African apartheid, a time when blacks and whites werent allowed to dine together. It took the enterprising wiles of an Indian businessman in Durban to invent the bunny chow, a cheap, nourishing take-away dish for poor black customers.

Nestled within each plump, meticulously-braided crescent of pizza dough is a mound of mozzarella and tomatoes; the whole thing is then baked until the crust turns pale gold in colour. The beauty of the calzone is that almost anything can be used as filling  cold cuts, anchovies, capers, eggs, whatever you like.

Today, of course, hot dog stands are everywhere  at baseball games, at amusement parks, on busy streets, serving juicy pork sausage spiked with garlic and slick with mustard, ketchup and pickle relish, all resting on a cushion of bread. Thats the classic, but wherever you go in North America, youll find different takes: dogs with coleslaw, dogs with chilli sauce, dogs with avocados and refried beans (surprisingly good), even dogs with fries and cheese i.e. a poutine dog if you will. In Mumbai, you get hot dogs everywhere and most come with a sweet relish and caramelised onions such as at Versovas Jam Jar Diner.

Poutines kind of a hot mess (the word literally means mess, a gadbad or ghotala ), a nest of slightly thick-cut fries drenched in an avalanche of warm, brown gravy and cheese curds, and naturally, the best way to eat it is to throw away your fork and knife and plunge your fingers into the scrum.

But it was much later, in the 1940s, that entrepreneurs discovered that the tortilla, when folded over and fried, lasted longer and tasted better. And thus was born the taco of today  a fellowship of wheat or corn flour shell with a heap of charred meat or seafood, smothered in salsa and topped with finely-chopped onion, cilantro and tomatoes.

The reason: prices have hit the roof with a reduction in their arrival into the market.Tomato is a most-used vegetable, like onions, and its skyrocketing prices had made it unaffordable.Drought and extreme heat are stated to be the reasons for fall in production triggering the price rise.Tomato is priced at Rs. 35 a kilo in the wholesale market while it is sold at Rs. 50-60 in the retail market. The hybrid variety costs Rs. 10 more.Some wholesale vegetable merchants said the prices will go further as the supply has been declining.Even the quality of the produce that is arriving to the markets is poor.Villages in a 30-km radius of Mysuru, T Narsipur, parts of Nanjangud, Gundlupet, and Nagamangala are among the prominent tomato-growing areas.Eshwar, a wholesale vegetable trader said, There is a wide gap in the demand and supply and this triggered price rise. Drought and blazing summer heat are to be blamed for the drop in production.Mahadevaswamy, another vegetable dealer, said tomato prices are unlikely to stabilise for the next two months. The prices are on the higher side since over a month.Santosh, who runs a mobile vegetable business, said consumers are bearing the brunt of the price rise. The quantum of purchase had been cut down by the consumers to deal with the price rise.As tomato has minimal shelf life, the retailers are averse to procure the veggie in large quantity over its high price.We dont want to lose and therefore procure tomato in small quantity until the prices stabilise, said a representative of a grocery shop, which also sells vegetables and fruits.Due to the high prices, its use in the kitchen had been cut down and tamarind paste, a substitute to tomato, is being used."

Photo: By Arrangementhe farmers of Akkamapally, who hardly used to make ends meet a decade ago cultivating dry crops, have now transformed their village into an horticulture hub of Telangana State.Thanks to construction of Akkamapally Balancing Reservoir (AKBR) at their village and a good thought by farmer Dereddy Krishna Reddy, considered the father of horticulture cultivation at Akkamapally, the face of the entire village was changed.Ivy gourd is being cultivated in over 80 per cent of the land (400 acres) from where they export vegetables to even Andhra Pradesh markets apart from various parts of Telangana.The farmers have been earning about Rs. 20,000 income a month on each acre of Ivy Guard cultivation. Krishna Reddy, who introduced ivy gourd, is now earning about Rs. 1.5 lakh a month by cultivating the crop on his 10 acres of land.In 2014, the farmers of the village formed Akkamapally Horticulture Growers Society (AHGS) to discuss and deliberate about new crops and market strategies to be adopted to sell their produce at a best price.A team from the village visited the Indian Institute of Species Research, Calicut in 2014 and started cultivating ginger from then on.Speaking to The Hindu , a farmer, Bashapaka Pavan Kumar, said the leaders from Andhra Pradesh had said that Telangana State would face shortage of vegetables once the State was divided. But we have made Telangana proud since we regularly export ivy gourd to Macherla, Narasaraopet and Guntur vegetable markets apart from Hyderabad, Warangal, Khammam, Kalwakurthy, Shaadnagar and Nalgonda, he said.The farmers of Akkamapally rotate crop. According to a rough estimate, the turnover only from ivy gourd cultivation in the village is about Rs. 25 crore in a year.The farmers also cultivate a variety of other horticulture crops such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, chilli, tomato, ginger, drumstick and others. Since the village is located between Guntur and Hyderabad, 100 km away from both the places, the farmers take their produce to markets in either of the places only after enquiring about the market price which avoids any involvement of middlemen.Drawing inspiration from Akkamapally, farmers from neighbouring villages  Medaram, Gudipally, Vaddipatla, G. Bheemanapally, Yellapuram and Polkapally  have also started cultivating various horticulture crops. The village has plenty of water since the construction of AKBR, and the groundwater table has also increased considerably.The AGHS has urged the State government to construct a vegetable market near their village to help them sell their produce apart from building a cold storage to help them store the vegetables, when there is fall in price.Assistant Director, Horticulture, G. Yugandhar and MPDO K. Narasimhulu suggest the farmers from other places in the district to visit Akkamapally village to learn how cultivation can be made profitable."

We see a carnivore ripping apart a rabbit, which we then realise is our protagonist narrating the story. Its a part of a modern-day play and the only animal-killing-animal that happens is on the stage, the only blood being spilled is tomato ketchup. The animal kingdom has left behind its dark, primitive days far behind. The tone of Zootopia is set, unexpected and snappy.The film doesnt take much time to make it clear that everything in it is meant to mirror the society created by humans. This nascent world is peaceful on the surface. But beneath, forces such as fear and prejudices are at play.Our protagonist Judy Hopp is an optimistic, idealistic Disney character (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to make the world a better place. She creates history by overcoming all odds and societal pressures to becoming the first bunny cop. A naive, righteous village girl leaves her native land to go join the police force in the city  the shiny, model city of Zootopia that, amidst its glass and mirror architecture, has districts that maintain controlled natural habitats.An important action sequence, for example, takes place in the Rainforest district. Hopp befriends a fox (Nick Wilde, a rogue character with a heart of gold, voiced by Jason Bateman), who isnt as straight as we think when we first meet him. And then there are battles at the workplace that she faces as a rabbit, especially from her immediate boss Chief Bogo (a buffalo, voiced by Idris Elba) and we read it as a message for sexism.Most of the times, it is fun to see our world through these anthropomorphic characters. Directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush and the writers never allow the material to get too sentimental or saccharine. It is simple, despite the familiar tropes at play, moves briskly and has a progressive intention.The humour, of course, is essential in this kind of a movie. There are the Godfather , Breaking Bad references, there is Zoogle, there are anti-Fox pepper sprays, a sultry pop star Gazelle (rhymes with Adele but voiced by Shakira) and there is also an overtly catholic skunk mafia boss who is served by intimidating polar bears.But the standout set-piece is that the Department of Motor Vehicles is run by sloths. Stepping inside that office means slowing of time. Its a riot when Jude, who has a few hours left to save his job by solving a criminal case, helplessly tries to extract information from an officer. The subtle ironical connection between sloths and superfast cars is later revealed in an expository fashion.In retrospect, questions pop up about the world of Zootopia . Is the entire Zootopia vegetarian? Have they given up on eating fellow animals for the sake of harmony? The only things they are shown eating are carrots and blueberries. The references to the past are at a very broad level  the only thing we are told repeatedly is that predators have sobered over 1,000 years of evolution, that foxes are shifty, and that there is an underpinning tension between the furries and the savage predators.But there is little iceberg beneath these tips, little fictionalised history to this animal world. Humans are never acknowledged. It is a big suspension of disbelief. Neither is this a science fiction film, nor does it have the bite of a satire. Thats the reason Zootopia doesnt go to the wild blue yonder. But we never ask questions while watching it as it is a fun ride.SANKHAYAN GHOSH"

The demand-supply dynamics has been causing misery to the cultivators for a month now.The price has been fluctuating between Rs. 10 and Rs. 5. According to tomato traders, several farmers have left the tomato crop on their fields to wither or let cattle graze on the produce due to the unremunerative price.A daily wage of Rs. 400 has to be paid to a farm worker and the transport costs in addition would otherwise cause heavier loss to the cultivators, a trader said.Horticulture Department officials say the price fluctuation for perishables was not unusual.In the case of tomato, the average cost of cultivation is Rs. 25,000 an acre, and the productivity ranges from 10 tonnes to 12 tonnes an acre. Farmers could evade loss if the price of tomato is in the range of Rs. 10 per kg, but below that level, the loss is bound to be heavy, official sources said.Since the price is Rs. 5 at the retail point, the field rate would not exceed Rs. 3 a kg, thereby pushing the cultivators to distress situation of letting cattle graze on the field rather than spend on harvesting, the sources said, adding that there is no solution in sight since even if the scope processing tomato is explored, the culture of consuming packaged tomato is not prevalent."

Authorities, however, at the time of supply of seed advised farmers not to grow one single vegetable as excessive yield would not fetch them profitable price. They suggested the farmers to plant three to four varieties of vegetables, but to no avail. Deputy Director (Horticulture) N. Sunanda told The Hindu that tomato cultivation increased by 15 per cent in the district this time resulting in more yield. Naturally, the price would come down with more supply. Similar is the case with the onion, she said."

However, the farmers have started using the light trap method to control insects. Many of cereal crops such as sorghum, rice and maize and vegetable crops such as tomato and brinjal attract insects and pests. Horticultural crops and pulse crops also attract insects.Agricultural officials and researchers say that one light trap was enough for controlling most of the insects that might attack the crop. It can be used from the stage of planting to harvest. As per the method, the traps should be placed at a centre of field for three hours between 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., as insects are active mainly during this period.J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur, told The Hindu that light trap was a vital tool to trap both the sexes of insects. It could reduce the carryover pest population substantially. Many farmers in Karur district had started placing light traps to kill insects.P. Baskar, a farmer at Thammanaickenpatti, said that he had raised bitter guard, onion, brinjal and a few other horticultural crops in his field. He had brought his field under the light trap system. He could say that his field was almost insect-free thanks to the light trap.He said he had bought the light for Rs.1500. It was a cheap and effective method to control insects."

The inmates of jails across Telangana will not only access these recipes at `wet canteens that are coming up within the confines but are treated to a variety of items even in breakfast nowadays.Breakfast spreadThe routine 100 gms of khichdi rice which was the only item at breakfast everyday for decades has gone and now the prisoners relish chapatti, tomato bath, upma, puri, pulihora and pongal by rotation during the week. They also get boiled eggs and banana. But, senior jail officials, said the menu is served within the sanctioned budget of 600 gms of rice, 100 gms of dal, 250 gms of vegetables and 30 gms of oil per head per day.To adjust the cost, the jail authorities have restricted the free supply of 175 gms of mutton to one Sunday against two in the past. They are getting 175 gms of chicken for three Sundays. More ingredients like coriander, curry leaves, garlic and chatni were also added to the items in breakfast to make the food tasty.CouponsFor lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before. The same is served in packets of 600 gms for under trial prisoners and 700 gms for convicts the next day. While the under trial prisoners are issued coupons to an upper limit of Rs 3,000 per month, the limit for convicts is only Rs 1,500 a month because the money had to be spent out of the wages earned by them in works assigned while serving sentence.The convicts have to necessarily send 50 per cent of wages to their dependents. In the case of under trial prisoners, the limit is higher as they will be spending from their personal cash that they brought at the time of admission or when their relatives gave them during mulaqat.Small gestureThe Deputy Inspector General of prisons A. Narasimha said the changes in menu were brought about as part of jail reforms in a bid to remove the vengeance among the inmates on having landed behind the bars.He said it was a small gesture to make them at home as their freedom and liberty was already curtailed. The facility was already provided in Tihar jail.For lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before"

We see a carnivore ripping apart a rabbit, which we then realise is our protagonist narrating the story. Its a part of a modern-day play and the only animal-killing-animal that happens is on the stage, the only blood being spilled is tomato ketchup. The animal kingdom has left behind its dark, primitive days far behind 1,000 years of evolution. The tone of Zootopia is set, unexpected and snappy.The film doesnt take much time to make it clear that everything in it is meant to mirror the society created by humans. This nascent world is peaceful on the surface. But beneath it, forces such as fear and prejudices are at play.Our protagonist Judy Hopp is an optimistic, idealistic Disney character (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to make the world a better place. She creates history by overcoming all odds and societal pressures to becoming the first bunny cop. A nave, righteous village girl leaves her native land to go join the police forces in the city: the shiny, model city of Zootopia that amid its glass and mirror architecture has districts that maintains controlled natural habitats.An important action sequence for example takes place in the Rainforest district. Hopp befriends a fox (Nick Wilde, a rogue character with a heart of gold, voiced by Jason Bateman), who isnt as straight as we think when we first meet him. And then there are battles in workplace that she faces as a rabbit, especially from her immediate boss Chief Bogo (a Buffalo, voiced by Idris Elba) and we read it as a message for sexism.Most of the times, it is fun to see our world through these anthropomorphic characters. Director Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush and the writers never allow the material to get too sentimental or saccharine sweet. It is simple, despite the familiar tropes at play, moves briskly and has a progressive intention.The humour of course is essential in this kind of a movie. There are The Godfather , Breaking Bad references; there is Zoogle, anti-Fox pepper sprays, a sultry pop star Gazelle (rhymes with Adele but voiced by Shakira) and there is also an overtly catholic skunk mafia boss who is served by intimidating polar bears. But the stand out set-piece is that the Department of Motor Vehicles is run by sloths. Stepping inside that office means slowing time down. Its a riot when Jude, who has a few hours left to save his job by solving a criminal case, helplessly tries to extract information from an officer. The subtle ironical connection between sloths and super fast cars is later revealed in an expository fashion. But then, that keeps happening through the film.In retrospect, questions pop up about the world of Zootopia . Is entire Zootopia vegetarian? Have they given up on eating fellow animals for the sake of harmony? The only things they are shown eating are carrots and blueberries. The references to the past are at a very broad level: the only thing we are told repeatedly is that predators have sobered over 1,000 years of evolution, that foxes are shifty, cunning and never to be trusted and that there is an underpinning tension between the furries and savage predators.But there is little iceberg beneath these tips, little fictionalised history to this animal world. Humans are never acknowledged here. Its a big suspension of disbelief here and we accept the artifice. Neither is this a science fiction film, nor does it have the bite of a satire. Thats the reason Zootopia doesnt go to the wild blue yonder. But we never ask questions while watching it because it is a fun ride to be in.ZootopiaDirector: Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared BushStarring: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris ElbaRuntime: 68 mins"

But beneath it, forces such as fear and prejudices are at play.Our protagonist, Judy Hopp, is an optimistic, idealistic Disney character (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to make the world a better place. She creates history by overcoming all odds and societal pressures to become the first bunny cop. A nave, righteous village girl leaves her native land to go join the police forces in the city  the shiny, model city of Zootopia that amidst its glass and mirror architecture has districts that maintains controlled natural habitats. An important action sequence, for example, takes place in the Rainforest district. Hopp befriends a fox (Nick Wilde, a rogue character with a heart of gold, voiced by Jason Bateman), who isnt as straight as we think when we first meet him. And then there are battles in workplace that she faces as a rabbit, especially from her immediate boss Chief Bogo (a buffalo, voiced by Idris Elba) and we read it as a message for sexism.Most of the times, it is fun to see our world through these anthropomorphic characters. Director Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush and the writers never allow the material to get too sentimental or saccharine. It is simple, despite the familiar tropes at play, moves briskly and has a progressive intention.The humour, of course, is essential in this kind of a movie. There are the Godfather, Breaking Bad references, there is Zoogle, there are anti-fox pepper sprays, a sultry pop star Gazelle (rhymes with Adele but voiced by Shakira) and there is also an overtly catholic skunk mafia boss who is served by intimidating polar bears.But the stand out set-piece is that the Department of Motor Vehicles run by sloths. Stepping inside that office means slowing time down. Its a riot when Jude, who has a few hours left to save his job by solving a criminal case, helplessly tries to extract information from an officer. The subtle ironical connection between sloths and super fast cars is later revealed in an expository fashion. But then, that keeps happening through the film.In retrospect, questions pop up about the world of Zootopia. Is the entire Zootopia vegetarian? Have they given up on eating fellow animals for the sake of harmony? The only things they are shown eating are carrots and blueberries. The references to the past are at a very broad level  the only thing we are told repeatedly is that predators have sobered over 1,000 years of evolution, that foxes are shifty, cunning and never to be trusted and that there is an underpinning tension between the furries and savage predators.But there is little iceberg beneath these tips, little fictionalised history to this animal world. Humans are never acknowledged here. Zootopia doesnt go to the wild blue yonder. But, we never ask questions while watching it because it is a fun ride to be in.ZootopiaDirector: Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared BushStarring: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris ElbaGenre: Action adventureRun Time: 68 minsStory: A fugitive con artist fox and a rookie bunny cop must work together to uncover a conspiracy"

But, much of the leaves bought for garnishing in households across the State last year could have been contaminated with dangerous levels of pesticide residue.The annual report (2015) of the Pesticide Residue Research and Analytical Laboratory on production and marketing of safe-to-eat vegetables, fruits and food products reveals high levels of pesticide residue in curry, mint and coriander leaves, ie., above the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) prescribed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Vegetable cowpea and yellow capsicum were also found to be carrying abnormally high levels of pesticide residue.Of the 58 varieties of vegetables that were collected for testing from sales outlets in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Malappuram and Kasaragod districts from January to December 2015, only five were found to have pesticide residue exceeding the prescribed limit. As many as 44 vegetable varieties were certified pesticide-free and safe to eat, while nine varieties, including bitter gourd, big chilli, green capsicum, tomato, baji chilli, parsley, green chilli and sambar mix, carried pesticide traces below the permissible MRL.Some pesticides detected in the heavily contaminated samples include chlorpyrifos, ethion, cypermethrin, profenophos, dimethoate, bifenthrin, lambda cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, phorate and malathion. Profenophos is a neurotoxic pesticide, which is banned in Kerala and restricted to tea and cotton in other States, while the others are possible carcinogens.According to Thomas Biju Mathew, principal investigator of the project, a systematic analysis of samples and its publication through the media could have gone a long way in ensuring pesticide safety. With enhanced awareness, farmers today use pesticides more judiciously, he says.With no reference standards, the health hazard caused by pesticide residue in condiments and spices remains unknown.

On an average, transactions involving 150-200 tonnes take place every day during lean season. About 15 tonnes are wasted during loading and unloading.At the same time, farmers dump huge quantities of tomatoes on the roadside when there is a glut.

Among other efforts, it plans to revive karunkanni, a cotton variety getting extinct. It will convert cotton into value-added products, including naturally-dyed yarn, and sell it to other khadi units for cloth production. It has roped in traditional farmers in Athoor and Reddiyarchathiram blocks in Dindigul district to raise this variety. Similar efforts are on to revive 23 traditional cotton varieties throughout the country.These points were highlighted at a workshop on Revival of desi cotton and contemporary khadi held at Gandhigram near here on Monday. Trust secretary K. Siva Kumar said that the proposed facility would procure the entire produce from farmers and add value to it. The main aim was to end farmers marketing problem. This short staple yarn was best suited for producing bandage cloth and bed sheets.The natural dying unit would use cotton to make naturally-dyed yarn to tap emerging markets. Seeds would be supplied to farmers and the unit would act as a full-fledged model centre for organic cotton and value addition. It would also facilitate formation of a federation of desi cotton producers in the State, he added.Ananthoo of TULA Organic Clothing said that 97 per cent of cotton produced in the country before Independence was of traditional variety. The British, who tried to kill native varieties, and introduce foreign varieties could convert just three per cent of farmers. But, after Independence, Indian scientists had successfully killed traditional varieties and converted 97 per cent per cent of farmers into hybrid cultivation. Now, khadi units were using foreign cotton. Production and input costs for traditional varieties were very less when compared to those from Egypt and the US, he added.Other varietiesKrishna Prasad of Sahaja Samrudha, a peoples movement in Karnataka, said that 23 traditional varieties, especially Bengal Desi, Pundur, Kaala cotton, Wagadh, Karunganni, Jayadhar and Pandrapura, were being raised in the country for the past 1,000 years. Efforts were under way to revive these varieties. All Indian varieties had been grown as inter-crop to channa, coriander, chillies, pulses, tomato and onion, he said.Traditional cotton grower Visvasam of Vellode said that 500 acres of karunkanni variety had been raised in Reddiyarchatram and Athoor blocks. Owing to lack of marketing facilities, many farmers had shifted to other crops. These farmers would be encouraged to grow this variety. Besides Dindigul, Karunkanni was grown in Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam only, he added."

Photo: AFPChampion ram King of Oils shows no visible signs of stress before his semi-final fight at the National Stadium in Lagos.The amber eyes of the snow-white ram barely register the raucous crowd 50 metres away but his outward tranquillity belies a tenacity deep within.Three and a half years ago, Dayo Folami bought King of Oils for less than 50,000 naira (Rs. 16,714). Yet today the 39-year-old businessman says the ram is priceless.Ive won a lot of money with the power he has, Folami, wearing a white T-shirt and dark jeans, told AFP at Sundays event. He doesnt give up.What motivates King of Oils to dominate in the ring is a mystery, said Folami. There is no winning secret of rams, you can never force them to fight.It is exactly that innate will to battle that distinguishes ram fighting from other animal sports, Folami said. With eight weight categories and referees, the Ram Lovers Association of Nigeria (RLAM) is working to bring ram fighting into the mainstream by enforcing a strict set of rules to ensure ram safety and fair play.We brought in rules and regulations of different weight categories, just like in boxing, RLAM member Basheer Bash Agusto said. People expect to see fairness.Agusto, the 68-year-old owner of champion ram Little Tiger  who competes in H, the lightest category  said the rams are just like any other athlete.Once identified as a fighter you make sure hes not lacking, Agusto explained, recommending to give him vitamins and clean between the hooves.Agusto, his silver hair in a short mohawk and a thin gold chain necklace, said ram fighting is an escape from daily life in Nigeria, where poverty is endemic despite massive oil wealth. They can't go to the polo club or golf club, never mind the boat club, so here they have an outlet to look forward to.Intimidating namesHundreds of people gathered under a blazing sun to watch the rams fight on a sandy pitch, fenced off with orange and blue rope.Vendors sold popcorn and suya  a salty, spicy grilled meat served with red onions and tomatoes  while contortionists in striped outfits of mustard yellow and lime green performed in front of VIPs sitting in the shade under white tents.Some rams are named after historic warriors (Attila the Hun, Spartacus), while others after devastating diseases (Ebola, Malaria).The Nigerian ram fighting rules state that at the start of a tournament rams are allowed to hit 30 blows before the referee calls a tie. By the finals, rams can headbutt up to 100 times.But sometimes the fight never takes place at all, with unwilling rams high-tailing it to the safety of their owners amid laughs and jeers from the crowd.At stake is a plethora of official prizes ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. More lucrative, however, is the gambling on the sidelines where men bet tens of thousands of naira on rams. After football, this is what brings people together, said ram judging assistant Segun Odulate. If you come here you wont think anything more, youll concentrate on the rams and youll be happy.  AFP"

The sheer diversity on the five-acre farm is mindboggling: carrots, shorgum , broccoli, cabbage, sunflower, pomegranate, wood apples, paddy and millets. Apart from rock salt, we outsource nothing, she adds with pride.A former airhostess and corporate affairs specialist, Sangita started Annadana Soil and Seed Savers in 2001. It is a self-sustaining organic farm in Vidyaranyapura and, probably, the only one within the city, which preserves traditional or 'naati' seeds. Called 'Bheej Behen' for her efforts to preserve traditional varieties of crops, she has spearheaded a movement to empower farmers. Today, 20 farmers and five experts grow 95 varieties of crops and, thanks to proper planning, reap the harvests of three seasons each year. The seed bank has over 200 varieties of traditional vegetable seeds, from black tomatoes to multi-coloured corn, preserved at a cooler temperature.Traditional seeds are those that stand the test of time, says Sangita. Initially, seeds were brought in from all over the world to start the seed bank. Every season, the seeds are tested for performance and yield. The good ones are saved for the next cycle, ensuring that only robust varieties survive. Each year, we donate 35,000 packets of seeds to farmers in distress across the country, she adds.Growing traditional seeds empowers farmers because they need not be dependent on seed companies.Raji, a farmer and a budding photographer, takes pictures of us with an old DSLR camera while we taste the farm-fresh produce.

""You won't find such delicious tomatoes in any store,"" says Sangita.She talks about the Kalam gopis referred to in the Rig Vedas, whom she calls the original seed guardians. They took charge of the land and saved seeds for the next sowing cycle, she says. Perhaps, this explains why most of the farmers in her land are women.

The students and the teachers developed the farm by cultivating it during leizure time and devoting additional effort for developing the farm.Before the farm, the school purchased vegetables from the market for the noon-meals scheme. Slowly, the school started using the vegetables from its own farm.Moreover, students also started cultivating vegetables on their house premises. Parents visited the school to see the vegetable farm and it gave them the confidence of cultivating the vegetables for their needs.The additional vegetables from the school are also given to the students for their household use. It is completely organic and cow dung and decayed leaves are used as fertilisers, said a teacher adding that they received expert opinion on developing the farm.The soil was tested and nutrient elements added as per the advice of the officials of Krishi Bhavan. Now the farm has tomato, potato, beans and cabbages. The main achievement is creating an interest for farming and it did not affect the classes.The school has also applied for the State-level award for best institution that developed a model vegetable farm."

Organic farming exponent and managing trustee of Yasoram ARS Vadhyar said that the project was coming to fruition after an eight-year-long struggle.He said the farming as envisaged by the project was possible even in a household with very little land. Its far less expensive at Rs.535 per household, of which Rs.505 will be borne by the corporation, from its plan fund. Each family is required to spend only Rs.30. While our workers will dig ditches to plant banana and yam alternately, with ginger, tomato, green chilly, spinach, okra and the like in between, all that the consumers should do is to ensure that the daily domestic waste is used as manure, Mr. Vadhyar said. The project, conceived by the Yasoram trust, had received the go-ahead from the district planning committee sometime ago. The seeds and saplings planted are sourced through the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK). The dual advantage of the project is that besides promoting organic, pesticide-free farming, it also ensures effective utilisation and disposal of household waste.Mr. Vadhyar, who has done some pioneering work in spreading organic farming around the city, said there were several easy methods available to get rid of pests including the use of organic solutions like neem oil while ground nut cakes and neem cakes could be used as manure. The plan, he said, was to ensure that people gradually move away from consuming pesticide-ridden vegetables and fruits. Its a culture that we need to foster. Theres no labour on the part of the consumer under this project, except that he/she must make sure to deposit food and other organic waste at this mini veggie farm, he said."

The deceased was identified as Purushottam Dehuri who hailed from Janardanpur village under Sadar Block. According to sources, Dehuri consumed poison on Tuesday night and was admitted to the district headquarters hospital at Keonjhar town. He breathed his last in the morning. The deceased had taken loans amounting to Rs.40,000 from different sources, and had cultivated tomato in two acres of land. But the crop was damaged due to scanty rainfall.Of the three other cases, two were reported from Balangir and Bargarh districts in western Odisha where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally a few weeks ago, and one from Dhenkanal.The State government, however, has not admitted a single such death of farmer to be due to crop loss or debt burden although it has admitted in the State Assembly a few days ago that 175 farmers had committed suicide in the State during 2015-16.Enquiries by the respective district administrations showed that none of the farmers ended their lives due to crop failure, said School and Mass Education Minister Debi Prasad Mishra while making a statement on behalf of Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy in the House. Mr. Mishra had said that the State government was not in favour of giving compensation to families of farmers who committed suicide because the move may encourage others to end their lives. While demanding adequate compensation for the family of the farmers who had committed suicide, the Opposition parties had demanded a change in the method and approach to probe into the farmer suicides taking place in the State."

He planted around 5,500 tomato saplings in one acre of land under shade net cultivation in January 2016 and also got a bumper yield. After seeing the yield, he hoped for a better price. But his hopes were dashed as the price crashed suddenly in the open market. The price of tomato fell to Rs. 5 per kg from Rs. 25 per kg in a month. Meanwhile, buyers offered Rs. 100-Rs. 120 per bag (weighing 20 kg).Unhappy with this, Bhimareddy Rampurahalli, who was left with no option, has sold around 1,000 kg since the first week of March at cheap price. Bhimareddy Rampurahalli invested around Rs. 34 lakh, including on developing the land and installing nets using hi-tech methods. He drilled an extra borewell to meet the water needs of the crop. He also set up a transformer to avoid interruption in power supply. I made all-out efforts to cultivate the crop with modern techniques. But, even after I got a good yield, the price crash is causing concern, Bhimareddy Rampurahalli told The Hindu .He has lost hopes of getting even half the money he invested from the remaining tomato crop.Bhimareddy Rampurahalli also said that the government has not released the subsidy amount of Rs. 17 lakh as per norms, despite reminders sent to the officials.Satish Kumar, Deputy Director of Horticulture, said that there was no scheme to help farmers who suffer loss owing to price crash of crops taken up under shade net cultivation."

We want them to get familiarised with the new mode first, said G. Chandramouli, Chairman, South Zone, K&VIC. Each unit of solar charkha costs around Rs. 40,000 and the cost may go up depending on the number of spindles used. To aide Central governments girl child scheme, the commission has decided to gift a solar charkha to artisans who have a single girl child. Responding to the financial woes of tomato farmers in Chittoor and Kurnool districts, the commission has decided to form a tomato farmers cluster in the backward Pathikonda area of Kurnool district. Tomato growers of Kurnool are distraught as they do not get good returns on their produce, which is highly perishable. We propose to use solar dryers to dry tomatoes and use them to make products such as sauce and ketchup. For marketing, we will collaborate with the Railways.

The budget will vary, depending on the number of people involved, from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 7 crore. Farmers will have to bear 25 per cent of the cost while the remaining 75 per cent will comes as a grant from the Central Government. We have sent a DPR (Detailed Project Report) to this effect, said Mr. Chandramauli.In Kadapa, which has large areas of banana plantation, it intends to help farmers add value to their produce by making use of the banana tree fibre to weave high-quality saris after blending the fibre with cotton.We have a model unit in Kerala which produces very fine strands of thread from banana fibre. We also want to bring banana fibre into use for hand-made paper. It is of very high quality and has good demand in European countries. Cost-wise, it may be on the higher side, but the lifespan of this hand-made paper is 700 years. The commission will soon have an ancillary unit of banana fibre.

For this, the government machinery need to change its outlook towards agriculture. They have to get into consultation with farmers bodies and disseminate the demand potential of every crop both in the domestic and export market in advance, pointed out C. Nallasami, secretary of Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Associations.K. C. M. Balasubramanian, a retired agriculture economist, too is of the opinion that due to lack of macro planning, many farmers blindly tend to raise a crop which is giving good dividends to some other farmers in the respective regions.The farmers across the district will also be demanding the candidates to give an assurance that exact acreage of crops will be carried out in the coming years to get the correct position of the crop yield."

Its not uncommon for tuskers to enter Karnataka from adjacent Krishnagiri forests in Tamil Nadu.We are making all efforts to trace the elephants that might have strayed in to the forests on our side, Bangarpet Range Forest Officer H.

We are happy to see urban dwellers visiting our office to get kits spontaneously, said a senior official of Horticultural Department.There are reports that those who have received the kits in February have set up gardens on their terraces in the city.They are about to harvest the vegetables. Several residents have raised terrace gardens by getting the kits from Chennai. They have reaped the benefit by meeting their day to-day requirement of vegetables grown in their gardens.We have stopped buying vegetables in the market ever since we set up terrace garden a few months ago. The yield is sufficient to meet our vegetable requirement, says K.S. Shankar, a property developer who has set up terrace garden in his house at S.B.I.

They choose from the varieties of fruits and vegetable plants, and even the flowers of green leaves grown in this garden.Pleased to see the guests in her terrace garden, Nandini.R., a resident of Lawspet, says: I began the terrace garden to create a habitat for birds and animals.Starting as an experiment, she initially planted ornamental plants in the terrace. Her strong inclination to follow organic methods in terrace gardening allowed her to grow even vegetables and fruits. I was not blessed with a green thumb so I was hesitant to grow vegetables or fruits in the terrace. Initially, I planted only ornamental plants for the birds. As they grew, I saw tomatoes and pumpkin grow automatically from the compost. Watching them grow, I decided to plant more vegetables in the terrace garden, she says.She makes bed for the plants from the vegetable compost collected from her kitchen waste with a layer of soil and dry leaves. No organic waste goes out of her house. She collects the kitchen waste and prepares compost from it. It is because of the organic method that different bees visit the terrace garden. It takes at least two to three months to prepare the compost from kitchen waste. This bed is sufficient for the plants to grow. Thatched roofs are built to provide shade to these plants, she says.Now, her terrace garden has tomatoes, onion, broad beans, more than two varieties of green leaves and many other fruit plants. From these plants, one can save seeds to grow more plants. It is difficult to find a good source for native seeds. I got the seeds from an exhibition organised by an environment protection group. The first thing we should learn in organic farming is to save the seeds, she added.She wants to grow small trees in the garden including fruit-bearing plants to make a habitat for birds and animals. Nandini confesses that what she has done was very little as her family was soon moving to a different place. She believes that more could be done to grow vegetables from the terrace garden that can be self-sustaining. Not just that, people will also start managing the organic waste themselves rather than waiting for the government to tackle the problem."

The disease has been ascertained by a virologist at the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) in Tiruchi.It is said that the virus was transmittef by cotton whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci). It was found on two acres of brinjal (Manapparai local variety), which was about 50 days old. The incident level was around 20 to 30 per cent and the disease is spreading rapidly despite the farmers taking up spraying insecticides regularly.The disease, which is noticed on tomato crop, is noticed on brinjal probably for the first time in the region. It has to be quarantined as the virus spreads very fast, J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Kirishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur.Speaking to The Hindu , he said whitefly, which is a sap-sucking insect, might have spread the virus in the region. There was a possibility of noticing the disease in neighbouring Tiruchi district too. The disease would paralyse the plants, thus wiping out any yield.He said the plants would have shunted growth. New leaves would be reduced in size and wrinkled. The leaves would curl downward. Flowers might appear and they would fall before fruit was set.Removal and destruction of virus infected brinjal plants was the best way to prevent spreading of the disease.L. Sornamanickam, Assistant Director of Horticulture, Karur said that information about the disease had been communicated to all field-level officials. Farmers had been advised to destroy the plants, if they were affected.Mr. Draviam said the occurrence of the disease was communicated to the Centre for Integrated Pest Management Centre in Tiruchi."

GM mustard is likely to be the first transgenic seed, to be available in farmer fields. It has had a tumultuous history in India with activist groups claiming that it will be a gateway to several other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc.  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in farmer fields.The GM mustard in question has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology. The technology involves using a complex of genes, sourced from soil bacterium, which makes it easier for seed developers to easily develop hybrid varieties of mustard, generally a self pollinating plant. Hybrids varieties are generally known to produce greater yields but they necessitate farmers to keep going to seed companies every year to buy fresh seed. The technology, according to Mr. Pental, will contribute to increasing yields of such hybrids by 25% of existing varieties.Kavitha Kuruganti leads the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, which also campaigns against GM crops. Ms. Kuruganti  who petitioned the CIC  avers that the GM seeds so produced arent substantially better than existing mustard varieties and that seed developers and biotechnology regulators have colluded to push GM mustard. She also argues that in spite of multiple requests, the department hasnt made a copy of the biosafety dossier, which details the GM mustard varietys performance, available publicly.The Commission directs the public authority to verify and provide such informationspecifically the bio-safety dossier as submitted by the crop developer and any other material submitted by them and under review, after separating confidential information, if any, as per their independent decision. The Commission also directs all biosafety data pertaining to all other GMOs in pipeline as that is part of voluntary disclosure under Section 4 of the Right to Information Act reads the order, seen by The Hindu. These details are expected to be made available by April 30 after the seed developers have edited out potential proprietary information, Ms Kuruganti added. Through the hearing, the Environment Ministry was asked why this data wasnt voluntarily uploaded  Im not sure if it will be available on the website but once we get it, we will certainly make it public, Ms Kuruganti told The Hindu."

The British food blogger turned author was there to promote the publication of her second book, Deliciously Ella Everyday , in the United States, and she had caught a cold on the flight across the Atlantic. Her hotel was close to a juice store, though normally she prefers putting ginger through her own juicer and adding a squeeze of lemon.Its sharp and tart, but effective, she said. Ms. Woodward is a food celebrity in Britain, where her first cookbook, Deliciously Ella , named after her website, has had record sales since early 2015. It helps that even while sick, she has the look of someone who just came in from a brisk walk outdoors, with glowing skin, rosy cheeks and hair that falls in waves.She is one of a group of fashionable young women in Britain who are making a career of promoting healthy eating, including Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, Amelia Freer, Anna Jones and Natasha Corrett. The Guardian has called them the queens of greens; The Telegraph named them the superfoodies. One could also think of them as the Daughters of Nigella, the logical successors to Nigella Lawson, the food personality known for her lush desserts, sensuous presentation and high-profile split from art dealer Charles Saatchi.Ms. Woodward grew up in London, the daughter of supermarket heiress Camilla Sainsbury and politician Shaun Woodward.She used to eat lots of junk food but turned to a plant-based diet after she was found to have postural tachycardia syndrome in 2011. At first I had a lot of brown rice pasta with vegetables mushed with tomato, she said, but then she learned to cook.Her sweet potato brownies made with sweet potatoes, ground almonds, buckwheat, dates, raw cacao, maple syrup and salt are both popular and controversial, with online reviews calling them, alternately, divine, horrible and you will be disappointed.Chef sistersJasmine and Melissa Hemsley, aged 36 and 30 respectively, grew up eating food that was influenced by our mum from the Philippines fused with Grannys cooking. Jasmine Hemsley, a former model, said We ate a lot of old-school soups and stews, in no way fancy and without romanticism.Were big on bone broth soups, cooked vegetables and natural fats that come with meats, Melissa Hemsley said. Their signature dish is cauliflower crust pizza with Parma ham, arugula and Parmesan shavings.Vegetarian cravings36-year-old Anna Jones became a vegetarian at 25. She has written a A Modern Way to Eat: 200+ Satisfying Vegetarian Recipes . Taking something away opened up this whole way of cooking that hadnt existed for me before, she said.I love my salad with kale and coconut and miso and roasted tomatoes, but most popular with my readers are the recipes that are the simplest, the twists on classics, like my veggie burger, she said.Celebrity dieticianAmelia Freer, 40, grew up in England near the Scottish border, and was formerly an assistant to the Prince of Wales. Coming from a small town to London, to have a shop where you could buy lattes, croissants, ready-made sandwiches, I was like Woo hoo and would buy breakfast on the way to work and my evening meal on the way home, she said.A doctor suggested she change her diet, and she eventually went to school for nutritional therapy and has since attracted a clientele of mostly actors and musicians, including Sam Smith, who credits her with his recent weight loss. Working with the prince taught me to be discreet and not be fazed by anyone, she said.Natash Corret, 32, had a father who owned Le Boudin Blanc, a French restaurant in London. His side of the family is a long line of restaurateurs where you try everything and food is delicious and feeds your soul, she said. My mother, on the other hand, has celiac disease and is also very allergic to dairy, so I knew about gluten-free cooking and nut milk long before it was fashionable.I cant just eat what I want, unfortunately; I yo-yo dieted my entire life, she said. It was hard to find a balance. The thing is, it was a blessing in disguise. When I found the alkaline way of eating, it changed my life, and I created a career trying to show how great it is. (Alkaline eating aims for a certain acidity or pH in foods: corn, dairy, meat and wheat are all frowned upon.)Im a sweet-tooth person, she said. My sticky toffee pudding is insane.

While over a decade ago, orders used to be placed almost for 1,000 people, there has been a precipitous fall in demand. About 50-100 packets are ordered now.The reason?There isnt a clear answer. Some say it is because the party representatives in charge of campaigning in each locality distribute the cadre tokens that can be used at select hotels, while some say the parties find buying food packets from nearby eateries more feasible.

The disease has been ascertained by a virologist at the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) in Tiruchi.It is said that the virus was transmittef by cotton whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci). It was found on two acres of brinjal (Manapparai local variety), which was about 50 days old. The incident level was around 20 to 30 per cent and the disease is spreading rapidly despite the farmers taking up spraying insecticides regularly.The disease, which is noticed on tomato crop, is noticed on brinjal probably for the first time in the region. It has to be quarantined as the virus spreads very fast, J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Kirishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur.Speaking to The Hindu , he said whitefly, which is a sap-sucking insect, might have spread the virus in the region. There was a possibility of noticing the disease in neighbouring Tiruchi district too. The disease would paralyse the plants, thus wiping out any yield.He said the plants would have shunted growth. The new leaves would be greatly reduced in size and wrinkled. The leaves would curl downward. Flowers might appear and they would fall before fruit was set.Removal and destruction of virus infected brinjal plants was the best way to prevent spreading of the disease.L. Sornamanickam, Assistant Director of Horticulture, Karur said that information about the disease had been communicated to all field-level officials. Farmers had been advised to destroy the plants, if they were affected.Mr. Draviam said the occurrence of the disease was communicated to the Centre for Integrated Pest Management Centre in Tiruchi and other officials concerned so as to take steps to control the disease."
58fa03efa3d24b0b70c43c2d,Choreographing masculinity,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/choreographing-masculinity/article8464117.ece,2016-04-12,,The Hindu,"This year, the International Theatre Festival of Kerala showcased an exploration of masculinity by Delhi-based dance director Mandeep Raikhy, A Male Ant Has Straight Antennae . It premiered in 2013, although it has only toured, nationally and internationally, over the past year. It is a piece whose expansive design could scarcely fit into the proscenium at the KT Muhammed Theatre in Thrissur. On both sides of a squarish arena, were large scaffold-like grids, with Jonathan OHears light fixtures on either side working like flickering Venetian blinds, creating pathways and intersections on the ground, and diffused liminal spaces in which the plays themes were to be negotiated. The seven-strong ensemble consisted of six men and one woman, perhaps to create a spectrum that ranged from the hypermasculine to the innately female.The performers patrol the stage along right angles, kitted out in only underwear, accompanied by a metallic industrial-style score by Yasuhiro Morinaga. At first, there is a workman-like quality to the sauntering, almost a steady ant-like progression across the turf. Later, it runs the gamut from quick darting movements to a slow drudge to an almost streamlined gait. Then, they strut across imagined ramps, and show off their assets. The woman accentuates her breasts, as the men do their arms and packages. The seduction is no longer veiled. When they stop mid-stride, the performers look outward probingly, trying to draw the onlooker/voyeur in. So, a secondary narrative that strongly emerges is closely linked with alternative male sexuality, in a way that is primarily a comment on the urban gay world. In the shadows, a couple of dancers who wear long black socks seem like male Venus de Milo figures, suspended in midair. This fetishisation, even if it is not erotically charged at this stage, appears to represent a superficial idealisation of masculinity, particularly true for a gay microcosm. The men are the various bare bodies one may encounter if one were to log on to a gay dating online portal, where an obsession with physical beauty is almost an affliction of human nature.Victorian-era laws outlawing homosexuality persist in the country, and the pieces of the puzzle here represent facets of an underground culture, some of which takes place very much in the open. They will perhaps be more easily discernable to queer viewers who may recognise their lives in this exploration.Much of the choreography is slickly executed, even if the set-pieces are not constructed to showcase technique as much as to represent a functional world. The movements have an observational quality, and the contemporary idiom employed seems organic to the characterisation of these men.The straight antennae, perhaps, is the conditioning that is part of every conforming mans rites of passage, but particularly oppressive to those with feminine psyches that must be purged from within. Diniz Sanchez, the only dancer with an average body, must bear the baggage of being an effeminate man. A martial Raikhy is at hand to correct his gait, and steady his posture, and ensure his hands flop about him appropriately, sounding a stentorian roar each time Sanchez falls back to feminine bearings. At one time, this onslaught of prescriptive behaviour gets too much for him, leading to an explosion of indignation in the form of an operatic strain in a falsetto voice.Moments of levity such as this enliven the piece. In another amusing set-piece, a wonderfully orchestrated power play of mine is larger than yours is taken to absurd lengths, and performed to a comic score. It underscores how we borrow from each other to make ourselves whole.The daily drill that converts men into automatons is affectingly rendered, and Parinay Mehra embodies this stoically, with an impassive countenance on a body that springs to life with short bursts of vitality.Yet, even if the dancers fleetingly evoke the hidden costs of masculinity, it is never in any real sense. No tough questions are asked. Many of these set-pieces operate only on the surface as if merely representing a sub-culture in itself is enough. Some of the sequences seem indulgently prolonged even if Raikhy appears to be constantly engaged in translating queer experiences.From a striking beginning, the lighting devolves into something more generic, except in one interlude, where the cast performs in silhouettes, which literally examines a combative form of interaction between dancers. The gym, the playground, the roads, the buses, the dark alleyways, are all sites where men negotiate territory and identity. Yet, the true diversity of the male experience proves elusive through the medium of these decidedly urbane men.Raikhy is the pieces anchor, and provides an almost nurturing stewardship to the others; touching, holding, guiding with his eyes. A public encounter between two men segues into a love sequence that is refreshingly devoid of power dynamics. The men find equivalence in one another, and the slumber of bodies that fit well into each other leads to a lyrical pas de deux , where one man holds the other as he swings around. Queer sexuality isnt ever talked about in such deeply felt terms, although Raikhy does put the brakes on taking the innate sensuality of his themes forward.Ultimately, the piece represents a fondness for the very masculinity that is shown to disfigure our psyches. This is why the lone female dancer (the otherwise efficient Manju Sharma) comes across as a token figure, single-handedly expected to provide counterpoints that are not germane to this exploration. The piece comes full circle, with the dancers restored to the insects crawl they started with. While the piece should not be taken as a nuanced take on masculinity, it is an evocative mirror to a concealed world that Raikhy is only too familiar with, one that remains obscured from the mainstream, for better or for worse.The writer is a playwright and stage critic"

But, he was unsuccessful as this unit did not facilitate growth of such plants there, he said after visiting the farmers land.At a press meet, he said that farmers expected waiver of all loans taken by them as agriculture has suffered a big blow in the last few years due to various reasons.Farmers associations will decide on extending their support to the party or alliance that promise to waive loans, he added."

That is the strange reality as the Stanley reservoir provides water for irrigation and drinking in the delta region but the local people face water scarcity. Efforts to draw the attention of authorities to their plight have proved futile so far.In the upcoming Assembly elections, the key candidates fielded in the Mettur constituency  S. Semmalai (AIADMK), G.K. Mani (PMK), S.R. Parthiban (Makkal DMDK) and Bhupathi (DMDK)  will have to walk the extra mile to convince people on implementing projects for sharing the surplus water of Mettur dam for irrigation in Salem and neighbouring districts and also implementing special scheme for the supply of protected drinking water to villages.Mettur has become a key constituency with Mr. Semmalai, a former Minister, and Mr. Mani, PMK president, in the fray. Both are three-time MLAs (Mr. Mani has won twice from Pennagaram). The incumbent MLA, Mr. Parthiban, as a candidate of the DMK-led alliance has made the contest an absorbing one.The constituency is also an industrial belt with the presence of a few major industrial houses while a large number of local people are fishermen.All the four leading candidates belong to the dominant Vanniyar community.A section of the local population is upset over the governments failure in constructing a spacious bus stand and also in promoting tourism. The demand for implementing the Thonimadavu water scheme and the Mettur surplus water scheme and a bridge across the Cauvery connecting Kottaiyur to Ottanur has been pending for long. Another unfulfilled demand is the provision of cold storage facility for tomato farmers of Mecheri and a factory for manufacturing value- added products.But the AIADMK cadre are hoping that the achievements of the government including the execution of the underground drainage works, construction of high-level bridge, commissioning of electric crematorium, funds for solid waste management project and for widening the road from Mettur Camp to Thottilpatti would see Mr Semmalai through."

Tomatoes, areca nut, grapes, small onions, and bananas are all cultivated here and for the residents of the city who want a short getaway, there are several spots on the banks of the Noyyal that they can go to.Well, things are not the same anymore. In several areas, the farms have given way to buildings and the Noyyal cries for attention. Elephants crossing the road, entering residential areas, and damaging crops are common.One of the significant demands of the constituency is efforts to support agriculture. It is an area where different crops are raised. In the recent years, small farmers have been selling their land as they do not find farming viable, say some of them. The grape growers have seen a sharp fall in area under grapes and have been asking for a research centre that can guide the farmers. Instances of elephants and boars damaging crops are on the increase and the agriculture community has sought protection for crops. Construction of retention walls on the bunds of the Noyyal will protect the river, they add.In some of the tribal hamlets at the foothills, the residents seek bore wells so that they can continue farming during summer months and when there is shortage of water too. The Noyyal restoration is important not only for the constituency but also for the districts through which the river passes. Now, untreated sewage is let into the river and waste is dumped on the river bed. The local bodies in the constituency need to go in for sewage treatment plants so that the Noyyal can be revived. Checking of violation of Hill Area Conservation Authority rules, controlling water bottling plants that operate without licence and improvement in public transport facilities for tourists are among the other demands.Eco-friendly measures that will conserve Nature, benefit tourists, and develop the religious and Natural tourist destinations will help develop the constituency better, say environmental activists.Sitting MLA S.P. Velumani (AIADMK) polled 62.40 per cent of the votes in 2011 in Thondamuthur Assembly constituency, which was bi-furcated in 2007 to create Kavundampalayam and had some areas of Perur added to it. This election, the main parties contesting include AIADMK (S.P. Velumani), Manithaneya Makkal Katchi in the DMK front (M.A. Syed Mohammed) and DMDK in the DMDK-PWA-TMC front (K. Thiagarajan). The constituency requires not just lights and roads but more development to increase the income of the people. It has potential for promotion of tourism and agriculture, says Mr. Thiagarajan. According to Mr. Mohammed, the constituency has not got any new industry or initiative to generate more jobs in the last five years."

The prices of vegetables that had begun to fall a few weeks ago continued to show a downward trend. As taking the perishable produce back home would require spending a few more thousands, Raghu had no choice but to slash his prices. He ended up selling ridge gourd at Rs. 80 for a 20 kg bag, bitter gourd at Rs. 25 for a 15 kg bag and green brinjal at Rs. 60 for a 10 kg bag.

When this reporter observed the auction of different vegetables held between 5.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m, it was found that the prices of all vegetables were down: tomato was priced at Rs. 80 for a 25 kg bag, cucumber at Rs. 100 for a 20kg bag, cauliflower at Rs.100 a bag of 10 pieces and green chilli at Rs. 100 for 10 kg bag.I have stopped harvesting green brinjal as it did not fetch m even the transportation costs last week when I had to sell it for Rs. 30 for a bag of 10 kg, Venkatesh, a farmer from Ele Bichhali village, said.Traders attribute the price fall to glut. Vegetables arrive from Shanti Nagar in Andhra Pradesh, Aija, Gadwall and Hyderabad in Telangana, and Chintamani and Belagavi in Karnataka, apart from the villages along the banks of the Tungabhadra and the Krishna in the district.Green chilli was sold at Rs. 600 for a bag of 10 kg a few weeks ago. Now, the price has dropped to Rs. 100 due to excess, Aarif Hussein, a trader, said.No benefitsWhen this reporter visited the only retail market two hours after the wholesale trading, it was found that the vegetables were being sold at much higher prices: ridge gourd at Rs. 40 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 4), bitter gourd at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs.1.60 a kg), green brinjal at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 6). tomato at Rs.10 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 3.20), cucumber at Rs. 30 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 5), cauliflower at Rs. 40 a piece (wholesale price: Rs. 10) and green chilli at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs.10).No regulationIn the absence of a statutory body to regulate the prices of perishable crops, the district authorities are exploring the possibility of safeguarding the interests of farmers and consumers by eliminating all the middlemen involved.Opening farmers markets where common people too can purchase vegetables directly from farmers is one option.

In Manjalloor in Muvattupuzha, a small hill has been converted into a farm.Not stopping organic farming with Onam, we are planning to take it to a much bigger scale by gradually increasing the acreage under cultivation, said Ms. Thomas.Kudumbasree will be holding 114 markets of a duration of three days to five days during the Onam season. Though the dates are yet to be finalised, the markets are being planned in a way that they extend till Onam eve.Besides organic vegetables, the Kudumbasree markets will also have a range of other products including different varieties of payasams, pickles and garments."

The increasing number of survivors say that the success is owing to early detection and treatment. In spite of that, with a million new cases being reported every year, cancer seems to be tightening its grip on India. Nearly 7 lakh Indians die of cancer every year, while over 10 lakh are newly diagnosed with some form of the disease. The greater part of the diseases in India are diagnosed when the disease has spread and has become either untreatable or hard.A new development offers hope for potentially increasing detection rates and enhancing the probability that those in need get treatment, and also lessening risk through nourishment and right dietary approaches. By some estimates, lifestyle factors, for example diet and exercise, assume a major role in cancer prevention. Dietary habits are assessed to be a causal factor in 30 per cent of all cancers. Combined with smoking, obesity, food chemicals (e.g. pesticides, additives and hormones), lack of exercise, air and water pollution, and the over-consumption of alcohol or certain pharmaceutical drugs (like, Estrogen, Metronidazole (Flagyl), Lindane (Kwell), or Griseofulvin), 70% per cent of all cancers can be connected to lifestyle.Cancer and the treatment of cancer are often connected with inflammation. Despite the fact that the inflammatory process may have a role in healing, if it goes on too long or if there is too much of it, it can damage cells and their DNA. Beside damage there are different components adding to perpetual inflammation, such as stress, obesity, chemical exposures, and such.The good news is that diet can altogether diminish inflammation. Here are a few things we can do.Lower fat intake - A low-fat diet is associated with reduced risk of cancer. Lower your fat intake to about 20 per cent of total calories. A minimum of 65 grams of fat per day is suggested; 50 grams is better. More of the fats should be mono and polyunsaturated types with a reduction of saturated fat intake and little or no consumption of refined and heated oils.Increase dietary fiber - Fiber has a protective effect against cancer, so a high-fiber diet is suggested to improve colon function, mainly by increasing carbohydrates in the form of whole grains and lots of vegetables, along with some fruits, all of which contain high amounts of many of the important nutrients.Maintain ideal weight and avoid obesity - Be as lean as possible, without becoming underweight.Exercise: for adults at least 30 minutes most days; for children 60 minutes most days.Avoid smoking - The best way for smokers to reduce their risk of cancer, and improve their overall health, is to stop smoking completely.Avoid smoked, salted, pickled and barbecued foods. Prepare meat, poultry and fish by baking, broiling or poaching. Low alcohol consumption - The less alcohol you drink, the lower the risk of cancer. To help prevent cancer, leading experts advise not drinking alcohol at all. Include foods rich in vitamin A and Vitamin C - Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant. Most dietary requirements of vitamin A comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils.Vitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. All fruits and vegetables contain some amount of vitamin C. Citrus fruits such as orange, grapefruit, lime, and lemon are excellent sources of vitamin C, and so are non-citrus fruits such as papaya, strawberries, pineapple.It is best to discuss your nutrition plans with qualified health & wellness coach.Expert- Preeti Rao,CEO & Founder, Total Wellness Management, & Consultant-Health & Wellness, Max Healthcare."

Surprisingly, when farmers all over the State have been screaming hard over failure of monsoons and water scarcity, tomato farmers here face a different situation where monsoon failure has resulted in a bumper harvest, resulting in steep price drop.Tomato farmers say that due to monsoon showers, the normal damage to crops would be high in terms of withering of flowers and fruit rot, but now, without the showers there was a rich flowering in the crops, and in turn a bountiful harvest of fruits.According to current market conditions, a container of 15 kg of tomatoes is sold at `20. Due to the drastic fall in prices, tomato farmers in the district are not even interested in plucking them and are leaving the fruit to rot in the plant itself.I have cultivated tomatoes in three acres of land, and have spent `3 lakh in raising the crops. But due the fall in procurement prices, I could not recover even `2 lakh, said Valukkuparai Balu, president, Farmers Association, Coimbatore. According to him, a farmer needs to spend `200 per farm hand a day for plucking tomatoes and he has to meet other expenditure like transporting the produce to markets.Similarly affected are shallot farmers. Following the fall in price, most of the farmers have created huts in their farms, and are storing the produce. According to farmers, the procurement price of shallots is `6 to `8 per kg, and hence, they are storing them in huts, expecting the price to rise.Farmers pointed out that the Economic Department of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) would normally indicate the price of every crop before the season. But this time, the university has failed to predict tomato prices. They demanded that utilising the excess production, a value addition industry for tomato should be started in the district.Meanwhile, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, A Ramakrishnan, said, Tomato is being cultivated in around 400 hectares in the district. Excess production has resulted in price loss. Practically, we cannot develop value-added industry due to the gap in production."

Two weeks on, his business is being hammered by the ensuing cash crunch.Sales at Somani's aluminium foil maker, Rockdude Impex, have fallen by roughly a quarter in the past week, and the cash shortage that followed the ""demonetisation"" drive has left his supply chain in tatters: his trucks are stranded with no money for fuel, workers won't load goods for free, and distributors can't pay up.Modi's move on Nov. 8 was aimed at cracking down on corruption and flushing out funds stashed away in India's ""black economy"". But the cancellation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.3 and $14.7), more than 80 percent of currency in circulation, threatens to push Asia's third-largest economy into a liquidity crisis.Consumer spending makes up 56 percent of India's $2 trillion economy. But with just the small stock of smaller denomination notes available and a struggle to get hold of new bills, consumers are holding back.The government has acknowledged that the disruption would last weeks because of delays in note printing and technical problems with ATM machines, but Modi has made a plea for patience until Dec. 30. The government said it could not have printed new notes or recalibrated cash machines in advance for fear of the move leaking out.Meanwhile, supply chains at small, medium and even larger companies are breaking down, underlining just how much corporate India - not just the shadow economy - relies on hard cash.""The entire supply chain has broken,"" said Somani, who employs 150 people across India from his base outside Mumbai.Problems at Rockdude go from its network of suppliers to its 1,500 distributors and 150 stockists. Its sales team, spread from Delhi to Nagaland in the east and all the way to the south, is rapidly running short of cash to promote a planned new product, even for the rickshaw rides they use to travel.Revenues have frozen, Somani says, but fixed costs continue, including wages. These are paid online, but his staff cannot get access without being given time off to queue at the bank.""We are cutting production,"" he added. ""If this goes on for two more months, then it will hit us very badly.""An executive at a mid-sized hair oil manufacturer, a beauty staple in India, said sales had crumpled as consumers simply stopped buying shampoos and lotions. Wholesale markets, which operate in cash, are shut. Distributors have no cash.""We are planning to extend some discounts to the distributors so that they at least replenish the amount of stocks they are selling, instead of not buying from us at all,"" he said.""We are cutting production every day,"" he added.Like many of the businessmen interviewed by Reuters, he declined to be named, given the sensitivity of the issue.CASH CRUNCHEDIn the year to March 2017, the cash crunch is estimated to pull down India's gross domestic product (GDP) growth from last year's 7.6 percent by as much as 4.1 percentage points. Brokerage Ambit Capital says it does not rule out a contraction in the October-December quarter.Corporate operating profits are tipped to fall by as much as 40 percent in the current quarter.People ranging from taxi drivers and street hawkers to big consumer goods firms have seen their earnings plummet by as much as 80 percent in the first week of the swap alone, according to some analysts' estimates.Those relying on informal, cash-based channels are, unsurprisingly, worst hit. Greengrocer Ranveer Singh, who regularly borrows money to run his shop in New Delhi, sold vegetables on credit to regular customers in the first two days after the cash crackdown, but has been forced to shut up shop.""I don't have cash to refill stocks,"" said Singh, who used to make about $15 a day before the crackdown began.""If it remains like this for two more weeks, my family might have to go without food.""But even for more sophisticated firms, paying employees is a major challenge, and not just in the construction and building materials sectors, which still pay contractors in cash.As most Indians do not have bank accounts, most are paid in cash, though reliable statistics are hard to come by.With the government changing rules for currency withdrawals and exchange almost every day, Somani and others are struggling.Chandubhai Kothia, head of chemicals company Shree Ganesh Chemicals in Gujarat, with an annual turnover of 1 billion rupees, said a newly imposed 50,000 rupee cash withdrawal limit per week for some businesses that came in as part of the measures was simply not enough.""The payment of wages to workers and transport are a problem,"" he said.While Modi has promised the cash situation would become normal by year-end, Saumitra Chaudhuri, a former economic adviser to the government, estimates it will take six months to replace the stock of cancelled bills.EARNINGS CRUNCHEDSome analysts are already reviewing their estimate of company earnings for the rest of the year.Brokerage Motilal Oswal warned this week that its forecast of a revival in corporate earnings in the second half of the fiscal year 2016/17 was now in jeopardy, with autos, retail, consumer goods, cement, telecom and non-banking financial companies likely to see downgrades.India's vast services sector, which accounts for two-thirds of GDP, is worst hit.Credit Suisse estimates more than 90 percent of consumer purchases are made in cash as few Indians have bank cards and infrastructure for online transactions is poor.In Gurgaon's Cyber Hub, a corporate leisure centre, several eateries reported a crash in their card swiping machines, compelling them to decline customers who didn't have sufficient smaller denomination bills.In rural areas, where cash is totally dominant, the situation is worse.In the wheat-growing states, sales of seeds and fertiliser have plunged halfway through the sowing season as farmers told Reuters they had run out of cash.As the crunch continues, more are beginning to ask whether the government could have done more to ease the impact.""The Prime Minister to my mind has done an income tax raid in every house in the country,"" said Abhishek Saraf, joint managing director of SquareFoot, a flooring-maker in Mumbai."

The cold buffet included Parma ham with melon, sesame crusted tuna nicoise, smoked duck with pear compote, shrimps ceviche, barley wuith prune and kalamata, artichoke and tomator terrine.The simmering hot roasted pumpkin soup was soft, sweet, rich in texture and creamy.The roasted turkey was carved and served to us. The turkey was well cooked, with subtle flavours of the giblet gravy, cranberry and potato that added to the glazed tasting.Honey glazed ham had a hint of sweetness, almost nil with the size of the slices served, the meat was succulent.The steak served was juicy and flavoured with barbecue sauce.The Coq au vin rouge won the buffet at the table - the meat was moist and cooked thorough.The classic pumpkin pie was dry, crumbled easily.The pie could have been better at least with a whipped cream on top.Maple pumpkin twists with cream cheese frosting was an interesting concept, but failed as the pumpkin stuffing was way too sweet.I had a diabetes threat in my mouth with the dessert.The Pavlov was the saving grace among the dessert with creamy and crumbly textures breaking into a moist combination of subtly sweet and fruity flavours.M Cafe at the Marriott also served red wine, which goes well with the meaty delight.They also served cinnamon maple whisky sour, ginger cranberry cooler and buck fizz at the dinner. Not a fan on buck fizz. The acidity of the citrus overpowers the sparkling wine flavour.Overall the dinner is a delight for a meat lover, especially if you are a fan of ham and turkey."

If you know Israel and Israelis, you can guess how quickly I fell in love with this word. Just imagine a small nation, spread across the world, suffering for being different, looking for a place to call home and building one for itself, almost from a scratch. The State of Israel is Jugaad! Jugaad is the way we think, the way we invent, the way we work, he said.He said, We in Israel were concerned about homeland security, but India taught us to think about food security. And this is why we are all here today. India and Israel are both old-new nations. We both know that building a home means being able to provide food for your family, and that building a nation means to be able to produce and provide food for all: now, and for the next generations. It is about taking care of your home with your own two hands; it is about taking care of your people and your land.A few days ago I visited Karnal where Indians and Israelis are developing new kinds of cherry-tomato, which are an Israeli invention. When Indian experts and Israeli experts place solar panels on the roofs of trucks so that the solar energy will keep the food inside the trucks fresh and prevent food waste  they are doing magic together. When Israeli companies and Indian farmers create professional and financial networks to help the farmers keep growing their crops, they are doing magic together, he said and making a special reference to the Central governments Make in India programme, he added that, Israel not only thinks that it can Make in India, but also Make with India.Pranab Mukherjee, President of India said, Im happy to share the platform with the president of Israel, a country that has made a mark in agriculture through innovation, technology solutions and converting its knowledge into value addition. Israel has created water and food surplus by successfully using technology.There is much to learn from Israel, a country which has converted its disadvantages to advantages with courage, conviction and fortitude. I was a part of the decision making team in 1992 that entered into a partnership for defence equipment with Israel, and I am happy we can do so in the field of agriculture as well, Mukherjee said.The union minister for agriculture Radha Mohan Singh said, It is appreciable as how CII is bringing digital krishi to farmers. When we talk about Indias agricultural production, the states of Punjab and Haryana get a supreme mention because it was here that the Green Revolution started off. However, in the last few years, water levels in these states have depleted and we need to develop ways to use water more judiciously.Barak Granot, head of Economic and Trade Mission, Embassy of Israel said, As a step towards promoting the cooperation between India and Israel in the agricultural sector, Israel seeks to increase the number of Centres of Excellence across India. There are currently 15 such centres that enable rapid transfer of Israeli agricultural technology to farmers, including those in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, and going ahead, these would be increased to 29."

We will be able to complete the entire 2 million tonnes by June 2017, Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande said on the sidelines of FICCI conference on food service industry.Pulses production is estimated to increase to more than 20 million tonnes in 2016-17. So, we will be able to procure one million tonne of pulses from domestic market for buffer stock and rest one million tonnes will be imported, he said.India has imported 3.5 million tonnes of pulses so far this fiscal, out of which 0.4 million tonnes is by public sector trading agencies In an initiative to safeguard the interest of buyers, the government is also coming up with a new Consumer Protection Act which is scheduled to be introduced in Parliament soon.Ensuring the availability of 24-25 million tonnes of pulses, the Ministry expects a reduction in imports as they expect a significant rise in production. Last fiscal, India imported nearly six million tonnes of pulses to meet the domestic demand.The price of pulses which had skyrocketed to `200 per kg, have seen a steep correction while the price of sugar is stable.Meanwhile, the wastage of tomatoes produced, makes it imperative that other fruits and vegetables are safeguarded from this wastage. Hence, the need to reduce post-harvest crop-loss and wastage of cooked food is also being emphasized with the need to increase the processing level of fruits and vegetables to 20 per cent in a attempt to reduce post harvest losses."

Its an everyday struggle as small vendors suffer a huge dip in their collection while labourers are left with no wages or work to meet ends. Express spoke to a few of them on how they are surviving against the odds.Ahmed | Age: 47 | Chaat sellerAhmed and his family live in a rented house near Shivajinagar. The demonetisation drive, Ahmed says, has taken a large chunk of his earnings as people do not have cash.Most of the food items I sell cost either Rs 30 or Rs 40 per plate. From noon to 9pm, Rukiya (his wife) and I used to conduct business worth Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. Everything has changed since the new notes were introduced. We are unable to make half of what we used to, he said.He has two school-going children.The couple has been selling food items near Commercial Street for over a decade now.Explaining his constraints, Ahmed said that it has become difficult to raise enough money to even buy tomatoes and onions among other items for his business.Since all my earnings go to my family, I have no savings or a bank account. The cash crunch, I fear, will push me towards debt, he said.However, he is hopeful that the situation will return to normal soon. If not, I will have to ask my son to quit school and assist in looking after the family, he added.Venkatesh | Age: 45 | Flower vendorIn a corner on Veerapillai Street in the city, Venkatesh has been selling flowers with his mother Lakshmi for the past two-and-a-half decades. Ever since demonetisation was announced, Venkatesh has been witnessing a steady decline in his income. We had never faced such a financial crunch before, he said.The income they generated by selling flowers has shrunk by 66 per cent in the last 15 days. Earlier, we used to sell goods worth Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 on a daily basis, of which we could make an earning of Rs 500. What can we do if we only earn Rs 1,000? he asked.He resides at Anepalya in the city with his mother, wife H Devi and two children. His recent income, he says, is inadequate to make ends meet. We dont have a bank account. All that we earn is enough to meet only our daily demands. If business continues to be this dull, we will have to explore other options to sustain the family, he said.Kannan | Age: 27 | Daily wage labourerIf not for the charitable gesture of his employer, Kannan says he and his wife would have been forced to beg. Kannan, his wife Vijayalakshmi, and a group of other labourers are working at a construction site in Banashankari and are being fed by the contractor.Thats all we are getting now  food. We have not received payment for the past two weeks, Kannan said. Kannan has left his parents and younger brother back in Kolar district. Though his brother does menial jobs, Kannan and his wife are the primary breadwinners. Kannan used to travel home every two weeks to give money to his parents, but he has not been able to do so since November 8. They have resorted to borrowing from people. I cant ask the contractor to send money to my parents because they do not have a bank account. Without salary we cant go home. We cannot insist that the salaries be paid because we might lose our jobs. We have to be understanding. How will the owner pay salaries if he cant take cash out from bank, he said.Karthik Kumar | Age: 32 |Migrant labourerKarthik Kumar and his family spend about six months in Bengaluru and six months in their village near Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu. He says his bank has been turning him away due to lack of change for the high denomination notes he is paid with.He and his wife Mutthu earn up to Rs 500 and Rs 300 respectively. The money he earns, he deposits it every month in his mothers account, who lives alone in the village. I used to deposit money in the Bengaluru branch of a bank we have back home. When I went last Tuesday, bank personnel insisted that I deposit the money at my home branch, he said.We cannot afford to travel more than 300 km every week to deposit money. We cant keep it safe with us either, he said. The Rs 2,000 denomination too has caused problems for him. When we are trying to save every penny, having a Rs 2,000 note is a problem as we are forced to buy more to get change, he added.Zarina | Age: 37 | ArtisanZarina, her husband Saleem and daughter Ayesha hail from Ahmedabad and have been residing on a footpath in front of Cantonment Railway Station.To a question, she said that she had heard about old notes being taken out of circulation but is not sure if it has made any difference.In Bengaluru or any other city, if we sell our wares we can make a maximum of Rs 200 a day. So, to earn Rs 500, my husband and I have to roam around the city for three days, said Ayesha as she started to cook on the footpath.People with money might have faced problems. But, we dont have any money. If our wares do not sell, we will beg and feed ourselves. There is always a tomorrow where we will earn enough for us to survive, she added.Mehboob Pasha | Age: 20|Construction labourerMehboob Pasha and his two brothers work in different parts of Bengaluru. They moved from Raichur district. For Mehboob, who started working as a construction labourer a month ago, demonetisation has put him in a personal crisis.Mehboob told Express that he had arrived in the city with his brothers with little money. A few days later he was left only with a Rs 500 note. This was a couple of days after the demonetisation move. Then, his employer gave him Rs 1,000 as salary.When I went to the shop with the money, they told me that both the denominations have been withdrawn. They asked to me to go to the bank to deposit the money, he said. Since he did not have a bank account to deposit the money, he was forced to stand in a queue for almost a day to exchange the notes. I lost a days earning. Since we receive a meagre salary, we cant afford to take leave, he said. Echoing similar concerns was his relative, who did not wish to be named. Even now we are paid in old notes. We have been asking the contractor to give new notes as we cant afford to stand in a queue and lose a day, she added."

The ongoing Italian food festival at Prego, The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace (which is on till October 29) boasts of a menu hand-crafted by chef Roberto Boggio that has all of above. He has been flown down from Le Meridien Pune and the full-course meal served by him and his team has already found favour with the Italian food enthusiasts in the city. It also helps that the Chef can make you fall in love a little bit more with his cuisine with his dramatic storytelling. My life is my job, says Roberto after giving a lively presentation about and dishing out some trivias about the fare on the table.The full-course meal rustled up by the team comprised starters, soup, pizza, pasta course and dessert. The Saturday afternoon feast begun with Tartara di asparagi con salsa di taleggio which is pudding comprising asparagus, a hint of egg and taleggio cheese sauce. The minestrone made with vegetables and pesto sauce was warm and comforting. The pizza with tuna, squid, prawn, crab, with a generous layer of pesto and tomato sauce sums up an ideal brunch food. However, the Cotoletta impanata, classic chicken pane served with rosemary potatoes stole the show before the desserts arrived. The coffee dust sprinkled tiramisu was the perfect way to end the meal."

This restaurant, a darshini, serves organic vegetarian. This is the brainchild of four friends  two who worked in a health-insurance office, and two in the software industry.Vivek Patil quit his well-paying job in the insurance company. I worked there for almost five years and observed the disease patterns. I found an unhealthy lifestyle to be the main culprit, in fact eating habits to be more precise. That got me and my friend Srinivas Hatti thinking... and we decided to open a restaurant with health as the main focus, says Patil, who has also enlisted the services of an in-house Ayurveda doctor for consultation. Dr Radhapriya convinced us to open an organic restaurant, he says. Shivanand Naik and Kiran DS, two software engineers, joined in.The most interesting section of their menu is The Health Special Organic Juices. It lists 15 to 20 juices combining fruits and veggies with names indicative of their effect on the body.So you have Flat Tummy (for burning fat), Red Cooler (for reducing cholesterol), Heart Beat (for a better heart), Acid Free (to fight acidity) and Body Builder (for muscle gain). All are prepared under the guidance of the in-house Ayurveda doctor, who is also available for consultation between 7 am and 10 am everyday.Health juices are famously tasteless, so the restaurant has cleverly altered their range to be palatable.Snacks such as Organic Idli, Masala Dosa, and Roti Khara Bhat dont taste like anything out of the ordinary, but it does leave you satisfied that you had something organic.Millets have been used in the dishes and the Millets Special Organic Lunch Menu features millet idlis, millet bhath, millet puliogre, millet sweet and pongal. All taste like they are homemade, bland and familiar.Davangere delicacies such as Davangere Benne Dosa, Girmit (a bhel puri like mixture made from onions and tomatoes, roasted gram powder and puffed rice) and Mandakki Oggarane (again a mixture of puffed rice, roasted gram dal and condiments), and some of the popular dishes from North Karnataka also find space on the menu. Be careful with the chilli fritter (bhajji), which is startlingly hot.There is also the special menu for the day with its 10-12 varieties of organic sandwiches. Coffee too has Regular, Black and with jaggery options. In teas, you could have a masala tea made from organic milk."

The secret behind the delectable spread of paya, nihari and marag served fresh with hot dil naan is that there really is no short-cut. Itminan or patience is the byword followed by the chefs who make it. The launch of a new Hyderabadi Irani menu, as a tribute to the Nizami traditions atSodaBottleOpenerWala, Hyderabad was another reminder of this fact. You cant cook this fare by a recipe book, it takes painstaking hours of cooking and a whole lot of love to put these delicacies on the table, says Shaaz Mehmood, partner, SBOW.From this week onwards, the Jubilee Hills-based Irani Cafe has been serving two kinds of cuisines-the usual Parsi Bombay fare and the Hyderabadi delicacies along with liquor. If this strikes a chord with the food lovers in the city, the plan is to replicate it in the other outlets through out the country. It took three months and copious hours in the kitchen for us to train our chefs. My mother, my partner Shirazs mother, my grand-mothers cooks, my fiancs grand mothers cooks, over six households got together to come up with the dishes, informs Shaaz.For starters we tried the mutton varqi luqmi with mint and tomato chutney; this could be the perfect companion for your cuppa of your signature Irani chai. The baked Irani specialties also include Osmania biscuits, macrom, badam biskoot, naan khataais.What came next at the sampling session was the paya, nihari and marag with dil naan and zabaan. The spice level was muted but it allowed us to savour the flavour even better. The talihuwi arbi and talahuwa gosht, would go well with your baghara khana and khatti dal. One must pair the kaddu ka dalcha (a warm and wholesome variant of dal with gourd) with steamed rice. The Irani haleem, somewhat different from the characteristic preparation that you get almost every nook and corner in Hyderabad during Ramazan. Served with chopped mint leaves, a squeeze of lemon, fried onions, and green chillies, this dish had a fresh taste. The biryani, both mutton and vegetarian were not the usual spicy variation but stayed true to the authentic Hyderabadi taste. The dum ka murg was distinctly smokey as this dish is meant to be. The meal ended on a sweet note with khubani ka meetha and kulfi-falooda that was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth.The new menu lives up to the promise of serving food that is truly Hyderabadi in every morsel. For your next relaxed meal with conversations that go on for hours, this could be an apt bet."

58fd43da7be9e06c937184b9,Travels inspire a ‘convertible’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/nov/18/travels-inspire-a-convertible-1540091.html,2016-11-18,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: Growing up in the city, Amit Gowda, saw many of his favourite restaurants shut down because they were operating from basements. City byelaws made this use of space illegal. But with that, according to Amit, the city lost half of its charm.A food enthusiast and an ardent traveller, he decided to open a multi-cuisine restaurant much in line with Tycoon restaurant that once was his go-to place in the city. It took him two years and travels to 15 countries to finally open his ideal restaurant.The Druid Garden was opened yesterday in Sahakarnagar.The 32,000-sqft restaurant is on the third and fourth floor of a building that houses a fitness gym and grocery stores. But pass the first two floors and you enter a world starkly different with its striped Aztec black and white marble floor.The entrance is dimly lit and, almost all of a sudden, the restaurant turns bright and open. There are different seating arrangements -- German communal tables and elevated corners to VIP sections and closer-to-the-DJ rooms.Our idea was to have an outdoor space and yet a controlled one, says Amit. What if it rains? An open space will not be fun, he says. I look around to see the open space and see the glass roof above my head starting to slide. The retractable glass roof gives way to open skies and a cool breeze.There are planted gardens all around, to remind you of this garden city. In the nights, with fairy lights, the restaurants wears a warm yellow tone.I seat myself in an elevated area, to the right of the entrance. Seated in a handcrafted Italian oak chair, I get an open view of an Italian kitchen. The kitchen boasts of a wood-fire grill and imported teak, oak, rosewood and hickory are used to smoke meat in the grill.The kitchen occupies 20,000 sq ft area and is driven by 60 chefs. You can take a tour of it on request. The store rooms and the refrigerators are stuffed with imported products from all over the world, such as chocolates from Belgium, salmon from Venenzula and cheese from Italy. While the organic vegetables are brought in from Talakadu and Chikballapura, the lamb is from Banur. Majority of the basic ingredients such as garam masalas, breads and ice-cream are made in-house. All ingredients are sealed with a sticker that carries the name of the chef who prepared it, the date on which it was prepared and Best Before date.Adjacent to the kitchen is a brewery with 36 tanks imported from Czech Republic. The beer is made exclusively by a master brewer Ladislav, who is from Czech Republic.The 140 dishes on the menu were carefully picked from 400 dishes. It was tough to narrow them down, says Niharika Raval, general manager of the restaurant.The dishes are from all 15 countries Amit travelled to: Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Portugal, Vietnam, Thailand, South America, Honduras, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Mexico, Japan, China and India. The menu was curated, over eight months, after tasting food from streets and from fine-dining restaurants.I cant try all, so I pick 10 dishes.First, I am served Vietnamese Summer Roll with Peanut Sauce. Fresh lettuce, glass noodles, red cabbage and herbs were assembled together and wrapped in a feather-light rice paper. Maybe because Vietnamese is my favourite cuisine, I find this roll to be the best I have ever had. It has unobtrusive flavours and crunchy, raw textures that are not too loud to chew on. Moist glass noodles adds a smoothness to it too.Hoisin Duck Taco is a surpise. The taco is small, round and soft. Shredded duck is layered with crispier pieces. The duck is prepared in confit, which means it is cooked slowly over a long time in its own fat. The process takes a whole day. The skin of the duck is crispy fried and topped on the taco along with cucumber, spring onions and chayote. The tanginess of the ketchup contrasts well with the sweetness of the duck.Campagna Burrata is sheer delight for cheese lovers. A solid mozzarella holds a refined silky mozzarella and fresh cream.Danish dish Smorrebrod with Anchovy Paste, an open-faced sandwich, has toasted bread drizzled with fresh lettuce. It is divine with the tangy flavour of marinated tomatoes and savoury anchovies. I can taste a hint of basil, roasted pepper and olive oil.Asian cuisine is served with dips that have soy sauce and garlic and Mediterranean dishes have creamy cheesy dips.For the dessert, I am served Orchard Fresh Sorbet that excels in presentation. There are fruit jellies and roll ups. You can pick from three kinds of sorbet -- the brown one that is Chocolate-Chilli flavored, white is Kaffir Lime and Coconut flavoured, and red is Mixed Berry. I try Chocolate Chilli sorbet first, out of curiosity. It tastes first of chocolate then the hotness of the chilli shoots in. The chilli is an after-taste. The Kaffir Lime-Coconut is tangy and creamy. The Mixed Berry sorbet tastes like something you can layer on a bread, instead of jam.Approximate cost for two: `1,400 without alcohol."

We get a rousing welcome at the recently opened restaurant, in UB City, with Punjabi songs from Bollywood.Popeyes loves spinach, so there is Popeye Paaji ki Chaat. On the plate is fried spinach leaf topped with yoghurt, mint and imli chutney. It is chatpati and a healthy dish to start off with. Tokri Chaat resembles Raj Kachori minus the puri, the tokri is kept in. It has different kinds of sprouts, which are boiled. We get the tangy taste of imli and dahi as we bite into the tokri.This is accompanied by Nashili Chai and Jatt Risky After Whisky. Nashili Chai stands true to its name and will be loved by any tea fanatic. It is tea mixed with vodka, gin, white rum, orange liqueur, lime juice and orange marmalade. In Jatt Risky After Whisky, whisky is shaken with apple cinnamon reduction, egg white and lime juice.I love paneer and dahi and find starters loaded with both -- Paneer Barrel Tikka and Dahee Pataka. Paneer, in the shape of hexagonal barrel, is stuffed with a filling made of sweet mango chutney, dry fruits and cottage cheese. It is cooked in tandoor. Dahee Pataka is made with hung curd, chopped chilli added to it. We bite into it and the dahi oozes into our mouth tangy, spicy and with a hint of ginger.Gabbar Prawns, made with jumbo prawns, has smoky flavour with a taste of herbs. The prawns are marinated in hung curd, green chilli, garam masala, jeera powder, heated mustard oil and cooked in tandoor. All these are served with mint chutney.The main course is, the unforgettable, Maa Ki Daal. The traditional dal makhni made with black gram, pigeon pea, green gram and kidney bean is slow cooked on tandoor which gives it a burnt flavour. Cream and butter add to its rich texture.BC Classic Butter Chicken too is creamy, tastes sweet with the right amount of spice. It has a thick gravy with chicken tikka. The tikka is marinated in hung curd, ginger garlic, deghi mirch, jeera powder and kasuri methi. The taste of tomato and cashew stands out, along with cream and butter.Chenna is the hero of Lehsun Palak Chenna. It melts in our mouths as we eat it along with ground spinach that carries a note of garlic.The crispy sweet jalebi is served on the streets of Punjab with rabdi and the same makes it to this restaurant, along with Ras Dates Malai. In the second, ground dates is smothered with soft Ras Malai.Approximate cost for a meal for two: `1,500"

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

These days however, the abundance of tempting roadside food and negligence in drinking enough clean water has made it easier to fall prey to infections, kidney stones and chronic kidney disease among other maladies. One does not understand the necessity of a healthy diet at an earlier age as the young body is capable of overcoming these disorders without much ado. It is only over time that one feels the long-term consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle and at this point usually the damage done is irreversible.Here are some pointers to follow to avoid dealing with unnecessary urinary troubles -A few simple tweaks to ones lifestyle can help ensure that the urinary system runs smoothly till a ripe old age. One must keep in mind that the above tips contribute to not just a healthy urinary system, they also lead to good health overall. A healthy lifestyle consisting of a good diet, enough physical activity and low stressors contributes towards strengthening the immune system and keeps the body running as efficiently as possible.Practice good hygieneBadly maintained public toilets are chock full of bacteria that are waiting to prey on unsuspecting victims. One must be careful and make the best use of toilet paper and water to keep their privates clean. Clean well before and after sex as well.Water water everywhere, stop and take a drinkWater flushes out all of the toxins in the body and keeps the cells at their most active. Do not underestimate the importance of this life giving liquid- not only does it energize your muscles and help in weight loss, it also keeps the skin clear and glowing. To help one remember to drink water: There are a number of mobile and desktop apps that post regular reminders to drink water. Keep a few full water bottles around at all times so that they can serve as a reminder to drink water. Buy some attractive water bottles or mark the water bottles.Careful with caffeineCaffeinated beverages like coffee act as a diuretic- which means that one will expel water from the body faster than usual. As long as one remembers to replace the lost water by drinking more water, caffeinated beverages can be enjoyed in moderation.Examine the dietIncluding a lot of water based fruits and vegetables in the diet will help give the body the water it needs to run smoothly. Watermelons, strawberries, cucumbers, and tomatoes are some examples of foods that are high in water content. Antioxidant rich foods such as blueberries help strengthen the bladder to fight away infections.Easy on the saltSalt is delicious but too much of it leads to water retention which is harmful for the body. A diet high in sodium leads to increased blood pressure which, if left uncontrolled results in kidney damage. One must also pay attention to the amount of sodium being consumed via packaged or canned foods.- Dr Anand Armugam, Apollo Spectra Hospitals"

Is their any connection? Yes, proves a group of head load workers who have joined hands with a few residents at the Kalikkotta Palace Road near Tripunithura Statue junction. The initiative has not only helped in curbing stray dog menace but has also yielded them good harvest of vegetables.How the dogs grew in numbersThe area near the Statue Junction was once a dumping yard for waste materials where people often dumped food and plastic waste during the night. It was common for stray dogs which hunt for food to camp in the area. Soon, the number of dogs visiting the spot increased, creating a threat to school children in the early hours of the day.Fed up by the foul smell emanating from the waste and the increasing number of dogs, the CITU head load workers whose office is located at Statue Junction decided to take matters in their own hands.We were thinking of a solution. This is when we realised that the area on the road side was lying vacant which is the major reason why people were using it as a dumping yard. If we use the land effectively and make them feel that the spot is not vacant, they will hesitate to dump waste there. After discussions, we came to a conclusion that vegetable cultivation was a good idea, said A M Manoj, a head load worker.Manoj, along with other workers Purushan, Raju, Babu, Pushkaran, Mohanan, Sasi, Johnson and Viswakumar decided to go ahead with the plan. As the cultivation will not affect the pedestrian movement, they were not worried about official sanction.We bought the seeds from the agri-outlet in Tripunithura and planted ladys fingers, tomatoes and cow peas initially. Seeing the success, we have planted more varieties like chinese potato (koorkka), green chilly and ginger, he added."

Chilli and other vegetables grown in the region have a good market in Tamil Nadu.Thousands of farmers who have grown varieties of vegetables using underground water and by judicious water management have also given up harvesting as the prices have crashed.The farmers have grown bullet chilli, beans, cabbage, potato, brinjal and flowers in hundreds of acres expecting good prices in Tamil Nadu market during Navaratri season.Farmers in Bommanahalli, Attigulipura, Siddaiahnapura, Chikkahalli, Chatra, Ankashettypura, Ramasamudra and other villages depend on Tamil Nadu markets particularly Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Mettuplayam and Madurai. They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court.

They now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.But, that is the least of Jayaramans worries. Ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said Jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.Consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said Jayaraman and his friend M Abdul Khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. This month, I had to send four of my 10 labourers to Bihar where they come from, since I couldnt afford them, Jayaraman added.Apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. For instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.Before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.As a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. Likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.In Koyambedu, Asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. Flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.While calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like Jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.If the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.Its not good for business.Produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apples from Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from Ganganagar in Punjab, seedless grapes from Solapur and sapotas from closer home in Tirupattur.The key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. Some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. We cannot do that, said Jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. If we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.So despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.Abdul Khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.In addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of Rs 1 per square feet a month.Hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, Rs 1,200 would have to be paid.However, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. The last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. So, were hopeful, Jayaraman said.On November 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere Rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at Rs 12.Last week, before Ammas death, it was Rs 7 per kg, said Abdul Khader."

The 45-year-old works for Ananda Foundation for Holistic and Healthy Learning and Living, where she helps schools, teachers and family with planning out the curriculum. Her home in Film Nagar in Hyderabad has a huge garden with a path leading to it from her kitchen.It is not a manicured garden as she believes in permaculture; a system where you directly utilise all the features observed in natural ecosystems. When you walk into her house, a shock of greenery welcomes you.Gardening for me has always been a passion since childhood, as my parents were vegetable gardeners and most of the fresh greens we consumed used to be from the farm or the ones we grew at home, she says. I could not continue farming once I moved to Hyderabad from Chennai as I got married and had kids. But for the past seven years I have been farming in a more organised manner.I grow a lot of vegetables in my garden such as tomatoes, chilli, greens, spinach, lemons broad beans, pomegranate, lettuce and gourds, she says. Maintaining a garden which produces so many vegetables is not easy. When asked about how she maintains it, she replies, If you are consistent, it is easy. I enjoy watering and looking after my plants. I have a gardener who is not good and does not listen to what you say. So, it does get tough to maintain at times.She advises people, saying, Everyone should grow their own vegetables. The nutritional value of a vegetable reduces when we buy from outside as we do not know what chemicals and pesticides they have used. We can also save a lot of water when we grow them at home as we can re-use water used to wash utensils and so on to water the plants. Composting is better than buying even organic fertilisers because it is home-made and saves the planet.I have plants inside my home which help in increasing the circulation of oxygen indoors, she further adds.For further details, please visit the Facebook page of Ananda Foundation and Art of the Heart."

Shut out of banks and starved of cash for inputs like fertilizer, seeds and pesticides, farmers across the south have slashed their rabi sowing, at some places by more than half the normal acreage.In Ballari, farmers who had already sown crops when Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were withdrawn from the market on November 8 are not much better off and face the risk of losing the investment they had already made. One farmer, Lepakshi Naidu in Hosapete taluk, Karnataka, said he had sown 30 acres of chilli prior to November 8 and now with banks allowing him to withdraw no more than Rs 2000 per day, he was unable to pay workers. The loss of crop over 30 acres could cripple his hopes, he said.Pesticide dealers confirmed that rabi sowing is down by 80 per cent in Ballari and by at least 40 per cent in Telangana, where a fertilizer trader said he would normally do business of Rs 20-25 lakh per day, but had not sold a single bag of fertilizer all week. Farmers across the peninsula said they would trade their produce for a deep discount if only they would be paid in low-denomination bills. But with no one having small notes, that was a remote possibility.For tomato farmers in Odisha, prices have fallen so low (Rs 2 per kg in Bargarh) that it was not even worthwhile to transport it to the market. Traders have been absent from auctions in the vegetable markets, and the only consignments moving are those that had been paid for before November 8. Not that such farmers are happier.Most have put their money in the bank and are now effectively shut out of any access to it. All told, its been a vicious cycle for farmers be it in Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Telangana. If in Kerala farmers are unable to repay their loans because their procurement incomes have been delayed, cultivators in Nalgonda, Telangana, said the loans from moneylenders and deposits in banks are out of reach as well while they pay interest on loans."

They are consultants to those wishing to nurture gardens of different sizes, as well.Minette shares some valuable information and tips with our readers.Watering requires to be done everyday, unless the soil is already wet/damp from the previous day. Among the herbs, rosemary is a delicate darling which requires some extra attention and care.Water your plants enough to keep the soil moist without over-watering (roots will rot in a soggy container). Let the top of the soil, or growing medium, dry out completely between watering and check moisture levels often. Mint, parsley does best in fairly moist soil, whereas rosemary, thyme and sage prefer soil that is only slightly moist.Herbs grow well in equal parts compost, sterile topsoil and builders sand. An all-purpose organic fertilizer can be added to this mix. The soil mix needs to drain well. Since they can thrive on any type of soil, the soil does not have to be completely organic. They are not often bothered by insect or disease pests. Neem oil works best in case of any diseases.Herbs can be grown in pots or on the ground. They require a minimum of 6 hours of bright sunlight and can be grown indoors where they get sufficient light. Indoors the advantage is no weeds, easy to access but the yield is less. A south west facing window will do well. Outdoors, the yield is larger, the herbs are more flavoursome.The beauty of herbs is that they can thrive on your kitchen window sill, balcony, patio etc as long as they get the required amount of sunlight and water. One can buy seeds from most garden stores. Most herbs are available as saplings and can be re potted into bigger pots or into the ground. Basil gives out flowers which dry into seeds. Once it flowers, it needs to be pinched and the seeds can be dried and grown. The same goes with garlic and onion chives.Seeds of annual herbs (basil, coriander, dill and oregano) can be started indoors and grown year round. Place a collection of popular culinary herbs in a sunny kitchen window and theyll be available when needed. Perennial herbs, like chives, parsley, sage, sweet marjoram and thyme, can be started from seed, but it is often easier to purchase young plants from a nursery. Because perennials grow for more than one season, its best to keep them outside in pots during the summer and bring them in if the winter is too cold.The Tale of a TeacherI am the proud owner of a farm in the heart of Bengaluru in Jayanagar. It is just a 3ft by 14 ft patch in my backyard but I call it a farm because in that small space I grow a variety of vegetables and herbs!says former teacher, Mythili Ramaprasad, her eyes sparkling with joy and pride. To make maximum use of the little soil in the patch and also the limited sunlight available, I grow climbers, shrubs, herbs and tubers.So there is a happy mix of pumpkin, turmeric, cherry tomatoes, sweet potato, colocasia( kesuvina soppu) along with curry leaves, chilies, mint, basil and ajwain ( dodpathre soppu) ,all growing in symbiosis. I have also tried growing climbers like passion fruit, chow and hyacinth beans ( avarekai) in the past which have given good yields.She says I took up gardening seriously as a hobby after I retired as a teacher. What began as a hobby has now become a passion. I love to spend time every morning in the garden, examining each plant and discover a fresh green shoot or a healthy new bud. It is very relaxing and has great therapeutic value. Very little investment is needed to plan a small kitchen garden. It is best if it is organically cultivated. Kitchen wastes like vegetable and fruit peels can be collected and buried in a pit in the soil.Sometimes the plants are attacked by caterpillars and insects which need immediate attention as they can seriously damage the plants and affect the produce. Monkeys can also be a menace and cause destruction.....she rues. And those who know Mythili Ramaprasad will tell you just how alert and vigilant she is especially when it comes to her beautiful garden!"

It had cabbage, onions, pepper, tomato ketchup sauce and garnished with a fried egg. Wouldnt you love to try that? I remember being the happiest little kid when my mom would cook her amazing meals for the family. I began to cook too. Actually, I wanted to join armed forces because I always admired their dedication and discipline. But I could not pursue it further; so I decided to be a chef, which also requires equally high levels of dedication and discipline. No regrets at all!Sujit MukherjeeThe first professional kitchen experience I had was peeling onions for a large banquet and I grew to cooking food for 2,800 people. I started my career in an Indian kitchen. The blend of spices and the union of flavours with exotic spices fascinate me. A lot of young people have no idea what this kind of job requires. Its tough; so try not to take this as an easy way out. Nowadays, chefs are in serious demand all over the world.Recently, we did a complete themed brunch which was based on molecular cuisine using techniques like sous vide, nitrogen cooking, gelling and spherification. Of course, certain experiments dont work out. I tried making a pizza pie with a twist but it didnt come out the way I wanted it too. Food is not just about cooking; I educate myself on flavour, taste and seasonality.You should try Spaghetti Aglio Olio with grilled chicken, which has a nice charcoal aroma of the chicken, caramelised garlic and extra virgin olive oil for that additional flavour. Its my favourite! Always use garlic and herbs in your dishes. While the former helps in controlling cholesterol, the latter helps in reduction of heart diseases.Ive got a good understanding of food and cuisines from other countries. A tip to aspiring chefs: eat a wide range of food and experiment with things; its the only way to update yourself in the present market. So start at the bottom and work your way up, learn and absorb as much as possible. Assisting in kitchens is essential to understand the industry on a deeper level. If you have that passion and youre willing to work hard, youll do well. And fast.As for me, Ive been in the kitchen for a long time and I soon want to travel to various places and try the local flavours there.Also, cook under the open sky and indulge in a nice warm chocolate souffl."

My father had a few acres of agriculture near Sadenahalli, around 16 km from Bengaluru. I grew up on the vegetables and other produce grown from the land, which inspired me to try my hand at terrace gardening.After my marriage in the mid 70s, I planted a small kitchen garden in our Rajajinagar house and grew beans, papaya and greens. When I shifted to Malleswaram, I became a member of the We Care for Malleswaram group. The groups focus was on educating residents on the segregation of wet anddry waste.The compost generated from the wet waste and the availability of abundant sunlight encouraged me to start my own terrace garden. Here I grow beans, greens, tomatoes and German Turnip, to name a few. I have not bought any greens from the market since 2013. When I started my garden, I had decided on two aspects -- no chemicals and judicious use of water.Today, I make manure from the wet waste generated from my own kitchen as well as my neighbours, leftovers from the pooja room, dry leaves and sour buttermilk.I have close to 150 pots on my terrace, in which I use an equal measure of coconut husk and manure. I keep experimenting with the crops and have managed to grow sweet potatoes, three varieties of brinjal, double beans, chickpeas, cucumber and bitter gourd. In addition, I also have basil, parsley, coriander, mint, green chilies and curry leaves. A portion of the beans and brinjal are left to age on the vines. Dried seeds are then collected and preserved for future plants.I also have a good variety of flowers, which are used for prayers. The remnants of the flowers post pooja are added to the compost bin. The garden terrace attracts honey bees and insects that aid in pollination too. I enjoy taking care of the plants and spend close to an hour every day tending them. It is a stress buster."

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

However, some enterprising people like Sunita Fatehpuria, a 66-year-old-housewife, manage to create their own garden and grow enough vegetables for a meal.Living in Tarnaka along with her family in a spacious independent house, gardening was not the first thing on her mind. However, she soon grew to love the plants, thanks to her mother, a certified green thumb. Today Sunita is an owner of a fruitful vegetable patch.Im happy to maintain this little space  which is the size of an average master bedroom. Water problems are aplenty and this is the reason I did not plant flowers. I feel that letting a flower die is a sin and on days when water is short, we barely meet our needs and the plants are left to wilt, she says.Her patch currently sprouts ladies fingers, spinach, mint, coriander, brinjals, bottle gourds, tomatoes and chilies, but lately, shes been noticing a batch of cucumbers growing as well! I never planted the cucumber seeds. Recent showers have caused havoc on my garden. Most of my crop got washed away or killed due to the excessive rains and the next thing I see is these wild cucumbers growing she adds, hinting at the almost flood-like situation the city saw last month.One of the major challenges of maintaining a garden is to ensure that the foliage does not get infected by pests. It gets even tougher when one avoids chemicals (as it destroys the nutrition in the vegetables). Sunita adheres to the philosophy of keeping everything au naturale.Using manure and neem cakes, she ensures that her vegetables get all the nutrition they need whilst remaining free of pests. Water for the plants comes from the boring water and occasionally government supplied water is used.Although she is glad to keep working on her own project for nearly three decades now, she confesses that it pains her that due to her age, she is forced to hire a few gardeners. ""But its a small compromise in exchange for a green and bountiful garden"". Now her aim is to ensure that her patch stays that way."

Monetary returns aside, working outdoors brings rich dividends for the young mind. It is fun, engaging and influences children to embrace sustainable livelihoods.According to Janani Eswar, founder of Growing in Nature (GRIN), a Bengaluru-based organisation that works in connecting children to nature, we are suffering from what Richard Louv calls nature deficit disorder. Children spend less time outdoors and more time indoors and on their screens, resulting in many behavioural problems.I met a seven-year-old who told me that tomatoes came from a supermarket. We are getting so disconnected from nature that we do not realise that working outside and with plants is not just a life skill but is as essential as speaking a language. Our bodies are built to be outside, so when children work outdoors, they are operating on an instinctive level and are forging deep connections with their surroundings. says Eswar, who also works with schools to devise curriculums that include nature as part of their teaching process.So why should children work in the garden and grow their own vegetables? When we get our hands dirty with soil and plants, the bacteria trigger serotonin or happy hormones in our brains. When we deprive ourselves of these natural anti-depressants, it leads to obesity, ADHD and depression, says Eswar.These three schools in Bengaluru have included organic farming as part of their curriculum right from the first standard. They grow their own produce, compost and teach their students advanced techniques like vertical terrace gardening and greenhouse farming.BM English SchoolLocated in Hennur, BM English School has been actively involved in gardening and organic farming for more than 6 years. With an organic vegetable and herb garden in the campus, its students display a remarkable knowledge of plants. They also produce vegetables that are used for the canteen and compost waste. The school's 'Green Club' actively participates in farming, grows and sells vegetables and also takes part in famous organic farming events in the city such as Oota From Your Thota. The organic farming module was put into place by Dr. Vishwanath Kadur, the most renowned urban agriculturalist in Bangalore and a pioneer in organic terrace gardening in the country.Says Dr. S Rajesh, Principal of BM English School, We have organic farming as part of the curriculum from grade 1. There is one class a week. Each group is given a patch of land to cultivate. The older children make their own organic pesticide using neem oil, clove and turmeric. We also do not use hybrid seeds and seed making is an important part of our curriculum. Children grow vegetables and take home the produce.Prakriya Green Wisdom SchoolPrakriya Green Wisdom School goes one step ahead of an organic farming curriculum - it strives to be an all-round sustainable campus that grows its own produce through recycled wastewater and places its children in an environment that turns them into conscious users. Children learn from nature and work on patches of soil right from nursery. The school does not encourage junk food. The campus is a no plastic zone and a conscious living practice is developed throughout the childs stay in the school.Says Rema Kumar, Director of Prakriya Green Wisdom School, The whole idea is that when children grow their own food, they become co-producers and understand that everything is interconnected, including chemicals in insecticides and how they destroy the soils health in the long run. Our canteens food is nutritious and we use a lot of local vegetables and fruits that we cultivate. Water consciousness is another keen focus area. We have rain water harvesting and we recycle the water that we use in the canteen and kitchen. The campus has more than 100 varieties of trees and is home to vegetables and fruits, mostly of the local variety, including papaya, mango, guava, rajma, beetroot, carrots and beans.Salads are prepared at least thrice a week and the school composts vegetable waste from the canteen and children are encouraged to never waste food.As a society, we are not doing enough to avert the problems that surround us. Our children will have to face their consequences so we w ant them to understand that water crisis can be averted by using really sensible water management systems that have been practiced over a million years,"" says Kumar."

Insects which feed on plants are called as pests. In nature, these pests are consumed by the predator insects, that are garden friendly or farmer friendly. However, chemical farming has collapsed this balancing system in nature. Chemical pesticides kill predators and pests resistance towards these chemicals as well. In natural farming, pest management is based on the principle of 'prevention is better than cure'. Weaker plants are easily susceptible to pest attacks while healthy plants don't get affected by pests and thrive best if they grow in good quality soil. Humus is the best way to create healthy soil. Humus could be created by adding biomass and beneficial micro organisms to the soil. Desi cow dung and cow urine are the best sources of beneficial micro organisms. Creating healthy soil as well as the following simple gardening tips will help you to make your garden absolutely healthy.Plant protection tips for your gardenSeeds should be treated with a microbial culture before sowing, which gives protection from all fungal diseases.Providing proper space between plants will facilitate aeration and avoid spreading of disease between the plants.Marigold can be grown around the garden, as a trap crop. The yellow flower attracts pests and secures the main vegetable plants.Grow companion plants. When vegetables are grown with herbs, the herbs act as a repellent plant for pests. Tomato and tulsi can be grown in the same pot.Crop rotation should be followed. Grow different plants instead of same plants in each container. For example tomato - beans - onion can be grown consecutively in one year.Grow maize and cow pea in between vegetable plants. The maize and cow pea foliage attracts pests and prevent other vegetable crops from getting affected.If any plant or plant part gets affected by insects, remove the affected pant or plant part manually and use it for composting.Growing marigold and castor plants once in a while in the pot which will give protection from root nematodes.Have lights in the garden during night hours. The nocturnal pests, which are active during night time will get attracted by lights and does not affect the plants.Take a piece of yellow colour chart paper and apply castor oil on both sides and tie it on the plant. Adult pest insects get attracted by the yellow colour and acts as a sticky trap.Nursery trays could be covered with a mesh/net to avoid the fly attackAdd neem cake with the potting mixture to give protection from root diseases.All the above prevention measures give maximum control over pests. In case any further pest incidence to be observed in the garden then go for a repellent spray, which will not kill the pest but give a repellent effect to the pests.These tips will help you to get rid of the pests from the garden. If you still find any pest infestation then use a neem based spray on weekly intervals until it is controlled.For more information on urban farming or any other related queries contact author at nalini@artyplantz.com"

You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

I dont know why I dont like them, says the actor, politician who has been a part of the film industry since the early 1980s.A Nature lover, she is very fond of her plants and treats them with all the love and care. I have my own terrace garden and every morning, Im there. Though I dont water the plants, I talk to them and love seeing the little ones bloom. I believe that the more you talk, the more they happily bloom. Apart from flowers that she has been growing for years, four months back, a vegetable garden found its place on her terrace.Radish, spinach, brinjal, tomato, beans and chillies  its a proper kitchen garden. For a long time I have been wanting it but a kitchen garden requires a lot of personal attention. So, till I could personally be involved, it didnt make sense to set up the vegetable patches. Its been four months now and its looking good, says the Nature lover who buys the seeds from a nursery on ECR Road and adds egg shells and tea leaves from her kitchen into the manure mix.Kushboo believes in personal care and claims that her plants dont bloom like usual when she isnt around. Yes, there are people who take care of them when Im travelling erratically but when I come back, I see the changes... they havent bloomed well enough. Im not happy when I dont take care of the plants myself, says the actor who loves anything green.Sharing her school-time memories, she tells us about the date palms and tamarind trees. We would run early to school, collect the dates, wash and eat them. I would also climb the tamarind trees to pick the white flowers. No, no one stopped us. Our school was cool that way, she grins.You know when I lose my cool? When the plants are withered or dried up, and not taken care of. Nobody taught me how to garden properly nor is anyone in my family interested. I taught myself through trial and error. They need proper trimming and have to be watered according to the season, with an understanding of their needs! she further says."

The second time she repeated Gadagada gudugudu.. gadagada gudugudu, even the adults joined her. Asha, who hails from a teaching background, belongs to the Chennais Storytellers Association. I was told stories while having food. I was so fascinated by this, I took up storytelling. As a storyteller, I believe in reviving old stories, traditions and passing them to the younger ones, said Asha.But what was the gadagada, gudugudu all about? Well, Asha was narrating the story of Krishna Rao who owns the Woodlands Hotel, a city landmark. As she finishes the story, Sharanya went on stage and begins dancing to the songs of the good old Madras. She enlightens the kids about five things Madras is famous for  the Marina beach, hot idlis with a variety of chutney, the Vandaloor zoo, Sem Mozhi Poonga and the Rajni craze. As she finishes, Banu jumps onto the stage and narrates the story of Thiruverkaadu Amman temple.The trio has been associated with storytelling for many years, and now has learnt new tricks to ensure kids can relate to what they say. Well, a few kids grasp immediately, while a few look at our actions and pick it up slowly. For some others, it is the rhyming words and songs that help them understand what is told. So when it comes to Madras Day stories, we try and incorporate all of these so that they can relate it to, says Sharanya.Today, Chennai has many heritage buildings and sites. How important is it for kids to know about these historic structures? I personally feel its very important for all of us who stay/live in this city to know about its history and heritage, says Banu. Of all the places that have become history, Asha says she misses the Moore Market complex most. Well, I treasure the hours I spent shopping there. I still remember buying books for 90 paisa, a basket for 25 paisa and I miss that place a lot.As she finishes, Sharanya drifts her thoughts to the days when Drive-in Woodlands was a happening-spot in the city. The bread and peas that used to be served there for breakfast used to be my favourite. The bread would be toasted with butter on plain tawa with the onion, tomato and green peas curry. Even today I pine for it, she laughed."

I specialise in North Indian cuisine, and I love cooking Rajasthani, Kashmiri and Bengali. Although I havent tried South Indian cuisine much, Ive learnt one item, Ardha Pathi or Adai, which my boss in Delhi loves.Indian cuisine is vast and there are so many things to experiment with, so I would still say that I am in the learning process. In the south, although there are many North Indian restaurants, I always find that theres a South Indian touch to it, just like how I cook South Indian food in Delhi. I use curry leaves instead of coriander in sambhar, and people like it that way there. The base for North Indian cuisine is onions and tomatoes. Like in the south, people use tamarind to get a sour flavour, in the north we use tomatoes to give a tangy touch. Today, I find people are open to all kinds of cuisines, and they want a change from the routine they are used to.I believe in cooking authentic food rather than innovative food. Im not against fusion, but I feel it can be adopted while presenting a dish rather than while preparing it. Let me share a funny incident that I faced in a restaurant a few years back. I had ordered a kofta, and the way they presented it was funny. It had a cup with gravy, a loaf of crispy bread placed over the cup and the kofta balls placed aside. However, the beauty of the dish is that the kofta balls should be soaked in the sauce/gravy! (laughs)Some of my vegetarian specialties are Butte ke Kabab, made from corn kernels, nuts and spicies, which are made into patties and cooked in kebab style. This is a vegetarianNorth Indian dish. In non-vegetarian, my specialities include Tandoori Jinga, Chicken Tikka and Tandoori Chicken.The kind of ingredients used play a major role in making sure the taste is retained in a dish. Today even in the south, we get all the ingredients required to cook North Indian food. But there are a few exceptions like the kachri powder (used to bring a sour taste to a dish), which I bring from Delhi. When it comes to dessert, the main difference is that North Indian desserts do not use coconut at all, while in the South, several desserts have coconut as a base."

Most of the Kudumbasree units are already engaged in organic farming in their respective areas.The programme has been titled as Harvest in three cents (Moonu centil veetham polivu). As part of the project all Kudumabsree members will also grow vegetables at their houses, utilising available space.Those who are interested in farming will be supplied with seeds and saplings through panchayats. For students, the same will be supplied through schools. Organic manure will be supplied on a subsidised rates to those who take up farming.Meanwhile, most of the local bodies have launched various initiatives as part of Haritha Keralam.At Amballoor panchyat, organic cultivation was launched on nearly two and a half acres of land. The vegetables being grown here include long beans, ladys finger, spinach, tomato and plantain.With this initiative, we are planning to carry out the ward level plans for organic farming to another level, said Amballoor panchayat president Jalaja Mohan.The two and a half acres at Poyyattithazham will be used for the cultivation. A group of farmers from the panchayath has already agreed to carry out the work. The vegetables will be cultivated organically by using compost and cow dung as the main manures, she added."

His action resulted from acute frustration over plummeting market price of tomatoes which stood at Rs 50 a box. Hailing from Anantapur, the farmer had spent Rs 60 per box in just bringing his produce to the city.This is not an isolated case and is bound to have happened, say experts, attributing it to demonetisation. It has not made it easy, but added on to the misery of small and marginal farmers, that started two years ago with severe drought in TS and AP.These small and marginal farmers have not seen the light of the day for two years now. Leave alone recovering costs of cultivation and making profits, they are not earning anything to make ends meet, remarked Pidigam Saidaiah, assistant professor, Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University.Small and marginal farmers have shifted to cultivating short-term crops because of drought.Also, productivity of horticulture crops is high during winter. Hence there is a lot of supply. With no money and people opting to buy from markets and going cashless, these farmers are running in loss, pointed Saidaiah.The cost of cultivation in this season can be estimated to be Rs 6 per kg and an added Rs 2 for transportation. While the official cost was Rs 4 per kg on Wednesday, this farmer was quoted Rs 2 for his produce.You cannot even call it a no loss or no profit. He also has to go back and there is no guarantee that he would sell all of it, said Saidaiah, adding that this has become the trend with farmers selling horticulture crops that include fruits and vegetables."

This green inititative comes from a group of women under the banner of Women Entrepreneur Belagavi (WEB) Association.They have launched these idols made of natural clay, in association with a Bengaluru-based organisation. These idols, instead of creating pollution after Visarjan (immersion), grow into plants.What is interesting is that you dont have to take the idol to any water body for immersion. It can be done at your home itself without creating any kind of pollution.Sonia Netalkar of WEB said the height of the statue is 10 inches and the base tub about 8 inches. The total weight of the set is about 5 kg, she added.Explaining the concept of a green Ganesha, she said the statue is placed at the base filled with organic coco peat.She said: Coco peat is very light, highly compressible and readily absorbs and retains moisture. All of these factors make it perfect for horticultural applications.Sonia said the idol is filled with Tulsi and tomato seeds. During the immersion, the devotee will just have to place the set in a gallery or terrace or garden and pour water on it.In about three days, the idol dissolves and seven days later, one can find a sapling of tomato or tulsi grown in that same base, she said.As this is a novel concept, we need to spread awareness. This year we want to sell 108 idols, each costing `1,151. Already more than 60 idols have been booked, she said.Rasika Kadolkar of WEB said these green idols will make the festival pollution-free without diluting the spirit of the celebrations.According to the pollution control board officials, Plaster of Paris idols may take several months to years to fully dissolve.

An auction takes place there. Traders from a wide area come to pick up huge volumes of vegetables. Its a unique market. The bids begin past midnight and the deals last through the wee hours. Prahallad Sahu hasnt been there in more than a week. Its 10 km from his village of Kalangapali but whats the point?There have been good years for Prahallad there but 2016 has been different. Tomato was going for a measly Rs 2 a kg, so he decided not to hire labour and made his family harvest the crop. Some of this seasons produce was picked up for that paltry price but the traders came to the village to pick it up. The rest is rotting in field.Vegetables had been a fetching crop for farmers in Bargarh block in previous years. This year too the yields had been bumper but then demonetisation drove the traders away. The only traders turning up in the market are those who had buy-back deals with farmers and had paid in advance. They got by the challenge of procuring fertilizers and seedlings by arranging credit, but paying for labour has no such solution. Many of the farmers have money in the bank but there are limits on how much you can withdraw.Winter is when vegetable prices soar. So theres hope when this demonetisation thing ends on Dec 30. When this crisis is over and we can sell vegetables for some profit again, said Uddhaba Deep, a farmer in Jamurda village. No one in Bargarh has read Shaktikanta Dass latest time horizon for that.Farmers who had already sold their produce before Narendra Modis bombshell on Nov. 8 ought to be happier, but they arent. Bipin Biswal is a cabbage farmer who sold his harvest before Nov. 8 and put his money in the bank. Now its locked and he cant pay his labourers. Really, the only lucky ones have been those who engaged local labourers. Villagers here have revived an age-old to cope with demonetization: they pay them in rice and vegetables. Farmers who employed migrant workers dont the luxury or barter.Bidyadhar Pradhan owes his labour contractor Rs 43,000. He can withdraw a maximum of Rs 24,000 per week from the bank. If he chooses to pay off the labourers as they are breathing down his neck, he has to forego preparing his field for the rabi rice. Hes got some tight management to do: he feeds his labourers twice a day and plies them with tea so they will a bit longer. Or, if the stars will it, his kharif crop will be sold and there will be money to pay them off.Some farmers said the heck with it and sold to any trader who will pay them in cash at whatever price, profit or loss, throwaway or handsome. Vegetable grower Shatrughan Mallick got rid of his entire lot of ladies fingers at one go. At least I got some money, he said.Take away the gnawing demonetization worries, villages in Bargarh have been sent back in time to days when apparently -- like in the Desh ki Dharti movies of the 1950s and 1960s -- kind neighbours helped out in each others fields and sang songs when the rain came. Since everybody is in the same boat, the merchants and traders of Bargarh are being sympathetic to the farmers, offering fertilizer and pesticides on credit.The villagers are ignorant but they never cheat and are very conscious of their prestige in the village. So they repay immediately after receiving the proceeds of their harvest, said a local merchant.Funny how the cashless economy has put rural India in the warm embrace of feudal practices."

The buffet will be at offer for guests and visitors on December 24 and 25 and is likely to feature close to 20 desserts, he adds.The roasted pumpkin soup was a warm and traditional start to the dinner. The soup is soothing, with the pulp mashed to a puree, leaves a hint of garlic and thyme taste. The pine nuts adds a crunchy bite to the soups.The Chicken Consomme looks like green tea with shreds of coriander leaves. The soup is thinner than the usual chicken broths, the consomme is carved into the shape of a rose and is stuffed with minced chicken.The Eggplant Parmigiani won the festive spread, with the vegetables spiced circlular slices baked well, with a smoky skin on, aligned over each other.The tomato sauce tastes of a pure extract and garlic. Although not a fan of cheese layered over eggplant, here the whole ensemble just melts in the mouth and the acidity of the tomato sauce strikes the right balance for deliciousness.The mushroom lasagna too is a tomato puree based vegetarian preparation. The tiny button mushroom chops are layered between the lasagna sheets and served with the garlic-tomato sauce and topped with basil. Enjoyed the dish, but my mind still wanders around how tasty the parmigiani was.Despite being a dessert person, this ensemble was a bit of a disappointment for me.The plum cake in a star cutout was just a regular tasting one and nothing extraordinary and same goes for the most desserts on my table.The pumpkin pie would be my best bet if you wish to end your meal on a sweet and satisfactory note."

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments. As for those investors who want to set up something, we provide the expertise.Meanwhile, Mariem is looking forward to coming back to Kochi in the future. I love the place, she says."

BJP think tank here feels that too much activism in the case has given more publicity to the former MP than she deserves.Elders in the BJP as well as its fringe groups feel that the film actress has been known for her inhospitable statements in the past too and there is no point in making her a public hero by giving her all undue publicity. Even her appreciation of Pakistan should have been ignored as it is inconsequential in the present situation. By overdoing it, we are in fact playing into the hands of the Congress party, they said.Mysuru-Kodagu MP Pratap Simha has already gone on record saying what was the need to send her to Pakistan for SAARC youth conference as she is not a peoples representative.Lok Sabha member from Dakshina Kannada Nalin Kumar Kateel who is now camping in Kerala overseeing the arrangements for a BJP national executive meeting told Express that Ramya is a novice in politics and has strange ways of reacting to issues. She does not deserve so much attention, he said.Ramyas mood in Mangaluru was jovial on Thursday. She never stopped smiling during her four-hour outing in the city despite being subjected to humiliations. Youth Congress leaders who accompanied her said she was happy for all the attention she got.Public attention and media glare has made her a hit in not just the coast but elsewhere, they said.Ramya has lost mental balance, say BJP workersMandya: BJP party workers staged a protest against former MP Ramya condemning her statement that Pakistan is not hell.

However, the free food is being wasted by some pilgrims leaving others hungry.Owing to a heavy rush during Krishna Pushkaralu, around 55 voluntary organisations and philanthropists have set up stalls in the 20 Pushkar Nagars to feed the pilgrims. Vegetable biryani, lemon rice, curd rice, tomato rice and sambar rice are being offered to the pilgrims at many makeshift tents. In the wake of consecutive holidays during the weekend, voluntary organisations made elaborate arrangements to feed as many as pilgrims they can.But the situation was different at many Pushkar Nagars as many dumper bins were seen filled with the excess food thrown away by the pilgrims. Pilgrims who arrived late at the Pushkar Nagars, were forced to return with empty stomachs as the food packets were exhausted.Karanam Jogayya, pilgrim from Lakkavarapu Kota in Vizianagaram district, expressed his dissatisfaction over the officials for their failure in monitoring the food supply near the Pushkar Nagars. I cant afford the food at roadside eateries which were being sold out at an exorbitant prices. The voluntary organisations should not confine themselves to particular area, they should spread their activity to other places to feed the hungry, he said.Most of the pilgrims at Pushkar Nagar near Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) and city railway station had bitter experience and left the place with hunger. We have prepared estimations to supply lemon rice and sambar rice for 30,000 pilgrims per day, said D Chalapathi Rao, an NGO volunteer at PNBS.From Day One of Krishna Pushkarams, Chalapathi Rao said that they have noticed that most of the pilgrims were taking excess food as a precautionary measure but throwing it away after all of them ate. To reduce wastage, we deployed additional volunteers near the queue lines to control the food wastage. Every pilgrim should feel responsible and extend their support in controlling the food wastage, he maintained.Meanwhile, the roadside eateries and hotels dotting the main stretches increased the rates of eatables and were fleecing the pilgrims. Pilgrims complained that the roadside eateries and hotels were charging anywhere around `10-20 per dish in excess of the prices mentioned in the menu. If opposed, many hotel staff were asking the pilgrims to leave. Some hotels have adopted a clever tactic. Though prices were not changed, they have reduced the quantity per each dish, said Raghavendra, a kirana shop owner."

Moreover, since it is located on the canal bund and restrictions have been imposed on vehicle movement in the area, even if the wholesale market is kept open it will not be accessible. The local vendors are sourcing the vegetable from other areas and hence, the increase in prices coupled with the shortage of vegetables, said K Sivashankar, a roadside vegetable vendor in Satyana rayanapuram.Out of fear, people are hoarding veggies in large quantities for the next 12 days. Even if vegetables arrive tomorrow, the cost may touch the sky. So, we are buying and stocking them for the next fortnight, explained P Sirisha of Ayodhya Nagar.However, the marketing officials in Krishna district say there is no need to worry. We decided to open rythu bazaars in the city, round-the-clock during Krishna Pushkarams. We are also operating as many as 20 mobile rythu bazaars in areas that are at considerable distance from the nearest rythu bazaar, said J Ravi Kumar, assistant director of marketing.There are six rythu bazaars in the city including the one at Ibrahimpatnam and running them round-the-clock will certainly help. When pointed out that potatoes, tomatoes and onions are not grown in Vijayawada region and have to be imported from other parts, the official said they have made alternate arrangements even though restrictions on vehicles have been imposed in Vijayawada.The government itself will supply potatoes, onions and tomatoes to rythu bazaars during Pushkarams. Potatoes are being imported from Agra and Indore, onions from Maharashtra and tomatoes from Madanapalle in Chittoor district, said Ramesh Babu, officer in-charge of Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar but public, continues to be apprehensive."

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

She entered Patnagarh via Gaiselet in Bargarh district where her vehicle was first attacked with eggs. She was shown black flags at Dalpali.As Chhuria ignored it and moved ahead, similar demonstration was staged at Ramji Chowk in Patnagarh town. The police, who were clueless, changed the route. But the move proved futile and the Ministers vehicle came under attack at the bus stand and at Dhumabhata Chowk of the town. The workers hurled eggs and tomatoes at the vehicle.While police took BJP worker Dhananjay Rout into custody at Ramji Chowk, partys district secretary Shailabala Bag and Mahila Morcha leader Pramodini Bhorasagar were detained at Dumabhata.An undeterred Chhuria went ahead and attended the programme at Subhadra Bhawan of the town before proceeding to Khaprakhol to attend the next programme.Chhuria said she was unperturbed by the incident as she had come to work for the welfare and uplift of women. People should understand that the area is lagging behind in development and things need to be set right for their benefit. Politics and development of the area are two different things and it is not right to mix the two, she said.Police, who were caught unawares, detained three BJP workers, including two women, for their alleged involvement in the incident.The detention kicked off another storm with Balangir district BJP president Bhaktabandhu Nayak claiming that policemen were deployed to pick up women BJP workers. The BJP also gheraoed Patnagarh police station protesting detention of BJP workers and demanding their release.Admitting that BJP workers had hurled eggs, Nayak said the Minister was scheduled to attend three State Government programmes in Patnagarh sub-division but local MLA K V Singhdeo was invited only for the Monday evening function making it difficult for him to be present. It was an intentional agenda of the ruling BJD and will not be tolerated, Nayak added.On September 13, eggs were pelted at the vehicle of Agriculture Minister Pradip Maharathy during his visit to Balangir."

His grandmother cooks traditional dishes using unique ingredients. She uses bamboo shoots, small fish, local tomatoes, salt and local fresh red chilies which is gently stuffed in cleaned bamboo tubes and covered with banana leaves. It is then placed in charcoal where the dish is cooked. The dish is called Pongsen.

In Ernakulam market, the wholesale and retail vegetable merchants have already begun to feel the heat with the sales registering a 20 to 40 per cent dip. The prices will likely pick up in the coming days, they hoped.The prices of perishable veggies like tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, chillies, okra and drumsticks have gone down. Vegetables like tomatoes, which are available through all seasons, are bought by wholesalers on the basis of the demand. Though there is a genuine demand for tomatoes among customers, the retailers are in a tough spot due to lack of lower denomination notes which can be given out as change.Some retail vegetable vendors were left with no other option than accepting the old Rs 500 notes. Most of the vendors urged the customers to buy veggies for at least a minimum of Rs 300 if they were to accept the old Rs 500 note. Every political party which comes to power brings in new policies and these create difficulties for the public, said Bhava, resident of Kadavanthra.The retail vendors said that on Saturday and Sunday, they had to sell their vegetables at a price lesser than the market in order to sell off the stock.

Many denizens in the city wrap themselves in their woollens and head to the Old City. The delicious gourmet itinerary, of course, leads them to the bowlfuls of nalli nihari, paaya, marag, and kaleji gurda washed down with piping hot Irani Chai.What is common about these comfort winter food items is that they are all made from juicy mutton/beef chunks or succulent chicken. But what about those who, by choice or not by choice, are hard-core vegetarians? Do they have a choice? Well, if you are a vegetarian and want to beat the winter chills we bring to you the list of delights that are prepared only with veg ingredients and keep you equally warm as would a liver pie do. Read on to mark the same in your winter bucket list:Classic Cheese LasagnaThis one dish can never fail you. Thick cheese layered with lasagna sheets and a whole gamut of other finger-licking ingredients like cherry tomatoes, button mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers and, of course, marble onions. What actually keeps you warm is the use of basil and oregano - the herbs known for their unique warmth-providing properties. A dig into the sinful layers and you feel comforted immediately - the rich taste stays with you till you head to bed. Recommended places: 10D, Deli9 and Autumn Leaf Cafe.Date palm halwaRich in nutrients and a handful of these desert fruits ensures that your energy levels remain high during the day. Sweet in itself, the fruit when cooked, doesnt need any sugar in it. Preparation of halwa just needs a box of fresh juicy date palms de-seeded and cooked on slow flame in milk. The result is a smooth mixture dark like winter night itself. A few spoonfuls with a glass of milk provides warmth enough to beat the chill.Mewa laddooWell, ask your grandmother and shell tell you the tales of mortal and pestle crushing those ochre coloured nuts into a granular powder that would be mixed with sugar, some ghee and translucent chunks of fried edible gum. The result - globules of warmth. Have two of these laddoos in the morning and you are set to take off your jacket even if the weathermans chill wind prediction comes true. Almond House is the best place to get a boxful.Beetroot RisottoFaint scarlet with that mix of fresh herbs - this is a must-try. The richness of seasonal vegetables paired with goat cheese makes this dish winter essential bringing to you the feel of balmy Italian afternoons. You can relish beetroot risotto at Tuscany, Trident Hyderabad with champagne or white wine. Shares chef Manik, Such foods are real comforters even if they are prepared with vegetables. Our bodies respond wonderfully to the produce of the season."

The ginger and garlic flavoured soya chunks, steamed in a bamboo were quite easily forgetabble. The chicken however, with a similar treatment was flavourful and well emulsified with the spices.The drumstick soup is thick, with palak and dal adding consistency to its texture. The soup stands by its name, tastes of dumstrick extract, dal and leaves a pepper hit in the end.The corn fried with til, served with garlic sauce leaves an oily after taste and the primary falvour you get is of the batter and cooked corn.The fixed vegetarian meal is soothing, filling and definitely my best take away from the place.The dal is took thick in consistency, for those who like it a little thinner and liquid-y, give this one a miss.The sambar and rasam is much like it is cooked in any South Indian household, same goes for the vermicelli paysam, which wasnt warm. However, paysam is served cold at some places, I learnt later.My recommendation from the place is the tomato chutney - a very simple mash of the vegetable with no mixing of sorts, the ginger pickle and the gongura - a traditional Andhra chutney.Experiment with the non vegetarian cuisine, if you are a meat lover, but if like me, you favour the greens, keep it simple and fixed meals order maadi!Nandhana Palace has inaugurated Amarvathi Foods Special at Shakaranagar."

And it gets spicier when it comes to colloquial and cuisine. What better way to witness the same on chefs table? Thats why we got to sample food prepared by chefs from North and South at K&K, ITC Kakatiya. Whats interesting to note that the food festival is titled Bade Miyan, Chhote Miyan. The celebrity chef Imtiaz Qureshi was supposed to come, but couldnt make it. Instead, chef Nisar Waris from ITC Maratha came and joined hands with chef Aamer Jamal and rustled up Awadhi dishes with a one or two Dakhani delights.One thing that ruled the roost was the use of kewra and silver varak on the dishes. For example, Murgh Chaandi Tikka lived up to its name wrapped in thin too-delicate-to-touch silver. And it was not just the tikkas, Kakori Kebab, too had hints of the thin-like-air silver foil. Chefs brought on table dishes cooked with traditional methods that were and are unique. Murgh Khushk Purdah was one such dish. No, the chicken pieces werent hidden anywhere, the pot in which the chunks were put was covered with dough that had turned crisp with heat.Inside, the meat was cooked with greentbell peppers, chunks of tomatoes and some red wine. Explained chef Jamal, This was the traditional method of cooking. The use of wine is more to do with English battalions and officers invited at the royal dinners of Awadh. This is a typical dum cooking method in which the dough layer, better known as purdah, is savoured with the curry inside.The recipes are from the star chef Imtiaz Qureshi himself. The food items have prepared with traditional dum method and thats why the pieces dissolve in the mouth and are so well-cooked.The festival will be on till October 2. Its only for dinner and is priced at `3,000++ taxes"

The dossier addressed key areas that the Central, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments must concentrate on to ensure for the smooth enforcement of the much awaited bill.The central government had on June 14 released a model law comprising 169 sections. We have gone through those sections and we are recommending a set of aspects which need to be clarified, said co-chairman of FTAPCCI JS Kasunendra.The recommendations are a set of aspects which need to be clarified. FTAPCCI has already submitted the recommendations to the Centre on the business module consisting of registration, payment, return and refund, said Ravindra Modi, President of FTAPCCI. We are going to submit the same to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and also to the empowered committee of state finance minister on GST, he added.The Telangana state government had on Tuesday ratified the Bill, thus becoming the tenth state to do so. After fulfilling the requirement of ratification from 15 states the bill is now at the table of the President of India for his approval.Speaking on the key sectors that will need careful intervention from the central government, Ravindra Modi said We have identified some key areas that need to be discussed, the food processing industry is one of them. Take an example of food processing industry where the farmer who sells tomato or mango do not pay tax but the converted products like ketchup and mango pulps need to be pay taxes,. There is no input credit from those products. The consumer is bearing the tax of those products. So we recommend the government to extend the deemed input tax credit to the food processing industry. Similarly the subsidy in the fertilizer industry will also have to pay GST so subsidy should be excluded from the preview of GST, he added.One of the important issues is dual control. The GST will be controlled by both central and state governments. We recommend to have a single control and it should be a rotating method, said S Tirumalai, advisor of FTAPCCI.We want the Central government to provide an educational guide about the GST. Majority of the industries and businesses are not clear about the GST law. We intend to help the business and industrial sectors to get a clear idea about the law, he added."

We have enough tomato and other vegetables stocks, which we import from India only in case of shortages in the domestic market,"" he said.The reason behind the ""suspension"" of cotton imports from India was, nevertheless, different, he said.""No. We have not stopped cotton imports from India. It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions. We're looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong,"" Shami said.He said only those cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes where importers had already secured permits from his department and carried phyto-sanitary certificates.""Our cotton consignments are not being allowed to enter Pakistan through Wagah and Karachi for reasons known to the ministry but cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn is being brought in without any let or hindrance. At least 11 trucks of Indian yarn entered Pakistan on Thursday when the department stopped cotton consignments from coming to this side of the border,"" a textile factory owner told Dawn.He said the suspension of cotton import from India would create a huge problem for the textile exporters as the truncated domestic crop target of 11.25 million bales for this year appeared difficult if not impossible to meet.""The industry requires 14 million bales. We will still be short by three million bales of cotton even if the crop target is achieved,"" he said.He said cotton shortages after the ban on Indian imports would make domestic prices shoot up at the expense of exports.Pakistan had imported 2.7 million bales of cotton (1 baleis 170 kgs) - about 40 per cent of India's total cotton exports in 2015-16 - due to crop failure that wiped off 0.5 per cent of GDP growth.

Cooked to perfect thick consistency, the tomato flavour drumstick leaf soup is creamy and delectable.

For starters, there are Palkatti Chukka, Kaikari Kola Urundai, Chettinadu Egg Roast, Chicken Leg Roast and Kuvepoo Kara Varuval.Palkatti Chukka is batter-fried paneer cubes tossed in Chettinad masala. The crunchy cubes are served along with generous amount of lightly fried curry leaves and shallots. The Kaikari Kola Urundai are fried balls of minced vegetables coated with bread crumbs. They are laced with Chettinad spices. Boiled egg is fried crispy for Chettinadu Egg Roast. They taste zesty.The Chicken Leg Roast is tawa roasted. The sounf-flavoured chicken drumsticks are juicy. Marinated with spices, the drumsticks are pan fried. This crunchy appetiser has a blend of ground masala and curry leaves. The Kuvepoo Kara Varuval has some crispy fried cauliflower florets tossed in Chettinad spices. Though the name suggests Kara, meaning spicy, it is not spicy at all.All the preparations are garnished with curry leaves lending them a strong aroma and flavour to the food. Though the Chettinad cuisines are believed to be spicy and rich, these food preparations are made less spicy, customised to the taste of the Bengalureans. Though, towards the end, everything tastes the same.For the main course, there is the Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryani. Both look appetising and colourful but, on tasting, the dish is mediocre.

Of the four crore eggs, nearly 50 per cent remain unsold after demonetisation.We cannot stop production and at the same time have to feed the live birds which involves huge cost.The poultry industry provides livelihood to a significant section of rural population, Reddy said.As government has been accepting old currency notes as payment for property tax, water and power bills and arrears, it should also accept old currency notes to purchase eggs and chicken, at least for next three weeks.Reddy also wanted the bankers to impose a moratorium on loan repayment by poultry farmers for a year.Telangana Poultry Federation president Erraballi Pradeep Rao said vegetables as well as non-vegetarian food are perishable in nature.Thus, the government should accept old notes to purchase eggs and chicken till the stocks are sold out.The months of November and December are crucial for the poultry industry as production is high during this time, besides consumption of chicken also being high.Therefore, the state government should realise the issue and accept old currency notes of the denomination `500 and `1,000 to purchase eggs and chicken for few weeks, Pradeep Rao said."

I could draw parallels between the spicy chunky tomato salsa to Indian tomato chutney grinded at home as the Mexican cuisine festival was made more Indian by the chefs at My Caf restaurant in My Fortune. Had it not been for the texture and cheese I would have easily been mistaken. The Tex-Mex festival which has been on-going since November 23 will host its final round this weekend.First we had Cheese Quesadillas, which is in fact Tortillas, a traditional bread of Mexico made either from corn or wheat and rolled in circles, just like roti. Grilled bell pepper and goat cheese was sandwiched between the tortillas. Salsa sauce and sour cream was served along with boiled veggies that made the plate a visual relish.Next came the Enchiladas, which was another version of tortilla cuisine. Filled with goat cheese and veggies and coated with shredded cheese, the hint of spicy Enchilada sauce was a mild zing. The salty and mild cheese balanced the hotness of sauces.Fish cakes, served after the Enchiladas was the show stealer. As a lover of seafood, I savoured the juicy fish meat. The fish fillet was shallow fried and kept tangy with the essence of lime. The first bite was like a drizzle in my mouth.Then Tacos abounding in jalepenos, tomatoes, yellow capsicum, chicken pieces, lettuce and pineapples followed, which was refreshing to taste. The tacos were soft and cunchy. The sour cream was in harmony with the outpouring and moist goat cheese.The food was kept true to its a la carte nature and it is ideal if you want to grab some Indian-Mexican bites with some chilled beer. But I did expect a bit more variety especially with the sauces. Salsa and sour cream is almost overrated for all Mexican cuisine. Where are my Guacamole Taquero and Chiltomate at?"

One fine morning, executive chef Prakash Chettiyar and he headed to Kozhikode to unravel the magic that left many drooling. They visited the kitchens of Kozhikodes favourite and famous food haunts, tasting and learning the secrets.And, for those who want to have a taste of the treasure (read: handful of tasty tips), one can have it at the month-long Kozhikodan food festival, going on at Cassava, Kochi Marriott.We wanted to know why people thought the Kozhikodan variety was supreme. That was the whole motive behind the journey. It is not just about the biriyani, but other dishes like the fish curry, too. Undoubtedly, Kozhikode is a foodies haven. The journey in search of food gave us the first-hand experience, says Saji.He also learnt some valuable biriyani lessons: the first being the meat used. In chicken biriyani, the difference lay in the chicken used. The taste of Kozhikodan biriyani is the white leghorn breed. The meat is firm but very juicy. That makes a lot of difference, says the chef.Even the spices are minimal. There isnt an excess of flavours. The balance is perfect, says the chef, who has replicated the technique at Cassava, including the cooking method.Slow cooking is the key. It should be the heat that cooks, and not the flame. It takes over one hour and 40 minutes to prepare it, says the chef.Saji also speaks about how flavour overdrive can kill the taste. Meen Mulakittath is a famous Kozhikodan dish. They usually have it with porotta. The secret of the curry is that it is cooked using tomatoes for the sour taste. Unlike in other parts of Kerala, the people dont use tamarind. The advantage is the curry doesnt kill the taste of porotta. It is such subtle things that give the dish its authentic taste, says Saji.The food festival also features dishes like beef dry fry, chicken chukka and the Kuttichira-special chemeen charu.The people here are very innovative when it comes to food, says Saji. Try kozhikal, a vegetarian snack made of tapioca, besan, maida and rice flour, you will know how. Vegetarians can also try the koon pathiri (mushroom pathiri)."

The starters consist of Bread Sticks, Baked Zucchini, Aranchini and Bruschetta. The platter is simple yet appealing.The round Aranchini, made of rice is crunchy outside and creamy inside. There are breads in different shapes and sizes too. The Bruschetta is said to complement many dishes. The bread is topped with fresh chopped tomatoes and sprinkled with salt and pepper which helps draw out the tomato juice. The sweet and tart flavours magically blend in your mouth. Even people who dont care much for tomatoes will be tempted to have a bite.The slice of Zucchini is baked with ricotta cheese and mixed with veggies, lending it a fresh flavour and creamy texture. The pizzas on the menu are with a thin crust and named after different places in Rome. The Trinita Dei Monti is named after the church in Italy. The velvety ricotta cheese lends it a sweetness. The asparagus topped on the light pizza base is crunchy.The Colosseo Pizza is topped with cheese and crushed black pepper. More the black pepper, better the taste. In Quirinale, cream of broccoli, you can get the raw and bitter taste of the florets.The Pincio is unique. Topped with thin slices of ham, decorated with figs, they are perfect to romance with this monsoon. These pizzas pair well with the beer, which is also served.The Aventino  Allarrabbiata is served with penne pasta. The arrabbiata sauce makes it spicy. The base is as usual crispy topped with fine cheese. It is a treat for the pasta lovers.No menu is complete without a dessert. Pannacotta, the cooked cream topped with berries, tastes like custard.The best bit is that the pizzas dont stuff you. They are light and you can taste the toppings, unlike the others that are usually smothered with cheese."

It is the southern counterpart of Palace on Wheels, an enterprise of Karnataka Tourism Department. Operated by KSTDC, with Mapple Groups able services, this luxury coach is quite popular with foreigners, NRI s and Indians with a penchant for extravagance. With an option of two tours, Pride of the South that covers Karnataka and Goa, and Southern Splendour that covers Tamil Nadu and part of Kerala, it is anyones dream to travel in total comfort and luxury. Who doesnt like one full week of absolute pampering with the choicest wines and food on board, served in style and treated like royalty? I think all of us, at some point of time, want to be a part of the crowned heads where we can sit and enjoy in the lap of luxury and get thoroughly spoilt.Karnataka, with its rich cultural tapestry was my first choice when I opted to travel back into history. After a rousing welcome by the Golden Chariot staff on a red carpet with rose petals, garlands and live orchestra playing traditional music, we settled down in the royal coaches.Each cabin had a luxurious bedroom, with the best of fittings and an attached bath. Elegant foyers for each coach (named after different dynasties that ruled Karnataka) to sit and relax or read. The dining restaurants Ruchi and Nalapaka were beautifully done up, inviting and irresistible. Madira, the lounge bar, filled with the choicest liquor was another popular place with the guests. There was gym for the fitness freaks and spa for those who wanted instant rejuvenation. The executive chef with his team would throw a surprise at each meal, one excelling the other.The best of Continental and Indian cuisines won the hearts of many, adding inches to their midriffs by the end of the trip !! With exotic dishes, just to name a few, a typical dinner menu would read like this: Assorted Pasta in Tangy Cocktail Dressing, Mulligatawny Soup, Grilled Fish served with Lemon Butter sauce, Supreme of Chicken in Tomato, Basil and Black Olive Sauce, Fried Fish with Black Pepper, Mangalore Chicken Curry, Mysore Brinjal Curry, Masoor Dal, Kori Roti , Steamed Rice...all this topped with Mango Cheese Cake, Elaichi Shrikand and tea or coffee! Rocked into sleep by the gentle swaying of the train, we woke up at Mysore with a special ensemble playing clarinet on the platform. We had breakfast on the train and left in the luxury coach for sight- seeing. Starting with the magnificent Mysore Palace, known as the Amba Vilas Palace, it is one of the grandest structures and the official residence of the Wodeyars, the erstwhile royal family of Mysore. Designed by Henry Irwin, here the Indo-Saracenic architecture blends with Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and Gothic styles, with two splendid darbar halls stealing the show.In Srirangapatna, the capital of Tipu Sultans kingdom, his summer palace is an outstanding structure that was built entirely with French rosewood, complete with pillars, arches and balconies. The walls are adorned with many interesting murals depicting battles. Gumbaz is where the tombs of Tipu Sultan, his father Hyder Ali and mother Fakrunnisa Begum lie. It has a beautiful dome above, ivory inlaid doors and finely carved stone windows. That night our dinner was at the splendid Lalitha Mahal Palace Hotel, another imposing structure built by the Mysore Maharaja specially to host his British guests.Our journey continued, to regions of yore, to hear the tales of lore .......on the Golden Chariot. Thus I embarked on a heritage trail rolling on the Royal Wheels. Visiting history, feeling proud of our rich cultural legacy my voyage continued. More of it later, next week!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; blogs at www.vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

Just make a trip to any of the Barbeque Nations outlets for Dilli Wali Khau Galli Festival.Were serving some usual favourites such as chaats, parathas and different types of kebabs, says Chef Ashish Rai, Head - Culinary, Barbeque Nation.Our meal at the restaurant begins with starters. Barbequed Pudina Ananas Ke Tikke  a grilled pineapple roast with mint flavour  and Dhelvi Paneer Teh Pe Teh  barbequed cottage cheese coated in mint, besan, etc  steal our hearts.I am a yoghurt fan and so enjoy the next, Dahi ke kebab, which is yogurt-based and vermicelli-coated. The dahi oozes out of the kebab, which is to be had with mint chutney with curd and amchur powder and khajoor ki chatni.Fish used in Surkh Fish Tikka in non-vegetarian starters is fresh. But Tandoori Murgh Akbari is a disappointment.Nimoda Tandoori Zinga, as the name suggests, has lemon marination. The dish with fresh prawn was the best among the starters, with its mix of lemon and spice.Dehlvi Shahi Chaap, a single bone strip of mutton chaap (chop) seasoned with Indian spices, is dry and powdery. Fathepuri Ka Fry Chicken, seasoned with spices could have been juicier.I make sure to hit the chaats live counter before moving on to the main course.Pani Puri comes first, with its aloo sabji and diced onions. The pani is just the right amount of tangy, sweet and spicy.The buffet has a wide variety of dishes.Sarai Ki Muglai Dum Biryani and Ballimaran Ka Gosht Pulao taste the same until we bite into chicken in the former and mutton into later. We recommend Ballimaran Ka Gosht Pulao because the spices are perfect and the mutton is fresh.The vegetarians are treated to Makhmali Paneer, the cottage cheese is as makhmali as the name promises. The tangy tomato flavour in the gravy makes it a treat.Dunkaar Anjeer Kofta Curry is artistically prepared with anjeer wrapped inside cottage cheese. The soft cottage cheese complements the crunchy anjeer seeds.Kache Paneer Ka Biryani and Chandni Chowk Ki Subz Briyani stand out with their cottage cheese and vegetables cooked to perfection.In desserts, Tiramisu is the best for its creamy texture and Dark Cheesy Brownie lives up to its name. Jama Masjid Ka Shahi Tukda, which is bread dipped in milkmaid, resembles Double Ka Meetha. Pan Kulfi does not make us miss paan. After a heavy meal, it tastes like paan served with gulkand and sweeteners.The festival is on till August 7."

""This year, they had a scheduling conflict. Actually, they just couldn't take my jokes anymore,"" the president said.His nephews, Austin and Aaron Robinson, filled in admirably. Obama joked they had not yet been turned cynical by Washington. ""They still believe in bad puns. They still believe in the grandeur of this occasion,"" Obama said. ""They still have hope.""The White House asked people on Twitter to vote for which turkey will receive the pardon, though both will get a reprieve. The White House even provided a biography for each bird to help voters with their decision. For example, Tater's favorite snack is worms. Tot prefers tomato slices. Each 18-week-old bird weighed in at about 40 pounds.While only one could be named the ""National Thanksgiving Turkey,"" the White House said that both birds will be sent to their new home at Virginia Tech's ""Gobblers Rest"" where they will be cared for by veterinarians and students.The ceremony also gave Obama a chance to reflect on the spirit of Thanksgiving. Obama said it's a time to remember that ""we have a lot more in common than divides us."" He also challenged Americans to show the world that the United States is a generous and giving country, and to make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving.After the ceremony, the president and first family served Thanksgiving meals to residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington. The campus is home to 405 previously enlisted service members, who represent every campaign since World War I. Obama served the turkey and gravy and briefly chatted with veterans and workers as they went through the line.First lady Michelle Obama served beans and spinach, while Sasha provided the mashed potatoes, dressing and cranberry sauce.The pardoning ceremony brings levity to the endless list of serious issues the president faces daily. It inevitably also leads to several bad jokes that will leave the audience responding with ""oohs"" instead of laughs. A baby began crying after one of the jokes, prompting the president to reply: ""Oh, it's not that bad. Now, come on.""Obama was not deterred by the groans or the crying saying he hopes that when somebody at the Thanksgiving dinner table says you can't have any more food, you'll respond: ""Yes, we cran.""The National Turkey Federation began bringing live turkeys to the White House when President Harry S. Truman was in office. The White House Historical Association said Truman remarked they would ""come in handy"" for Christmas dinner. President John Kennedy spared the turkey presented to him in 1963, saying ""let's keep him going."" And President George H.W. Bush is credited with beginning the formal pardon tradition saying that year's bird was ""granted a presidential pardon as of right now."""

Civil protection officials were working to find alternate routes, since the bridge is crucial for emergency crews moving in and out of town.The aftershock was preceded by more than 50 overnight and was followed by another nine in the next hour  part of the nearly 1,000 aftershocks that have rocked Italy's central Apennine Mountains since the original 6.2-magnitude quake early Wednesday.Premier Matteo Renzi has declared a state of emergency and authorized 50 million euros for immediate quake relief.Rescue efforts continued through the night and into Friday, but more than a day and a half had passed since the last person was extracted alive from the rubble. While Renzi hailed the fact that 215 people had been rescued after the quake, authorities reported a steadily rising death toll that had hit 267 by Friday morning.Civil protection operations chief Immacolata Postiglione still insisted Friday that the rescue effort hadn't yet switched to a recovery mission. Rescue workers have noted that a person was pulled out alive 72 hours (three days) after the 2009 earthquake in the Italian town of L'Aquila.""I confirm, once again as we have from the start, that the units that are doing the searches and rescues, including with dogs looking for other people trapped in the rubble, are absolutely fully active,"" she said Friday.On the ground, authorities were still struggling to account for all the missing, since that number is still uncertain given the large number of visitors for summer holidays and an annual food festival.""There is still hope to find survivors under the rubble, even in these hours,"" Walter Milan, a mountain rescue worker, said Friday. But he conceded: ""Certainly, it will be very unlikely.""The vast majority of the dead were found in Amatrice, the medieval hilltop town famous for its bacon and tomato pasta sauce that was leveled by the quake. The other dead hailed from nearby Accumoli and Arcquarta del Tronto.Flags will fly at half-staff Saturday on all public offices and a state funeral will be celebrated by a bishop in a gym in Ascoli Piceno for the victims of nearby Arquata del Tronto  to date, 49 of the dead have come from the tiny town and its hamlet Pescara del Tronto.Across the area, thousands have been forced to abandon their homes, either because they were destroyed or they were determined to be too unsafe. Overnight some 2,100 slept in tent camps, nearly 1,000 more than the first night after Wednesday's quake, in a sign that a significant number had found nowhere else to go.""I have no idea what I'm going to do now, because I had renovated the house two years ago,"" survivor Umberto Palaferri said, showing a photo of his collapsed home on his phone. ""It was all new and now I don't know what to do. I'm 76 and don't know if I can rebuild it."""

No, it's not,"" he said.He also said there was no need to ""smash"" the Sakharov Centre exhibition -- while condemning it for ""glorifying"" Ukrainian troops.- 'Powerful supporters' -Such protesters remain on the fringes but they have powerful supporters, said Sergei Lukashevsky, director of the Sakharov Centre.""These radical marginal people -- the government condones their activities,"" he said.""There are people in power who protect them or even directly support them.""After Belikov defaced the images of Ukrainian forces at the Sakharov Centre -- part of a documentary photo exhibition -- the centre decided to reopen.But the next day, some 40 protesters arrived -- among them Cossacks and a local lawmaker -- carrying a jar of tomato juice labelled ""blood of the children of eastern Ukraine.""Entering the building, some tore down signs.But when the police arrived, they questioned staff about the exhibition's content, not about the protesters' actions, said Lukashevsky, who said the centre would not press charges.The photos by Sergei Loiko for the Los Angeles Times and Belarusian Alexander Vasukovich were ""war reportage -- they did not glorify or condemn anyone,"" he explained, saying the protests were the result of ""the general atmosphere being whipped up by government propaganda.""Yet the latest protests will affect the centre's decisions about future events, he acknowledged.""We will undoubtedly weigh this up,"" he said.""Our doors are open, so I have to worry about the safety of staff and visitors."""

(Photo | AP)KASHIWA: At a public bath in a Yokohama slum in the 1950s, a red-haired girl scrubs her skin with a pumice stone, hard, to try to get the white out.Other kids sometimes taunt her. ""American, American."" She yells back, ""I'm Japanese!""There are more hints that she is different. Once a year she's taken to a grave in the cemetery for foreigners. Once she is made to listen to a record of people singing ""Happy Birthday"" in English. The reasons are as unknown to her as the Western-looking couple she sees in photos hidden in a brown leather suitcase in the closet.She is told she was abandoned. Only much later would she learn that her family had been a casualty of anti-Asian immigration policy in the United States. Her American father got Congress to pass a special bill that would have allowed her to enter the US, yet she would go most of her life without knowing that.Her life became headline fodder in two countries  Japan and Sweden  as a custody battle waged, yet she would be the one to sort out her own fractured identity. It took decades, and the last piece was put into place only this year.""So many coincidences happened in my life,"" she said in an interview at her house outside Tokyo, reflecting on her 67 years. ""But altogether, you know, I managed to put the whole story, that now I'm settled, and I have peace of mind. Thank goodness that I don't have to live with two people anymore.""Those two people are Mary Ann Vaughn, the girl she was born as, and Marianne Wilson, the girl that fate made her.Texas-born James Vaughn arrived in Japan in early 1946, a 20-year-old civilian assigned to a U.S. military base in Yokohama. Photos show a handsome lad with a bit of a James Dean look.He met 16-year-old Vivienne Wilson working in the PX to help support her family. It was an ill-fated romance. Overseas U.S. personnel needed permission from the military to get married, and Vaughn was denied because Wilson was half-Japanese. U.S. law at the time barred Japanese from becoming citizens or even immigrating to the country.Vaughn and Wilson didn't give up. They tied the knot at a Japanese shrine in May 1948. But U.S. military police harassed the couple, and Vaughn returned to the U.S. that August. Wilson gave birth to Mary Ann Vaughn in a Yokohama hospital on April 17, 1949.James Vaughn wrote to Congress, which passed a law exempting Wilson from immigration restrictions so she and her daughter could enter the U.S. It was dated Aug. 5, 1950.That very day Vivienne Wilson died of tuberculosis. Mary Ann was 16 months old.Wilson's family was struggling financially, and asked Mary Ann's nanny to take care of the baby until her father returned to get her. He never did.And so Mary Ann ended up trying to peel her whiteness off in a public bath. ""I was wondering what kind of disease I had,"" she said. She hoped she would wake up transformed, her red hair gone to black.She became Mary Ann Kizawa, taking the surname of her nanny's first husband. She called him ""Papa."" They lived in a one-room shack in Yokohama, got water from a shared pump and cooked outside.The young girl didn't know she was American  she was taught to be terrified of Americans. She wasn't sure who or what they were, but would jump into a covered wooden tea crate whenever they came to the neighborhood. They will make you into sausage and eat you, she was told.Ultimately, an organization set up to help ""GI babies,"" orphans left behind by American soldiers, found her. In letters to the Swedish consul in Tokyo in 1955, the group reported that Mary Ann's nanny wanted to adopt her, but questioned whether that was advisable, given her impoverished circumstances. Sweden decided it should find a home for her, and a custody battle ensued.The media descended on the first-grader. Magazine photo spreads from 1956 show a smiling, pig-tailed girl at school or eating at home. Behind the sometimes impish smiles was a child who didn't understand what was happening to her.Her nanny, Fumi, took Mary Ann every Aug. 5 to Vivienne's grave in a mosquito-infested cemetery, without telling her it was her mother. The child couldn't read the English on the tombstone.Fumi once took her to the beauty parlor where she worked, so she could use the record player. Mary Ann listened to a recording of ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Mary had a Little Lamb"" without realizing it was her father and his family in America singing.The nanny did lay out what was happening after a court ruled in Sweden's favor in 1958. ""I'm going to tell you something very important,"" she told her. ""Sit here and just listen. You're going to quit this school. From September you're going to go to a new school on the bluff where all the A-B-C kids are living. And from now on, your name is going to be Marianne Wilson.""It was a name she hated. Marianne is the Swedish version of Mary Ann, and in her 9-year-old mind, it was the source of all her troubles.With no English, she was sent back to second grade at the ""A-B-C school""  the international school in Yokohama. It was a blow to her ego. She couldn't stomach the strange food  ham sandwiches and tomato juice  and threw it away.""I just couldn't understand a single word the teacher was saying,"" she said. ""I couldn't even write my own name.""An excerpt from a recent email captures her confusion:""On my first day, we took the bus to the bluff. To my big surprise came a little boy who looked like me accompanied by a Japanese woman. When I heard the boy addressing a Japanese lady 'Mommy,' my mind just spun with great joy. I had found the same species!""Her joy was dashed when she discovered the father of a similar girl was a tall white man.""Oh my goodness, I was totally confused,"" she wrote. "" ... I expected a little girl who looked like me to have a Japanese mommy and a Japanese daddy! My little head at that time had no idea about mixed-race, and just left me with the great grief that there is no planet for me to live in. I searched for Krypton, a planet which Superman came from, for there might be some aliens existing like me on that planet.""Under a compromise with the Swedish Embassy, Marianne would live with a foreign host family during the week, and stay with her nanny, now remarried as Fumi Yamaguchi, on the weekends. A Swedish company moved them out of the slums and into a house in Tokyo with new wonders for Marianne, from a refrigerator to a vacuum cleaner.She transferred to the American School in Japan, and rotated through about half a dozen families during her school years. Now, when she visited that gravestone, she could read ""Vivienne Wilson"" on the marker, and realized it was the same last name as hers. She peeked at the photos in the suitcase. A young man, a young woman. A little boy. How were they a part of her life?After high school, she was sent to Sweden, speaking no Swedish. She worked for SAS, the Scandinavian airline, but returned to Japan in 1974, after five years.On her deathbed in 1975, Fumi finally told her everything. James Vaughn was her father, and he hadn't abandoned her, but had tried to find her. It was him on the record, singing to her. She gave her the photos, and told her, these are your parents.Marianne was not ready to try to track down her father until the 1990s, after she got married and had a son. The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo gave her a list of agencies to try.""Every time an envelope came from America, I thought, 'Yay, they found him,'"" she said. ""Then I would start crying. It didn't work.""An acquaintance suggested the Japanese Red Cross. The answer came by phone in 2004: We found James Vaughn, but unfortunately he died 11 months ago. There is a short obituary. And you have a younger brother in America.Marianne Wilson Kuroda was drinking her coffee and shaking, waiting in the kitchen for the phone to ring. It was Steve Vaughn, the son of the father she never got to meet.At first she didn't know what to say. ""What was father's favorite color?"" she asked. Then the emotions overflowed.""I thought, 'Gosh, I wish I would have taken care of you,'"" she said. ""I missed him so much as a baby. I could have been big sister to him ... changed his diaper, given him milk. I guess that's what you call family.""Three months later, she was flying to New Mexico. Vaughn, 56, is a doctor at a Veterans Administration clinic outside of Albuquerque.""She got off the plane. I could not look her in the eyes,"" he wrote in response to questions. ""Her father's eyes scrutinized me, stared at me.""It's not clear whether James Vaughn attempted to contact his daughter after the death of Vivienne Wilson in 1950, but his family kept an envelope on which his mother had written, ""May be important some day.""Inside were some photos and a note: ""The baby in these pictures was named Mary Ann. The last time (I) heard about them was 1958. The mother had died, and baby or girl Mary Ann was adopted in Tokyo, Japan, by unknown parents.""Steve Vaughn, whose mother had married James Vaughn in 1956, wasn't told about his half-sister.He and Marianne compared photos, and found they had similar ones of their father as a little boy. They visited the grave of their father, who had died on Feb. 3, 2003, at the age of 77.""I had to give him respect, you know. But, um, hmm, it was like, you know, 'Why did you die 11 months ago?'"" Marianne said, her laughter mixed with pangs of regret. ""You could have lived a little bit longer after all these years.""The puzzle was coming together. An uncle remembered something about a law related to her story. Steve Vaughn wrote to the U.S. National Archives and found under Private Laws, Chapter 596, ""An Act, for the relief of Vivienne Joy Wilson and minor daughter Mary Ann Vaughn.""Marianne was stunned.""I saw the name Mary Ann Vaughn, which I was called in my very early childhood, and was shocked that she really existed, and my father was truly an American,"" she said.And so was she  or at least should have been. She decided that she should make it official and claim her citizenship, in his honor.It would take 12 years.A U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo asked her why she wanted citizenship when she didn't intend to move to the U.S. He gave her a long list of requirements.""He even said it is almost impossible,"" Marianne said. ""He raised my anger to fight for anything to get justice.""She got help, in a way, from her grandmother. Vivienne's mother. She, amazingly, had gone through very much the same struggle.To get the bill passed, James Vaughn had written Nevada Sen. Pat McCarran letters pleading for help. Steve Vaughn obtained those letters through the McCarran archives.A 1949 letter said that Vivienne Wilson's mother, Helene, had divorced and gotten remarried to a man named John Bouiss and was living in Portland, Oregon. That was something she never knew.Searching the internet in 2012, Marianne happened upon a 78-page paper on Helene Bouiss in the New York University Law Review. Half-Japanese and half-German, she had been denied entry on arrival in Seattle and detained because of her ethnicity. She only was admitted after Congress amended the War Brides Act to allow in spouses like her.It boggled Marianne's mind. She sought help from the author of the paper, professor Rose Cuison Villazor from the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.""Her case is a consequence of this history of discrimination from immigration law and citizenship law that I thought really needed to be corrected,"" Cuison Villazor said in a telephone interview. ""There was ... this awful history that I felt needed to be addressed as a matter of justice.""Kevin Brosnahan, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs, said that consular officers are required to determine whether a person meets the legal requirements for citizenship that were in effect on her birthdate.For Marianne, born in 1949, that meant she had to have established that Vaughn was her father by the age of 21.

When its suggested to the overtly proud unemployed commerce graduate, Dasan (Mohanlal), that he could rear cows and become a successful dairy farmer, he exclaims, Me? A first class B Com graduate, become a dairy farmer? I dont think so.Three decades on, trends have reversed and theres no shame in picking up the plough. A growing breed of youngstersarmed with professional degrees and successful enterprisesare proving that their degrees are assets out in the field. From using lessons in mechanical engineering to mechanise farms and creating e-commerce websites to sell organic farm produce, these youngsters are proving that careers can be created away from the confines of a cubicle.Your creations on the computer are intangible. When it comes to agriculture, you can touch, feel, smell and taste your creations, and even share your outputs with your loved ones. I believe this school of thought is urging youngsters to take up farming, says Mathew Sebastian, a veteran agriculturist and co-founder of the farm-certifying agency, INDOCERT, elaborating,Currently, the biggest hurdles to agriculture are lack of access to markets, real-time information, and middlemen who rig markets to their convenience. Now young agriculturists have opened online market places (think Farming Colors, Farmers FZ and Ente Krishi), which are supplying farm produce directly to households and cutting out middle men. Queries on agricultural practices, too, are easily clarified on Whatsapp groups like Kaarshiga Rengam (details: 9447001122). These individuals are poised to change the face of agricultural commerce in the coming years.Pradeep P SChief profession: PHP developerAgricultural land hold: Six acresProduces: Tapioca, ladies finger,red banana, bitter gourdThe monotony of working full-time as a web developer and the thirst to find a larger market for the agricultural produce from his household in Mala, Thrissur, motivated this 26-year-old to take the shovel. My father grew vegetables in our backyard. Once, when he tried to sell 200 kg of bottle gourd in the market, he was offered `1 for a kg. This really disturbed me. I vowed to create something that would take our farm produce directly to households, where it would be appreciated. Thus was born the online store and app FarmersFZ last year, which now serves close to 4,000 customers, says Pradeep, who skips chemical fertilisers and adds cowdung to his crops for its essential micro nutrients. Apart from attaining self-sufficiency in the future, I want to fuse agriculture and technology, and create AgroIT careers, adds Pradeep, who engages in the end-to-end process on his farm.Details: farmersfz.comRanjith ChittethChief profession: MachinistAgricultural land hold: 26 acresProduces: Tomatoes, hybrid redchillies, brinjals, snake gourdA precision tool maker by profession, Chitteths love for tractors and farming equipment brought him to the farm. Applying his expertise on the field, the 37-year-old developed precision farming methods in his farm at Ashtamichira, Thrissur, by introducing drip irrigation, hybrid seeds and farm mechanisationall of which greatly reduced water consumption and wastage, and recently earned him an accolade from the Kerala Government: Best Young Farmer. I used simple plastic sheets for mulching, which increased the moisture content of the soil and water retention. I also skipped the heavily-built high power consuming tractors in the local market and opted for the smaller Japanese Kuboto tractor and customised it with multiple attachments, which could pluck weeds and till the soil, says Chitteth, who keeps tab of the latest technologies in agriculture on the Haifa Chemicals website (aifa-group.com) and Tamil Nadu Agricultural Universitys e-learning portal (tnau.ac.in/eagri). Only after researching online did I realis our soil was acidic, compared to the alkaline-rich soil in Tamil Nadu, which gives more yields. I am aware about the benefits of going organic, but going completely organic will reduce 70 per cent of my output and the projected market for organic produce is hyped, too, so I will stick with using pesticides responsibly, adds Chitteth.

We now farm pokkali rice and coconuts (organically). We also farm prawns. From adopting a simple litmus test, learned in school chemistry classes, to test acidity content in the waters, to accessing YouTube farming channels like Ag Proud and emailing agricultural societies around the world, we have an upper hand when it comes to farming practices, says the elder Vineeth, who entirely mechanised their farming operations, devised a strategy to yield multiple crops post harvest and use something as simple aspeanut fodder for increasing soil nutrients the organic way.Details: facebook.com/noshhausDigol ThomasChief profession: Interior designerAgricultural land hold: 25 centsProduces: English cucumber, capsicum, musk melon, bitter gourdWhen the 2009 recession hit, 37-year-old Digol Thomas realised it would be wise to rely on ones backyard rather than some unforeseen global economic forces.

Initially, a few of my bitter gourds wilted, and every one opined it was a nematode attack (a soil-bourne plant disease). But I posted pictures of the vegetables on Facebook and some farmers hinted it maybe an iron and magnesium deficiency.

If reports coming in from Technopark and the incident which occurred at the Infopark in Kochi are any indications then it can be said, Yes, they are. Three days ago, techies at the Infopark were shocked to find a millipede in a snack served by a cafeteria attached to one of the blocks in the park.The situation is not so different at Technopark! For years, the techies have been complaining about the poor quality of food and also the unhygienic conditions in which they are being prepared at the several cafeterias inside the campus.Techies point out that several cafeterias have been serving stale food even after being served notices by the Food and Safety Department threatening closure if conditions arent improved. At present, 22 cafeterias are functioning inside the park at various blocks. Apart from branded food outlets, several cafeterias serve local cuisine to attract Kerala-based techies. In fact, it is these cafeterias which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. Two weeks back the Food and Safety Department raided the cafeterias inside the park after receiving large number of complaints from techies. Food and Safety officials issued warning and penalised many of these restaurants for serving stale food and that too in unhygienic conditions. They also slapped closure notice on a restaurant functioning in Bhavani building.Techies said that they have been at the receiving end for years. Though Technopark exudes glamour, the condition of the eateries inside the campus will put off people from food for a long time. For how long should we suffer unhygienic food ? a techie asked.Harrowing experienceOn August 4, a group of techies spent a harrowing night after having food from one of the restaurants functioning on the ground floor of Nila building. A software developer who didnt wish to disclose his identity told TPuram Express that he was served tomato rice which was two-days-old and spent half of his day puking.

In a way, he was right.Twelve months from the deadly accident at an iron ore mine in Minas Gerais state, the Samarco company and its giant owners BHP-Billiton and Vale say they are putting the pieces back together.Yet the way of life Pascual has known all his 76 years in the village of Paracatu de Baixo shattered beyond repair that day.The disaster began in the afternoon of November 5, 2015, when a dam holding mining waste burst without warning about 17 miles (27 kilometers) up a small river from Paracatu.Thirty two million cubic meters (42 million cubic yards) of sludge rushed down the valley, killing 19 people unable to get out of the way and smashing anything in the flood's path, starting with the adjacent village of Bento Rodrigues.A helicopter reached Paracatu in time to warn villagers before their turn came.""I was in the garden and my wife was putting clothes out to dry when they came,"" recalled Pascual, a lean, strong man, whose snowy hair was hidden under a battered Stetson. ""They said: 'Get out of here!'""Running uphill with the rest of his neighbors, Pascual heard the disaster before he saw it.""It was the noise of a runaway train. Then we looked at what was coming,"" he said. ""It was the color of the clay. There wasn't even water, just clay coming and this strong wind.""The sliding wall of mud tore apart or submerged orchards, houses, roads, cars, animals, trees.""It was like the end of the world,"" Pascual said. ""The lights went out.""- Neck deep in mud -Pascual and his wife, whose 12 children live in other towns, were safe and their small house and plot of land, located on a slight rise, were spared.But Paracatu was finished. A year later mud still clogs the main street. Mud sits heaped in roofless houses. Mud stains walls of the ruined church.Pascual is hardly the quitting type, recounting how he waded back home through the mud to retrieve his wife's forgotten documents. ""It was up to here,"" he said, pointing to his neck.Even today, he tends his crops of manioc, onion, tomato and maize. Ever resourceful, he has grown his own tobacco for cigarettes that he rolls in dried maize leafs.Yet the clock is running down.Samarco says it will build a new Paracatu in a different location, with each inhabitant receiving a house equal to the one that was lost. A majority of residents have agreed to take the deal, although it means abandoning their ancestral home -- and Pascual is with them.His house and crops may be intact, but too much else has been spoiled.The river where he used to fish now runs red with mining waste. His two best cows were killed and so his production of round, white cheeses depends on two skinny survivors that he herds around the ruins. Income is down 75 percent.Samarco says it could take until March 2019 before the new Paracatu is built.In the meantime, Pascual tends the farm alone, making a journey of about an hour on weekends to see his wife. It's a lonely, sometimes spooky existence.""Sometimes I spend the whole night awake. Any noise will wake me,"" he says.And even if he could somehow hang on in the village, community life was always about more than mere survival.""We've ended up without a bar where you can go to get a drink, just a tiny drink,"" he said mournfully.""Yes, I want to leave."""

He was over the moon when he saw biscuits,"" said Kamel, a pale-faced woman, aged 38, wearing an old, black coat.""Yazan asked me if ice cream was some kind of cake.""In the two-day evacuation which started on Friday, around 4,000 civilians were to be directed to reception centres and at least 700 rebels escorted to the rebel-held city of Idlib in northwest Syria, the state news agency SANA said.The four years of life under siege was just as hard on the adults.""All anyone of us had to eat was a portion of soup at sunset and we'd then have to fast until sunset the next day,"" said Yazan's mother.""We had no gas or electricity... My heart would break and I'd cry at the sight of my son starving and I had nothing to give him.""Kamel said her family spent most of their time in shelters to avoid the bombs which often rained down on Daraya. Like most other residents, she did not dare send the children to school.Another mother, Houda, said her children were in awe of vegetables which used to be in plentiful supply in the agricultural province of Damascus before the war.""My children, who are three and five, were very surprised to see tomatoes. It was the first time for them,"" said the 30-year-old woman. ""All we had to survive on was grass.""Staple diet of fearThe surrender of Daraya, where Syrian authorities said soldiers deployed on Saturday, followed growing malnutrition and illness among its residents.For Houda, leaving her hometown, despite all the suffering of the past four years, has been a heart-wrenching experience.She said she brought along some stones ""as a souvenir of the smell of the town"", and hopes to return one day.At the entrance to the reception centre, made up of 30 prefabricated units, children played under a blazing sun as Red Crescent volunteers distributed mattresses, blankets and food.Apart from starvation, the evacuees said, fear had been the staple diet of everyday life in Daraya.Adnan Naccache, 47, told of how he and his family spent each night for more than four months in a hole they had dug in a patch of open ground that was mostly spared bombardment.""We would squeeze against each other, eight of us, and not dare to fall asleep for fear of the bombs,"" he said sternly.""Life was hell. We were at the end of our tether. We even reached the point where we'd rather die than have to do without any food or medicine any more.""Naccache said his weight fell from 86 kilograms (190 pounds) to 68 kilos."
58fed6e27be9e0420db28061,A just exchange,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160525/jsp/opinion/story_87368.jsp,2016-05-25,,Telegraph,"The Supreme Court passed a landmark judgment on May 13, 2016. It returned to the Haryana Urban Development Authority 280 acres of land that had been licensed to Uddar Gaggan Properties Limited by the Haryana government in 2006. The land was acquired by the government from farmers and then transferred to Uddar Gaggan Properties to build residential houses. The court termed the process ""illegal"" and deceptive. What is the main issue here? Land that was privately owned by farmers was acquired by the state government and then handed over to a private commercial interest. The state acted as an intermediary in a transaction between two private parties. Intermediation is common in private transactions, especially in land and buildings. Most of these transactions are effected through brokers who are the intermediaries. In this particular case, the state was an intermediary. There is nothing against the state acting as intermediary in private transactions. What makes this intermediation problematic is that the state used its legal powers to compel farmers to give up the land. If a broker did such a thing, the broker would have been jailed. However, the government has been forcing people to give up their land by the powers vested in it by the Constitution. This legitimate power enables government to acquire land from private entities if the government can justify the acquisition and if the erstwhile owners are compensated. While there has been a lot of debate in recent years on what is the fair compensation, there has been little, or no, debate on what justifies acquisition. This is largely because, till now, the Supreme Court accepted the 1984 amendment to the Land Acquisition Act that empowered the legislature to decide what the meaning of public purpose is. And both the corrupt and the well-meaning politicians have been interpreting public purpose to mean whatever is in keeping with their own ideas of developmental policies. Haryana is not the only state where such things have happened. Neither is India the only country where such things happen. Indeed, such government induced, or coerced, transfers have happened in other democratic, rule of law states also. In 2004, the Michigan Supreme Court in the United States of America corrected a wrong by returning land taken by the Detroit Wayne County Stadium Authority from a certain Frida Alibri. The reason for returning the land was that the local government gave the land to a private party to build and own a stadium on the land, when the government's justification for acquiring the land was to build a publicly-owned stadium. More famously, in 1998, the drug company, Pfizer, built a new plant in New London, Connecticut, US. To take advantage of the additional business the plant might bring in, the City of New London wanted to acquire 115 nearby houses and commercially develop the land on which the houses stood. The house owners sued the city in Connecticut courts. The case ended up in the US Supreme Court. In a five-four decision, the Supreme Court upheld the city's decision. The irony is that Pfizer, after a 10-year tax holiday, which was an integral part of the city's development plan, moved out of the city just when it was time to start paying taxes. And, instead of creating new jobs, it destroyed them by moving its facilities to a different location. Eventually, the City of New London apologized to the original home owners and so did one of the Connecticut Supreme Court justices who had earlier voted for the city. The first time India faced such an issue in the Supreme Court was in 1971 where the plaintiff objected to his land being taken for a public sector unit and then that land being given to a private corporation. It is uncanny that there should be two near identical cases (the case of Alibri above) in the two largest democracies concerning the government's affinity for the forceful acquisition of private land on behalf of other private parties. In the US, while initially the courts supported the state's behaviour, they drastically changed their stance by the beginning of the current century. Eminent domain can no longer be used by the State in the US to transfer land from one private entity to another unless ""public purpose"" is somehow associated also with the public ownership of the acquired land. The recent judgment by the Indian Supreme Court suggests that our courts also have started to think in a similar fashion. Private property is an essential concept in market driven, rule of law economies. Without property rights, market exchange of assets and goods is not possible. Thus, any suspension of such property rights, that are fundamental to an economy like ours, must have a solid argument justifying it. It cannot be justified simply because some interested group has a temporary majority in the legislature. Indeed, this is why democracies are also rule of law societies - the latter institution prevents the tyranny of the majority. There is some theoretical argument in certain cases for the involuntary transfer of private ownership to public ownership. That is how roads, hospitals and schools get built on land that may or may not have been government land to begin with. No similar argumentation has ever been made in economic theory for the forced transfer of land held by a private entity to another private entity. Quite frankly, that is precisely what such land transfers are. And, justifiably enough, the farmers who have lost their land are agitating against this. Of course, the land market is different from the market for tomatoes and, hence, a land transaction is not as simple as buying many other things. But the fact that land markets are not perfect is no justification for letting government officials and politicians decide on the principles of exchange. It is not a very deep insight; it is immediate as soon as one realizes that they are arbiters who have a huge stake in the outcome. If you are not convinced, think of Adarsh. If that happened too far away, look around you and identify the buildings and land where government officials and politicians stay. There are others who stay too, in the neighbourhood, but they were not directly involved in fixing the terms of exchange. If there was any involvement, it was one of collusion with officials and politicians. Controlling the land market since Independence has not rid us of the land sharks; it has only made them respectable. The Supreme Court judgment gives me hope that people in India are reclaiming their rights as we move towards a more mature democracy. The author is Research Director, India Development Foundation"

With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160728/jsp/nation/story_99226.jsp,2016-07-28,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, July 27: Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan today cited the example of bank interest to justify the rise in prices of food items over the past year while making it clear that middlemen and hoarders were the main problem. Paswan claimed the only increase had been in the price of dal, as he replied to a short-duration discussion in the Rajya Sabha. ""Only dal price has increased. The states have to take action against the middlemen and traders,"" he said. Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the prices of all food items had skyrocketed and Paswan could face a ""privilege motion"" for misleading the House. ""The minister says only dal price has increased. This is incorrect."" But Paswan came up with the bank interest analogy. ""If the price of something was Rs 29 last year and increased to Rs 32 this year, what is the increase? Don't you get interest benefit of Rs 2/3?"" he asked. The link between ""interest benefit"" and price rise was not clear. Unhappy with the reply, Congress MPs walked out. Paswan said the price of arhar dal and urad dal had increased because of a fall in production. The international production of arhar has declined from 75 million tonnes in 2012 to 71 million tonnes this year. In India, 171 lakh tonnes of arhar dal was produced in 2014-15 against a demand for 236 lakh tonnes. In 2015-16, the production remained almost stable at 170 lakh tonnes, whereas the demand increased to 246 lakh tonnes. Therefore dal is being imported, he said. ""If the price is high, why cannot the states relax tax on dal, why cannot they take action against the hoarders, why cannot they directly import?"" Paswan said. Initially, however, Paswan had mentioned some items whose prices had increased. The price of sugar, for example, was Rs 29 a kilo this time last year but had increased to Rs 40, while tomato prices had gone up from Rs 29 to Rs 39. Earlier, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the Centre was responsible to a large extent for the rise in prices of essential commodities, a major reason being the high price of fuel that increases the transport cost of goods. While the international price of crude oil has fallen from $110 a barrel in May 2014 to around $40 now, the government has increased the excise duty on petroleum products by ""nine times"", he said. Trinamul Congress leader Derek O'Brien asked the government to introduce air-conditioned vehicles to transport vegetables to stop them from rotting in transit."

The retail price of the tomato has breached the Rs 60-a-kg mark in local markets and, if sources are to be believed, the tag won't change at least for the next few weeks. ""Extreme temperatures, which crossed 45C this summer, has adversely affected tomato production in vegetable bowls of Jharkhand. This has led to short supply and hence, the price has doubled over the past fortnight,"" said A. Wadood, an agriculture scientist at Birsa Agricultural University in Kanke, Ranchi. Gopal Kumar, a vendor at Bistupur vegetable market, said against a daily consignment of two trucks of tomatoes, they weren't receiving any for the past week. ""Stocks in cold storage are getting exhausted while there are no supply of tomatoes locally (from Patamda),"" he said, adding that tomatoes were available for Rs 40-50 a kg, depending on quality, in the wholesale markets of Bistupur and Sakchi. If the berry-type fruit is troubling kitchen budgets, so are vegetables. Beans, which were available at Rs 70-80 a kilo in local markets until a few days ago, sold at Rs 120 a kg on Wednesday. Carrots are selling at Rs 70 a kg against Rs 50 last week and capsicums are a costly Rs 80 per kilo against Rs 40 earlier. ""The price surge has been triggered by inadequate supply. We are keeping our fingers crossed because the situation is unlikely to change for another few weeks,"" said Arun Mandal, a vegetable vendor in Sakchi. A vegetable seller from Patamda, Panchanan said poor production because of harsh temperatures had resulted in the wide supply-demand gap. ""We are hopeful that the situation will become normal with the advent of monsoon."" A survey of the twin markets in Bistupur and Sakchi revealed that prices of vegetables like bottle gourd, pumpkin and bitter gourd are also on the rise. ""We are left with little choice but to buy at increased rates. I think the rise in demand of vegetables in summer has also led wholesalers and retailers to hike prices,"" said a buyer. Bistupur homemaker Shalini Rao said no vegetable was available below Rs 40 a kilo. ""The price punch is taking a toll on our monthly budget,"" Rao rued. Catering staff Amar Babu added, ""Tomatoes are doing a vanishing act from salads because of its shooting price."""

In the inaugural session, the vice-chancellor of the university, K.M. Bujarbaruah, said the strategies should take into consideration an increase in productivity by linking it with biotechnology and agro-climatic conditions of the regions, treating each state differently. ""The area under banana cultivation, 1.03 lakh hectares, is good but the low production of bananas - only 13.5 tonnes per hectare compared to the all-India average of 37 tonnes per hectare - is a matter of concern. We have to devise strategies to increase productivity and this research can be linked with bio-technology,"" he said. The vice-chancellor added that for bananas, the temperature suitable for growth was 27 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees Celsius. Hence, in states like Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, where temperatures fall below 10 degrees Celsius, the productivity of bananas per hectare was lowest - two tonnes and three tonnes respectively. Productivity of Assam was the highest at 16 tonnes, followed by Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur. ""While devising the strategies, we have to consider whether Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh should be brought in at all or whether the strategy should be different for these states and find varieties suited to that climate propagated there,"" he said. He also stressed that biotechnology would help prevent diseases and increase shelf life of a perishable crop like banana as it had been done for tomato by switching off the ripening enzyme. Bujarbaruah said it should be considered that different varieties of bananas should be cultivated according to requirement as is done in Mizoram where a particular banana is cultivated for fibre. Bananas should be cultivated for fibre, processing and consumption after studying the market. S.K. Mukherjee, the senior consultant, department of biotechnology, New Delhi, said while preparing the roadmap, there was a need to find ways to value add nutrition as bananas are deficient in vitamin A. B. Padmanabhan, the director in-charge, National Research Centre on Bananas, Tiruchirappalli, stressed ways in which bananas could be made disease free, as there was great loss from the production to the consumption stage. Scientists from the fruit science department, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Coimbatore, National Research Centre on Bananas, Tiruchirappalli, microbiology department, Sardar Patel University Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat, PGP College of Agricultural Sciences, Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, and The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) participated in the meet.

Pictures by Prashant Mitra Organic and affordable BAU capsicums, gerberas, mangoes and more. Sounds good? Wait for six months. Ranchi-based Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) is in the process of setting up its own air-conditioned retail outlet inside its Kanke campus at a cost of Rs 15 lakh, which the National Horticultural Mission is funding. Once it starts direct sales, the varsity's produce of vegetables, fruits and flowers would be sold under the BAU brand name in about six months. The varsity grows tomatoes, red, green and yellow capsicums, mushrooms, limes, lady's fingers, mangoes, litchis, papayas, roses and gerberas. The produce basket is fully organic as no chemical fertilisers are used. Chairman of horticulture, Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Ranchi, K.K. Jha said they were already contributing around Rs 10-15 lakh a year to varsity coffers from the sale of vegetables, flowers and fruits and expected to double it with the proposed direct sales. ""Currently, a reputable food chain buys all our produce which it markets to consumers. That's why the BAU tag is missing. But, soon this will change. We shall begin the sale of vegetables, fruits and flowers grown at BAU directly to consumers within the next six months,"" Jha said. ""The AC sales outlet is expected to be fully functional in the next six months. Since no middlemen are involved, BAU produce would be available to consumers at prices much below market rates,"" Jha said, adding they had given orders to print poly bags with the BAU name. D.K. Singh Dron, BAU director (research), said the varsity had started to grow all types of vegetables at the fully refurbished and naturally ventilated poly houses or greenhouses, irrespective of season. ""The poly houses, over the past five years, had been in a bad shape,"" he admitted. ""Last year, we had revamped them with funds from Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi,"" he said. ""Since then, we are growing all types of vegetables, fruits and flowers under controlled conditions round the year and irrespective of season. The quality of the produce is better than in open-field cultivation. Even crop yields are better, four to eight times more compared to open-field cultivation,"" Dron said. He added they were encouraging state farmers to take up commercial cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers in poly houses. ""At BAU, we successfully demonstrated their cultivation at our poly houses, which farmers can replicate on a commercial scale,"" he said. The cost of a poly house depends on size and shape. The cost of a naturally ventilated poly house ranges from Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 per sqm. ""Farmers willing to construct poly houses on their land are eligible for a 50 per cent subsidy borne by National Horticultural Mission,"" Dron said. BAU airs informative bulletins on agriculture to farmers through its radio channel Birsa Hariyali on 107.8 FM. Farmers can also approach their Krishi Vigyan Kendras located at each district of the state for necessary guidance, he added. Will you drive to Kanke for farm-fresh veggies & fruits?

(Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP, File) A huge toxic algal bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi River, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water. (Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP, File)A huge toxic algae bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi River, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water for days during the hottest part of the year.The bacteria commonly known as blue-green algae has spread rapidly to cover almost all of 150-square-mile Utah Lake, turning the water bright, anti-freeze green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore.It smells like something is rotting, said Jason Garrett, water quality director for the Utah County Health Department. We dont have an idea of how long this event will last.Toxic algae is a problem around the country. An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the Atlantic coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.Utah Lake doesnt provide drinking water, but its closure has caused big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities and for farmers with thirsty crops.Watch Video: Whats making newsUtah Poison Control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including some 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.The contamination spread to the Jordan River, which supplies irrigation water to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.Weve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have, said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. Were real worried about it.Farmers got some relief on Friday after the state lifted a week-long advisory against using the water for food production. Officials cited new test results that show lower-than-feared levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria.Meanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.This will be a real hit, said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that its murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.The lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah Division of Water Quality.Longstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.There are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.For now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.To stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater thats pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.Weve been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and its catching up with us, Gaddis said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Prashant Mitra Don't want to go veggie shopping amid dust, heat and crowds? Just tap on an app. Two young Ranchi guys with BCA and MBA degrees under their belt from Manipal and Pune are back home to open a start-up selling vegetables and fruits at prices lower than retail markets. Friends from their days at DAV Public School, Hehal, Bariatu boys Ankit Kumar (25), a BCA from Manipal, and Aman Lal (24), an MBA from Pune, have teamed up to open Meri Sabzi, a vegetable shop with a difference, from June 20. The boys have provided three options for customers to order fruits and vegetables, through the portal www.merisabzi.com, an app called Merisabzi and a WhatsApp number 8351155455. Ankit, who worked as an event manager, and Aman, who was with a telecom company, came back home when the business bug bit them. ""We wanted to open something people needed everyday,"" said Ankit. ""Vegetables and fruits are a must, but busy young professionals, couples who have a packed day juggling many things or elderly people who don't want to depend on domestic help do face problems going to the market to buy the essentials."" ""Plus, the skyrocketing prices,"" chipped in Aman. ""From farm to wholesale to retail, prices keep inflating at every rung and the customer bears the full brunt of it. So, we wanted to put in place a seamless logistics, from farm to Meri Sabzi, to give our customers the best deal possible, eliminating middlemen."" The duo made their home delivery plunge after six months of planning. They took care of the software, built contacts with farmers on the outskirts of Ranchi in places like Bundu, Chanho Pithoria, Ormanjhi, Bedo, Nagri, hired delivery boys and opened up their Bariatu office. The efforts seem to have paid off. Thanks to their farm links, they have managed to deliver potatoes at Rs 15 per kg, onions at Rs 14, tomatoes at Rs 25, brinjal at Rs 22 and lady's finger at Rs 23 when the market rates are Rs 20, Rs 18, Rs 40, Rs 30 and Rs 30. In mornings, they delivery only vegetables from 6am to 9am. In the evening, they also deliver fruits and fresh veggies between 5pm and 8pm. Orders must be worth Rs 100 and above. If someone places an order worth Rs 250, he or she will get 5kg onions for Rs 50, the duo promise. The best part? Delivery is free of cost. So far the maximum orders are through WhatsApp, though the duo hope their own app also catches on. ""But our five delivery boys are busy all the time, which is important as we have just started out. We got 60 orders on Day One. We've come close to 100 orders in one day,"" said Ankit. ""We've got customers from Namkum, Hatia, Piska More, Booty More, Kanke Road, Bariatu, Morabadi, Ratu Road and many other places."" Their first customer, Bariatu homemaker Rachna Sahay, said she was thrilled when the fruits she had ordered, worth Rs 167, came smartly wrapped in plastic in a basket.

58feeb357be9e0420db2968a,Aussie MP is Depp's 'Lecter',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160526/jsp/foreign/story_87645.jsp,2016-05-26,,Telegraph,"May 25: Australian deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce today billed himself as Hollywood star Johnny Depp's Hannibal Lecter, playing mind games in his head and escalating a ""war on terrier"". The sparring began with the illegal entry of Depp's two Yorkshire terriers into Australia last year when the actor was filming the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, breaching the country's tight biosecurity laws. Depp's wife, actress Amber Heard, was convicted in April of falsifying travel documents to sneak the dogs into the country on a private jet and was given a suspended fine of AUD$1,000 (500). A deadpan video apology by Depp and Heard for the offence, dubbed ""terriergate"" by the media, went viral. Joyce, who is also agriculture minister, couldn't help but gloat after the video was released, mocking Johnny Depp's acting skills. Depp kicked off the latest round in the war of words when he appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! chat show yesterday, describing Joyce as someone who ""looks somehow like inbred with a tomato"". ""It's not a criticism. I was a little worried he might explode,"" said Depp. Joyce, who had threatened pets Pistol and Boo with euthanasia, fired back today, comparing himself to the fictional forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer who has graced both the big and small screen. ""I'm turning into Johnny Depp's Hannibal Lecter, I'm inside his head, I'm pulling strings and levers,"" Joyce told reporters in Australia. ""Long after I've forgotten Mr Depp, he is remembering me."" Joyce, who is also the agriculture minister, thanked Depp for the free publicity on Australia's bio-security laws. Depp suggested the video was not sincere after Kimmel said it was the greatest apology he had ever seen. ""There are things you have to prepare a long time for to be able to tap into the emotion,"" he said. ""I played that anti-government Australia, when someone threatens to euthanise your dogs ... tiny teacup things, [that are] clearly dangerous in Australia because of so many poisonous creatures in Australia you could die at any minute, so the dogs were obviously a problem."" Depp said ""an absolute genius"" had written the apology and it was directed by an iPhone but there may have been more than one take because ""sometimes you have to giggle a little"". When asked if he watched the video before releasing it, Depp responded: ""No, because I didn't want to kill myself."" ""I think the choice they made to utilise the taxpayers' dollars to globally chase down teacup yorkies and give them 50 hours to live, I realised the badness of my ways, I was kind of repenting."" The charges were dropped against Heard after the pair released the video which Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan said at the time was ""of far more benefit to this country"" as a warning to would-be illegal importers than any conviction recorded against Heard. The agriculture minister made global headlines when he said the dogs had to ""bugger off"" to California or face being euthanised within 50 hours after it was discovered they had not been declared when they entered Australia. Depp has already mocked the apology since the charges were dropped. ABC reported today that Joyce was asked if there was a vegetable he would prefer to be compared to. ""Something sleek and sensitive, just like me,"" he responded."

(Gautam Dey) The hands which handled machines three years ago are now sowing seeds and reaping fresh vegetables. From the world of machines to the lap of mother earth, it is a huge leap for 36-year-old Santosh Yadav. Yadav, a senior manager with Electrosteel Steels, Bokaro, till three years ago, is now an organic farmer at his hometown Barmasia on the fringes of Dhanbad. So, what provoked this mechanical engineering graduate from BIT, Sindri, to follow the reverse trend at a time when most people leave their roots and migrate to big cities for the rat race? The ""24/7 work culture at private companies"" leaves almost no time for one's family, friends, hobbies and social obligations, said Yadav. ""I wanted to give my wife and two children time and do something for society. So, I decided to leave my 13-year-old career and come back to my roots. I wanted to show that if farming is done scientifically using modern techniques, it is as profitable an industry as any other. At a time when farmers are committing suicide or migrating to bigger cities, I want to prove that farming can be fruitful if proper techniques are used,"" he said. ""This year, I earned a profit of around Rs 1.5 lakh in three months from April to June,"" said Yadav, adding that though his income at present was not commensurate with his earlier jobs, he was confident of increasing it. He said he followed organic vegetable farming on his 5-acre family plot near his house. ""Education is never wasted. Every day, I apply my years of learning and experience on fields. I use drip irrigation to save water, and mulching, which is rarely used, to protect soil from weeds,"" said the BTech graduate who prefers doing most of the work himself but employs labourers during sowing and harvesting. Admitting that farming had uncertainties, Yadav, said he also suffered losses in tomato last year but soon learnt from his mistakes. ""I always use organic fertilisers to cultivate seasonal vegetables like tomato, cabbage, capsicum, chilly, brinjal and lady's finger.? His wife Amrita Kumari (32) is his greatest strength, Yadav admits. A CA who prefers the role of a homemaker, Amrita encouraged her husband to do whatever he wanted, though the couple have two children, Priyansh, a Class V student and Kavya, who is in UKG at St Xaviers International School, Dhanbad. About the reaction of relatives and friends, Yadav said they at first laughed at him. ""Now, after three years, when I'm planning to expand my business and launch a packaged drinking water plant on a portion of my land with my savings I have, they seem to appreciate me,"" he said. His eyes gleamed speaking about his new endeavour: ""Clearances from irrigation and pollution departments have come. I'm waiting for machines to arrive. I'm positive about starting construction in the next two months. I'm looking forward to train local jobless youths who can join me."" He also keeps his Sundays for the poor children. He takes free classes at the Jharia and Dhanbad Bank More centres of NGO Samadhan. ""He lives life to the fullest,"" said Samadhan founder Chandan Singh."
58fef5217be9e0420db2a12a,Caterpillar cloud on tomatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/nation/story_91510.jsp,2016-06-16,,Telegraph,"UNDER SCANNER New Delhi, June 15: Government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to South America that has slipped into at least four Indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year. ""The United States is taking it so seriously we haven't even given permits to do research (in laboratories) in order to prevent any possibility of the insect's escape (from the labs into farms)."""
58fef7c07be9e0420db2a56a,Showers set stage for bumper veggies,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160530/jsp/jharkhand/story_88342.jsp,2016-05-30,,Telegraph,"Fresh vegetables on sale at a roadside market in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Sunday. Picture by Hardeep Singh The May showers, triggered by a series of Nor'westers, cyclonic circulations and low-pressure troughs, augur well for bumper vegetable yield in Jharkhand, which is expected to keep prices under check this year. ""The ongoing spell of pre-monsoon rain has helped keep the mercury at near-normal level and saved standing crops of bitter gourd, bottle gourd, tomato, sponge gourd, spinach, beans etc. from withering away under harsh sun. These vegetables are now available in abundance at local markets across the state. The prices are under control,"" said A. Wadood, weather scientist and chairman of agricultural physics and meteorology at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke, Ranchi. Another good news is that rainfall so far has been moderate, and not too heavy, which has allowed the soil to retain moisture. ""There has not been any run-off... not a drop of rainwater has been wasted. This is an added advantage,"" Wadood stressed. The weather is conducive to kharif crops such as paddy, pulses, soya bean, groundnut, chick pea and mustard. With the soil enriched with moisture, BAU has started advising farmers to go in for intensive ploughing so that when monsoon finally arrives, the fields are ready for immediate sowing. ""Timely sowing of paddy and other crops and vegetables will help ensure a bumper harvest,"" Wadood said. ""Had the pre-monsoon rain not come at this time, standing vegetables would have withered away and sowing of paddy got delayed,"" he added. However, the BAU weather scientist emphasised on the need for urgent measures like creating dobas (farm ponds), check dams and intake wells on a war footing to help recharge groundwater to tackle the prevailing water crisis. Compared to an average annual normal rainfall of around 1,400mm, the state had received 900mm in 2015. Again, the number of rainy days per year has come down to 55-60 days as against 80-85 days in 1980. In the absence of adequate measures to conserve water bodies and recharge groundwater, the entire state is currently in the grip of acute crisis, he pointed out. Under the Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers' Livelihood (SAFAL) programme, the BAU has demonstrated how dobas can help retain rainwater for months. ""On a pilot basis, we had dug dobas in 10 villages of Angara block (Ranchi district) in June last year. They retained water for up to 11 months till April. Farmers in these villages have reaped two to three times higher yield of improved varieties of paddy and vegetables. This success story needs to be replicated across the state,"" he said. The SAFAL programme is being implemented by BAU in association with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Columbia University's Centre for International Projects Trust."
58fef9a77be9e0420db2a861,"Rain whips up tomato, potato price",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160709/jsp/jharkhand/story_95578.jsp,2016-07-09,,Telegraph,"A vendor sells precious tomatoes in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Friday. Picture by Hardeep Singh This week, Ranchi vegetable customers are moving around markets with long faces and half-empty bags. Reason? Heavy rains of last weekend have damaged a bulk of local potato and tomato crops, hiking their retail prices to Rs 24 and Rs 50 per kilo, respectively. Members of Pandra Bazar Samiti, the wholesale hub in Ranchi, said wholesale prices of potato and tomato are Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kilo. ""Water-logging in farms has destroyed both crops,"" said horticulture scientist of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) K.K. Jha. Explaining why, he said: ""The recent heavy rains led to water-logging in poorly drained farms. So, potatoes rotted underground. Heavy downpour tore tomato skins and lack of sunlight led to their getting fungus."" Bhuidih, Mandar and Itki in Ranchi district, Gumla, Simdega and Hazaribagh are the state's tomato bowls. A bulk of potatoes are brought from Bengal, but the tuber also grows in Ratu, Ormanjhi, Pithoria, Namkum and other places in Ranchi. Imports from Bengal had also reduced drastically since monsoon picked up steam, rued a Ranchi wholesale trader Naresh Sahu, saying compared to last week's two trucks, only one came this week. BAU scientist Jha stressed it was possible to save tomatoes from tearing or fungus. ""Growing tomatoes in polyhouses in a controlled environment will enable them to survive heavy monsoon, but then, only a fraction of Jharkhand's tomatoes are grown that way. More farmers need to adapt to progressive ways,"" he stressed. Raj Kumar, MD of Jharkhand State Agriculture Marketing Board, added another valid point. ""We need cold storage for perishable items so that the produce we get is kept properly. So far, a few private ones have come up at Bero, Ormanjhi and other places, but we can't monitor them. The situation will improve when our 5,000 metric tonne cold storage comes up in Pandra,"" he said. But for now, the scene at Lalpur vegetable market, one of Ranchi's largest retail hubs, is dismal. A vendor had stocked 5kg of tomatoes against the 20kg. ""Due to heavy rain, the local tomato crop is damaged,"" rued Munna Oraon, when asked why there were so few tomatoes. ""I brought 5kg tomatoes from Bero farmers but that too is of poor quality,"" he admitted. Potato vendor Lokesh in Lalpur said he was selling them for Rs 24 a kilo. ""Last week, it was Rs 18 per kilo. But, what to do when supply is so poor? Our margins are thin."" Homemakers are feeling the pinch. ""I'm substituting fresh tomatoes with ketchup and using less potatoes in subzi,"" Lalpur homemaker Anju Saxena said. ""French fries are out of the menu for the time being."" But, scientist Jha had a word of hope. ""New cropping is on at tomato and potato hubs. By September, Ranchi customers can expect the duo at affordable prices,"" he said."
58fefa957be9e0420db2a9df,The ambush on the tongue,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/opinion/story_91990.jsp,2016-06-19,,Telegraph,"Reading about the huge variety of international food now hitting Calcutta makes me imagine the city as a planet which, having placidly circled around its star for billions of years, is suddenly being peppered by rain-waves of asteroids. It's not true, of course: if there was one place in the subcontinent that was a smorgasbord, or rather a khichuri, or perhaps actually a bhelpuri of cosmopolitan foodings, it was this colonial town, soon after its establishment. Besides the massive variety of local food, in its early years the city hosted cuisines from Portugal, France, Britain, Burma, south-east Asia and China, while African, Middle Eastern and Afghan food would also not have been unknown here. Looking back over the last half-century one realizes that the city was in fact provincialized only after the departure of its international citizens. From the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, at the higher price range there was not much available besides the standard, ho-hum five-star fare. Likewise, while the streets retained their great local culinary chutzpah, nothing during those years was particularly exciting or ground-breaking at the lower end of the dining scale either. The city had its cuisine pillars of course, what one could call the Calcutta-Wajid Ali-Lucknow cookery, the most authentic Chinese food in India, and a small cluster of restaurants working the vein of raj Anglo-European cooking. Ringed around Burrabazar and Bhowanipur were also the street foods of north India, Marwar and Gujarat-Bombay, not to mention the South Indian joints near the enclave of Lake Market. Growing up as a doubly local-yokeled kid - south Cal and non-Bong vegetarian - life had in wait a lot of taste surprises for someone like me. I still remember the taste of the first non-Amul cheese, in a sandwich at a French-American couple's house on Pretoria street, some hard cheese, probably Emmental because it had holes, like in the foreign comics, with - I now realize - a thin scrape of Dijon mustard; the first taste of proper French red wine in Delhi as a teenager; the shock of a proper pizza while visiting America; the first taste of Guinness with the tangle of extreme bitter and subtle sweet that could compete with any karela sabzi. Across life, one got to learn that, just as it's possible for many people to be at home anywhere, everybody but almost everybody is a provincial, a local-yokel, during their first years, no matter whether those years are spent in a floating market on the Mekong or a chateau in Mdoc. In this regard, a sudden memory pops up. My mother was a fine cook of Gujarati food and many non-Gujju friends became devotees of the various, classic snack items she'd make. In the mid-1990s, one such friend was working in Dhaka when I travelled to meet her. The loud and repeated request was for me to bring a stack of my mother's much sought after theplas (spiced paratha-type flatbread). I duly took along a box packed with theplas and, since it was Ramazan, a few of these were placed alongside the several other items where the iftar feast was laid out. The thepla fan burst into effusive excitement when she saw the discs loaded with methi leaves and all sorts of spices, and immediately grabbed one. Our host, a sophisticated, upper-class Bangladeshi woman, much travelled and widely exposed to the different foods of the world, also picked up one. As I watched, she took a bite and her head snapped back in shock and revulsion. She quickly put down the offending thing and put distance between herself and the ecstatically mumbling thepla fan. At first I was deeply offended - it was as if my Bangladeshi friend had insulted my mom. But then I thought back at all the electrified rejections and ejections I had made of alien tasting food across my life, not least all sorts of supposedly great Bengali fish, and I calmed down. Like me, my mother, too, couldn't stand any smell of fish, uncooked or cooked. But she would have had equal if not greater revulsion for some of the things I've grown to love, from mutton curry and roast pork to finely sliced carpaccio of raw beef and bresaola. Thinking back, what offended me about my Bangladeshi friend's reaction was that, in my mind, she was after all a desi and not some bland-palate foreigner, and one who wasn't inexperienced in eating spicy subcontinental vegetable preparations, nor desi breads including, I imagine, rotis, luchis and dhakai parathas. Again, another neutralizing memory collides with this one, of when I first went to non-Bombay, proper Maharashtra in my mid-twenties. It was in Pune, one morning, that I asked for a cup of tea at a roadside stall. By now I'd had 'Indian-style tea' in many parts of northern and eastern India; I knew the taste of the thin Bengali chaa in the maatir bhaand, I'd bitten into thick, milky chaay at many Sikh dhabas, I knew well the differently highly sweet and masala loaded chaah in Ahmedabad; I just wasn't prepared for the particular masala they use in Maharashtra (or, at least in Pune) in their roadside tsahaa. Like my future Bangladeshi friend, I almost threw up at the first sip of that stuff and had to really control myself so as not to offend all the slurping Ghaatis around me. It's akin to what a friend, an aficionado of Hindustani classical, said, as he confessed that he couldn't stand Carnatic music, ""Of course you can recognize some of the the same raags as in Hindustani music, the notes are all in the right order, but the spicing is just wrong! I can't bear that!"" I suppose it's about what one is used to, also about what one is expecting to land on one's ear or tongue, and about being unevenly open- and close-minded about different things. For instance, in my rejection of all things piscatory, I remember throwing a fit when I discovered a friend had used (precious) fish sauce in a Thai meal she had lovingly made for my birthday. That was about 20 years ago; now I stock the (readily available) fish sauce in my own cupboard for any visiting culinary artist who wants to use it to cook in my kitchen. Similarly, I've seen other people change their food prejudices, some gradually beginning to like stinky cheese, or the taste of hiing or karela, some having a sudden epiphany about gin, or about the beautiful power of the bhut jolokia chilli. Equally, as time passes, one has witnessed people's tastes (and sometimes world views) shrink, chilli-champions of yore being unable to take even the slightest mirchi-heat, hard-core drinkards of wine rejecting allergy-causing red wine for 'safe' whisky, tomato-phobists actually beginning to use the emperor of fruit-vegetables in their cooking and so on. I think it's great that Calcutta is receiving all these different cuisines, albeit at the moneyed end. I think the ionic exchange between Calcutta the local yokel and world food, and simultaneously between Calcutta the sophisticated food town and the ignorant world, should increase exponentially. In terms of Calcutta as a food-discerning city, I find myself hoping our tastes continue to expand, and not just in some snobbish, money-driven way. It would be great if we were to have different innovative food vans a la so many cities, not just in Europe and America, but all over the globe. It would be extremely desirable (and I know this is a whole different Pandora's box, but it's not unconnected) if we were to avoid the knee-jerk reactions of Bihar (and, previously, Kerala) in following Gujarat into declaring foolish prohibition and decided to really work on changing our drink culture. It would be wonderful to take a leaf out of Bangkok's book and make sure our numerous street food stalls were strictly hygienic and spankingly clean. All of this would (forgive the pun) feed into making Calcutta a different kind of 'food capital' or 'food hub' from what it once used to be. As someone, I forget who exactly, once said, if you change a society's food habits you transform that society itself. This change, if it can be effected, would be a good ambush to face."
58fefbf17be9e0420db2abdb,To counter the violence within,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160809/jsp/opinion/story_101309.jsp,2016-08-09,,Telegraph,"Irom Chanu Sharmila may be calling off her hunger-strike after 16 years of force-feeding, but the attention she has managed to attract to her cause is substantial. That her breaking the fast, her decision to marry and join politics have attracted international media attention is not only because of her unique method of protest, but also because of the seriousness of the cause she campaigned for. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act that Irom Sharmila wanted repealed is indeed a draconian law inconsistent with the spirit of Indian democracy. It tarnishes India's global image at a time when its prime minister, Narendra Modi, is making an effort to secure a place for the country on the global high table. But, more important, the AFSPA should be shelved because it encourages lazy, incompetent soldiering - why make an effort to find a militant by going over available intelligence when one has a law that gives powers to line up a whole village for scrutiny at day or night? Indian army and paramilitary forces have fought a counter-insurgency campaign in the Northeast for six decades now and in other 'disturbed areas' of India like Kashmir for three to four decades. But India does not have a counter-insurgency doctrine - all it offers are clichs, such as the iron fist in a velvet glove. It is high time the country develops a doctrine based on its long experience and one that focuses more on political persuasion and smart internal security management rather than on the blatant use of force. Force often begets more force and surely more alienation. The AFSPA confers special powers on the armed forces to respond without restraint in ""disturbed areas"" to maintain law and order. In a ""disturbed area,"" a military officer can fire upon an unlawful assembly of five or more people if the need arises or for the illegal possession of firearms. The military is free to use force, even causing death to those suspected of possible violence. No arrest and search warrants are required for any operation as in the provisions of the law. Owing to the blanket powers it confers on soldiers, there is a lingering fear of its misuse. In 1990, an amendment bill was passed to include the state of Jammu and Kashmir under the purview of AFSPA. Manipur, however, withdrew the act from some parts of the state after a huge agitation following the mysterious death of Thangjam Manorama. The federal government in 2004 appointed a five-member committee under a former Supreme Court judge, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, to review the act and consider complete repeal or a possible replacement by a more humane legislation. On June 6, 2005, the committee recommended in its 147-page report the repealing of the act unanimously. Interestingly, among the five members of the commission was a former director-general (military operations) of the Indian army, Lieutenant-General (retired) V.R. Raghavan and a former home ministry bureaucrat, P.P. Shrivastava. Now why would such hard-core members of the security establishment advocate a repeal of AFSPA? This is a question that has rarely been asked. In fact, many a military officer with long years of experience in counter-insurgency in the Northeast and Kashmir has argued after retirement that it should be repealed as it serves no purpose. But the serving military establishment has fiercely stalled AFSPA's repeal. Senior officers even launched a Facebook campaign to ""save AFSPA"". The defence ministry has been pressured by the army top brass, so that the United Progressive Alliance government did not even dare place the Jeevan Reddy Commission's report for discussion in Parliament. But it is time India seriously considers a repeal of AFSPA - not merely out of a concern for human rights but also out of a desire to improve and refocus India's internal security regime. One has to remember that counter-insurgency is directed against one's own citizens and not against a foreign enemy. So, the primary focus of a counter-insurgency operation should be 'winning hearts and minds', and not liquidation or elimination. AFSPA lets troops get away with murder and its frequent misuse encourages a culture of impunity which is counterproductive to WHAM because it widens the disconnect between the forces and the local population. With AFSPA around, military or paramilitary units do not feel the need for restraint or fire control, leading to incidents like the one at Malom (Manipur) which led Irom Sharmila to start her hunger strike in 2000. It also leads to a sharp drop in professionalism and actually dehumanizes and corrupts the army and paramilitary forces. The extent to which AFSPA has encouraged a culture of impunity and a compromise of professionalism can be gauged from cases such as that of Colonel H.S. Kohli (the ""Ketchup Colonel"") who asked civilians to feign death, smeared them with tomato ketchup and claimed kills in an operation - all to score brownie points. It was later found that he had done all this in full knowledge (if not under explicit orders) of his immediate superior, Brigadier Suresh Rao of the 73rd Mountain Brigade. These mountain brigades are supposed to be our key units in the order of battle against China. If one were to lay emphasis on the primacy of WHAM in counter-insurgency, success in it should be judged not by body count in encounters or by 'area domination' but by how many rebels/militant groups have been compelled by an intelligent mix of persuasion, force, secret contact and psychological operations to abandon the path of armed struggle and return to normal life. AFSPA makes soldiers lazy, non-professional and is characterized by an absolute lack of focus and a conspicuous lack of a consistent doctrine of counter-insurgency. Operational action is rarely linked to clearly defined objectives - more kills rather than more surrenders from guerrilla ranks are likely to fetch better decorations and rewards but they also encourage gung-ho commanders to further alienate the force from the people in areas of operation. The former Manipur governor, Lt.Gen. V.K. Nayar, made this point rather strongly in an article in the Indian Defence Review in October 1992. In his book, A Soldier Recalls, Srinivas Kumar Sinha says that until the late 1960s, the Indian army did not even have training manuals for counter-insurgency. Even now, many military institutions like the Counter-Insurgency & Jungle Warfare School do not have appropriate campaign studies for units to be deployed for 'internal security duties' in a counter-insurgency environment. In his Fighting Like a Guerrilla, Rajesh Rajagopalan has aptly pointed out that the ""conventional war bias"" of the Indian army explains its failure in counter-insurgency like in the Jaffna peninsula during the Indian Peace Keeping Force operations in the late 1980s. Therefore, the argument made by the military top brass that its units will be ""crippled"" in counter-insurgency situations without AFSPA is untenable. Long use of AFSPA has not helped end insurgencies; political settlements have. The reason for the failure of Indian military units to effectively root out insurgent groups in Kashmir or the Northeast stems from its failure to evolve an appropriate doctrine for counter-insurgency even after fighting insurgents for 60 years. This not only reveals the ""learning failures"" of an unimaginative military leadership but actually ends up alienating populations. It is time the government realizes the dangers of unleashing a force with a conventional war bias on its own people. The repeal of AFSPA should be seen as the first step in an effort to create a smarter and more effective counter-insurgency capability that draws more on information technology, psychological operations, political persuasion and conflict resolution rather than on overkill and mindless indiscretion. The government will have to evolve a counter-insurgency doctrine which will not only seek to keep the army out of the ""internal security"" matrix to the extent possible and deploy other specifically trained and highly skilled forces that observe the principle of ""minimum force"", but also not insist on an AFSPA-type legislation as a prerequisite for their deployment and demonstrate a respect for human rights and accountability in keeping with the letter and spirit of the Constitution."

George W. Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation's fast food president. ""A 'fish delight,' sometimes, right?"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town-hall-style meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald's. ""The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It's great stuff."" Trump's presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent. And so is his diet. In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn't have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House. But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Trump has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation - devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal), feasting on a McDonald's burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters). He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (""It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,"" his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See's Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol. But his highbrow, lowbrow image - of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seatbelt buckles - is also a carefully crafted one. If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting ""a splash"" more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Trump's diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them. ""There's nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,"" said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"

Telegraph picture Darjeeling, June 16: A college student who had successfully climbed Mount Everest in May today spoke of five climbers she had seen battling for life on the slopes of the world's highest mountain during her expedition. Trishala Gurung, 23, from Southfield College was part of the first all-girl team of the National Cadet Corps that conquered Mount Everest. She, along with Sulaxchana Tamang, who studies at Ghoom Degree College in Darjeeling, climbed Mount Everest in two batches last month. While Sulaxchana was part of the first batch to climb Everest and had left the base camp on May 18, Trishala had started the climb, along with 13 other members of the NCC group, the next day. It was Trishala and her team that encountered the climbers who were battling for their lives. ""Around 11pm on May 21, when we were above South Col (26,000ft), we met a climber who was digging ice. It was on a slope of about 70 degrees and first, I thought why he was wasting energy at such a high altitude by digging ice, which seemed unnecessary. Now, I think he was suffering from altitude sickness,"" Trishala told the media. The team, which had set base at South Col, had started its trek for the final accent at 8.30pm on May 21. ""A little above, we found a Sherpa and a lady climber. The Sherpa asked for water but I couldn't give, as I was wearing a thick glove and the water was deep inside my bag so that it didn't get frozen. They said they were hungry and I managed to give them chocolates and dry fruits,"" said Trishala. Fifty meters above the Sherpa and the lady was another climber hanging on a rope. ""We didn't know whether he was climbing up or down and just above him was another man who was resting and moving his hands probably trying not to fall asleep,"" said Trishala. She reached the summit, along with three other NCC cadets, an army officer and six Sherpas, at 8.30am on May 22. ""Later, when we were descending, we found that the man who had been seen moving his hand had died. He had anchored himself safely so that he would not fall. We did not see the other man on the rope, or the lady and the Sherpa with her,"" said the Southfield College girl. However, Trishala and the army officer, Bishnu Rana, met the man who was digging ice. ""It seems he was moving in an opposite direction where the ropes were tied. He seemed to be suffering from snow blindness and had frostbite on the hands. He said he was from Calcutta and even though he said his name, I cannot recollect it now. When he said he was from Calcutta, it struck me that we were from the same state,"" said Trishala. Trishala and her team had by then been informed about some missing climbers. ""The description matched the man who said he was from Calcutta. We tried to get him down to South Col but we couldn't. The only way was to carry him and we could not despite our attempt,"" said Trishala. The team then reached South Col in about 20 minutes and immediately, Sherpas climbed up and brought the Calcutta man to the South Col. ""One of the Sherpas, Migma Dorjee, made tomato soup and he had it. We then gave him coffee but when the mug was handed over to him, he could not hold due to frost bites and the coffee spilled over the mat. It was so heartbreaking when he immediately kneeled and tried to lick the coffee from the mat,"" said Trishala. The Calcutta climber was kept in a tent which was abandoned by pervious climbers. When the Sherpas went to serve tea to him in the morning, the climber was found dead. Even though Trishala cannot recollect the names, her description suggests that the lady was Sunita Hazra of Barasat, who along with the Sherpa was rescued but Sunita suffered frost bite. Trishala's description also suggests that the three people they met were Subash Paul from Bankura, Goutam Ghosh of Barrackpore and Paresh Nath of Durgapur who were all part of the same expedition."

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Berhampur/Cuttack, July 15: Congress workers today clashed with police while staging a demonstration in front of the state police headquarters in Cuttack over shooting five innocent persons in the alleged crossfire between Maoists and the security forces in Kandhmal district on July 8. Tension prevailed after a 58-year-old woman Congress activist was injured in a tussle with security personnel during the protest. The injured activist, Basanti Tudu, suffered three cuts on her head after she was allegedly pushed by the police during the protest. Later, the Congress activists pelted tomatoes on police in protest against the ""inhuman treatment"" to one of their members. ""It is unfortunate that the police officials manhandled and pushed a woman activist of our party during the protest which is not accepted in a democracy,"" said Cuttack Nagar Congress president Mohammad Moquim. The police headquarters was fortified with the deployment of 15 platoons of force today. Condemning the ""violence"" by Congress workers, BJD spokesperson Samir Ranjan Dash said: ""Violence is a part of Congress culture."" In another development, Congress MLAs, led by leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra, today visited Gumudumaha village, the site of July 8 firing. Mishra said, ""Whatever measures have been taken by the state government following the killings of innocent tribals are all eye wash to dupe the people. We have come here to have a first hand assessment to find out who is responsible for the incident and how we can avoid repetition of such incidents in the future."" The Congress delegation alleged that the state government was solely responsible for the massacre and it was trying to shield the officials responsible for the killings of the innocent people in the name of anti-Naxal operations. Later during the day, a delegation of BJP MPs led by party's national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe arrived In Kandhamal. They are scheduled to visit the site tomorrow. ""The state government is not responsive to the killings of innocent tribals in Kandhamal. We have taken the incident seriously and have expressed our deep sorrow on the killing of innocent tribals in Kandhamal. We have come to have an on-the-spot assessment and will submit the report to our president Amit Shah,"" said Sahasrabuddhe. Earlier, a ten-member fact-finding team led by BJP state unit president Basant Panda had visited Gumudumaha village. A four-member team of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) had met the family members of the firing victims and injured persons at Gumudumaha on Tuesday. However, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who is now in Delhi, has stayed away from the entire episode. Additional director general of police in charge of State Human Rights Protection Cell Mahendra Pratap, who will supervise the investigation into the incident by a special investigation team, said the SIT would visit the site and speak to the affected villagers and the police personnel. ""The ballistic test of the guns used by the police officials will be conducted to ascertain as to who had fired at the tribals,"" he said."

Pictures by Ashok Sinha Spirits of the past haunt Dhananjay Kumar's shop at R-Block. Inside it is largely the same, like it was over a month ago; the same shelves from which Scotch tickled a drinker's thirst for malt. Even the refrigerator is the same, which, till not long ago held in its belly enough chilled beer to draw endless customers holding empty mugs. But today, the shelves contain cold drinks, biscuits, chips, soan papdi and Maggi. Open the refrigerator and one can almost see the chilled beer before focus returns and ice creams and cold drinks come into view. It is like this at most other liquor shops now forced to sell cold drinks and snacks since total prohibition was implemented in the state a month ago. While most liquor shops have shut down altogether, others have metamorphosed this way to live another day. But the present is a poor reflection of the past when one compares revenue earned. Most shops are not sure they will earn enough to even get back the rent they are paying for their shops. ""I pay Rs 30,000 in rent for this place and we now earn Rs 1,500-2,000 a day,"" said Dhananjay. ""It is becoming very difficult to pay my staff and rent. Because it is summer, we are just about managing by selling cold drinks. But I am not sure we can sustain ourselves after this."" This correspondent spent around half an hour at the shop during which only one customer turned up. The shop-owner laughed when he caught this correspondent noting four CCTVs on the premises. ""Do you think anyone is going to steal cold drinks? The CCTVs are not functional, we have cut the power supply,"" he said. He went on to say: ""Nitish ji should not have banned foreign liquor. We were paying tax after all. He has no idea how many people have lost their livelihood. Ban of country-made liquor was a good decision but Indian made foreign liquor should have been allowed."" Another erstwhile liquor shop in front of Hotel Chanakya has been turned into an ice-cream parlour. It also sells milk shakes, chips, Frooti, Maaza and Haldiram's soan papdi. The interiors are still the same. They've just replaced liquor on the shelves with the new fare. ""We spent lakhs doing up the interiors. We are not fools to be spending more on redoing the interiors to sell cold drinks and ice creams now. Those days we used to earn Rs 1.25 lakh-2 lakh a day. We now earn Rs 1,000-1,500 a day. Is that a comparison? This is not fair. When the government failed to open shops on its own it put a blanket ban on liquor,"" said Kaushal Kunal, shop manager. The shop has just replaced the earlier signboard with one for ice cream and cold drinks. Most of these shops have opened just three to four days ago. The government had offered to help liquor shop owners open milk booths in their premises, but till date no one has taken help. Another liquor shop in the Kankerbagh area has turned into an ice cream parlour, also selling tomato sauce, vegetable patties, cold drinks, biscuits and chips. ""Earlier, I used to earn Rs 12,000 a month, as revenue was higher,"" said an employee at the shop. ""But now pay has dipped to Rs 3,000. Everyday, a fight ensues between my wife and me over how I will run the house or pay my children's school fees. We are not getting any customers. Why will anybody come here when there are so many established shops? Since morning, I have sold just two bottles of water, two patties and four ice creams. God only knows what we will earn by selling ice creams and cold drinks."" It remains to be seen how many liquor shops will start selling snacks and cold drinks in the coming days. There were 5,446 registered private liquor shops in Bihar, 2,471 selling country-made liquor and remaining 2,947 India-made foreign liquor. There were 424 liquor shops in just Patna district."

But harvesting the fruit on a small terrace in a grand manner is something special. The hard-work will always bear fruit. For Selvaraj Gowda it is sour and sweet as he took up the challenge and recently brought home the bacon of harvesting more than 300 kg grapes in a season on the terrace of his house at Pulliyampatti, a small village near Vedanchandhur Taluk in Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu.A tractor driver by profession, the 42-year-old god-fearing person Selvaraj hails from a poor family and his love for nature began at a tender age. His passion for growing vegetables started when he was in the fifth standard.However, the idea of growing grapes on the terrace was suggested by his wife, Soundeshwari, a couple of years back. My wife gave me a small bunch of grapes and asked me to taste it. She told me that the sweet grapes were grown in clay pots at her friend's place, Selvaraj, who also does voluntary work at temples, said.When I took interest in growing grapes in our place, we had constraints of space to make a grape garden around my house, he said. That made him almost drop the idea. However, his wife was not the one who was willing to give up easily. Soundeshwari promised full cooperation in developing a grape garden on his terrace and Selvaraj decided to take a plunge into grape cultivation and that too on his house rooftop.Initially, I spent Rs 15,000 to set up steel beams and other necessary equipment on my terrace, Selvaraj said. To mobilise additional funds for his new venture, he slogged and worked extra hours. That helped him in arranging the seed fund for the path-breaking initiative. He had about 900 sq feet available on the roof but decided to use only about 700 sq ft for the cultivation.Luckily, it clicked and he harvested good crop. As the terrace faces south, there is good sunshine throughout the day. I spent a few thousand rupees to ensure shade for roots of the plants. This was needed as continuous exposure to sunlight would have meant the plant would dry up, he said.Besides, the couple tied wire crisscross on the terrace to enable the plant to creep, spread and grow without hitches. They made grape cuttings and planted them in the tank constructed on the terrace.Selvaraj and his wife's hardwork was not in vain. The first harvest fetched him 50 kg good grapes. I and my wife were very happy when the flowers slowly turned into grapes, he said. He credited his wife for the achievement and stressed without Soundeshwari nothing could have been done.I used simple bio-fertilisers like cow dung and regular watering during summer as it is essential for healthy grape growing, he said. Natural tropical climate and regular wind and sun prevented pest attack on plants.There is a big advantage in our place, he said. We had options to regulate and make changes required for cultivation of grapes. Everything from water management to nutrient factor were under our control, he said.Selvaraj also efficiently undertook pest control measures. He says that the common pests of grape farming are flea beetles, thrips, mealy bugs and leaf hoppers. According to him, the sugar content in grapes determines when the fruit is ready to be harvested. The grapes are ready to harvest in about five to six months, he said. Selvaraj cleverly chose to grow Panneer Grapes, a popular fruit across the south India, by considering local growing conditions.Explaining about the second harvest, he said after the harvest is over, it is important to trim all green growth that you do not want to be part of the main trunk. Interestingly, the couple do not sell the grapes but give them to poor children in the area. We have decided not to sell even a single grape that is grown on our roof. Even if I grow one tonne, it will be given to children and poor people, Selvaraj asserted.Selvarajs efforts were recognised by the local farmers association, which pitched in to help him in the second harvest. After hearing about my success, local farmers helped me in giving organic fertiliser and equipment so that I could do better in the next harvest by getting 150 kg of grape, he said.My friends and neighbours came forward to help me. Some of them offered me steel poles, a few others natural fertilisers and even grape seeds, he said.Recently, Selvaraj cultivated 300 kg in his third harvest. He claims during the latest harvest, each bunch of grapes weighed about 250 grams. We are planning to achieve about 500 kg, he added.As per an expert's advice, Selvaraj allowed the grapes to grow freely in his latest cultivating season, without removing canes. He supported the vine with extra bamboo stake. Extra growth of leaves in this season will also make roots stronger and ensure that the plant gets a good start in the next season, he said.Keeping in mind the help from his friends and neighbours, Selvaraj shared the fruits. This time I had enough grapes to give to more people and children"", he said. Selvaraj adds that rooftop grape harvesting will also be a learning environment where kids from local schools, who love nature, could understand utilisation of space. Selvaraj also grows vegetables around his house. I have some space around my house to grow vegetables, he said.Selvaraj's daughter, who is in the ninth standard, helps her father.Brinjal, carrot, snake gourd, red pumpkin, cucumber, tomato and ladies finger are the latest entry to Selvaraj's garden."

And if that sounds judgmental and presumptuous, youre right. I was judgmental and presumptuous about the womenfolk in my family who laboured away in the kitchen to dish out tasty treats for foodies like me. Till one such day when reality hit me. And how?I was to get married and live alone with my husband, with no one to cook for us. Fortunately for me, I had no romantic notions about marriage that love-struck couples can survive on love and thin air alone. I knew we needed our three meals a day  fresh, tasty and healthy. But, cooking and me? A chit of a girl whod always treated cooking with disdain?Well, coming back to the problem, hiring a cook was not an option. What would my in-laws think? A crash course in cooking was out of the question, too. With the wedding just a month away, I was working, and shopping, and getting ready for the D-Day, all at once.So, the next best thing was to jot down all my moms recipes, to experiment later. I quickly grabbed a blue diary, dragged my mom out of the kitchen, and started noting down recipes for everything from simple chutneys to complicated biryanis.Along the way, I realised I was ignorant when it came to the names of dals. Painstakingly, I explained each dal with my own understanding of it. Toor dal was sambhar dal, green gram was kosambari dal, and so on. Once done, I felt like I had conquered the kitchen. The blue diary occupied the pride of place in my wedding trousseau, holding within its hallowed pages culinary secrets that promised to make me a great cook.Post-honeymoon, the first thing I did on entering the kitchen was to open my blue diary and look for the simplest of recipes. It was tomato bele saaru (rasam). Thus began my culinary journey, with the blue diary religiously by my side. I quickly graduated from saaru to gravy to pulao and biriyani. Of course, not without the blue diary by my side. Recipes from glossy books were not for me. Even if I saw an interesting recipe, I had to first note it down in my blue diary before trying it out. My strong belief was that only recipes that came out of my blue diary worked their magic.Over the years, the blue diary attracted more recipes, and oil splatter, too. Dog-ears and the fading colours of its pages notwithstanding, it continued to be my cooking bible. It was highly personalised, too, as only I could understand the recipes therein, what with my own notes in a nice combination of my mother tongue and English.Recently, post my week-long vacation, I opened the kitchen cabinet to pull my blue diary out, and what did I see? Horror of horrors, my sacred book had been feasted upon by termites. It was in tatters. Tears rolled down my cheeks. Out of frustration, out of anger. Of all the books at home, which are quite a few, termites had to target my blue diary. The same diary that had changed my attitude toward cooking, the same one that had given me the confidence to master culinary skills. And, most of all, the one that had marked my journey from ignorance to struggle to triumph.My dear blue diary, I miss you."

Evironmentalist in him spurred him to take up some green activity in his apartment. The result: he has more than 1,700 plants, including bamboo shoots and vegetable and medicinal plants. These give his house a garden look.Exnora founder Nirmal has nurtured thousands of plants in his 12th floor apartment. Garden can be created everywhere, including your home store room or even in the balcony, Nirmal says. Except his bedroom and a small portion of his kitchen, the entire space, including veranda and terrace, have plants. Since plant produces more oxygen, it is better to avoid that in your bedroom, he says.When I came to this apartment, neighbours initially challenged that plants will not grow as the place has high levels of pollution. However, I proved them that plants can be grown anywhere provided there is good sunlight, 74-year-old Nirmal, who started his house gardening a few years back, said.In his house, one can find plants in handmade jar carved out of thermocol, flowers in wooden bowls and freshly planted crotons in pots. Nirmal also uses bamboo poles for planting. Bamboo can be horizontally placed from a rod fixed to the wall. Now the poles can be filled with soil and with that we can grow small flowering plants in them, he said. His living room too has plenty of plants, including those with medicinal properties. My living room is an oxygen parlour for me, he said.Gardens help to cool the house, he claimed. Nirmal's garden venture could be classified into earthen pot garden, pipe garden, tray garden, bag garden, drum garden and tyre garden. Even canvas shoes could be seen filled with mud and saplings in them.According to him, sufficient sunlight and tailor-made space are necessary to start garden at home. Keep the plants near windows or in the balcony where some sunlight will fall on the plants during the course of the day, particularly in the morning or in the evening, he said.Right plantsHowever, he said that there are some plants that can grow even in shade. Handsome hosta will grow in shade areas, he said adding a few others need just little sunlight. Right plants have to be picked for the right spots, he said. For example shrubs or hedge plants should be planted on both sides of the entrance of the house, he added.Nirmal said if sufficient sunlight is not entering the house, most of the potted plants have to be kept outside (terrace).Highlighting the benefits of the terrace garden, Nirmal said it will keep the house cool. The electricity consumed for operating a fan and an air-conditioner will be reduced. It will also calm you down, he claimed. Whenever I see my terrace garden, my mind becomes calm, Nirmal said. Besides decorative plants, he has grown vegetables such as brinjal, ladys finger, tomatoes, chillies, greens and radish on his balcony.The environmentalist claimed that his flat is zero water waste flat. Even the water we use to wash our rice and vegetables go into the plants, because they are full of nutrients, he said. We also prepare our own organic fertiliser to feed the plants. For Nirmal, water is the most precious commodity and the second basic necessity after air. It should not be wasted and plants do not ask you for potable water, he said.Advising people to use sky space even if they live in a small apartment, he said that waste milk trays, which can he hanged, can be transformed into plant growing area. Disposable tyres can be stacked up to hold enough soil to grow plants, he said. Nirmal's 900 sq ft sky farm has over 50 medicinal plants, which he calls green pharmacy.We want people, especially youngsters to know that techniques like these exist and implement them in their houses, he said. More than 200 houses in the city have already taken up the activity.People from other states too have evinced interest in doing this, he claimed. On the advantages of sky gardening, he said people will tend to use the kitchen waste for compost and slowly sewage treatment will also be brought about for water supply. Nirmal's another advice is that greening the outside walls and compound will serve as a barrier against dust and polluted air.Now, Nirmal's garden has turned into a small tourist spot with students from various schools visiting every day. Young students are very much interested in knowing about each and every plant. They are spending almost two to three hours during their visit, he said.Exnora, which was founded by Nirmal, is a broad-based non-governmental organisation focusing on mobilising and empowering communities to participate in preserving nature and preventing environmental degradation, thereby improving the quality of life.The 16-year-old movement has spread and covered many parts of India. There are about 5,000 such Civic Exnoras in Chennai city and in the various Districts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala and a few other states, covering about 30,000 streets and settlements."

I am also unaware of any demands that the agitators may have. The incident is politically motivatedSanjay Das Burmaskill development and technical education minister Bhubaneswar, Sept. 19: Minister Sanjay Das Burma today escaped unhurt after students of Alaranath Vocational College hurled a chair at him during a programme at the institute. The skill development and technical education minister faced stiff opposition upon his arrival at the college, which is located 65km away from here. Though the chair missed him by a whisker, the incident sparked a confrontation between the supporters of the minister and the agitating students. The clash also forced the police present at the location to resort to mild lathicharge to bring the situation under control. The incident took place when Das Burma, who is also the local MLA, was about to take his place on the dais during the 38th foundation day celebrations of the college. Though the cops remained tight-lipped about the reason behind the incident, sources said that the attackers were backed by Opposition parties. Alaranath Vocational College principal Khageswar Jena said the attackers were former students who had also been invited to the programme. ""The former students had an argument with the present group over some issue and both groups threw chairs at each other during the meeting,"" he said. Das Burma, on the other hand, pleaded ignorance about the incident. ""Protests are a part and parcel of politics but, it should be done in a decent manner. I don't know the reason behind their anger. I am also unaware of any demands that the agitators may have. The incident is politically motivated,"" the minister said. Brahmagiri police station inspector in-charge Umakanta Singh said the police had detained one student in this connection. ""The minister is safe and we are interrogating the student to ascertain the reason behind the incident,"" said Singh. This is not the first time that Das Burma has found himself in the line of fire of Opposition ""missiles"". Earlier this year, Das Burma, who is also the food supplies and consumer welfare minister, faced stiff resistance from youth and student wings of the Congress over alleged irregularities in the distribution of ration cards under the National Food Security Act. On January 4, activists of the Youth Congress had hurled eggs at Das Burma's car at Puri Circuit House. They were staging a protest against the irregularities in the preparing ration card beneficiaries' list. The cops in Puri had arrested five members of the Youth Congress in connection with the incident. The following day, activists of the Youth Congress again targeted the minister, hurling eggs and rotten tomatoes at his car near Chhatrapur Science College during another protest. The minister was on his way to Berhampur University to attend its golden jubilee function."

(AP) Amatrice, Aug. 25: The chaos came in the middle of the night. People were screaming and dying in the darkness across Amatrice, a summer getaway in central Italy famous as the birthplace of a pasta dish made with tomatoes and pork cheeks. It was 3:36am when the 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit, followed by a succession of strong aftershocks - including one nearly as strong an hour later - that flattened houses and buried residents in the rubble. Amatrice was the worst hit by the quake, which also damaged surrounding towns. As of this morning, the deaths totalled at least 247, officials said. ""Half the town no longer exists,"" mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice had told reporters yesterday morning. He might have been too optimistic. By midday Amatrice, a quiet mountain town about 100 miles northeast of Rome, felt more like a ghost town. Ambulances raced along windy roads clogged with traffic and rubble as rescue teams searched for survivors. Using picks, shovels and hands, they scrabbled through the dust and debris of crumbled homes. They brought in dogs to sniff for the dead and injured. A soft white dust was still swirling about the rubble piled waist-high in Amatrice. Stunned survivors - some with tear-streaked cheeks, others still wearing pyjamas - wandered through the streets, unsure what to do. A father, holding a small child, pushed a wobbly stroller piled with plastic bags of clothing over a rocky path. A young girl sobbed into her mobile phone. ""It's all gone, the bar, the house, everything,"" she said. The initial quake was comparable in intensity to one in 2009 in the central Abruzzo region that killed more than 300 people. ""The number of missing people is undefined at the moment,"" Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit at Italy's civil protection agency, said at a news conference in Rome. With a permanent population of about 2,000, Amatrice is a place where people know one another. Many had ties to Rome in one way or another, working there in the winter, running restaurants, bars and hotels, as food has always been part of the town's culture. ""If you closed the restaurants in Rome run by Amatriciani, you'd close half the restaurants,"" said Maria Prassede Perilli, a resident who had been visiting her sister in Rome when the quake struck. Perilli said she had rushed back after her husband, Giacomo, called in the middle of the night in a frightened voice, telling her, ""There's been a terrible earthquake, you can't even imagine."" Her husband survived, she said, but his sisters and niece did not. The couple's house was crushed. ""It's flat, like a book,"" she said. For many residents who worked in Rome, August was the traditional month of rest and relaxation. ""You had dinners in the piazza, long tables with lots of people, someone would bring out a guitar to sing,"" Perilli said. ""It's the mountain, it's a good place to be."" Women at a rescue camp in Amatrice on Thursday. (Reuters) ""Will they ever be able to rebuild this?"" Perilli said. ""It seems like the end of an era."" Rescue teams representing a spectrum of police and armed forces, civil protection agencies from around the country, as well as medical staff members worked through the day searching for survivors, but more often finding the dead. ""This is positive; as soon as the earthquake struck, people came from all over to help,"" said Riza Sinani, a nurse from the nearby town of Rieti. ""That doesn't happen in every country, this outpouring of humanity and good will."" Several people in Amatrice said the town had been full of tourists who came for the coming weekend's annual Sagra dell'Amatriciana festival, which celebrates Amatrice's native pasta sauce, using cured pork cheek known as guanciale, and grated pecorino cheese. The festival has been cancelled. As sympathy and offers of support poured in from around the world, Pope Francis led pilgrims at St. Peter's Square in praying for the victims, clutching a rosary in his right hand, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi went to Rieti. Renzi praised rescue workers and volunteers and vowed to rebuild - a promise particularly important for Italians still furious about the long delays in reconstruction after the 2009 quake. The area's most significant monument, the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, was unharmed, as were monuments in the city of Perugia. ""We were saved by a miracle,"" said Stefania Proietti, the mayor of Assisi, where in 1997 a devastating earthquake caused casualties and extensive damage to the city, destroying frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue in the basilica. For those in Amatrice, the immediate focus was on essentials: who was alive, and who was dead, or missing. New York Times News Service"
58ff1f2b7be9e0420db2cfea,River of discontent where 'cusec' is a call for war,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160913/jsp/nation/story_107927.jsp,2016-09-13,,Telegraph,"A woman takes her child from a Karnataka Sangha school in Chennaion Monday. (PTI) Chennai, Sept. 12: Just say ""Cauvery"", and you could end up hitting a raw nerve in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The two states have been fighting for centuries for their share of water from the river, which feeds the rice bowls of both. While less water has been flowing down the river - for both climatic and man-made reasons - the size of the area it irrigates has been increasing in both states, particularly in Karnataka. A tribunal award in 2007 that instructed Karnataka to release 192 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year has aggravated the dispute (it's not yet settled how much the release should be in distress years). When Karnataka has a poor southwest monsoon, like this year, things turn especially tricky as the water stored in its reservoirs is just enough for drinking and not for irrigation. So when the Supreme Court on September 5 directed the state to release 15,000 cusec water every day till September 15 to Tamil Nadu (about 1.3tmcft per day), furious farmers and pro-Kannada outfits in Karnataka directed their anger against the rulers of both states. Today, the top court revised the award to 12,000 cusec a day till September 20. In Tamil Nadu, every small legal victory on the Cauvery (or Mullaperiyar, in the case of Kerala) is flaunted by the ruling AIADMK as yet another feather in Amma's cap. This further provokes the pro-Kannada groups in Karnataka, who see their government as the loser in the duel in spite of controlling all the dams that store the Cauvery's waters. So the easy targets of their anger are vehicles from Tamil Nadu, Tamil films, eateries with distinct Tamil names and the Tamils living in large numbers in Bangalore and Kolar district. As interstate road transport grinds to a halt, trade and the movement of people are hit. While the arrival of tomatoes and onions in Tamil Nadu dwindle, the farmers growing them in Karnataka stare at losses because of the consequent glut. Similarly, milk and eggs from Tamil Nadu stop moving to Karnataka, the tensions thus hitting both states economically. In Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery dispute feeds into the rivalry between the two Dravidian parties to prove which of them is the greater protector of Tamil interests. So the verbal duel between the DMK and the AIADMK grows to its shrillest, with each accusing the other of not doing enough to get Tamil Nadu its share of the water. The two parties often send separate delegations to Delhi to fight the state's case, in contrast to the unity displayed by Karnataka parties. It is in this context that fringe Tamil groups try to grab their brief moments of fame by attacking vehicles from Karnataka or businesses run by Kannadigas. Although they claim that their attacks are aimed at deterring violence against Tamilians, such incidents in these days of 24-hour television news have exactly the opposite effect. ""It was only after New Woodlands (a hotel owned by a family with Karnataka roots) was attacked in Chennai early today that the Adayar Ananda Bhavan in Bangalore (part of a chain of restaurants with Chennai-based owners) got vandalised,"" a senior police officer said. Even when the monsoon is not playing truant, the Cauvery remains a sore spot as Karnataka wants to build one more dam at Mekadattu, 110km from Bangalore, to feed its capital's growing drinking water needs. Tamil Nadu sees it as another plea to deprive it of its tribunal-stipulated share of water. One solution mooted to decrease the two states' dependence on the Cauvery is to link the peninsular rivers starting from Mahanadi in Odisha down to the Vaigai in southern Tamil Nadu. With Tamil Nadu already locked in water wars with three neighbouring states - including Andhra Pradesh -however, that proposal may never take off. Farmers in the Cauvery delta have been slowly resorting to alternative crops that need less water compared with rice. This could create another kind of dependence on other states - for rice - by lowering rice production in Tamil Nadu. ""Even in a good year, the water flow along the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu is hampered by the huge pits created on the riverbed by reckless sand mining. The irrigation channels are not desilted, either, to take the water to the tail-end areas,"" an agricultural scientist said. ""We should address these issues with greater sincerity, too, while we demand our share of the water."""

58ff23367be9e0420db2d592,"Festive touch of Calcutta, in Hounslow",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161010/jsp/nation/story_112805.jsp,2016-10-10,,Telegraph,"London, Oct. 9: Bengalis in Hounslow in west London belonging to a group called Probashi queued eagerly for pushpanjali and perhaps even more enthusiastically for luchi, khichuri, bondey, payesh and home-made tomato chutney without which the worship of the Goddess Durga is not quite complete. The idol had been kept in storage for the past five years but this year the local authority has given permission exceptionally for immersion, which will take place in the Thames at Isleworth. After allowing Durga, Ganesh, Saraswati and Kartik to soak in the river for a couple of hours, the debris will have to be cleared. The Durga idol at Hounslow and (right) pushpanjali petals being distributed Hounslow believes it has the biggest Durga in the country. Designs for even bigger replacement idols have already gone out to craftsman Proshanto Pal of Kumartuli. No one quite knows how many Pujas are held in the UK though the consensus is that the figure is around 40, with around a dozen or so taking place in London. For years the main Puja has been in Camden Town in north London, but Hounslow is now apparently a Bengali hub, populated mainly by IT specialists who have come to the UK in the last 10 years or so. Without saying so, Hounslow reckons it has become a rival to Camden. The Bengalis in Camden ""said why don't you join us,"" according to Debabrata Das of Hounslow, ""but we said we can manage on our own, thank you. Then they said they will give us a prize for our Puja. We said no need, we can give you a prize!"" ""We are about 47 families who belong to Probashi,"" said Atrayee Chaudhury, who was very proud she had worn her bright red sari in Bengali fashion. Acting Purohit Biraja Ghoshal, (right) the Probashi women create a bit of Calcutta in Hounslow Atrayee, who works in financial PR - her husband Shankar Chaudhury works in IT - explained: ""We are first-generation (migrants). We want to pass on the Bengali culture to our children."" On Saptami evening, the children had lined up a Bollywood show. The Hounslow Puja has become a magnet for non-Bengalis and Bangladeshi Muslims too. ""I have become practically Bengali,"" admitted Probashi's current president, Chetan Kashyap, a Bihari who remembers Durga Puja from his days in Patna. He has been in Britain for 12 years and, like most of the others, works in IT. ""Everyone here feels 'this is my Puja',"" he said. Last year, some 7,000 people had to be fed. Two cooks are on duty. But everyone contributes by bringing in home-cooked items which have to be ""pure veg"". The job of the purohit (priest) was performed expertly on Saptami by Biraja Ghoshal, who said he knew all the right prayers and rituals ""because I grew up in a Ramakrishna Mission"". Ghoshal, who works for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said he had been able to access everything that he needed except, in the first year, the lotus. ""Then someone came along and put something in my hand - it was a lotus flower."" Marigolds of the kind needed for pushpanjali are grown at home by Hounslow Bengalis. One of them, Dr Ajit Kumar Basak, told of how disaster struck his allotment last year. ""I had between 3,000 and 4,000 marigolds. I went one morning and found the whole lot had been killed off by a nine-degree drop in temperature and a sharp frost."" Basak, who works as a scientist in the field of ""animal and human biology"", has a crucial role to play in the Hounslow Puja - he supplies the banana tree. ""They are the ornamental variety - not tall like the kind you get in Calcutta - and I have three which I keep inside my home where the temperature is 24 degrees Celsius,"" he said. ""One I give to Hounslow, another to the Puja in Ealing where I have a student and the third stays at home."" The Goddess Durga perhaps noticed one change compared with previous generations - ladies were taking selfies with Mother in the background."

""I have sown only that much of paddy which will sustain me for the year and grow tomato and capsicum on the rest of my land,"" said Nuagaon resident Budhun Ekka, who owns three acres. Ekka's income has increased substantially since he began cultivating these crops instead of paddy. Last year, he had made a profit of more than Rs 60,000. This trend is not only confined to Nuagaon. Kutra resident Sandip Majhi, who has completed his BA from Sambalpur, has returned to help his father in vegetable farming. This December, the plan is to produce tomato and capsicum on a large scale. ""The desi or indigenous variety of tomato and capsicum have good market all over the country,"" said agricultural equipment manufacturer J.K. Patra, who has an industrial unit in Kalunga industrial estate. Patra is in talks with some landowners at Nuagaon and near Rajgangpur to avail himself of land on lease. ""I want to produce drumsticks on permanent basis, along with tomato and capsicum,"" he said. These vegetables are in demand right from Bangalore to Punjab. ""These produces have more demand than the local ones,"" he said. A woman carries capsicum in Nuagaon. Rajendra Agarwal and his brother had been producing watermelon with seeds imported from Thailand. However, they are now planning to concentrate on tomato and capsicum. ""We found the demand for the two in many places, even in Bengal,"" said Agarwal. Patra, who plans to cultivate drumstick, said: ""This is a very cash-rich product, and one can grow other vegetables along with this as I have seen in Tamil Nadu. So, I will try to do that as well."" Over the years, Nuagaon and its nearby areas have come to be known as the land of capsicum. ""We take the best ones and the inferior ones go to you,"" said Narayana Krishna Reddy from Trisur with a smile. Reddy comes twice or thrice a year to this area and keep his supply chain network healthy back in Hyderabad and Bangalore. Now, he is planning to go to other areas of the district where these two crops are produced on a large scale. This year's monsoon, which has been moderate, has encouraged the farmers. ""I am satisfied with the rainfall, and there will be enough water for us everywhere, including the bore wells and rivers,"" said Bimal Lakra of Titrerkela. The only problem other than an efficient irrigation system is the absence of cold storages. There is only one private cold storage which is of small size and only let out to store fruits. ""We need cold storages, so that we can also sell our products locally when the demand goes up,"" said Amit Pradhan, who stays near Riun. He has completed his MBA and now plans to devote his full time to agriculture. ""I did agriculture marketing during my internship and gained some basic knowledge about it,"" said Pradhan. In Rourkela, the indigenous variety of tomato sells between Rs 25 and Rs 40 a kilogram while capsicum sells between Rs 60 and Rs 80 a kilogram."

(File Photo)In a bid to connect with North Indian voters ahead of BMC elections slated next year, ruling BJP has organised a public dinner with a traditional menu at suburban Goregaon on September 2 which will be attended by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. BJP city unit, which has organised the function, said 5,000 invitations have been sent out for the function, to be held in the western suburb.We are elated to announce that our chief minister would be having quality time with the people of North India over Baati-Chokha wherein he would interact with the intellectuals as well as commoners invited from all walks of life, BJP city unit president Ashish Shelar said on Thursday. He said Fadnavis will be first such CM who wanted to connect with commoners over a dinner with their traditional food.While baati consists of wheat and sattu (powdered roasted blackgrams) formed into balls with spices, and then dipped in ghee (clarified butter) chokha is a dip prepared by mashing boiled potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant together with some spices. It is no surprise that the BJP is aggressively trying to woo Uttar Bhartiyas as they form 28 per cent vote share in countrys financial capital. The outreach has another objective with forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, due next year.BMC has been ruled by Shiv Sena, which plays its agenda of sons-of-soil vs outsiders, with the BJP as a junior partner for over two decades. On the choice of venue, as Shiv Sena recently held a function to mark its golden jubilee at the same spot, Shelar said, We are organising this programme at same place where one party had recently celebrated its 50 years without connecting with the commoner, but our case it different. Our all top leaders of state, including Fadnavis ji, would have a direct interaction with the invitees.Mumbai BJP general secretary Amarjeet Mishra, who often organises such functions for North Indians, said, the work that chief minister of Uttar Pradesh didnt and couldnt do here in Mumbai (to connect with the North Indians), is being done by Devendraji.Mishra, who recently organised a music festival dedicated to Kajri form of singing which is popular in Northern belt, said, Our CM is connecting with North Indians very fast and this was very much visible when he instantly donned gamachha during a programme when he came to know that it was a typical a traditional cotton towel used in North India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The market is more than a century old and as years passed by, the condition of this biggest commercial hub has deteriorated. Except ""sweet promises"" from those at the helm of affairs, the marketplace has been in an unhygienic condition and left unattended to without any change for many decades now. Like others in the past who had visited the marketplace, today too, it got fresh attention from the Meghalaya government as chief minister Mukul Sangma, urban affairs minister Ronnie V. Lyngdoh, health minister Roshan Warjri and officials went there. The market is under the control of Hima Mylliem, one of the Khasi traditional administrative units. Acting syiem (chief) of Hima Mylliem, Ricky N. Syiem, and his traditional myntris (ministers) were also present. Though Hima Mylliem falls under the administrative control of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, not a single official or member from the council was present. The hourlong inspection began from a place where tomato sellers used to assemble every day. Sangma and his team explained to the vendors the intention of the government to revamp the market by working together with Hima Mylliem that proposed to develop a first-of-its-kind women's market complex at the venue. They inspected items ranging from perishable goods to garments. At the fish market, Sangma - under whose initiative an aquaculture mission was launched with a target to make Meghalaya self-sufficient in fish production - got an unpleasant reply to a query when one of the sellers told him that most the fish sold at Iewduhwere brought from Andhra Pradesh. The chief minister interacted with local shopkeepers and even took photographs with some of them. Amid the stench that emanated from the tomato-selling venue, he made a brief but ""promising speech"" before the crowd. According to Sangma, Iewduhneeds to be converted into the ""most-talked-about"" marketplace, given its legacy. The chief minister, who recalled his days as a medical student in Manipur, said there he saw the thriving Ima (women's) market. He vouched to work out a plan to have such a market complex at Iewduhtoo. ""If the Iewduhcan attract people, hoteliers and taxi drivers will get money and the state government will get tax,"" he said. Meghalaya has been also generating revenue from luxury tax from hotels, and the fund was utilized for development of the state. In a lighter vein, Sangma said once the marketplace had been the meeting point for many people, including youths who also used it as a place for dating. Stating that visitors, including tourists, must be tempted to visit Iewduh, Sangma underlined the need to make the market clean and attractive. He said his government was committed to making Meghalaya a clean and green state and design a programme where markets would compete for an award for being the cleanest. ""The most challenging is removing garbage which is the enemy number one. We came here as a team that is tasked with the responsibility of supporting Hima Mylliem in its plan to improve the market with additional infrastructure. We will sit together and design our investment and find a solution to the challenges,"" Sangma assured. Lyngdoh said: ""It is no longer a market, but a slum"". He warned that if a natural disaster strikes, the marketplace will suffer huge damages and massive casualties as it is congested with numerous unplanned buildings."
58ff3c177be9e0420db2eebc,Modified crop irks CM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161008/jsp/bihar/story_112525.jsp,2016-10-08,,Telegraph,"Nitish Kumar Patna, Oct. 7: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate cancellation of a clearance given to genetically modified (GM) mustard by a technical sub-committee of the central Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The committee's clearance certifies genetically modified mustard as ""safe for human and animal consumption"". Nitish requested the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and ensure that attempts towards its commercial release are not taken without prior consultation and the state government's consent. ""I strongly urge you that GM mustard application which has been cleared by a sub-committee to GEAC must be overruled instantaneously,"" he wrote to Modi. ""Further, no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, as it can harm the interests of the farmers and the people of India at large."" In the missive dispatched on October 6 - a copy of which is with The Telegraph - Nitish has also pointed out that ""interested parties"" were trying to push in an unproven technology and the states must have a decisive say in its use. Narendra Modi ""We strongly feel that as per existing policy, Government of India should consult and seek no objections from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop. The states must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on farmers,"" Nitish wrote. The chief minister's opposition to GM seeds and crops is well known. He had been at the forefront, opposing field trials of transgenic Bt brinjal (brinjal with a gene inserted from bacillus thuringiensis to make it pest-resistant) and genetically modified maize, mustard and other crops. He has documented the Bihar government's opposition to GM crops and expressed dismay that ""the unscientific push for GM mustard"" was continuing despite previous communication in the matter. Nitish said that if transgenic mustard gets final approval it will become the gateway to a host of other GM food crops, including maize, rice, brinjal, wheat and tomato among others. The chief minister's worry stems from the fact that mustard is an important crop for Bihar and its oil is used for cooking, seeds as condiments in dishes, leaves consumed as a winter delicacy and cakes (residue after pressing seeds to extract oil) as animal feed. Its yellow flowers serve as food for honeybees during winter. ""Mustard is an important crop for states like Bihar and we'll not be able to escape the consequences of the technology,"" Nitish said on the use of transgenic mustard. ""When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out."" So far, the only GM crop granted final approval is Bt Cotton; cultivated in cotton-growing areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat and elsewhere since 2002. Nitish argued that the case of Bt Cotton amply demonstrates that GM is a failed technology, as bollworm, a cotton pest for which it was brought, has developed resistance against the Bt toxin and is wreaking havoc on cotton crops causing heavy losses to thousands of farmers across the country. He also questioned why GM mustard is seeking to promote itself as a hybrid technology when non-GM hybrids are available. ""I had written to the Union minister of environment and forests in January saying that interested parties who failed to win the confidence of farmers (on transgenic crops) are now pushing the technology through public institutions,"" Nitish said. ""There have been conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard and there is ample proof provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and civil society that the tests were misled to obtain favourable results. This particular GM mustard variety was tested against 40-year old varieties,"" Nitish added. He said GM mustard is similar in yield to latest hybrid varieties of mustard available in public and private sectors. He reiterated that agriculture was a state subject and urged Modi, who has been emphasising on cooperative federalism, to demonstrate by cancelling the nod to GM mustard. GM crops have come under severe opposition from advocacy groups and non-government organisations, who say its risks have not been adequately examined and sufficient testing not possible, as the regulatory authorities and scientific bodies in various countries are too closely tied to private sector industry. Some studies claim genetically modified crops could harm consumers."

The quantity of rainfall is also declining with each passing day. The groundwater levels have also fallen and borewells have to be dug deep to find water at 1,500 to 1,800 feet.Farmers work very hard and use the available water to grow crops, vegetables and mulberry for sericulture. New agricultural methods are being developed. Progressive farmers have now adopted the use of polyhouses (greenhouses) for growing vegetables.It is the experience of these farmers that the polyhouse is a boon. Polyhouses can be constructed in land measuring five guntas to one acre. Capsicum, chilly, tomato, cucumber, beans and other vegetables; watermelon, musk melon and other fruits; rose, chrysanthemum, marigold, Gerbera, carnation and other flowers can be grown in polyhouses.They can be also be utilised to start nurseries to grow saplings of mango, cashew, sapota, guava, lemon, custard apple, jamun and other horticultural crops. The plants grown in polyhouses are of a good quality and have a high yield. Not only do they use less water, they also are relatively free of weeds.Control of diseases and menace of pests is also easier in a polyhouse. Good quality vegetables can be grown in any season of the year and this can increase the profits. Polyhouses also offer protection from unseasonal rain, winds and hail.Farmers can also save 30% to 40% on fertilisers and water. The yield of vegetables and the ensuing profit can go up by 30%, says Shivaprasad, senior additional director of the department of Horticulture.With an increase in the number of farmers growing vegetables, the demand for vegetable saplings has also grown. Saplings grown in trays can easily be transported. Nearly 90% of saplings grown in polyhouses survive transplantation.An advantage of a polyhouse is the option of controlling the growth conditions. Vegetables grown in polyhouses are in greater demand and fetch better prices in the market.As per the regulations of the Horticulture department, construction of a one-acre polyhouse costs Rs 33 lakh. The National Horticultural Mission and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana give a subsidy of 75% to farmers of general category and 90% subsidy to farmers belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes for the construction of polyhouses.Boon for progressPolyhouses are a boon to progressive farmers. Those interested can contact the Horticulture department. Nearly 50 farmers of the taluk have already constructed polyhouses.Polyhouses can also be built on 5-10 guntas. A polyhouse built on 10 guntas can cost Rs 9-10 lakh. Maintenance of the polyhouse after its construction is utmost important, said Sunil, an official of the Horticulture department."

The process of drying helps lengthen the shelf life of the vegetables. There has been a growing demand for the quality and value-added horticultural crops and we have been marketing the same to a number of foreign countries particularly Dubai and Gulf countries, says Manikutti Subramanian, Managing Director of the Group.Dheenadhayalan, working partner, said that what started on an experimental basis with banana has given a new dimension to the company. The company was marketing these products through an agent. We do not have license or permit for exporting these products to foreign countries and we rely on the agent, he said.Mr. Manikutti Subramanian said that the solar drying of the horticultural crops is adopted when prices of vegetables are less. ""For example, when the price of tomato is less, we make a bulk purchase of the produce and dry it, he said. The dried produce is sold when the price appreciates.In fact a large number of hotel owners and restaurant managers rely on us to when prices of the vegetables shoots up, he said."

The Centre should fix uniform prices for vegetables across the country, to bail the growers from crisis situation. The farmers should be able to determine the prices for their produces, he said. He also urged the state government to strengthen Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing Society (HOPCOMS) across the state.Farmers produce 250 million tonnes of food grains and vegetables, every year. But, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to introduce appropriate food security policy, he alleged.Puttannaiah set a deadline of one month to the government to address the problems faced by the farming community at APMCs. Tomato growers expressed their anguish over crash in prices and irregularities at APMC. The farmers alleged that if a box of tomato weighs 30 kg, the brokers calculate for only 26 kg.Shadakshari, a farmer from Duggahalli, Nanjangud taluk ,complained that the brokers ignore them if they question the fraud."

Scientists should strive for value addition to agriculture produce to make the agrarian activity profitable. So, lab to land and land to lab cycle should be initiated. Research outcomes should reach the farmers and they should be tested on farmlands and the problems should be again fixed in the labs, he said.Pointing out that online trading of agriculture produce has been introduced in around 30 APMCs in the State to minimise the role of middlemen and make farming profitable, Siddaramaiah claimed that it was a first-of-its-kind experiment in the nation and was being replicated in other States.Citing the election code of conduct in view of the Zilla and Taluk Panchayat polls, he diverted to beliefs, culture and traditions and slightly towards spirituality.Customs and traditions should be followed for the benefit of humankind and the society and they should not be followed blindly. Since my student days, I am against superstition, but not against customs and traditions. My only concern is that beliefs should not harm the society. I strongly believe in Basavannas preachings and Sharana Samskruthi. Ones birth is not in ones control, but one should die as a human being  irrespective of caste, creed and religion, he said.Stating that the crux of Hinduism is tolerance, he said caste system was stagnant and was a hindrance in promoting humanity. Recalling his childhood, he said, during holidays to school, when he went home, he would not get food if he did not do household and farm chores. It was not because of poverty, but, because my parents regarded work as worship. Kayaka should be actually translated as production. The society will progress only when all the members become productive, Siddaramaiah added.Code of conductSpeaking about the election code of conduct, he said, it is actually a hindrance to development. Since I assumed office as the chief minister, the State has been facing elections continously. So, many development works are lagging behind, he said.Making a mockery of the eroding human values, the chief minister said it reflected even in sports and games. As children we used to play a lot of desi games and stayed heathy, now cards game is a favourite pastime among many people, he quipped.Member of Parliament from Chamarajanagar R Dhruvanarayan presented prizes to six farmers, who have achieved higher yields in paddy, tomatoes and plantains."

Reason: most of the veggie prices have been slashed to half.Good rain in July have cheered up the farming community. It has resulted in the reduction of vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed a month ago.Except a few unseasonal vegetables, most of them are being sold at for Rs 20 per kg. With hardly any weddings or ceremonies held during Ashada, there was also less demand for vegetables . Hence, there was a sudden drop in the prices of veggies, said Anand, Managing Director, Horticultural Produce Cooperative Marketing Society (HOPCOMS).While Tuesday marks the end of Ashada and the beginning of the festival season, slight fluctuation in the prices of vegetables is expected, he adds.Just a couple of months ago, the price of beans was Rs 120 per kg. It was hovering around Rs 70 a fortnight ago. It is sold being at Rs 15 and Rs 20 per kg presently. Even the price of tomatoes had sharply risen. Presently, it is being sold at Rs 7 per kg and hybrid variety is being sold at Rs 10 per kg.Says Anand, With onset of monsoon, small farmers had sown vegetables which are being harvested now. With rise in production, a large quantity of vegetables has arrived in the market, hence the reduction in price.On August 2nd, beans, carrot, brinjals, cabbage, ridge gourd, bottle gourd were being sold at Rs 20 per kg. Knol khol, beet root, ladys finger is being sold at Rs 30 per kg, capsicum Rs 50 per kg and drumstick is being sold at Rs 70 per kg, which is highest amongst all.Coriander, mint, methi and other greens, which earlier being sold at Rs 10 per bunch.

Today, he feels proud of his garden with a variety of fruits and vegetables, including exotic ones.The passion for growing vegetables and fruits motivated him to set up a garden on an area of 1,200 sq ft on the terrace of his house.Initially when I planted ivy gourd, I used to get around 150 kg of ivy gourd per month and there was a good demand in the market. Along with ivy gourd, I started looking for different vegetables and fruits. We have not bought vegetables from market for the last seven years, he said.Along with vegetables, he has also experimented with jackfruit and grapes in his garden. This year, DSouza tasted success by nurturing a two-year-old grafted Kantakali Pink variety of jackfruit bought from a nursery. The jackfruit weighed about one kg and had 15 bulbs. This is probably the first time that a jackfruit has been grown in a terrace garden, he said proudly.After working in the Gulf for a few years, he came to Mangaluru and converted his terrace into an organic garden.The garden has black mango from Brazil, China orange, Israel orange (which is consumed along with its peel), Thailand mango, wood apple, apple bore, water apple, Kabul grapes, grafted avocado, butter fruit, varieties of guava, cocoa, peach, cashew, coffee, star fruit, cap fruit, milky fruit, sweet tamarind, Jabuticaba (a kind of grape), sapota, sweet lime, Bombay Bore (each fruit weighs 150 g), strawberry, fig, pomegranate, seedless lemon, passion fruit, gumless jackfruit and varieties of mangoes like Mallika, Mundappa, Neelam, Badami, Alphonso, Kesar and also all-season mangoes.Apart from this, ivy gourd, snake gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal, drumstick, ridge gourd, tomato, winged beans, broad beans, hog plum, basale (both green and red variety), ladies finger (both red and whitish), mint, Harive, black pepper, bush pepper, green chillies, bottle gourd, Brahmi from Australia, Sri Lanka and also native variety and betel leaves can also seen growing in his garden.I dont use any chemical fertilisers for any of the plants including those of vegetables. Kitchen waste and dried leaves of the plants are manure for the plants. A neem mixture is sprayed to control the pests, he said.DSouza added that Tulasi, which he has planted, acts as a repellent for insects attacking the plants. A small olive plant also finds its place on the terrace. The plant was brought from Israel by one of his friends.Looking at my passion for vegetables and fruits, my friends get me the plants from different countries of the world, he said.Stating that the grape vine was planted accidentally, DSouza said it was nearly four years ago that a nursery in the city got two grape vines in a lorry load.As I was in constant touch with the nursery, the owner asked whether I was interested in planting the grape vine. I planted two vines and allowed them to spread on the terrace. After one and half years of planting the vines, it bore fruit from April to July, he said with a smile on his face.He also helps people set up terrace gardens and supports them with assistance. Over a period of time, he has set up 75 terrace gardens in and around Mangaluru.DSouza also delivers lectures in schools and colleges on cultivation of vegetables and fruits. A number of students visit his house to get a glimpse of the variety of fruits and vegetables grown by him. He said he had learnt gardening techniques through trial and error method.Terrace gardens keep the surroundings cool. For plant lovers who do not have space, terrace gardens give an aesthetic value to a house. It is a satisfying and invigorating experience. Moreover, its important to talk to plants to nurture them well. Hard work and patience is all what matters in terrace gardening, he explained."

This had made them to sow seeds of commercial crops.However the eluding of rains even after completion of one month of rainy season has made the growers to worry over the future of the crops. If rain fails, farmers will incur huge loss this year as well, said an onion grower.To cultivate onion on one acre land, the growers have to spend at least Rs 45,000 including sowing, removing weeds and applying fertilisers. A good yield can fetch at least 80 quintals of onion from one acre land. The lack of rainfall will, however, affect the yield per hectare.At present, the onion growers are dependent on borewell for irrigating the farm land. Onion plants have grown well in Nagenahalli, Biluvala, Maccheri, Chikkabasoor and other areas. Onion has been sown on 1,894 hectares in the taluk.According to horticulture department statistics, tomato is cultivated on 211 hectares land in Sakharayapattana hobli.

The price of tomato has shot up to Rs 70 per kg.The tomato is not cultivated in the district in a large scale to meet the demand of the district. As a result, the merchants purchase tomatoes from outside the district. This is also one of the reason for rise in price of tomatoes, said one of the consumer.The price of tomato has been raising since the last 20 days. From Rs 40 per kg, the price has increased to Rs 50 per kg and Rs 70 per kg. The price of beans (Rs 60 per kg), cauliflower (Rs 60 per kg), green peas (Rs 160 per kg), carrot (Rs 60 per kg), okra (Rs 40 per kg), capsicum (Rs 80 per kg), potato (Rs 40 per kg) too have increased. The prices of methi, pudina, corriander leaves and sabsige too have doubled.APMC Secretary Chandrashekar said, Owing to lack of rainfall, the tomato production has declined in the last three months. As a result, the arrival of vegetables to the APMC has reduced drastically. The onions arrive from plateau and Maharashtra and accordingly, the price of onions are under control.Lakhya, Sakharayapattana, Kadur, Kalasapura, Ambale where tomato, beans and other vegetables are grown in the district faced 1acute shortage of water in the last three months. This had an affect on the cultivation of vegetables. The region has been receiving rainfall in the last few weeks and the farmers have started cultivating vegetables. The harvest will reach within a month, said APMC former president S T Chandre Gowda.The price of vegetables have increased drastically. Instead of vegetables it is better to purchase one kg of chicken, said Jagadish, a resident of Market Road.The price of green chillies were Rs 100 to Rs 120 last week. However, the chillies have started coming to the markets in Chikkamagaluru from Hassan, Arakalagoodu, and Ramanathapura. As a result, the prices have come down to Rs 40 per kg this week, said vegetable vendor Jafar Saab."

It may increase further, if there is any delay in pre-monsoon rains, fear vegetable vendors.

Except cucumber, many veggies witnessed 30 per cent hike.HOPCOMS authorities said, city receives vegetables from parts of Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Ramanagar and Chamarajanagar districts. As vegetables are in great demand in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, many major farmers transport their produce to the neighbouring states, they said.According to a vegetable vendor Kumar at Devaraja Market, drop in supply of vegetables is also one of the reasons for price hike. He said that in spite of high prices, there was demand for fruits like watermelon and muskmelon as people prefer their juice to beat soaring mercury levels.According to farmers, even though prices are almost double, they are not getting handsome returns owing to crop loss and unaffordable transportation charges.Ramesh, a farmer, who had brought a tempo load of tomato for sale at a ground near exhibition grounds in the city said, even though the prices are touching sky, farmers are not making windfall, owing to obvious crop loss and other expenses.

The vagaries of nature have already taken their toll.Earlier, farmers in the hinterland had struggled to save their crops. Now, they are struggling to sell the available crops, with the crash in price of farm produce.The price of vegetables have fallen in the region. Bhadravathi was the main market for the vegetables grown in Kadur till recently. Now, the vegetables are sold at Kadur APMC till 2 pm. Okra, brinjal, tomato, avarekai, cucumber and others are sold at wholesale price only.With the demonetisation of high value denomination currency, the farmers have faced inconvenience to some extent. Vegetable price varies if the farmers accept scrapped notes during the sale of crops or if they accept new currency. In spite of it, the price of crops received by the farmers is not even sufficient for the transportation of crops to the APMC.Farmers cultivating leafy vegetables like coriander, fenugreek and spinach, seem to have been left in the lurch as prices have crashed. The women in surrounding villages wake up at 3 am and pluck leafy vegetables and visit Kadur to sell them at KLV Circle.Instead of selling leafy vegetables in wholesale, it is better to sell them by visiting various streets, said the women engaged in selling vegetables. Though farmers get a meagre amount, the price of vegetables in vegetable shops are high.In the absence of a statutory body to regulate the prices of perishable crops, there is a need to explore the possibility of safeguarding the interests of farmers and consumers by eliminating the middlemen involved, said a farmer.On the other hand, there was a huge demand for the sale of watermelon in Kadur. Watermelon was sold for Rs 30 per kg."

They are in grave peril of losing their lives, he said.The delivery of food packages, which included rice, lentils and oil, came amid a growing international outcry over the increasing number of deaths from malnutrition in Madaya, which along with neighbouring Zabadani, is besieged by pro-government forces, including the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.The aid shipment there was being coordinated with a similar delivery to the northern Syrian towns of Fouaa and Kfarya in Idlib province, which are surrounded by Syrian insurgent groups.After a last-minute flurry of negotiations as the convoys idled at the entrances to the towns, trucks and sport utility vehicles began rolling in, Pawel Krzysiek, a spokesman for the Syria branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said by text message from Madaya. Unloading was expected to last through the night, he said on Twitter.Aid workers continued to unload the trucks in the dark, using flashlights and cellphone lights, since the town had no electricity.Crowds of hungry kids around, Sajjad Malik, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative for Syria said in a text message released by the agency. Its heartbreaking to see so many hungry people. Its cold and raining but there is excitement because we are here with food and blankets.Um Majid, a nurse at a field hospital, said the mother of a desperately ill 8-year-old girl begged relief workers to take her to a hospital in Damascus, but they said they could not.Khaled Mohammad, a nurse anesthetist working in a clinic in Madaya supported by Doctors Without Borders, said weak and collapsing patients had continued to pour in to the health centre as people gathered to receive the aid, which he said included fava beans, sugar, hummus and canned tomatoes.OBrien said that getting the 400 people out of Madaya could be as complicated as getting the aid in. Negotiations would be conducted with the government of President Bashar Assad and other armed groups for guarantees that ambulances would become targets.Despite the arrival of the aid, and plans for new peace talks on January 25 in Geneva, spasms of violence continued on Monday, with an airstrike on a school killing at least a dozen children.UN diplomats and international aid officials welcomed news of the delivery, but coupled it with a plea for unimpeded access as international law requires. One convoy will not solve the problem, said Stphane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.For months, aid to Madaya and Zabadani has been the subject of delicate negotiations toward an agreement known as the four-towns pact. Under the agreement, some aid was delivered in October, and last month, several hundred wounded fighters and their families were evacuated.Since then, plans for more aid and evacuations have stalled, and malnutrition has worsened in Madaya, where, according to interviews with a dozen residents as well as with humanitarian workers assisting a clinic there, people have been collapsing of hunger as they try to subsist on things like grass soup.Madaya is controlled by Syrian insurgents, mainly affiliated with an Islamist group called Ahrar al-Sham, which has been the main interlocutor with Hezbollah and its patron Iran in talks to reach cease-fires to help the towns.Five people died of suspected malnutrition in Madaya on Sunday alone, bringing the total since the beginning of December to 28, according to medics at the Doctors Without Borders clinic.Nisrine, a schoolteacher trapped in Madaya who for safety reasons asked that her surname not be used, said she and her son, Abdullah, 10, were waiting eagerly for the aid but that she was sure it would not last long.Nisrine said two people, an adult and a child, died there Monday even as the convoy was approaching. Samer Rajab, an activist helping in the aid effort said three people had died in Madaya and a third in Zabadani. People are exhausted, Nisrine said. They cant even go to wait for the trucks. Theres not much time. The food should be distributed today.The siege of Madaya, which is surrounded by land mines, snipers and barbed wire, is only the latest that Syrians have endured  despite Security Council resolutions insisting on the unconditional delivery of aid across front lines.Cut off from the worldThe UN says that 400,000 Syrians are in besieged areas or in areas that are hard to reach, with the largest number, 200,000, trapped by Islamic State militants in the east. Nearly 200,000 are penned in by the government and allied forces and several thousand more by Syrian insurgent groups, mainly in Fouaa and Kfarya.The convoys on Monday included deliveries from UNICEF and the World Food Program-me, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the local Red Cross affiliate that takes part in all international aid convoys in Syria. The World Food Programme has said it planned to bring enough food to feed 40,000 in Madaya and 20,000 in Fouaa and Kfarya for a month.Hezbollah, in statements last week, accused insurgent forces in Madaya of hoarding food. The statements also accused the insurgents of not allowing civilians to leave. And on Monday afternoon, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jaafari denounced what he called efforts to defame his government with reports of starvation deaths in Madaya.He offered two seemingly contradictory explanations. He said the images were fabricated, citing a photograph of one child who he said was Lebanese, not Syrian. He also said aid delivered to Madaya had been stolen by terrorist groups and sold to civilians at prices they could not afford.Terrorists are stealing humanitarian assistance, al-Jaafari told reporters outside the Security Council chambers.OBrien, however, said UN officials could see for themselves the extent of hunger. There has been very severe malnourishment. Theres severe shortage of food and we have reports of people who are either starving or indeed have starved and died, he said. As for Abdullah, Nisrine said that he fell asleep before he received any food: He got tired and disappointed while waiting, the trucks arrived so late."

One of the largest vegetable markets in Sector 26, wears a deserted look as the number of customers has come down drastically. There is a big fall in the price of green vegetables because off-take by vendors has come down substantially. Due to this reason, vegetable growers (farmers) have been hit hard. The price of cauliflower in the wholesale market has come down to Rs 200-250 per quintal from Rs 1,500-2,000 a quintal during the past 10 days, says Paramjit Singh, a vegetable grower from Jangpura village.WATCH VIDEO: How Demonetisation Impacts Rural PopulationThe business has taken a serious hit since the announcement of the decision to invalidate Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Customers have virtually vanished from the market. The business in the market has come down to 20 per cent as of now. There is no money in the market with the people and with me as well to do business, said Hari Om, a commission agent in the market.Similarly, small vendors say the sales have gone down.Consumers have cut down on buying vegetables and other stuff. The price of green coriander was around Rs 20 per small packet but now 2 packets of coriander fetch Rs 10, said a seller, Ravi.Tomato, which used to be around Rs 40 per kg, is now Rs 20 per kg, spinach which used to be Rs 20 per bundle now costs Rs 10 for two bundles and mustard leaves have come down from Rs 20 to Rs 25 per bundle to Rs 10. Another small vendor, Ashok said, Today, we are seeing some customers, perhaps because it is Sunday. Otherwise, for the past 5-6 days there were no buyers. Before the demonetisation, Ashok used to sell fruits worth Rs 8,000 daily but now the sale has come down toRs 2,000.

The procurement price of cabbage which was Rs.15 per kg last month was down to Rs. 5 per kg on Friday while beans, which had a purchase price of Rs. 40 per kg, crashed to be sold at Rs. 8 per kg. R. Chandrappa, a wholesale dealer at the APMC yard in Mysuru, said that the bulk of tomatoes used to be procured by buyers in Maharashtra and other places for use in food processing units for preparation of jams or sauce but the demand was low since the last 30 days. Consequently it has resulted in supply exceeding demand and the prices have crashed, he said.Tomato is widely cultivated in and around Mysuru but mainly in Jayapura hobli of Mysuru district besides H.D. Kote, Hullahalli, Yelwal, and K.R. Nagar while Nagamangala is another tomato growing centre according to Raitha Sangha leader Badagalapura Nagendra.The crop is also cultivated in Gundlupet and surrounding areas but the farmers there are insulated from local glut in production and price crash as the bulk of their produce is sourced by traders in bordering Kerala.Failure to develop cold storage facilities for perishable commodities and lack of access to market in distant places due to poor connectivity besides absence of market information was hampering the farmers from getting a good price for their produce, said Mr. Nagendra.He and other farmers demanded support price for horticultural produce to help bail out the cultivators in times of crisis."

My niece sounds excited when she calls me in the morning. We havent seen each other in months and have a lot of catching up to do. The coffee house in my neighbourhood across a womens college is a favourite haunt for students. I do not know if it is the loud music or the avant-garde artwork on the walls thats the draw, but within a week of its opening, the place was packed with perky young people.As I wait for my niece at the coffee house, I remember the first time I brought my parents here. My dad placed his walking stick near the vacant table at the entrance and looked around. There was a hint of a smile on his face and then he sat down. Dad was a man of few words while mom made up for the lack of them. This doesnt seem very... Moms voice trailed into a whisper as she caught my eye. And this was before we saw the prices on the menu. The parents wondered aloud why I was paying so much for a cup of coffee.Shortly, a sullen waiter served us some snacks along with coffee that tasted like sawdust. The darshini down the road serves better coffee and costs nearly a third less, the parents grumbled. I fervently prayed that no one had heard their comments. Later, when I paid the bill, my dad decried, This is the last time Im setting foot in this place!The darshini down the road from my house holds its own as it caters to different age groups. Its a family favourite. Often the dosas made at home get vetoed down in its favour. For the uninitiated, the place is a hole in the wall  nothing fancy yet it gives a homely feeling once you walk in. The dilapidated walls and the standing-room only space do not deter the regulars or even newbies from venturing in.The aroma of freshly-made decoction coffee vies with the smell of butter emanating from the benne dosa. The slice of tomato served as a dressing on top of the khara bath is waived off as an eccentricity as the dish itself stirs up the senses with its texture, colour and taste. The servers greet the customers with a smile. While the regulars are given a familiar nod, the absentees are given an earful for not frequenting the place.As I nurse my bitter coffee now, I notice my niece step inside the coffee house. She heads my way after exchanging a brief smile with the person behind the counter. The moment she sits down, shes on a rant about fickle friends, absent-minded professors and difficult parents. Please dont give me advice  I just need you to listen, she insists. I am hard-pressed not to retort, How on earth can I hear the words coming out of your lips in this din?The rock music playing in the background has become louder and I feel the remnants of a headache coming on. But I continue to smile at her, secretly yearning for that cup of coffee and benne dosa at the good old darshini a few blocks away. Ah, the things we do for familial affection."

They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."

The evening was free so we went to the Vadakkanathan Temple. After that we sat on a stone bench under a large and spreading tree. The gentle breeze and the serene atmosphere did much to soothe the spirit.Lakshmi was in a mood to reminisce. She spoke at length about the good old school, where she was a boarder and didnt have a care in the world. She recalled the ruses she and her friends used to wrangle permission from the warden to go shopping or watch a movie always escorted by a senior boarder, of course. Sometimes, the senior turned out to be stricter than the warden! After a lengthy pause in the conversation, Lakshmi slid off the bench and said, You know what? I am hungry. She sounded as if she had made a major discovery. So we flagged an auto and returned to the hotel we were staying at. We headed straight to the restaurant where an attentive waiter seated us and stood by to take our order. I placed my order and so did Lakashmi. As an afterthought, she asked for salad as well. The pleasant-mannered, cheerful youth was only too eager to oblige. With the air of a magician producing a rabbit out of a hat, he put the plate of salad on the table. It looked impressive with slices of tomato, cucumber and carrot artistically arranged on a lettuce base with a mound of shredded cabbage in the centre. Looks tempting, doesnt it? asked Lakshmi. If you insist, I smiled. (I never touch salad outside the home.) She turned to the waiter.Dont you have onion? she enquired. He blinked in puzzlement. So Lakshmi repeated the question. He still looked uncomprehending. Lakshmi hails from Kerala so I suggested she speak in Malayalam. She saw the sense of that and asked, Onion undoe? Enlightenment dawned and pat came the answer. Illa. (No) was the very short and very sweet answer.Why? demanded Lakshmi, lapsing into English. Her voice held a hint of irritation. The waiter literally wrung his hands in confusion. Ari illa. (Dont know.)Then, as if inspired, he added, Chechi undu. (Have an older sister.) Aniyan pronounced like onion means younger brother in Malayalam. I had a tough time keeping a straight face. Malayalam, Lakshmi, I prompted. She did switch to her mother tongue then. And bingo! The waiter nodded and hastened away to bring the smelly bulb!"
59042b017be9e02646bdca3b,Being Buddha,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584908/being-buddha.html,2016-12-05,,Deccan Herald,"LEELA RAMASWAMY, Dec 05, 2016: 9:43 ISTA man, trying to uncover the mystique surrounding Buddha, asked him, 'Are you a god?' 'No,' he answered. 'Are you an angel or a prophet?' he went on. 'I am neither' came the answer. 'Then what are you?' And the Buddha replied, 'I am awake.'Buddha's answer may sound simple and even trite, but the word 'awake' stands for much more than its opposite, 'asleep'. It has a significance, which is both penetrating and profound.In our ordinary waking state, we may well be engaged in some daytime activity and yet fail to be fully awake. This happens when we lack command over our thoughts, words and actions. We then function much like automatons.Feelings of fear, anger, depression and even love can so overwhelm us as to make us slaves of our emotions. There are many examples and here are a few.Children often tell lies for fear of punishment. If the problem is not handled and solved wisely, they can turn into habitual liars. Anger can stoke unreasonable behaviour. Handled inappropriately, it can lead to fruitless arguments, physical fights that can result in death. Many murders are committed in a fit of fury. When anger is turned inwards, it becomes depression.A depressed person can turn away from all activity, whether good or bad. The person may even need medical help in order to emerge out of it. Even love, when bestowed wrongly, is harmful. A common example is the mother who pampers and indulges her child making him an unpleasant and demanding individual. We see now the great need to be fully awake and aware. It is only then that we can control the powerful impulses human nature is heir to.There is another important reason why we ought to be alert and aware. We think with our conscious minds. Whatever we habitually think of sinks down into the subconscious, the seat of creativity. If we think of good, then good will follow.If one thinks of evil, then evil is what will follow. The mind, we must remember, is a sacred enclosure into which nothing enters without permission. To quote Buddha again, ' A wise person is one who has a calm and steady mind, who is alert and who is free from fear.'"

At that instant, my mind subliminally started juxtaposing yet another lunch experience, to find a stark contrast, wherein I was invited sometime back with few others.So on that day, as I stepped in there, I saw the invitees, sunk in some soft conversations, skimming through sundry topics. The hostess, oblivious to the happenings around, was ambidextrously knitting a woollen sweater. And, the host was poring over the display screen of his sleek mobile phone, spewing out the comments for his latest updates on FB. The fact that the house was decked out in exquisite wall-hangings, exotic objets-d'art, enchanting faux flowers, all faded into utter insignificance amidst this uber inhospitality. None of the invitees seemed to enjoy the seemingly scrumptious food, sumptuously laid on the table.Apparently, with people today being inextricably caught in an immensely busy life, we are turning more and more like automatons, mechanically executing our everyday mundane tasks.No wonder, with severe time drought, the spirit of hospitality seems to be slowly losing its significance. Interestingly, even the invites for social functions, at times, are sent in a rather clinical/ frosty manner via SMS, (unlike in the earlier times, wherein people invited guests with the intent of genuinely wanting/valuing their presence).But today, at some of the family get-togethers, leave alone making guests feel important/ special, the hosts even fail to acknowledge their presence. And, once the guests are seated, often we see the host launching on a self-aggrandisement drive, expatiating on his/her recent achievements or acquisitions, without realising the guests would care two hoots to these insipid, mindless info.Still worse is when the host thrusts on your lap that family photo album, giving graphic description of each picture clamped in it. Equally worse is when the host holds horrendous monologues, dishing out dreary details about deadly exploits of their dear grand/kids. And, after all these ordeal endured by you, the time you are bidding adieu to the host, leave alone waiting near their house gate till you are out of eyeshot, the moment you cross the threshold, the door is slammed shut.Indeed, 'good hospitality' is synonymous with high comfort levels that we offer to the guests to the extent of making them forget whether they are at their place or ours. It also reflects on the host's upbringing, since it speaks a ton about how much the host is refined, polished and cultured in his/her attitude/ manners. These apart, speaking spiritually, it's believed, when the guests leave our home precincts with happy hearts, our punya quotient too would escalate exponentially. Yes, ""Athithi devo bhava!"""

But the many perversions of a Soviet-style economy fed by inefficient cooperatives and state-owned farms mean that the record arrival of visitors seems to have literally snatched the staples off ordinary Cubans plates. Once the collapse of the Soviet Union left the country ill-equipped to purchase fertilisers, animal feed, machinery, etc, a situation worsened by the US trade embargo, the Cuban government focused on organic agriculture. That has been greener but not more profitable, appetizing or plentiful.Azam Ahmed reports in NYT that, Tourists are quite literally eating Cubas lunch. Thanks in part to the United States embargo, but also to poor planning by the islands government, goods that Cubans have long relied on are going to well-heeled tourists and the hundreds of private restaurants that cater to them, leading to soaring prices and empty shelves.As onions, peppers, tomatoes, pineapples, limes, beer and soda rise beyond ordinary Cubans reach President Ral Castro has moved to capping agricultural prices. But as Ahmed points out, scapegoating middlemen does little to provide good, affordable produce for Cubans. Scapegoating the restaurants that have mushroomed to cater to tourists would be similarly wrongheaded. Its a supply side problem which can only be solved by encouraging not discouraging enterprise. Socialist policies discouraging profit have already taken a terrible toll on the economy; more of the same shall only worsen the countrys food insecurity.Meanwhile Irina Pino writes in the Havana Times, A psychological state has been created in poor people in Cuba so that they can do without so many things and hate consumerism like they would an infernal machine. In a mind game that demonetization has made so familiar here too, the act of queuing up for hours for food and basic items has been elevated as a virtue. But the grip of the mind game is loosening. Scarcity cannot remain a convincing virtue forever."

Today, the Air Quality Index is 310 and it states, Avoid outdoor activity. So I merrily unlace my shoes and collapse on the couch.7am: The prodigal son is heading off to school and asks, You are still here, what about your run? We had a deal! Munching on the leftovers from the babys breakfast, I add, I invoke the Force Majeure clause that clearly states a party is not liable to perform its obligations as a result of Acts of God including fire or other natural disaster. Not having decent air to breathe counts as a man-made disaster if not quite a natural one. And my foot is also aching a bit!Anyway, I just read an article in Time magazine about how even injured people can burn calories. Chewing, they say, also counts as exercise  15 calories an hour if you keep at it!He sniggers, Mom your foot only hurts because you constantly keep putting it in your mouth! And have you figured how many calories you will end up consuming in an hour?I snap, What am I, Aryabhata to do all these calculations early in the morning? Mind your business and go to school.10.30am: Scrolling through my phone on the way to the office, I stumble on the news that to instill committed patriotism and nationalism, the Supreme Court has now ordered all cinema halls to play the national anthem and folks are obliged to stand up and show respect to the same.Now, I am admittedly one of those barmy women who get teary-eyed during our national anthem and bellow it out as loudly as we can, much to the embarrassment of our children.I have even gone on a tour to the Wagah border where, along with the 200 people sitting beside me, I too screamed myself hoarse with Jai Hind and Bharat Mata Ki Jai competing vigorously with the Pakistanis raising their slogans across the border, because not having variable parameters to judge nationalism, we seem to simply define it by volume, hoping the loudest wins.But I still cant wrap my head around how and why I am obliged to feel patriotic when I have merely booked tickets for Befikre, and am about to see Ranveer Singh in his tight red underwear.2pm: Tucking into some biryani with an old friend, I tell her about the Supreme Courts order and she sighs, This nationalism fever is contagious. My husband has suddenly become so patriotic that whenever the national anthem plays, even on television, he drops everything and immediately stands up.I giggle, Perhaps you should count yourself lucky. Now, you wont have to dress up as a nurse or a skanky French maid, just get into your bedroom, and play Jana Gana Mana on your iPhone.She squeals, You have such a twisted mind, gross!I reply, Everyone is mixing nationalism and sex. Im just making jokes but Shree Maruti Herbal is advertising its Stay On pill with a tagline that says: Think demonetization, think Stay OnIts not a bitter pill. Its a power capsule. Watch with pride the emergence of Super Power- the India!She laughs, Yuck, I prefer the anthem idea.I reply,  Err..On second thought, the anthem only lasts for 52 seconds. I have another suggestion  swallow the bitter pill called demonetization, forget about cash on delivery to conceal evidence of your purchase and just buy a vibrator with your credit card.6pm: A straw hat perched jauntily on my head, I am helping the baby dig holes to plant sweet pepper and tomato seeds. We have begun working on our little vegetable patch and kitchen compost, though getting my building society to agree to composting seems a slightly trickier proposition.My phone pings with an email from the friend who is helping us set up, You convinced your building to go ahead? Dont know why composting isnt mandatory! It turns 200 kg of waste into 20 kg of rich compost which means less landfill waste and incineration, significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They should at least give municipal tax benefits to societies who shift to composting. Everyone will switch once the government dangles this carrot.I type back using a rather unoriginal veggie pun, I am trying and perhaps you are right about this carrot incentive because as things stand right now, most of my neighbours dont carrot all.And wondering why respecting our national anthem seems so much more important than respecting our land, I put my phone away and go back to planting a few more seeds before the sun sets."

Money doesnt make you laugh when you are lonely, or make you full of contentment on a New Year. But wherever you are, you have to work for your living, she added.So, do you think that a lottery win would make you happy forever? No, a big payout wont make that much of a difference. Winning the lottery isnt a ticket to true happiness, however enticing it might be to imagine never working again and being able to afford anything you want.It seems that as long as you cannot afford to avoid the basic miseries of life, having loads of spare cash doesnt make you very much happier.Our happiness depends on how we feel relative to our peers.Lottery win may make you feel richer than your neighbours. You may move to a new mansion in a new locality, which may make you feel happy. But, sooner, you will realize that all your new friends are living in bigger mansions.Happiness isnt a quality like height, weight or income that can be easily measured. It is a complex, nebulous state that is fed by transient simple pleasures, as well as the more sustained rewards of activities.Actually, happiness is having satisfaction and meaning in your life. Its the propensity to feel positive emotions, and holding a sense of purpose. Happiness is not having a lot of privilege or money. Its not a constant pleasure. Its a broader thing: Our ability to connect with others, to have meaningful relationships, to have a better community. People who say theyre happy have strong connections and communications with other people  that is a sort of recipe for happiness. Money increases happiness until about a certain level of earning, and after that our emotional well-being doesnt increase with income.Close circle of friends and family is most important for happiness. The material possessions like iPhones, computers, being wealthy and owning a sports car will not provide the same level of contentment.So, to sum up, true happiness lies in rewarding relationships, and not in material wealth and money."

Of baguettes and bistros,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ooh-la-la-of-baguettes-and-bistros/,2016-07-27,,The Times Of India,"It is a perfect summer day in Paris. The sky is a perfect cerulean blue, the trees are a vibrant green and the streets are full of happy people dressed in a symphony of colour. As I stride down the Avenue des Champs-lyses, I joyously break out into an old Maurice Chevalier song from the movie Can Can, I love Paris every moment. After one horrified look at me yodelling away, the family nimbly hops it over to the other side of the road, keeping a safe distance from the warbler with the non-musical prowess.We have been in France for the last few weeks for the Euro Cup tournament and now that it is over, we can finally get down to business: the art of fine dining in Paris. However, this time I am discovering something entirely different: While Paris may not be the melting pot that its sister cities New York and London are, what makes this city so special is the outdoor cafes which come alive in spring and summer. Between casual strolls along the river Seine and visits to the numerous cultural offerings in the City of Light, a good way to soak in the local scenery and sun is to eat at one of the thousands of pavement cafes across the city.As the temperature rises into the pleasant 70s, Parisians head to their favourite cafes to while away the day on a sunny pavement terrace. These cafes can range from a landmark locale to a small hole-in-the-wall noshery. Tiny rows of tables facing the street under gaily patterned umbrellas are overflowing with chattering, smoking Parisians, all occupying every corner in every square. With an astonishing number of cafs at which to park yourself and enjoy the City Of Lights anything-but-pedestrian (couldnt help that pun!) culinary offerings, the hangouts du jour are those with bustling crowds, and the best vantage points for scoping the latest Parisian trends.And these outdoor cafes serve everything, from the ubiquitous croissant to more elaborate culinary meals like ducks filet candied in cider and served with a side of grated potatoes. As we roam around the city, I eat a number of meals at these cafes. A staple food on the menu is the croquet-monsieur, a deliciously oozy and crisp grilled ham and cheese sandwich splashed with just a touch of Bchamel sauce. If you are an egg-lover, get the croque-madame, which adds a fried egg on top. Or there is the Jambon beurre, which is a fresh half-baguette, lavishly smeared with cool butter and garnished with jambon de Paris, a pink-hued cooked ham, served with optional cornichons or pickled cucumbers.As we settle down at a caf on a beautiful spot overlooking the Notre Dame and the River Seine near the Latin Quarter, I decide to show-off by ordering my meal in French. Je voudrai une glace deau avec une salade Caesar, I say primly in my best college-level French. After a moments hesitation, the hostess, a pretty French girl, says kindly, Madame, you just ordered an ice cream of water. I think you mean un verre deau. As the rest of the table collapses into titters, I say with as much dignity as I can muster, Oui oui, cest vrai glowering at my fluent Spanish-speaking boys.Another day, tired after fighting the hordes inside the massive Louvre and a bit miffed at Mona Lisas know-it-all smirk, we decide to re-energize at the nearby Caf Ruc on the Rue Rivoli. The H has ordered a layered fruit and veggie salad combined with a yogurt dressing and served beautifully in a jar. The older son is savouring his Blanc de Volaille Provenale (or chicken breast marinated in a thick sauce of tomatoes, garlic and olive oil) served on a bed of fresh tagliatelle pasta and the Foodie is about to launch into an artfully constructed club sandwich with homemade frites or fries. As for me, I sip on my glass of Merlot and do what Parisians do best on a lovely summers day: unabashedly eavesdrop on conversations around the cafe, while watching the world go by!"

As I look around the room, I notice that even the most well-heeled customers are uncomplainingly and happily rolling up the bread, scooping the stew or vegetables and paying tribute to the chef by a single-minded focus on the delicious meal in front of them.I am at an Ethiopian restaurant Zeni in San Francisco with my sister, her husband and my younger son, The Foodie. We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."
5904751e7be9e04154df7311,The culture of continental breakfast in Delhi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/priyali-prakash-blog/the-culture-of-continental-breakfast-in-delhi/,2016-06-06,,The Times Of India,"Lets face the truth  majority of Delhiites are not known to be early-risers, especially during the weekends. However, the concept of meeting friends over breakfast instead of evening coffee or a round of drinks or late dinners is fast-catching up.While a place like the All American Diner is a front-runner when it comes to breaking fast early in the morning, a lot of new places, like the quaint little Tonnino or the student-friendly Big Yellow Door are coming up with quirky ways to attract customers and are quite successful too. And now, we have a new player in the fray in the form of our good ol Hard Rock Cafe.While the idea of a place, dedicated to jamming to rock music on evenings, serving breakfast sounds a little queer, HRC has tried hard to break out of its stereotyped image to diversify into something as challenging as a breakfast buffet.The factor that sets HRC buffet apart from others is that this is not a regular feature for the cafe, and has been conceptualised to be a speciality for days that have international sporting events, the telecast time of which coincides with the local breakfast time.The inclusion of parathas as the only Indian option seems more like an attempt to fit into the breakfast for all bracket, particularly for the Indian crowd, when the chef claims to have hand-picked an otherwise continental array of choices.Chef Brijesh tells us that the menu, which mostly comprises continental items, was designed keeping in mind the kind of crowd HRC generally attracts based on its brand value.The eggs-on-order live station was perhaps the best part of the HRC breakfast buffet. A choice of omelettes, fried eggs, scrambled eggs and akuri cooked to perfection, with add-on vegetables including onions and tomatoes as well as bacon, is just what was needed to lift up the spirits of this buffet.Coming to the continental choices too, the menu is pretty plain and simple. Bacon and sausages, baked beans, pancakes with maple syrup and honey and hash browns, along with choices of cereals, breads and fruits are the regulars on most breakfast buffets these days.While bacon and sausages were processed foods and tasted like they would at any regular eatery, pancakes were made in-house. The bite-sized pancakes were airy but dry and a tad bit too salty.Sauted vegetables were a good option for the vegetarians. A mix of bell peppers and broccoli tossed in olive oil and flavoured with oregano and a hint of basil was refreshing.Talking of refreshing, while the assorted fruits included beautifully cut water melons, musk melons and papayas, canned juices were a bit of a let-down since one would generally expect a breakfast buffet to be serving fresh juices.All in all, the breakfast buffet at HRC for Rs 899(AI) seems like a good deal but one would generally picture himself or herself having breakfast in a more naturally well-lit setting that is synonymous with the freshness and spirit of mornings rather than the dimly-lit Hard Rock Cafe that plays loud music and has an ever-persistent alcohol-infused air."
590494677be9e04154df8c94,The babble about bagels,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/the-babble-about-bagels/,2016-06-17,,The Times Of India,"Whats round, has a hole, is packed full of carbs and can be had at any time of the day or night? If you answered a donut, you just landed yourself a lemon!The answer is the Bagel, that chewy crusty bread, with dollops of cream cheese inside, making it a carb-laden delicious mouthful in every bite. Both the donut and the bagel are best-selling comfort foods but while the sweet donut is essentially a breakfast item, its savory cousin bagel is an all-day comfort food, especially if there are plenty of great toppings to go along with the soft and doughy inside.So now I am back in New York where the locals pride on two things: their pizza and their bagels. So familiar is this food to New Yorkers that a number of episodes of the popular series Suits revolve around conversations that the two protagonists Harvey Specter and Michael Ross have around bagel carts.What is this wonder bread anyway? According to popular belief, bagels date back to 1783, when they were created to honor King John III Sobieski of Poland, after he protected Austrias people from an attack by Turkish invaders. As the story goes, an Austrian baker created the bagel in the shape of a stirrup to honor the horseman king, and named it a beugel (the Austrian word for stirrup). The beugel quickly gained popularity throughout Eastern Europe, and, over time, the bagel evolved into a circular shape with a hole in the middle. The round bread first came to the US with immigrants through the portals of Ellis Island in the late 1800s. And even now, most of the popular bagel shops are on the Lower East Side where the early immigrants made their tenement homes.My New York morning usually starts with an early morning sprint to my favorite bagel shop to catch the first batch of freshly baked bagels. Baked did I say? Wrong! Because the bagel is the only bread that is boiled before baking it. Once the bagel dough is shaped into a circle, it is dipped in boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. After that, the bread is drained and baked for about 10 minutes. And that hole in the center is not just for looks! The bagel hole comes in handy to thread multiple bagels onto a dowel, making it very convenient for street vendors transporting and selling the doughy delights.Over the years the bagel has moved from its humble plain doughy self to the most designer bagels that the mind can possibly conceive. So there are the onion, garlic, rye , poppy seed bagels which are jostling for space in bagel shops with their more exotic versions ranging from cinnamon raisin bagel to the pumpernickel to the sun-dried tomato bagel. For those with more adventurous palates there are flavors like blueberry and the French Toast. I have tried these flavors and sworn never to go near these wannabes again. Some mash-ups are fun like the pumpernickel or the sesame bagel. But while French toasts are yum and bagels are awesome, marrying those two together is like The Odd Couple!New York is famous for its bagels, but there is something about the way they are served that annoys many New Yorkers. Bagel shops in the city often slather enormous amount of cream cheese on each bagel they serve, making it a royal gooey mess to eat. Most bagel lovers, including me, find that amount of cream cheese overwhelming and feel that it detracts from the taste of the bagel itself. So my first instinct when I buy my bagel: scrape off that excess.The traditionally accepted amount of cream cheese that is appropriate for a bagel is a schmear. That is a relatively small amount that is just enough to enhance the flavor and texture of a bagel. The cream cheese is meant to complement the taste of the bagel, not to overpower it. Like bagel, cream cheese has matured over the years to complement the bread. So even the most ordinary bagel shop will boast a plethora of cream cheese offerings from the plain-Jane Philadelphia cream cheese to more exotic ones like jalapeno asado, tofu cream cheese, horseradish and pickle, and all the combinations in between.So here I am on my first day in New York, sprinting down to my favorite bagel shop only to discover dozens of patrons already in line ahead of me. I am accompanied by my older son, The Health Nut, who is a big advocate of Bagel-on-the-go, the New Yorkers attempt to assuage a guilty conscience at eating so many carbs at breakfast. It is essentially a plain bagel with bacon, eggs and your choice of cream cheese. When its my turn, I ask for a sesame seed bagel with wasabi cream cheese on the side.As my son and I stroll back to our apartment clutching our prizes, I wonder how long before I am asking for a garlic naan bagel with tandoori masala cream cheese!"
590494a57be9e04154df8ceb,Why are Bengalis so crazy about the Durga puja?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-n-style/why-are-bengalis-so-crazy-about-the-durga-puja/,2016-10-03,,The Times Of India,"A north Indian friend asked me recently,  why are all Bongs so crazy about Durga Puja? Yes its so obvious that Bongs are crazy about Durga Puja. As a Bengali I can say Durga Puja is just awesome. So there are ample reasons to be crazy about it.It isnt just an event that brings the city of Kolkata to a halt. Durga Puja is a festival that brings people together all across India. The fun, food and the fervour that Durga Puja brings is something that cant be replicated. The entire city turns into a beautiful dreamland of joy and togetherness.Its no secret that Bengalis are foodies. And Durga Puja is a prime example. While other people celebrate Navratra by fasting every day, Bengalis totally have the time of their lives, eating fish fries, mutton rolls and mughlai paratha. And also fish curry is a must. Fasting is restricted to daytime, till pushpanjali. Our Gods are pretty adjusting about this stuff.Food stalls at literally every corner serving a variety of mouthwatering dishes right from cutlet to rosogolla and people gorging on them like theres no tomorrow.Perhaps one of the best thing about Durga Puja is the bhog that is being served. It usually consists of khichudi, alur dom, papad, tomato chutney and rosogolla.Then comes dhaak and dhunuchi dance. This is just not a ritual dance, it is more of a merriment. As a part of everyday aarti, men and women with dhaaks create an ambience of celebration and sheer happiness. Adults and kids alike can be seen dancing with the perfect rhythm and enthusiasm which is almost infectious.Undoubtedly the most emotional moment for all in Durga Puja is bhasan or immersion when every Bong bid adieu to maa Durga and chant asche bochor abar hobe, which means ma Durga will visit us next year as well. Dashami or the tenth day is marked with a ceremony known as shidur khela (playing with sindur) where married women apply vermilion to each others faces as also to Goddess Durga dressed in the traditional Bengali attire.Last but not the least, immersion or bisarjan at the end of the Durga Puja festival is like parting with a member of the family after five days of praying, feasting and merry-making. Actually, Durga puja isnt just about taking part in the rituals, but more about feeling the pulse of the celebration."
590495167be9e04154df8d94,Food prices will keep interest rates sticky,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/food-prices-will-keep-interest-rates-sticky/,2016-06-17,,The Times Of India,"The recent increase in the prices of basic food items such as tomato and pulses will influence the interest rates of banks. Banks are now unlikely to lower interest rates on their loans in a meaningful way. And this will happen regardless of what Reserve Bank of India might want.Since February, food inflation has been increasing which, in turn, has pushed up the overall level of inflation.Food inflation in terms of retail prices, or CPI, was 5.4% in February. By end May, it had increased to 7.5%. Consequently, the overall level of inflation increased from 4.9% to 6.1%.During this period, RBI has taken steps to lower the interest rates banks charge on loans. RBI has tried to achieve it through a combination of a cut in rates and liquidity measures, or by making more money available to banks. Even now, RBIs policy is in an accommodative phase.However, accommodation may not help banks beyond a point. They rely mainly on deposits to raise money for onward lending. This means that the key to reducing interest rate on loans is to first bring down the deposit rates.In an interview to Mint, State Bank of Indias Chief Arundhati Bhattacharya explained this point.On bank lending rates, there are 3-4 reasons why there is a problem. In India, 97% of the sourcing is from deposits. So, when a repo rate (rate at which RBI lends money to banks) change happens, only 3% is impacted by the cost of funds reduction.As long as deposit holders feel the rate at which prices of everyday consumption items such as food is rising fast, they are unlikely to settle for lower deposit rates. Over the last year, banks have been able to lower deposit rates faster than lending rates. Interest rates offered by banks on fixed deposits of more than one year duration has been brought down by one percentage point, while the base rate for loans has come down by less than half the amount.Therefore, given the extent of decrease in deposit rates over the last year, banks might not find too many takers if they try to reduce deposit rates in the present environment.You cannot take bank interest rates very sharply down, you will lose your deposit franchise, said Bhattacharya.Had banks been profitable, they may have been in a position to push down lending rates. But the large extent of bad loans on their books rules out the possibility.We are in for a spell of sticky interest rates."

Those words, however, were uttered in Jaipur and not in Delhi.Speaking to NRIs during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Jaipur on January 8, 2012, the then PM was talking about global recession and how India managed to steer through it. He was trying to reassure the NRIs (potential investors) that India was facing difficult times but its economic fundamentals were strong and constitutional institutions were robust.From global issues he moved on to domestic ones and spoke about soaring inflation that had dampened the image of his government. Speaking all through in English, he said, Latest data shows food inflation turned negative for the first time in six years fuelling expectations that it would help in moderating overall inflation which currently stands over 9%.To further emphasize his point, Manmohan Singh enthusiastically uttered those golden words, Ab acche din aaney waley hain. While saying so, little did he know that Gujarat CM Narendra Modi would pick his words and turn the tables on him the next day.On January 9, Modi addressed the NRIs that included steel tycoon LN Mittal. The hall was overcrowded and security forces had to forcefully close the gates. Modi in his usual style started off with unverified examples on how he made Gujarat a template of success. Pointing to Mittal, loquacious Modi even went on to mention that tomatoes and ladyfinger that he eats in London were produced in Gujarat.Intention of Modi, however, was not solely to impress the global Indians. With general elections that were scheduled in April 2014, he wanted to box the UPA-II government at every possible platform.Speaking of the then upcoming Lok Sabha polls, Modi said Yesterday our PM told you that acche din anney waley hain and then took a pause. With making perfect pitch he dropped his googly and with trademark smirk he added, haan mein bhi kehta hoon ki ab jald hi acche din anney waley hain.Amid feverish chanting of Modi Modi, the then Gujarat CM had made a remark which Gadkari now feels has stuck in BJPs throat.That very moment Modi must have realized that he has got one of the election punchlines that captures the mood of the nation. Clinging on it and presenting it as his own, Modi revolved his speeches with promises on bringing acche din. Gadkari only showed the reality when he said acche din kabhi nahi attey."
59049f1f7be9e04154df96ec,"Umrikan vs Angrezi: Why Donald Trump has trouble understanding us, and vice versa",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/umrikan-vs-angrezi-why-donald-trump-has-trouble-understanding-us-and-vice-versa/,2016-05-06,,The Times Of India,"Referring to Indian call centres which respond to queries from customers in the US, Americas would-be president Donald Trump has said that he has trouble understanding Indians when they speak. This is understandable.Because we Indians, call centre workers or others, speak English, or Angrezi. Whereas Donald, like his fellow citizens, speaks Americanese, or Umrikan, as we call it. It is this language barrier which makes it difficult for Americans to understand us, and for us to understand them.So when Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to the US next month  his fourth visit since assuming office  hed do well to take a refresher course in Umrikan boli.For instance, when he meets someone who says Howdy to him, he should not address that person as Howdyji, assuming that to be his  or her  name. In Umrikan, Howdy is not a persons name, but a greeting, like our Namaste, and is an abbreviated version of the Angrezi How do you do?Similarly, the phrase So long expressed by someone taking your leave is not an enquiry of measurement as to the length of an unspecified object  nor even the breadth measurement of anything, including a 56-inch chest  but the Umrikan equivalent of Bye, bye.On being offered a termayter sandwich, the PM should not suspect that he is being induced to eat some taboo non-veggie substance, possibly the flesh of gau mata, but is being asked to tuck into an innocuous preparation involving the use of a harmless vegetable which in Angrezi is called tomato (toe-mah-toe) and in Umrikan is called termayter (ter-may-ter).On being asked if he wishes to use the rest room, the PM shouldnt reply that he isnt tired and doesnt need to take a nap right now, and in any case hasnt brought his night suit with him. In Umrikan, a rest room is not a place where people go to catch forty winks but where they go to perform what we call our ablutions, ab-loo-shuns, from which we get the Angrezi word loo.And if Donald does become US prez and visits India in his official capacity he needs to mug up only one sentence to make him understood by one and all here, his Umrikan pronunciation notwithstanding: Barrat matter key jay!"
5904b4b17be9e04154dfac45,Who will bell the cat – aka the rich farmer?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/law-street/who-will-bell-the-cat-aka-the-rich-farmer/,2016-04-05,,The Times Of India,"Rich shareholders in India (individuals, firms or Hindu undivided families) earning a dividend income of more than Rs. 10 lakh in a year, will on passing of the Finance Bill, 2016 be paying a flat rate of income-tax of 10%. Contrast this with agricultural income, which even if it is a crore or more, remains exempt from income-tax in the hands of the farmer.Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, recently announced in the Parliament that a probe was on by tax sleuths of some prominent people who were evading taxes in the garb of agricultural income.However, he hastened to add that there is no proposal or move to tax farmers (in other words, genuine agricultural income, no matter what the quantum of earnings in an individuals hands would not be taxed).During the three year period beginning April 1, 2010 itself, there were more than a thousand cases where agricultural income of Rs. one crore or more had been declared.India is predominantly an agrarian economy, producing more than 250 million tonnes of food grain annually. Nearly 60% of the rural population depends on agriculture as its primary source of income. As per estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the share of agriculture and allied sectors (including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishery) was 16.1 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 201415 at 201112 prices.While majority of the farmers belong to the small and marginal holding categories, characterised by household labour, production chiefly for consumption and low productivity, there are others who are earning more than the income-tax exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh. While the FM took courage to tax dividend income in hands of rich shareholders, there is a hesitation to tax agricultural income in the hands of rich farmers, as his statement in the Parliament proves.Decades ago the argument for not taxing farm income was that the terms of trade were biased against the farm sector as food-grain prices were kept dismally low. Today, farming is also undergoing a gradual change. At one end of the spectrum are those small farmers who have been badly hit by drought and are reeling under debt. On the other hand, contract farming, where the farmer cultivates a certain crop (say tomatoes for a ketchup manufacturing company) for a pre-determined price with technical inputs and equipment duly provided by the company is no longer a rare instance. Corporate farming also exists, where the land is owned by a company and leased out for farming.Invariably, when income-tax collections fall short, the powers that be toot the horn: our tax collection ratio to GDP is dismal. Direct taxes (both corporate and individual tax) during financial year 2013-14 represented just 5.6% of the GDP. Come March, instructions are invariably issued to tax authorities to pull up their socks, the end result  refunds are withheld or tax demands hurriedly issued. This year has been no different.Such tax harassment (one may not want to use the stronger word  tax terrorism) continues, despite various remedial measures taken by the government, such as setting up grievance committees, which can be approached by taxpayers in case of high-pitched demands. Or reforming the basis of performance appraisal for tax officials, which will no longer be based on revenue collection targets.Statistics, as per a report tabled by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) show that the number of non-corporate taxpayers is on the decline, decreasing to 3.04 crore in financial year (FY) 2013-14, a drop of 17.4% from the previous year. At the same time, income tax collections from non-corporate tax payers has increased from Rs. 1.97 lakh crore in FY 2012-13 to Rs. 2.38 crore in FY 2013-14. As tax rates have only been tinkered with, one can say that it is the existing taxpayers who are paying more. There is no widening of the tax base in terms of the number of taxpayers.Realizing that the political powers would never bite the bullet and impose a tax on farm incomes, the Raja J Chelliah headed committee, in 1992-93 had suggested that the agricultural incomes of non-agriculturists if it was more than Rs 25,000 per annum should be taxed in aggregate.As under the Indian Constitution, agricultural income cannot be taxed by the Central government, but only by the States, the former should obtain the consent of States to enact a suitable enabling provision. The entire tax attributable to the agricultural component of income, should be distributed to the States on the basis of origin.More recently, Tax Administration Reforms Commission, led by Dr Shome has said: Large farmers should be brought into the tax net. Against a tax free limit of Rs.5 lakhs on agricultural income, farmers having income above much higher threshold income, such as Rs 50 lakh, could be taxed. This will broaden the taxpayer base.Even a large number of rich farmers, who earn more than salaried employees in the cities, get away with paying no tax at all in view of the governments lack of will to consider an agricultural income tax. Agricultural income of non-agriculturists is being increasingly used as a conduit to avoid tax and for laundering funds, resulting in leakage to the tune of crores in revenues annually, the report had added.TARCs committee had also pointed out that an across the board political consensus needs to develop, and be followed by appropriate amendments, laws and collection procedures to ensure effective implementation of such an important change. But it will certainly bring about a much improved tax culture and performance.There seems to be a valid case for taxing rich farmers. These should pay taxes the same way as any salaried employee or business man does. But will any government bell the cat (aka the rich farmers)."

The idea of Chef Couture, a food promo where the plate played the runway for some seriously glamorous Italian haute cuisine, inspired by fashion trends globally including Milan, got going.The opening sequence choreographed by Chef Rahul on my tasting menu lunch was Suede, wild quinoa & barley with asparagus cream, and it could easily pass off as a light and not too sweet salad or dessert, depending on how you would look at it, delightfully fresh and smooth as its name. Quinoa is one of the highest sources of protein, and many of the models follow the high protein-low carbs funda, and quinoa is quite the rage globally, says Rahul. Fuschia pink is apparently back on the runway so we have a pumpking soup with parmesan foam named after it.Next up was Chic, (slow cooked chicken with barley & Parmesan crisps), which was again a work of artful glamour. The sequences Pallazo (Pecorino ravioli with fennel cream) and Offshoulder (lemon fettucini with pepper butter emulsion and chevre) were good enough, but the showstoppers were the main course and dessert.Cowl (seafood risotto in a beautiful tomato-roasted bell pepper sauce was the best of the meal and Boho Chic (vanilla mousse with blue berry cream centre, with the meringues on top crafted to resemble the retro hairstyle bouffant, were couture cuisine at their best.Some more names on the menu?

In this instance, a precise holographic replica of the Martian landscape was projected on stage from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover. The scientist was in three places at once: On Mars and on stage in virtual form, in a room across the street in reality.Put it another way: When mankind steps on Mars, you almost certainly could be walking lockstep with the astronaut  and experiencing everything he is on the Martian surface, while sitting in your living room  in ways that were unimaginable during the Moon landing. You could travel to the Pyramids of Egypt or Niagara Falls or Taj Mahal without leaving your digs.The technologies will not just help explore and learn, but also help conquer fear and phobia, address hunger and disease. From growing body parts in a petri dish to 3D printing to discerning hereditary illnesses through genomes, humankinds advances are becoming more creative than those the industrial revolution engendered.Of what use is all this in a country that is in the throes of unrest and poverty you might ask. The same questions were asked of computers and smartphones, advances now being used by the poorest in India. The touchscreen, so ubiquitous now, was first rolled out at TED nearly a decade ago. In the same way i yearned to teleport myself to Abu Dhabi to pacify my children, imagine the overworked Uber driver in India  who said he had to tear himself away from his wailing daughter each morning to work the 7am to midnight shift to earn the Rs 50,000 he needs to put her through college  being able to do the same.These are not terribly expensive technologies, and where they are, they will, like computers and smartphones, soon arrive at a sweet spot where much of the world can afford them. Already, some basic drones now cost as little as $20 apiece. In that sense, the Rs 251 smartphone that is ringing (alarm) bells in India is not all that inconceivable. The pricing is only ahead of its time.But what these technologies will do is disrupt and sometimes destroy some aspects of growth while galvanising others. Watching a swarm of programmed drones (some of which are already delivering parcels) put together a brick wall, one cant help fear for the fate of jobs in construction, in manufacturing, in agriculture. In fact, self-driven cars, for which the US government only last month began drawing up a regulatory framework, will destroy the livelihood of millions of young men who have begun driving app-driven cabs in the shared economy space, the same way they disrupted yellow cabs and taxis.Indias go-to mantra for growth and job creation is its Make in India campaign, based on its so-called youth bulge and demographic dividend. But what if manufacturing is largely over-run by ever-cheaper drones, robots and automatons? After a brief glimpse of the future last month, the Indian formula is not something i would want to bet on even though the future is electrifying. There has to be a life beyond mere manufacturing. Just Make in India wont cut it; it needs fine-tuning. Create in India might be a better mantra."

Working as executive chef at Park Hyatt, Chennai, Greg (call me Greg, he offered after seeing me struggle with his name) oversees the kitchens of the all-day dining, The Dining Room and the iconic specialty restaurant, The Flying Elephant built over five levels. He considers Mediterranean and Thai cuisine as his forte, as well as his favourites.For Saulo Bacchilega, executive chef of Park Hyatt Goa Resort and Spa, Italian food is home turf and also his best-honed cuisine, (in his near-three-decades old career), despite his expertise at Asian cuisine and his overseeing operations at their in-house epic Goan restaurant Casa Sarita. Saulo, with a quirky sense of humour and multi lingual skills (English, French, Spanish and Italian, of course) just feels Italian food is simplest to make and good to eat!For Lars Windfuhr, executive chef Park Hyatt Hyderabad and German by birth, it is food cooked with freshest seasonal produce which matters. While Continental cuisine would be his most specialized skill, Murgh Makhni, as he would prefer calling Butter chicken, is his all time favourite carry away memory from India. Lars also confesses his wife and daughter love to snack on the ubiquitous Chindian Veg Manchurian.Three chefs from three different countries ruling the kitchens of different corners of India. Now if that isnt true blue globalization of the F&B industry!As part of the first season of Park Hyatts Chefs on Tour (under the umbrella of their Masters of Food & Wine initiative), a chefs table was set up recently at Tre-Forni, the in-house Italian specialty restaurant of Park Hyatt Hyderabad, which also saw the chefs in animated conversation on a range of food-related topics, with a select few bloggers and journalists.While we were looking forward to Chefs Greg and Saulo dishing out their signature stuff, their flight schedules put those plans to rest, and we settled down to a fabulous, nonetheless Italian meal. On the menu was Asparagus Tart, Seared Scallops & Prawns (with mashed apple, rucola pesto, sundried cherry tomato), Ravioli (provolone cheese and porcini sauce), Herb Crusted Lamb rack with rosemary roasted potatoes (magnifique!) , a delightful green apple sorbet as well as a perfectly bitter-sweet tiramisu.The chefs on tour included a cooking class showcasing Park Hyatt classics and unique home-grown recipes like Chef Gregs Polish Pierogi, dumplings served with mushrooms and sauerkraut.In the end, it was a chefs table which had a lot of takeaways, especially in terms of perspectives on global food trends and what good chefs want."

It later became the cornerstone of welfare policies in Tamil Nadu. For politicians it was a shrewd populist move by MGR to retain his vote bank; for nutritionists it ensured at least a third of the required nutrition for children; for educationists it was a strategy to increase enrolment in school; for some economists it was a waste of public money; and for teachers it was an added administrative burden. But for MGR it was a moment of satisfaction for having ensured the feeding of hungry children.This scheme is the outcome of my experience of extreme starvation at an age when I knew only to cry when I was hungry . But for the munificence of a woman next door who extended a bowl of rice gruel to us and saved us from the cruel hand of death, we would have departed this world long ago. Such merciful women folk, having great faith in me, elected me as chief minister of Tamil Nadu To picture lakhs and lakhs of poor children who gather to take up nutritious meals in thousands of hamlets and villages all over TN and blessing us in their childish prattle, will be a glorious event, said MGR about the noon meal scheme.Providing noon meal in schools was not new to Tamil Nadu as it had existed in various forms since the early 1900s. The sporadic events of providing noon meal in schools were outcomes of the philanthropic efforts of a few. But it was left to K Kamaraj to conceive it as a public policy so that government could provide it.Yet due to the lack of adequate finances and weak administrative machinery , the scheme was implemented only in rural primary schools and was dependent on contributions from local governments. In 1982 the allocation towards the noon meal scheme was less than 6 crore.The emotion of MGR behind the initiation of the scheme was truly captured in terms of its mammoth size and his determination to implement it against all odds. The total outlay for this scheme in 1982 was 120 crore that was later revised to 140 crore in late 1982 and 220 crore in 1983. Increasing the outlay by 20 times in a year shows the importance it received in the state. The scheme initially benefited 5.6 million children in rural schools in the age group of 5 to 10 years and within two months it was extended to children in urban areas, increasing the number of beneficiaries to 6.5 million. In addition, the balwadis (child care centres) were roped in to provide meals for children in the age group of 2 to 5 years. Subsequently, the elderly, widows and destitutes were also covered by this programme. Nearly 56,000 noon meal kitchens were opened, of which 35,000 were in schools. The average cost of a meal for children was 45 paisa and for adults, 90 paisa.To ensure its smooth implementation, the scheme was reviewed every month at the secretariat during the initial days by a committee headed by the CM and senior ministers, officials and important political leaders.Though the opposition described the expenditure a waste and a political stunt, MGR was aware that those who criticised the scheme would be shunned by the people. Journalist Ragavendra Rao, while recalling his experience during a field survey , had said that even a few pieces of carrot and tomato in the sambhar rice was a delicacy in the interiors of the districts of TN. This showed there were many hungry MGRs in the state, who were a meal or two away from death at that time."
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,,The Times Of India,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."
5904ea987be9e04154dfdb02,What the ponkh?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/what-the-phonk/,2016-02-15,,The Times Of India,"It is a lazy winter morning in Mumbai and finally for what it is worth, there is a nip in the air and the urge to have frequent cups of garam-garam chai. I am sitting all toasty and warm in my favorite recliner when the doorbell rings and a friend sashays in, radiating bonhomie and good cheer. I have just come from Surat and look what I have for you, she exults. Diamonds? I breathe hopefully. No silly, she giggles, waving a bejeweled hand towards a box she is carrying. Its ponkh!Ponkh? I squeak.Spoiler alert: for those of you who are hardcore carnivores, there is no meat in this story!What she has got back from her recent soujourn to Surat is a Gujarati delicacy called ponkh which is the local name given to tender jowar seeds or white millets. During a brief period in the winter months, the jowar grain is juicy and very tender and the seeds are just right to be harvested and eaten roasted. It is generally picked from fields and cooked there and then, with parties thrown to celebrate this young edible seed.My friends box reveals a bunch of packets neatly packed together: the green jowar seeds, three types of sev (fried gram flour noodles) and tiny sugar granules also known as sakkar-danna. The three sevs spread out in front of me are variously colored: a yellow one which is mildly spicy, a tomato-flavored red one, and the brown one which is hot and spicy and enticingly called limbu-mari (lime and pepper). The three flavors of the sev and their sharpness offset the slightly bland and sweetish taste of the ponkh. And I guess the sakkar-danas are provided to counteract the smoke-in -the-ears spiciness of the limbu-mari. Ponkh is sometimes eaten raw and sometimes slightly roasted and Gujaratis often wash it down with glasses of chhaas or lassi. My friend informs me that die-hard lovers of this delicacy even attend ponkh picnics in Surat.In Maharashtra, ponkh is known as hurda. As a child, I remember my mother talking about the hurda parties she used to attend on her visits to her hometown of Amalner, Maharashtra. During the season, the local farmers would throw a party in the middle of the fields where the young tender jowar was being roasted and eaten directly when it was still hot and tender. To accompany the hurda, the farmers wives would provide jaggery (gud), shengdana-lassun chutney (groundnut-garlic chutney), dry khobra chutney (dry coconut chutney), wangya chi bhaji (a brinjal preparation)and taak (butter milk).So now I am sitting with this big fat packet of ponkh and after diligently mixing the three sevs and a bit of the sugar granules with the green seeds, I carefully plate it on a salad dish and serve it to the family. Unfortunately, it does not set anyone on fire. The husband grimaces, the foodie wrinkles his nose and I stoically plod through the helping I have served myself. The next day, I decide to spice up the ponkh by serving it as a bhel. I add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, rock salt, a dash of chaat masala, and a few drops of lemon juice. On top, I add the rainbow colored sev, and serve it in the evening as an appetizer before dinner. The foodie son looks at it and exclaims, That thing again!My cook, the Garwahli genius, comes in from the kitchen to see what the fuss is all about. He takes a look at the ponkh offering, tastes it and then saunters off to the kitchen with something suspiciously sounding like Not on my table wafting on the breeze. With sarson ka saag and makke di roti on the menu, the poor ponkh is not getting its day under the sun in our house.Desperate to finish the huge mound of ponkh sitting forlornly in my kitchen, I call a few Gujarati friends and ask if they would want ponkh. Chokkas! Tarat mukaljo! (Of course, send at once) is the ardent response. And now, just as I am sitting back with a contented sigh that the ponkh has finally gone to places where it is being appreciated, my friend calls and asks how I liked the ponkh. Loved it, I squawk and cross my fingers for lying. Great, she chirps happily. Next year I will send you three kilos, and hangs up."
5904f8b27be9e04154dfe8d1,Bread-Poha or things like that,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sweet-n-sour/bread-poha-or-things-like-that/,2016-02-05,,The Times Of India,"Youve had a heavy lunch or a late one and if youre fitness (or thinness) freak you might forego dinner but if youre like me, who need their three-squares (and some intermediates), bread-poha is our salvation. Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

Among Jains scroll of breakthrough technologies, laid out in hundreds of papers and thousands of citations, are his developing the delivery of molecular and nano-medicine to solid tumors in ways that have fundamentally changed the thinking of scientists and clinicians about drug release.Jain is among nearly a dozen highminded brainiacs from India, now settled in America, who have been recognised by successive White House administrations over the past decade for revolutionary scientific and technical advances. Among previous National Medal winners of Indian-origin are Rangaswamy Srinivasan, whose work in ablative photodecomposition led to the development of Lasik eye surgery; Praveen Chaudhari, whose work in materials science resulted in developing the optical disk industry; and B Jayant Baliga, whose invention of the insulated gate bipolar transistor forms the basis of the smart energy grid.The work of each of them has resulted in development of industries worth billions and even trillions of dollars across the world, starting in the United States. It has kept the US well ahead in the technology sweepstakes, where occasionally there are pretender countries purportedly snapping at American heels. In this season of automotive agony one recalls that the late Haren Gandhi of Ford, the first Indian-American to win the National Medal in 2003, was recognised for his work in automotive catalysts and emissions control  long before it became such a hot button issue.Why is it that these scientists and technologists, all of whom finished their schooling and early college in India, made their breakthroughs in the United States and not in their country of origin? The short answer is that they have all migrated to the US. But why arent their contemporaries and peers in India or China making similar breakthroughs?What path breaking technologies or universally acclaimed products have China and India produced in recent decades? How does the US remain the birthplace of Apple, Google, Tesla and other cutting edge companies, while China and India only provide the grunt work and back offices for America to rake in the lolly?To understand this, lets rewind to socialist India of the 1960s and 1970s. Remember the big transistor radio that was the centrepiece of the living room, whose knobs father would not even allow you to touch, forget about letting you open the back and dismantle the whole contraption? Remember the fountain pen that you were not allowed to use, let alone taking it apart? Or the few other dont-touch-it devices that were wheeled out only for special occasions?Indigent, insular and insecure, we lived in an experimentally arid India, bereft of the spirit of academic adventure.Compounding this fear of exploration caused by our penurious existence was the stigma of failure, painfully brought home even now by the epidemic of student suicides under academic pressure  30 last year alone in the coaching crucible of Kota, Rajasthan, but thousands across the country year after year. All this was underscored by a system that prized mental calisthenics over physical labour or manual skills which, by Brahminical injunctions, were better left to lesser people or lower castes. High-minded Indians didnt get their hands dirty.The result is an annual assembly line of academic automatons, particularly in engineering. According to a recent report, 80% of Indias engineering graduates are unemployable.Yet when the same Indians come to the US and go through the American ecosystem, it is as if they have been let loose in a vast amusement park of discovery and exploration. Freed from the rigours of rote learning that constitute the rite of passage in India, they produce a staggering output of inventions and innovations.Consider this: In the list of some 200 Fellows for 2015 named by the US National Academy of Inventors there are at least 20 of Indian origin, a strike rate of 10% for an ethnic group which constitutes less than 1% of the national population. Last week, 13 of the 40 finalists at the Intel Science Talent were Indian-American kids.How to fire up this spirit of innovation and invention in India, beyond invoking dubious ancient glories? Three things are central to American dominance in this sphere: an ecosystem that encourages risk-taking, a market that provides capital and funding, and a social ethos that does not stigmatise failure.Recent initiatives promise to address the first two, but the third is a societal slur that no government can fix. America is a country of second chances, even third and fourth chances. India: no chance.The repair work then has to begin in the schools. Mere slogans or late-stage government intervention will not result in Make in India and Start Up India. Despite knowing where the problem lies through many reports and recommendations, India is yet to free itself from the stranglehold of textbook mastery, in an education system that remains depressingly moribund.The day you visit a school and find children hunched over devices and contraptions, equipment and appliances, rather than just textbooks and notebooks, is the day Make in India would have started up."
590592937be9e04154e0015c,Finding me,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/shweshwe/finding-me/,2016-01-18,,The Times Of India,"Just let go, and relax, my yoga teacher said soothingly, as we lie in Shav Asan in class this morning, having been given three minutes to cut off from the world. There is silence all around except for the occasional chirping of a bird or a distant car horn. As much as I try to focus on my breathing, my mind keeps going back to my busy schedule for the day. I open one eye and look at the girl lying next to me. She is snoring slightly. How can she do it? I shut my eyes tight, and try again. Do I over-think?I did not make a resolution this New Year. It is the first time in maybe fifteen years, that I did not say, This year I am going to lose weight! Though I could hear that line pop up at the back of my head all through New Years eve, I drowned it out with a few glasses of Mot! After all these years of following a somewhat repetitive routine the brain tells you what to do, even if you do not want it to. Its called muscle memory! So instead, I have made up my mind that this year, I am going to give myself ME. Find myself, the real and inner me. Pull myself out from the depths of a space where I have been comfortably hiding. Under layers of conditioning and practise. This is not a resolution as I tend to break those by the third week of January, which is about now! This a decision. Do I have the courage?Hmm So it must be around 9am already. I have to rush back home, as the hubby has an early meeting, and I need to be around while he leaves. Four egg whites with mushrooms, tomatoes and onions, very fluffy, no oil. The cook has been serving it to him for the past thirteen years! So what can go wrong with that if Im not around? Well invariably something does! I have to make sure that his shirt is pressed crisp with zero creases, and that he is wearing blue, his lucky colour, as he has an important buyer today! OhI almost forgot. I need to finalise with him the guest list for the dinner party we are having next week, as I have to send out a save the date today! I was supposed to ask him last night but then I didnt get the chance to as I had to accompany him for a business dinner, where I was busy entertaining three Chinese wifeys with stories on our Bollywood Badshah Shahrukh Khan! It always works! Do I try too hard to be the perfect-wifey?As I sit down with my chai, the staff will then attack me with the problems for the day! Bhabhi I have to go on leave today as my chachas son-in-law is going to the village, or bhabhi the washing machine has broken down, again! Each day there is a new issue, and it drives me up the wall! Also I have to give them instructions to start polishing the silveware for our party! It must sparkle like it is brand new. And tell them what to make as a snack when the kids get home from school. Mexican Tacos maybe? Do I sound like a typical bhabhiji?I must quickly escape to the salon to get my hair and nails done, as I have to go for a very social lunch! Now this is going to be an afternoon of complimenting on the face, talking behind each others back, and then discussing travel plans for the long Easter weekend. None of this really appeals to me, but not showing up is not really an option in this city! If you dont go once it is okay, maybe they will believe that you genuinely have the flu! But if you dont go twice, it is over! Your favourite aunt can be in the ICU, but you better not cancel twice! Its social murder or rather suicide. I mentally put together my outfit for this glamourous affair. Do I want to be part of this air-kissing society?Once Im done, I have to rush home cause the tween girl has her assessments going on! Anyone who has a child this age will agree with me that it is better to get home in time to hear their high-pitched complains on everything wrong that is happening in their lives! My best friend had a fight with me, she is so mean!, or then something else as earth shattering! This is always accompanied by water works, as in free flowing tears, and the mom you just dont get it dialogue! After the tweeny outburst we will have to study together for at least an hour! She must revise again. I mean whats wrong with trying to get perfect grades right? I must take the lil boy for his running practice as he has his school sports day in a couple of days. He is all excited but needs my constant cheering. It makes me go faster, he says, smiling! That reminds me that we have junior football league this Sunday, where full-on adrenalin and energy is required by us moms, to make sure their sons score! Im sure even Messi is not as driven to win, as our young boys are! Do I behave like an over-protective and pushy mom?Oh oh! I forgot to call my mother-in-law to check whether we are going to the Mata ki Chowki tomorrow? Being a non-Punju it is sometimes overwhelming the number of festivals and customs there are! All I know is that I attend them all, by putting on a blingy salwar-kameez, do parey paina'(touch feet and get blessings) to many Auntyjis, and eat yummy channa-kulcha and malai-phirni! Of course, vigorously moving to the beats of the dhol. I also better start my research on hotels and flights for our next family holiday. Golden Temple or Goa? Do I fit the part of a dutiful daughter-in-law?My legs are still killing me from my high impact Zumba class yesterday. I got a bit carried away and overdid the sexy hip rotations while squatting! I do try to keep myself in good shape, externally! Regular workouts, facials, tonnes of makeup, and not to forget carb-deprivation! Can you believe that I was actually dreaming of a divine molten chocolate fondant last night? But I cannot touch it until my cousins wedding next month. I have to wear a gorgeous sari, so I am working towards flat abs. Do I focus too much on my outward appearance?The soreness, coupled with the pain thanks to the stilettos I wore to the business dinner last night, are making me realize that my legs are not as young as they used to be! Im thinking of this, and cringing, because I have to get back on those damn heels tonight. We have to attend a friends 40th birthday dinner! Again, no excuses will work right. I mean its not like I dont want to go after all, its just a bunch of close buddies! A few beers down the hubbies will start to discuss the bad economy and who is surviving in these markets! We wifeys, taking big gulps of wine, will discuss our maids ( gods gift to womankind), or our kids achievements! My darling daughter came first in her elocution! Do I like hanging out with these friends?So it is going to be quite a hectic day, or rather week as usual! Am I complaining? Not really. But do you also sometimes feel that while you are struggling to juggle all your responsibilities, in the process, somewhere down the line, you lose yourself? Do we allow our inner self to take a backseat in our own life, while we go around making others happy, or perform our never ending duties? What about all the questions in my head? I realize now that they have one common simple answer, which is YES. These are all the roles I play, and I give it my best, every single moment. Also I actually enjoy this routine and value each bond I have. But am I putting in too much? Where is my own identity? Is this who I really am? No. I need to look deeper. And I know I will find myself.What is it that I want? For myself, and not anyone else! I have already made progress towards my decision for the year. I have found my voice, which comes straight from the heart and reaches you, through my writing. I will continue to discover who I am, and slowly rise to the surface. Hmm Suddenly I hear my yoga teachers voice,Open your eyes gently. I might not have been able to relax, as she asked us to, but at the end of the three minutes I have definitely decided to let go, so that I can find ME."

More than four million children have lost at least one parent in Congo over the past two decades. (AP Photo/Jerome Delay)More than 4 million children have lost at least one parent in Congo over the past two decades, the silent victims of continuous cycles of violence. And more than 26 million orphans live in West and Central Africa, where Congo is located  the second highest number in the world behind South Asia, according to the United Nations.Watch what else is in the newsThese children have grown up amid conflict fueled by ethnic strife and the fight over valuable minerals.The violence and displacement are eroding the tradition of families caring for their own. The breakdown in family means some orphans are forced to look after themselves and their younger siblings.Some are vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups. And many also face sexual exploitation, in a country where rape has become commonplace on the streets.They are the orphans with a story of violence since 1994  its a generation of victims that continues, says Francisca Ichimpaye, a senior monitor at the En Avant Les Enfants INUKA center. And the children lose their story in the violence.As Congo falls once again into violence in the face of a delayed election, here are profiles of some orphans in Goma.ALPHA MELEKI, 6Alpha Meleki was found in a pile of bodies after an attack by rebels on his village in Congos eastern Beni earlier this year. He had been shot and left for dead with his parents in the bush. The bullet wounds and the vine-like surgery scar on the 6-year-olds pudgy belly have only recently healed. He hobbles around, pulling his loose shorts up on his tiny body.The emotional scars are still fresh. When held by someone new, Alpha sits limply. His large eyes glaze over, and sometimes glare with angry distrust. He saves his smiles for those he trusts, often seeking the hands of adults he knows.He cannot stand to see others suffer. Whenever another child at the INUKA center needs medical attention, Alpha cries and screams. In a quiet moment, he touches a short, wide scar on his head. He lets others touch it.They hit me with a machete, he recalls. The center says it could take years to find any family members, as attacks persist in the northeast.JEANNETTE UMUTSI, 17At 17, Jeannette Umutsi has become the caregiver for her little brother, whom she hopes to protect from the horrors she has seen. At first she recounts her story stoically and with distance. She was born only a few years after Rwandas 1994 genocide spilled into Congo. Armed fighters stormed her home, hit her in the leg with a shovel and nearly killed her sister.She and her family fled her hometown of Kirolarwe in 2008 to escape the violence. In the next village, she hid in a toilet enclosure with wooden plank floors for three days to save herself from another attack. Alone, she would sneak out to grab tomatoes that grew nearby. For days, she heard gunshots and saw dead bodies, including that of her uncle. As she continues to talk of violence, she breaks down into tears and gasps.I have so many nightmares now. So many nightmares, she says. Her mother returned to save her. But she later died after giving birth to her brother Shukuru, now 5.Her father used to be a fighter, she says. Once, he threatened to kill her with a machete. As she talks about him, she folds over herself, head in her skirt, and the fear is palpable in her eyes.Finally she fled the family. She wrapped Shukuru up, put him on her back, and walked for days, struggling to breathe, on the way to Camp Mugunga in Goma. She is now an older sister to more than a dozen other children at the INUKA center, where she helps cook the fish and rice for lunch and rounds the kids up for naps.MOISE, 7, AND AGATA MUNOKA, 5Moise Munoka, 7, sits still, looks down and speaks in a near whisper when he recounts the loss of his mother.She died in 2013 after health complications from rapes left her quite sick. Rape is a constant in Congo, where it has become a weapon of war. At the Childrens Voice Virunga Centre in Goma, where Moise and his sister Agata gather during the day, at least 30 children were born of rape.Though Moise never knew his own father, he knows that he was probably a fighter who raped his mother. When asked if he wants to meet him one day, he scrunches his nose up and shakes his head in disgust, No! He is happy to have left his war torn village of Massissi.Its a bad place because theres war, trouble, people dont like each other, they like to kill, he says. Theres always dead people, and blood.He lights up as he explains that he and his sister are now being cared for by a widow, Arlette Kabuo Malimewa, 45. She has three children of her own and also cares for a third foster child. Agata sleeps in the living room, which has several posters of Jesus Christ lining the walls. Moise has his own room, where his two book bags hang from nails on the wooden planks.Malimewa sells bed covers in bright pinks and whites that hang over her black lava rock gate, and makes about $5 a week. I love them, but it is difficult, she says. I want to keep them until my death  because who would they go to?ANUARITA MAHORO, 12Anuarita Mahoro, 12, has been ostracized because she was born with a right hand problem that leaves her too weak to do hard labor. She lived with her father until he was asked to chop wood for armed men who then killed him in 2014. Her mother lived with the men of the forests, as she refers to the fighters. They eventually killed her mother, too, and left.Anuarita fled to her grandparents in Kiwanja. When her grandfather died, she was forced to leave her grandmother to find work to eat. Starving and sick, she was eventually taken in by a center for orphans. Here, her right hand tucked between her legs and leaning on her left elbow, she apologizes.I have suffered so much so I might sound confused, she says. She hopes to return to her village and reclaim her grandmothers land, showing those in the community her worth.After the death of my parents, the community discussed who would take this child. And no one was prepared to take me on as a parent. So since no one wanted me, when I grow up they better not come and ask me for any help, she said, grinning widely, and then covering her face and laughing.She would like one day to set up a center for orphans. And if she ever got the conversation she wants with the men who killed her parents, she solemnly reveals the one thought that wont leave her mind.I would ask why they killed my father and my mother and didnt kill me?DAMIEN MATATA BIZI, 22Damien Matata Bizi looks down, his shoulders heavy, when he hesitantly recounts his past as an orphan who became a child soldier.Many of the thousands of other former child soldiers in Congo over years made a similar choice, or had none at all. Rwandas 1994 genocide pushed fighters into Congo, and multiple rebel groups now fight over the mineral-rich region.Matata Bizi became a rebel after his father, also an armed fighter, died. He was only 10 years old.I was angry when I learned of my fathers death. So I wanted to avenge my father, so I entered into the rebellion to fight, he said. My mother could never pay for school, and we could never find money to pay for food so I thought this was best. Matata Bizi says he was treated well, but others werent.The life that vulnerable children have is hard, he says. They dont have education, they dont have clothes, so it may be better to be in an armed group with the ability to find food and clothes than to be at a loss.When asked about having to kill people, his eyes narrow and he impatiently takes a deep breath, visibly angry.Theres a difference between the militants and child soldiers, he says. The adults have the occasion to reflect on what theyve done. But for a child, we can only execute an order we are given. We dont think of things, we do what we are ordered to do. Matata Bizi was found, rehabilitated by the United Nations and integrated into the army in 2009. He signed papers that say he is no longer a child soldier. He carries the dirtied, crumbling pages around in his shirt pocket. They brand him now.He came to Goma in 2013. He was trained as a mechanic at the Don Bosco center in Goma but has no work. He says its easier to make more money and move up in rebel groups than in the army.War I know isnt good, and neither is violence. Its not good or normal, he says. But the armed groups exist because the country is badly organized. Theres no work. Theres no occupation for the young.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Nashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra.Kehav Kakad, a farmer from Girnare in Nashik district, received a newly minted Rs 2,000 note on Friday for the 20 quintal of tomatoes he had gone to the Girnare market with. In December last year, Kakad had got Rs 30,400 for the same quantity in the same market.Last year, I received Rs 30,400. Also, the payment was done in notes that I could spend. This year, not only has the price dipped, I am being paid in currency that not many people are willing to take, says Kakad.He is one of the many farmers in Nashik district who have been hit hard by the slump in tomato prices. The overproduction of tomatoes in the country, coupled with the demonetisation effect, has meant that at places such as Girnare, farmers have been forced to sell their produce for as less as Re 1 per kg. The average price for tomatoes in Nashik district for this entire month was a measly Rs 2.76 per kg. Last year during the same period, it was close to Rs 15.5 per kg.Watch What Else is Making NewsNashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra. Over the past three years, tomato production has seen a major surge across the country, including in Maharashtra. In 2014, APMCs across Maharashtra saw a total of 3.90 lakh tonne tomatoes coming into the market, with Nashik accounting for over 30 per cent at 1.24 lakh tonne. The production has, however, spiked to nearly double at 8.59 lakh tonne this year, with Nashik accounting for 3.82 lakh tonnes.While the increased production has played a role in bringing prices down, farmers say demonetisation is to blame too. Before the move, farmers were on an average getting Rs 5.2 per kg for tomatoes. Post November 8, when the decision was announced, the prices in Nashik dipped to Rs 2.76 per kg.This is the last stage of the tomato crop. It cant survive in winter and farmers are desperate to dispose of their produce. The traders know this and are squeezing farmers, citing the effects of demonetisation. They say you either sell at this price or go home with your produce, says Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Palse in Nashik.Traders claim the oversupply of the crop is deciding the price.There is no manipulation by traders. There is an oversupply in the market. The total produce that came in this month is almost double of what was seen during the same period last year. The overproduction across the country has caused the price drop, says a trader from Girnare, not wishing to be named.However, despite the low prices farmers are being offered, there has not been much fall in retail prices of tomatoes, which continue to be sold at Rs 10-15 per kg across the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8e77be9e033b96e95d4,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,,Indian Express,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo) People collect tokens from an IDFC counter that will allow them to buy vegetables at the Rythu bazaar. (Source: Express photo)Anyone who has an Aadhar-linked bank account can now buy vegetables without currency at Rythu bazaars (government-sanctioned farmers markets) in Telangana. With smaller denomination notes hard to come by post demonetisation, the Telangana State Marketing Department has begun an experiment to replace cash with tokens that can be used at the vegetable markets.The tokens, in denominations of Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 20, are available at mobile counters being set up by the Industrial Development Financial Corporation (IDFC) at various markets and other locations. The IDFC counters have hand-held machines connected to servers of all banks, and a small mobile ATM machine that can hold up to Rs 25,000 in cash.Those seeking the tokens have to provide their Aadhar numbers, which are fed into the hand-held machines, which then authenticates credentials and the bank account linked to that number through a fingerprint scan. Once cleared, a customer can take tokens worth a maximum of Rs 500, which would be deducted from the bank account. Customers will receive a text message on their mobile phones from their banks, notifying them of the transaction.Farmers, vegetable sellers or vendors who accept the tokens in lieu of cash can deposit them at IDFC counters at the end of the day, which will then credit their bank accounts with an equal amount.The IDFC mobile ATMs linked to the hand-held machines can also dispense cash to those depositing the tokens. For instance, if a farmer or vendor wants some of the amount in cash and the rest to be deposited in the bank account, it can be done, Telangana Marketing and Irrigation Minister T Harish Rao said. The IDFC agents facilitating these transactions receive a commission from the banks.The experiment was started at the Kukatpally Rythu Bazar Friday afternoon but the response was initially slack as many buyers and vendors could not remember their Aadhar numbers. It has since picked up.Due to lack of awareness, only 85 transactions happened Friday but today, over a 100 people availed coupons within an hour. Buyers are happy and farmers, who were suffering from a slump in sales and lack of cash in hand, are ecstatic. We are fine-tuning it now, director of agriculture marketing G Lakshmi said.With hundreds queued up to buy the tokens, stocks of fruits and vegetables that had been lying unsold for several days, were finally seeing buyers.I did not have any sales the whole of last week. We threw away a lot of tomatoes and cabbage. Since morning, I have been accepting the tokens after my son brought our Aadhar numbers and they linked it at the counter. We have some 40 tokens so far and so it is good. I will encash them in the evening, said Nalla Sriramulu, a farmer from Sangareddy.Health Minister C Laxma Reddy has requested the IDFC to start their counters at government hospitals immediately. The counters are expected to be operational at the hospitals from Wednesday.Officials said that due to uncertainty over when the cash crisis will ease, the Telangana government has decided to start the token payment system.

Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes.The currency crunch resulted by the Centres demonetisation move is set to hit farmers, agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and farm produce transporters ahead of a bright Rabi season, forcing the government to plan measures to tackle the impending crisis.An urgent meeting was held at Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swawalamban Mission, a government organisation, at Amravati Monday to discuss the problem. We are expecting both bumper crop of soyabean and cotton in the Kharif season in Vidarbha and a very bright Rabi prospect across the state due to the last heavy spell of rains and visible positive impact of Jalayukta Shivar scheme. But with currency crunch, both procurement at APMCs and the ability of farmers to purchase seeds have been badly affected. Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes. The farmers are also facing problem in buying seeds for the forthcoming Rabi season which is likely to go up manifold in Vidarbha and Marathwada. We have thought of some measures to address these issues, Kishor Tiwari, director of the mission, told The Indian Express.Watch What Else Is making NewsHe said they had requested the state government to approach the Centre with request to allow use of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 for purchase of seeds at government and registered private centres. We also want the banks to make enough new currency notes available to APMCs to tide over the payment problem. If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named. We are planning to provide transporters of at least onion, potato and tomato with some cash to enable them to continue plying. It will require expenditure of a few crore rupees, which is not a big deal, added the official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Sahay, a former Union Minister of State for Home, said Jharkhand was a horticulture-based state and the marginalized and small farmers were solely depended on producing vegetables.Former Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahay on Friday hit out at Jharkhand government, saying it did not consider ground reality and feel the pulse of tribal community when it decided to amend the decades-old Chhotanagpur and Santal Paragana Tenancy Act (CNT and SPT). The Raghubar Das-led government says the amendments will allow acquisition of tribal land, while keeping the landholders ownership intact, for building infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and educational institutions, but the opposition parties have decried it.Watch what else is making news:The Chief Minister Raghubar Das is not a son of soil, so he neither worked on the ground reality nor could feel the pulses of tribal community while bringing about an amendment in the CNT and SPT, which was drafted haphazardly only to favour corporate and big businessmen, Sahay, a senior Congress leader, alleged. The amendment has changed the nature of land from being an agriculture land to commercial land, he told a press meet alleging that the government had overlooked the provisions of Land Acquisition Act introduced by the UPA government.CNT and SPT were framed to protect the interests of the tribal community, which was very much apprehensive of losing their land despite state governemnts assurance that tribals will not lose ownership over their land, Sahay said. Sahay, a former Union Minister of State for Home, said Jharkhand was a horticulture-based state and the marginalized and small farmers were solely depended on producing vegetables.He claimed the tribal community was apprehensive that their cultural identity and livelihood will be lost. Apart from CNT and SPT, the government was also displacing people settled on non-government and forest land to benefit the corporate and big businessmen, he claimed. An all-party delegation of opposition including JMM had recently met President Pranab Mukherjee to apprise him of the prevailing situation in the state, he added.Referring to demonetisation, Sahay claimed that the farmer community was hit hard owing to demonetization. The poor and small farmers were unable to take their produce to market and were selling foodgrains and vegetables at throw away prices, he said, adding many were dumping tomatoes at roadside. He threatened to launch an agitation on the issue of amendment in the CNT and SPT and said the entire opposition was now united.Sahay said the opposition parties have also demanded a judicial enquiry in police firing at Barkagaon (Hazaribagh), Golla (Ramgarh) and Khunti districts, which claimed seven lives and injured many during protest against alleged forcible land acquisition of agriculture land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Congress leaders are expecting a good turnout of people from the north Gujarat region, where the party had won five district panchayats and 27 taluka panchayats in the local body election held a year ago. Congress had wrested all these panchayat bodies from BJP. Besides, one-fourth of the partys MLAs or 15 to be exact, hail from six districts of the region.Party leaders feel that they can politically cash in on the resentment among the Patidars against BJP and its leaders who, according to the Patidar leaders, have not stood with them in their agitation for seeking reservation in government jobs and admission in higher educational and professional courses.In a way, the rally is likely to become a test of strength for the party, especially at a time when the assembly elections are just a year ahead and leaders of all the major political parties have begun mobilisation programmes in the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally at Deesa, just 100 km from Mehsana, Saturday last.Party spokesperson Manish Doshi said that farmers in the north Gujarat region have suffered the most since the NDA came to power at the Centre two and a half years ago. Congress wants to highlight plight of the farmers by inviting Rahul to address them in Mehsana. Doshi said that export of cotton and tomatoes grown in the region has been hit badly due to wrong policies of the central government.Rahul was to earlier launch a yatra for the rights of tribals that was taken out by the party from temple town of Ambaji two months ago. But that did not happen. Now, Mehsana located at the centre of the state is the most suitable place for Rahulji to address the farmers and rural folks who have suffered the most due to wrong agriculture policies of the Modi government and also demonetisation, said Doshi. Mehsana is the home district of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former chief minister Anandiben Patel and currently Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel.Banaskantha district Congress president Zakir Chauhan said that as the party won the district panchayat polls in Patan, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Sabarkantha and Aravalli districts a year ago, it indicated that the rural population was in favour of the party. Congress had also won Banaskantha district panchayat, but lost to BJP due to a couple of elected members crossing over to BJP.State party president Bharatsinh Solanki and Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Shankersinh Vaghela held a meeting of the office-bearers of the six north Gujarat districts on Wednesday to plan how to mobilise people for the rally.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Crates carrying tomatoes at the Nashik agriculture produce market committee. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Suryabhan Kusare hasnt come to terms with the method of payments at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard thats barely a fortnight old. Earlier, we were getting hard cash. Now, the traders and commission agents pay us by cheque. The new system, were told, would ensure that buying will go on and our payments are on time. But effectively, it means standing for hours in front of banks, first to deposit these cheques and then withdraw whatever little we are allowed to, says this farmer from Sawargaon village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district.Soon after the Centres November 8 announcement, demonetising all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes, traders in all of Nashiks 17 wholesale produce mandis ceased operations, citing shortage of cash to pay farmers. On November 20, the district collector convened a meeting of stakeholders, wherein it was decided that farmers would henceforth be paid either by cheque or through electronic bank transfer. The markets have since opened  with most traders opting for payment through cheques.Watch What Else is Making NewsKusare, who had harvested around 100 quintals of late-kharif season onions from his 2.5 acres holding, isnt happy at all with the new arrangement. Only last week, he sold 25 quintals at the Pimpalgaon Baswant market, fetching him Rs 7,500 at Rs 300 per quintal. The trader wrote out a cheque for this amount drawn on ICICI Bank, which Kusare then took to deposit in his account at the Nashik District Central Cooperative Banks Sawargaon branch. Depositing the cheque took me four hours. The bank people told me it would be cleared only in 4-5 days. After five days, I stood in the queue again and, at the end of it, got just a Rs 2,000 note, complains Kusare.Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Pramod Kusare, a fellow-farmer from the same village, has a similar story to narrate. About eight days back, he took 50 crates of tomatoes (each of 20 kg) to Pimpalgaon Baswant and got a cheque of Rs 4,000 for it: I stood for three hours to deposit the cheque and queued up for another two hours after four days to collect a single Rs 2,000 note. I was informed that the banks cash position did not permit me to get more.For farmers like the Kusare, November-December happens to also be the peak planting time for rabi season crops  mainly onions, tomatoes, and wheat. For them, the move from instant cash to receiving cheque payments has translated into productive time in the fields getting diverted to standing for hours in serpentine bank queues.Just as Lasalgaon is for onions, Pimpalgaon Baswant  also in Nashik district  is known as the market that sets the price for tomatoes in the country. With an annual turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore, this APMC last year recorded total produce arrivals of over 76 lakh quintals, mostly tomatoes, onions and pomegranate. During the peak season, which is from November through the first week of December, daily tomato arrivals are in the range of 20,000-30,000 crates. Even now, 15,000-20,000 crates are arriving every day, with nearly 100 per cent payments to farmers being done though cheques issued by traders either on the same or following day.Somnath Nimse, one of the 557 traders/commission agents at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC, admits that clearing of cheques takes 5-6 days. We were willing to adopt electronic bank transfers, but the internet connectivity here isnt good to enable that, he notes. Tomato prices have crashed post-demonetisation; the average quoted rate, last Friday, at Nashiks primary produce markets was as low as Rs 20 per crate or Rs 1/kg. Its not just farmers. We ourselves are struggling to sell in other (terminal) markets, as the traders there are finding it difficult to arrange funds for making purchases, claims Nimse, who, in the past, has also exported tomatoes to Bangladesh. That trade has completely stopped after November 8. During the peak season, I myself make tomato purchases of Rs 25-30 lakh in cash per day. As against this, the government has specified a weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 for traders, which is a cruel joke, he adds.Traders at Lasalgaon, a market that is synonymous with onions and deals in some 40 lakh quintals of the bulb annually, have also moved almost entirely to cheque payments post-demonetisation. Right now, about 97 per cent of transactions are being done through cheques. We are quite happy having done away with cash payments. Our attempt would be next to go in for direct bank transfer, states Nitin Jain, a commission agent-cum-exporter based in this APMC that is 30 km from Pimpalgaon Baswant.Jagdish Apsunde, a trader and director at the APMC in Nashik  not far from the main city  has already taken the step of electronically transferring money into the accounts of farmers supplying to him. Ive got them to submit their bank account details along with a cancelled cheque to enable me to remit payments directly. This way, farmers are ensured of getting their money the very next day, saving them at least the trouble of having to deposit cheques, observes Apsunde, whose daily peak business in tomatoes and onions runs to over Rs 10 lakh.The Nashik APMC, which handles around 84 lakh quintals of produce annually, was closed for three working days after the demonetisation announcement. Since the meeting with the district collector, the bulk of the 1,300-odd traders here have adopted non-cash means to pay farmers. We are also in the process of getting a public sector bank to open a branch within our mandi premises, which should help farmers, informs KB Shevale, assistant secretary of the APMC.Arun Govindrao Wagh, chairman of the smaller APMC at Sinnar, isnt as enthusiastic about produce trading going cashless. Although we have moved to cheque payments, it doesnt help farmers, as they need cash for purchase of farm inputs and labour payments. How can one expect them to embrace debit or credit cards, leave alone internet banking? he points out.Farmers, on their part, seem resigned to accepting payments now largely through cheque. Pandit Gaikar recently sold 25 crates of cauliflower at the Nashik APMC, for which he received Rs 1,000. The nearest bank is 15 km away from my village. I couldnt possibly have gone all that distance to deposit a cheque for such a paltry amount, and further await payment. My trader was fortunately kind enough to agree and pay me Rs 1,000 in cash, remarks this farmer from Gangavhare near Nashik.Gaikar has harvested just a quarter of his cauliflower crop on one acre and has another two acres of brinjal almost ready to be picked and sold. I dont know what price I am going to get in todays cashless market. Even I get a price, will I be able to lay my hands on cash from the sale? Without cash, how am I going to fill diesel in my tractor and make labour payments for my next crop, within the little planting time available now? asks Gaikar. Thats a question bothering most farmers today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Speaking to The Indian Express in Raipur, Shankar said the Maoists came to his village of Tekla in 2005. My mother died from fever. My father drank constantly and had no affection for us. We had to fend for ourselves. I had to ask people for food. So when the Maoists came, the villagers said there was nobody to take care of us. They took us with them.Shankar said that Day Singh, the man who led the team, took them to a bal ashram in Mundmal, on the border of Abhujmaad in Narayanpur district. There they stayed a few days, until the brothers were separated.Mundmal has 30-35 children under five years of age, and one teacher called Manoj. They stay there until they are ready to join the bal sangham, Shankar said.Shankar  at that time of bal sangham age  was taken to Rajmeta, where he stayed with 15 boys of his age, under the tutelage of an area commander named Aashu. There they were conditioned for the life of a rebel.The children would wake up at 4 am and sit in silence till 6 am, or when the first light broke. This was when police movement is at its highest, so we were told to be awake and aware, Shankar said.Between 6 and 8 am, the children would work in the fields, some planting tomatoes, others rice. Then there would be lessons. In the bal sangham, we are considered almost ready to fight. So there isnt much theory. There was one book, which the commander taught us. It said that capitalists were taking away our jungles and peoples way of life, and we were fighting to protect them, Shankar said. With a premium on ammunition, all weapons training was done with bamboo poles fashioned into makeshift rifles.Carefree as they were, self-preservation was built in. Each child had a uniform akin to government schools, and civil clothes. If the police came, we were told to run in different directions to a village so we could blend in, he said.Shankar spent a year at the sangham. At 13 he joined the Rajmeta militia. Quick on the uptake, he was soon promoted to the National Park military company no. 9 in 2007, and handed a .303 rifle. But there was growing disenchantment, and a failed escape attempt. We got nothing. No money, no peace of mind, no regular food. I didnt know what I was fighting for, and didnt like killing. So I tried to escape with my gun and got caught. Then I got demoted to the Buri militia, Shankar said.One of the reasons for his disillusionment was the failure to meet his brother, he said. He made his way to Mundmal, but was told nobody could meet the children.DM Awasthi, Special DG Anti Naxal Operations and SIB, to which Shankar had surrendered, said, This surrender has given us much information about how the bal sangham and schools operate. He has been part of big incidents like the Murkinar camp attack, which left 11 dead, or the Ranibodli camp attack, which left 55 personnel dead. We now have information on how they were carried out.On Shankars right ankle, a linear scar runs deep. It was in the Ranibodli attack that he first fired his .303 in an encounter, and was shot in the leg. The stitches amateurish, the wound still hurts eight years later. It is this life he wants to pull his brother out of.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Gajendra Yadav) Vegetable sellers at Azadpur mandi had to turn down several customers. (Express Photo: Gajendra Yadav)Every day, 32-year-old Sanjeev Kumar Thakur, an aarthiya (middleman) who trades in tomatoes at Azadpur mandi, makes transactions worth about Rs 10 lakh with wholesellers from across Delhi-NCR. But on Wednesday, even after working an hour extra, and rejecting countless Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, he made less than 40 per cent of what he usually does.By 7.30 am on Wednesday, Thakur had already turned away four wholesellers. One of them, Ram Shankar, 35, owns a grocery store in northwest Delhis Adarsh Nagar. Shankar said he needed 20 kg tomatoes, but since he only had Rs 500 notes, he had to go back empty-handed.Pointing to a truck full of tomatoes, Thakur said, Since the announcement, there is confusion all around. I cant risk taking big notes, he said, adding that he doesnt want to give vegetables on credit because most buyers have previous dues.About 300 metres away, 40-year-old aarthiya Titu had a different problem. Two chilli farmers were refusing to leave until he paid them in notes of Rs 100 or less. How do I pay the farmers who have come from far? Some of them dont even have a bank account, Titu said.Chilli farmer Bhagat Singh, who arrived from Jafrabad at 3 am, said he was on his way to the mandi when he got a call from home. My wife told me not to take Rs 1,000 or Rs 500 notes. The aarthiya owes me Rs 20,000, said Singh, adding that he would wait until the end of the day for the cash.Like Titus and Singhs, most stalls in the mandi saw discussions and arguments on the same issue. In the absence of an alternative, most small retailers accepted Rs 500 notes from customers after bit of convincing.Agricultural Produce Market Committee deputy secretary Babu Lal said, Business was hit but we will be able to understand the impact only in a few days.Azadpur mandi is Asias largest wholesale fruits and vegetables market spanning 90 acres. In the 2015-16 fiscal, the mandi saw an annual transaction of more than Rs 9,000 crore, the APMC, which governs the mandi, said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions.Were looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong, Shami said.He said the cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes."

Thank you all, lets do business, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said. (source: PTI)Stressing that cyber warfare is a strategic challenge, the visiting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Thursday said that his country and its defence industry were ready and committed to strengthening its cooperation with India to make a safer world.Introducing the heads of Israels defence industry, Rivlin said in a speech on Thursday, We did not seek to become experts in the field of defence, but through the struggle for our independence and our liberty, we learned how important it is to be able to defend ourselves, to fight our enemies, to fight terrorism. Today the battlefield is changing. Cyber warfare is no longer science fiction, it is a strategic challenge. In all these areas, Israel, and Israeli industry is ready and committed to strengthening this cooperation to make a safer world. Of course we are very grateful to our Indian partners for the way they work together with us in order to ensure a safe and secure world.He added, There is positive and growing cooperation between our countries in many areas of defence and security. We also face a common challenge in fighting terrorism and radicalism. I am here today to affirm our commitment to the fight against global terrorism. We are here today to carry the great potential of this partnership into reality.Rivlin is in India for an eight-day visit. After holding talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week, he visited Agra and is scheduled to travel to Karnal, Chandigarh and Mumbai.Regarding cooperation across diverse sectors, he said, Israel wants to play a part in the Four-Colours Revolution that Prime Minister Modi has set as Indias national goal, that brings together the colours of the Indian flag: saffron for solar power, green for agriculture, white for dairy produce and blue for water. In all these issues, Israel  little Israel  is a giant of knowledge and experience, as we have already had to overcome our own challenges. Our advanced solar power systems, irrigation systems, water treatment projects and the average milk production per cow are just a few examples.Todays innovations are almost unimaginable  and we now have companies working to make water out of air. We want to gather all these technologies, all the power of our Israeli innovations, as our motivation today: To make in India!! To make with India!! To be your partners!He said the two sides were cooperating to attain food security. We already have Israeli and Indian experts working together with local farmers to improve Indian produce and the lives of local families. We are very proud of all they are doing. Tomorrow, I will visit Karnal where Indians and Israelis are developing new kinds of cherry tomatoes (which is an Israeli invention). They are already making in India a future together.Our two nations have changed the world before; it is time to do it again, together.

Some middlemen said the situation has improved since November 8, but it is yet to reach normalcy. Middlemen dealing with tomatoes are facing an even tougher time  their business was first affected when exports were banned to Pakistan due to the ongoing tension between the two countries, and next by demonetisation.Watch what else is making news:Sanjeev Kumar Thakur, a middleman in Azadpur, said they get tomatoes from Bangalore and Nashik. A box of tomatoes, weighing 25 kg, now costs Rs 170-Rs 300. Weve been facing problems since exports to Pakistan were stopped. Demonetisation has dealt a double blow. The cash crunch is never-ending.He added that small farmers who come from nearby areas, mainly Agra, to sell their produce are facing huge problems. Sanjeev Yadav, who has come to the mandi to sell chillis, said that since November, the biggest challenge is getting the full amount in cash from traders.Sandeep Kapoor, owner of Om Sai Ram Traders, said he has seen a decline of nearly 50 per cent in his sales ever since demonetisation. After demonetisation, the volume of sales has also gone down. The market is moving at a snails pace.

590a30a77be9e033b96ebace,Halting desertification,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581090/halting-desertification.html,2016-11-14,,Deccan Herald,"Sriroop Chaudhuri and Mimi Roy, Nov 15, 2016 23:16 ISTFOOD, CLIMATE, MIGRATION : About 96.4 million hectares land area (29.3% of total landmass) of India is currently under land degradation/desertificatioIn the last couple of decades, land degr-adation/desertification has grown into an appalling menace to sustainable human development, affecting billions around the world including India, leaving the authorities reeling over dire resource depletion/inadequacy. A major reason for it has been a lack of consensus over a precise definition of desertification.As per the United Nations Convention for Combating Desertification (UNCCD), desertification is virtually any form of land degradation in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, resulting from a combination of climatic variations and unplanned human expansion. Desertification, by newer definitions, is no more just about sand dunes and oasis. Today it means the collective damage caused to the worlds dryland ecosystems.In India, combating land degradation/ desertification has emerged as a top environmental priority to the authorities concerned. India is signatory to the UNCCD and intends to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030. On June 17, 2016, on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), and Arid Zone Forest Research Institute (AFRI), jointly released desertification maps of the country. These maps, compiled by the Space Application Centre, Isro along with 19 partner instit-utes, for the 2003-05 and 2011-13 periods, have brought up some disturbing facts.It appears that about 96.4 million hectares (Mha) land area (29.3% of total landmass) of the country is currently under land degradation/desertification, as compared to about 94.5 Mha (28.7%) during 2003-05. By far, Rajasthan appears to be the hot-seat of degradation/ desertification in the country followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Cumulatively, these nine states account for about 23% of the total land area under degradation/desertification in India.But what bakes the cake really is the state-wise land area under degradation/ desertification. In Jharkhand (68.9%), Rajasthan (62.9%), Delhi (60.6%), Gujarat (52.2%) and Goa (52.1%), over half the land area is under intense threat of land degradation/desertification. To add further to the aggravation, in each on these states/UTs, land degradation/desertification has increased between 2003-05 and 2011-13 period with the worst scenario apparent in Delhi, registering about 11% increase.Desertification/degradation is on steep gradients in the Northeast as well. In Tri-pura, land degradation/desertification increased by about 10.4% between 2003-05 and 2011-13, in Nagaland by 8.7% and Mizoram 4.3%. Overall, in 25 states/UTs, desertification appears to be on the rise.But why the heck we care for desertification of the drylands? Here is what the drylands do: they constitute about 34% of worlds total landmass and are major source of food, especially for the poor. One in three crops cultivated today, including oats, barley, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage and saffron, originated from drylands. About half the worlds livestock is concentrated in the drylands.Recent UNCCD reports suggest that about 52% of worlds agricultural land area is moderate to severely degraded. About 12 Mha of productive land are turning barren annually resulting from desertification/drought, toppling cha-nces of about 20 mt of food grains which acutely exacerbates global food crises.As added vice, desertified areas are noted for their long-range adversities on climate. For example, reduction in vegetation (frequently associated with desertification) cover elevates atmospheric aerosol/dust levels which affect cloud formation and rainfall patterns, carbon cycle, and biodiversity.Visibility crises in Beijing, a well-known menace these days, is believed to have been caused by springtime dust storms originating in the Gobi Desert. Yellow Dust from China costs the Korean and Japanese economy a huge revenue each year. It is also taken for US air quality deterioration in recent times. In China itself, desertification, leading to recurrent droughts and massive crop-losses, takes a nice bite of the countrys annual GDP. Studies find that desertification can hugely magnify global warming in days ahead.But putting aside the tangible issues regarding food/water shortage, and climate, there are others that do not meet naked eye. One such is forced migration. Desertification is destabilising large communities globally, turning them into migrants and homeless refugees.Environmental migrationAn estimated mob of 60 million will migrate from desertified areas in sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and/or Europe by 2020. By 2050, about 200 million people will turn up as perman-ently displaced environmental migrants. Governmental reports suggest that such displaced mob and forced migrants often take to radicalisation and extremism, inciting brutal resource-driven conflicts.Environmental migration is largely triggering political instability, terrorist disturbances, and food/water riots across desertified areas, ultimately spilling over to neighbouring lands. So what can we do to halt desertification? Or shall we do anything at all? Monitoring for causes of desertification should be central any action plan. Aberrant climatic shifts is of course the major impaling factor.But other than climate, unleashed human expansion contributes a great deal to desertification:a) Land cover change (due to urban sprawl): deforestation/logging beyond permissible limits; forest fires/encroachment into forest lands; conversion of native croplandsb) Land management protocol: inadequate soil conservation measures (soil erosion); improper crop rotation /shift in cultivation patterns; improper irrigation schemes (water-logging/leaching); indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals (soil salinisation)c) Overexploitation of natural resources (overpopulation/demand): overgrazing; unplanned groundwater extraction; inequitable sharingd) Lack of resources (tools/funds/ trained professionals) to: support innovative dryland agriculture; reclaim water-logged and/or saline soilsThese days, climate change also is a ramified effect of human expansion (urbanisation/carbon emission/freshwater abstraction) only. A disturbing fact about desertification is, it is largely irreversible. So, may be its time we seriously gave in to the UNs recent plea stop deserting the deserts. Other than building up holistic awareness among the common people, a major push should be to establish transnational partnerships to monitor, assess, re-assess and implement stringent actions plans.(The writers are assistant professors and assistant directors, Centre for Environment, O P Jindal Global University, Sonipat, Haryana)"

(Representational image) Wisdom is required to cap the gains of the winners and limit the losses of the losers. (Representational image)This week too, I must stay with the subject of demonetisation.When change takes place, there will be winners and losers. Wisdom is required to cap the gains of the winners and limit the losses of the losers. Greater wisdom is required to ensure that no one is utterly ruined. Such wisdom can only come from full information and knowledge.Piecing together bits of evidence that are freely available in Delhi  especially from the government and BJP sources  it is now absolutely clear that the Prime Minister was not told:1. That demonetising Rs 500  and Rs 1,000  notes will result in 86 per cent, by value, of all currency notes being withdrawn from circulation and use.2. That printing capacity is limited and replacing the demonetised notes (2,400 crore in number) will take seven months if every note is replaced by a note of the same denomination; more time if a note is replaced by smaller denomination notes; and less time if the notes are replaced by Rs 2,000 notes.3. That it will take a month or more to recalibrate the 2,15,000 ATMs and stack them with the new notes (if sufficient notes are supplied).Skeletons tumbling outWithout full information, and without asking the right questions, the Prime Minister unilaterally took the decision to demonetise high denomination notes (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000). His confident demeanour and rhetoric swayed the people. The vast majority believed him when he said that demonetisation will stamp out black money, corruption, fake currency notes and terrorist funding. They believed him when he said that the inconvenience will be short-lived (his Finance Minister even fixed the following Tuesday [15 November] as the day on which things will become normal!). They believed him when he asked for forbearance for 50 days. They stood patiently in long lines, for long hours, and did not protest too much even if they returned empty-handed.Until last week, the Prime Minister had the upper hand. Then, the skeletons started to tumble out of the cupboard. Every promise of the government turned out to be hollow and false. The myth around demonetisation began to unravel. The winners and losers were identified. And we found to our shock that the lives of millions had been utterly ruined.Winners and losersWho are the winners? The hoarders who laundered every note in their hoard. The launderers and brokers who earned huge commissions. The bank officers who converted the demonetised notes and handed over bundles of new Rs 2,000 notes to the tax-evaders and the corrupt officials. The petty government officials, including policemen, who cajoled or threatened bank officials to open a backdoor exchange counter to exchange old notes for new. Together, they have succeeded beyond imagination and practically ensured that every rupee of the Rs 15,44,000 crore will be returned to the banking system!Who are the losers?  The average person who was compelled to make several visits to the bank to withdraw money from his own account. The person with a few old notes who had no access to a bank branch (because of distance) and exchanged her notes at a discount. The homemaker who had to scrounge for money to provide at least one meal a day for her family. The patient who had to forego his treatment at a hospital because he did not have money in his hands. The student who got his meal at the langar in the neighbourhood gurdwara. The farmer who could not buy seeds or fertilisers or hire labour and took a hit on productivity.Those utterly ruinedWho are those who were utterly ruined?  The labourer who was laid off in industrial hubs like Tiruppur, Surat and Moradabad. The daily wage earner who could not find work in farms or mandis or on construction sites. The self-employed, selling flowers or fruit or pav-bhaji, whose customers vanished for several weeks. The artisan plying his trade (carpenter, electrician, plumber) who got no calls. The small businessman whose sales fell by as much as 80 per cent. The truck owner and truck driver whose trucks were idle for several weeks.Among the worst affected were the farmer-producers whose produce suffered a crash in prices, as will be seen from the table (right):In the case of tomatoes, carrots and spinach, seasonal factors may have caused a decline in prices. In other cases, it is undeniable that lack of money, and the consequent fall in demand, was a major driver. As far as the farmer-producer is concerned, the loss of income is brutal and final  and no one has come forward to compensate him. Eleven crore people, on average, standing in a queue before bank branches and ATMs every day; the promise of being allowed to withdraw up to Rs 24,000 every week dishonoured; loss of daily wages or daily income that cannot be recouped; fall in commodity prices for which there will be no compensation; tragic deaths, the number of which is nearing 100- not even a natural calamity could have wreaked such havoc across the country.Cry, my beloved country, because of an ill-conceived plan that turned into a catastrophe due to incompetent implementation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"

Trolls say, they were shortchanged. #BoxersArentUndies trends.Rainbow now has black too: Finally apartheid ends. Temba Bavuma becomes first black African specialist batsman. Its taken long for South Africas batting line-up, crickets pampered and elitish top order, to get a rainbow hue.Scratch the surface: We do live in the post-truth era. India gets excited about Pranav Dhanawades 1,009 from 327 balls. The rider that mostly went unread: 30 yard boundary, 10-year-old pacers, 25 chances.Mid-career crisis: And you thought Manish Pandey had made it. In January 2016, he scores 104 in 81 balls as India chase down 330 at SCG. Soon it will be January 2017. Pandey still gets chance when stars rest.Sporting rebirth: If you fail as Raju Sharma in India, you can succeed as Raju Rijal in Nepal. Mystery of how within a span of 10 years, an under-15 Mumbai junior player emerged as a under-19 Nepal captain.Negi demonetised: Never trust IPL valuations. How Pawan Negis Rs 8.5 crore cookie crumbled? Mostly on bench during the IPL season, not in Delhis Ranji probables and, now in December, released by Delhi Daredevils.Role reversal: The Ferris wheel went around a circle earlier this year, as Australian journalist Samuel Ferris tried nudging India ODI skipper MS Dhoni on the touchy retirement question. Dhoni called the scribe to sit next to him and asked Do you think I can survive till the 2019 World Cup? You should, yes, sure, the scribe was forced to concede. What goes up, and all that.Defeat to die for: If you thought bad defeats dont hurt coaches, think again. It even turns some towards potential suicide.

You need a captain and coach with the right take on the Decision Review System (DRS) which BCCI snubbed for eight seasons. Fortune favoured the brave as Virat Kohli-Anil Kumbles India won 4-0.Trouble at the top: Openers were a happy headache for Virat Kohli at the start of this year with many batsmen in form. It turned into an actual headache as they contrived to get injured by the end of the 2016. It got so bad that Kohli was forced to open with Parthiv Patel in Mohali while the selectors plucked out Gautam Gambhir from the cold. In all, India used five openers, and six different combinations in just 11 Tests. Not an open and shut case still.No homely feeling: India went into the Mumbai Test against England for the first time without a single player who could call Wankhede home; the first such instance since 1933, when Bombay Gymkhana hosted Indias first-ever Test. No wonder you didnt hear a commentator say he knows it like the back of his hand.More added to the list: Throughout his career, Kiran More was made to regret the dropped catch of Graham Gooch at Lords in 1990. Reprieved on 36, he went on to make 333. Alastair Cook can nurse a regret of his own now: he spilled a difficult one of Karun Nair on 34, and the Indian struck a triple. He has company in Adil Rashid who twice dropped Virat Kohli, who went on to make hundreds of match-changing proportions.Redemption for the royal: Once a figure of ridicule, Ravindra Jadeja silenced detractors in Tests, no less. Not only as a left-arm spinner spinning out England on a blameless pitch in Chennai, but also as a reliable lower-order batsman who batted in a restrained manner when needed. Sir-prise !!!His best delivery: As if being ICC Cricketer of the Year and Test Cricketer of the Year wasnt enough, Ravi Ashwin turned even more adorable becoming daddy to Daughter No 2. I delivered carrom baby #2 on the 21st Ashwins better half Prithi tweeted.Cricket gone to the dogs: England tried relentlessly to stop Pujara and Kohlis onslaught at Vizag. But a pitch-invader was more successful than the visitors. The game was halted when the dog was chased away, only to see it return after a while. A mongrel more dogged than the Poms and their three lions. Move over 007s, our Vizag dog has 700 followers on Twitter.Adding (financial) injury to insult: The Poms came here and literally paid for their defeats. The BCCI made the England team pay their own expenses under the pretext of a court ruling. Interest on the Kohinoor in instalments?Lights, camerapink: Not many expected the Ranji Trophy to get the much needed facelift this season. First, zonal system was scrapped. Then a shiny, pink ball and fully-lit up flood-lights suddenly gave Duleep the leap.You cant see me: Smog had its desolation moment in cricket. With visibility affected, Bengal-Gujarat and Hyderabad-Tripura  played in Delhi, split points. Bengal players had updated from monkey caps this winter to vogmasks.Goose cooked: South Africa are known to trigger captaincy changes in England with Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss stepping down after home series defeats against the Proteas. India can lay claim to Alastair Cooks head though.Wheres the star: The great AB de Villiers couldnt bat in Australia. 2016 mustve been really rotten.Reality check: By not playing the Ranji Trophy this term, Harbhajan Singh might have scripted a silent version of farewell to Tests. Ashwin now has Jayant Yadav for company.Too spicy for everyone: Heard of too many cooks spoiling the broth? Well South Africa have kind of dissed that myth. They are yet to lose a Test when both Stephen Cook and Keshav Maharaj have played together.South America is not South Asia: Months before Rio, Indias South Asian games tally: Gold: 188, Silver: 90 silver, Bronze: 30. Post-truth again.Tongas topless man for all seasons: Pita Taufatofua, the Taekwondo athlete, walked carrying Tongas flag, topless, his ripping torso oiled at the Rio opening ceremony. Hes threatening to qualify for Pyeongchangs Winter Olympics in two years time in cross-country skiing. Hell need a few thermals there though.All bases covered: Standing on the Olympic podium, under the US flag, wearing a hijab. Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Muslim girl from Maplewood, picked fencing since that would mean wearing the mask, glove, jacket, pants on sporting arena.One for the upstart: Didnt see it, Cant believe it, sang Marc Antony. Neither did Puerto Ricans imagine it. But Monica Puig won Olympics gold in tennis singles. Strains of Ricky Martins Cup of Life rent the air, this time for his compatriot.China is never too far away: It was PV Sindhu in yellow vs Carolina Marin in red that finals day of womens singles at Rio, the two hues being Chinas predominant playing colours. Shockingly, no Chinese eventually made the podium.Diving into matrimony: The Chinese decided to turn cute this Olympics. He Zi, moments after receiving a silver medal for 3m springboarding, was offered another piece of silverware. An engagement ring this time. Fellow diver and boyfriend Qin Kai went down on his knee to say the magical words. Zis ji followed.None of the above: Indias Entry List for 74kg Freestle Wrestling (Mens): Option A: Narsingh Yadav; Option B: Sushil Kumar; Option C: Parveen Rana; Option D: No one. ANSWER: D for Duh. Dont. Get. Us. Started. On. This. One.Leap into history: Sachin didnt know there was no R in Karma(r)kar two years ago when he first met Dipa, the Tripura gymnast. But everyone agreed there could be an extra U in Pro(u)dunova after Indias sensational 4th place finish in Vault.Phelps schooled: Michael Phelps may have ended the year with a photo shoot that rivalled only the gold adorning the Reddy daughter at her wedding. But Joseph Schooling, literally an autograph-seeking school-boy when Phelps last visited his home Singapore, pipped the American to the 100m fly gold.Breaking down walls: Olympics was all about climbing podiums. Now its climbing walls. The webs sport weaves to welcome Spidermen.Down Under: The Kookaburras had won everything in the lead-up to Rio, before the Dutch ditched them out in quarters. They failed to score against Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands. Come to think of it, India couldve fancied its chances against Aussies, atoning all prior sins in the grand flowing Amazon.Fashioning heartbreaks, German Hockey Style: India beaten with 3 seconds to go; Argentina denied win with a goal 8 seconds from time; and Kiwis stunned with 1 second remaining on the clock.Rising to the occasion: They were boring. Didnt win a game in 90 minutes. Finished third in their group. Dont know if Portugal were good or others that bad at Euros. But then, Ronaldo now has what Messi doesnt  a major international title. 2016s settled the matter.Having England on ice: Icelands dream run, surely, was over. But they had it in them to score a goal more than England in the Round of 16 of Euro 2016. It wound up with Roy Hodgson resigning as England coach.Stay original: The Viking Clap celebration looked good on Iceland. France trying to do an Iceland after their Euro semifinal win over Germany, though, drew a lot of criticism for their lack of creativity.Friendly fire: Sania Mirza and Martina Hingis won the Australian Open, and then made a Grand Slam final at the French, but against each other in mixed doubles. Irony is the partnership would break before the Olympics, the only tournament they arent allowed to pair up together. Not with  nor without you.Everyone loves a winner: World number 1. Wimbledon champ. And Olympic gold. Andy Murrays British identity looks safe by the end of 2016. Until he starts losing and becomes Scottish again.Rivalry for the ages: Indias next Davis Cup captain will be younger than the oldest active player. If theres one thing we know about Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi, it is that never put them in a year-ending list with finality. 20 years down the line, theyll still be at it  whatever the it is; love, hate, intrigue.Show me the money: While the general public reeled under the governments demonetisation drive, Mahesh Bhupathis International Premier Tennis League came and went without much fanfare and organisers of the Pro Wrestling League had to postpone the second edition due to cash crunch. Even Ranji Trophy teams struggled with daily allowances. Nothing la la about these Ligas.On auto pilot: Its Team Principal and managing director is absconding and chairman and co-owner Subrata Roy is out of jail on parole. And yet, Force India left all off the track problems in their slipstream in their best year ever in Formula One. They notched up a fourth-place finish, ahead of Williams and the iconic McLaren.A Lion in winter: Tiger has mellowed with age, injuries and lack of success. He was seen babysitting his teammates kids during the Ryder Cup, ensuring their families were having a good time while Team USA was conquering Europe. Who Woodve thunk!Cubs become LIons: Chicago Cubs recorded a no-hitter (when a team is not able to record a single hit) on April 21. It sat nicely with their moniker Lovable Losers. Seven months later they ended a 108 year curse to be crowned World Series champions. Americas staple of fairytale wins.Paving the way: In combat sports, UFC superstar Conor McGregor of Ireland showed his lightning-fast hands to match that motormouth. But the real story was Stipe Miocic of Cleveland. The Ohio native, a huge underdog, upset Fabricio Werdum in his den in Curitiba, Brazil, in a first-round knockout breaking the states longstanding sports curse. The Cavs followed in the NBA finals.Rest in peace: Circa 2016 proved to be bad for sports revolutionaries. Muhammad Ali, Johan Cruyff, Arnold Palmer and our very own Amal Dutta were taken out.And finally, again: L, E, I, C, E, S, T, E, R.

591f0b537be9e025a5d49fe8,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migration",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560567/bihar-state-litti-chokha-migration.html,2016-07-27,,Deccan Herald,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migrationJustin Rowlatt, Jul 28, 2016, INYT: 23:29 ISTLitti are char-grilled flavour bombs, especially when freighted with chokha, the spicy stew of grilled aubergine, tomato and potato that traditionally accompanies one of my absolute favourite Indian street foods. They come originally from Bihar.Biharis absolutely love litti chokha, as  in truth  do most people who taste it. Put it like this, the first time I went to the Bihars capital, Patna, I had people in my office begging me to bring some back. I said Id do my best, but warned I was unlikely to be allowed any food through airport security checks.Nevertheless, I arrived for the return flight with two big bags full of the stuff. The security officers at Patna airport sniffed suspiciously, but, when I told them what and why, they broke into smiles and waved me right on through.Clearly, they judged it was more important to get a consignment of the states most celebrated street food to hungry fans than enforce a few petty restrictions and regulations.Litti are pastry balls, packed full of a spicy mash made with sattu  roasted chickpea flour. They are roasted in beds of charcoal  or, sadly a rarity these days, dried cow dung  and then dipped in salty melted ghee, clarified butter. A couple of these will be served with a decent dollop of chokha, as well as some yoghurt sauce and a scoop of hot, sour pickle. Yes, I thought that would get your mouth watering.You find litti wherever Biharis go, and since Biharis go almost everywhere in India, that means youve got a chance of tasting this delicious snack almost anywhere in the country. Youve got to keep your eyes peeled, though.Look out for the tell-tale pall of smoke from the charcoal and the queue of wiry, tough-looking men. Wiry men, because one of the few things Bihar is famous for in India  apart from litti  is migration.Historic cityThe state capital was once the greatest centre of learning and culture on the sub-continent. When the Greek ambassador Megasthenes visited in 302 BC  yes, it was a while back  he was stunned by Pataliputra, as Patna was then known. The city stretched for nearly 10 miles along the banks of the Ganges.It had, Megasthenes reported, 64 gates and 570 towers, not to mention gardens, palaces, temples and stables full of war elephants. I have seen the great cities of the east, he wrote, I have seen the Persian palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, but this is the greatest city in the world. No visitor would say that of Patna today.Buddha achieved enlightenment in Bihar, the state was home to worlds first residential university and was the powerbase from which Ashoka built the first pan-Indian empire, famous for its tolerance and pluralism. But sadly the capital has not  how shall I put this?  retained the elegance of the ancient city.Poverty-stricken stateTruth be told, modern Patna is a great sprawling, poverty-stricken megatropolis. Which should be no surprise because Bihar has a population of over 100 million people, larger than any western European country, and is one of the poorest states in India. It recorded an average per capita income of just $682 in 2015, less than half of the $1,627 average income nationally.Last year, I managed to get hold of a copy of a vast health survey carried out by the government with the UN agency for children, Unicef. The report had been due for publication in October 2014 but the government had decided to keep it secret.Flip through page after page of statistics and you can see why. Youll also discover why so many Biharis have decided to go in search of work elsewhere. The report shows that in 2013-14 half of children under the age of five in Bihar were stunted, a third were underweight and three quarters of households practised open defecation.Now comes the good news. A few years ago a new technocratic state government made tackling graft and promoting economic growth its priority, and Bihar  which had become a byword for caste division, crime and corruption  started scoring double-digit growth.Thats good news for the people of Bihar, but not for lovers of litti, like me. Because heres the rub: as a result, migration from the state has fallen dramatically.The fear is that the litti chokha stalls dotted across India that ensure that Bihari migrants still get a taste of the best of home will pack up shop and go home too. Then this wonderful street food snack will be even harder to find."

While a pizza is a treat for a shared occasion, largely consumed for lunch and dinner, we find that a burger is an all-day snacky item, mostly meant for individual consumption. While we are a pizza brand, we wanted to participate in the individual consumption occasion, and hence came out with a new product BurgerPizza responding to that trend.The BurgerPizza, as the name says, looks like a burger, but has a lot of pizza goodness packed within such as fresh tomatoes, veggies, and mozarella cheese, sandwiched in a pair of oven-made buns. The product has two variants each for vegetarian and non-vegetarian, priced from Rs 89.Explaining the strategy, Narayanaswamy said, There is a lot of opportunity to grow in the said trend. While we couldve launched a burger ouselves, we realise that were a pizza brand, and used our expertise to create a pizza in another form. BurgerPizza will allow the company to tap the burger occasion, and acquire a bigger pie of the QSR industry as a whole, while also establishing a new category.According to Euromonitor, the informal eating out (IEO) industry was valued at $121.7 billion in 2015, and is expected to grow by 8% in 2016. The QSR industry is valued at $18.9 billion of the total IEO market in India. The burger and pizza markets  which set a rage in India  are valued at around Rs 3,200 crore each.Talking about the QSR market in India, Narayanaswamy said that the industry has potential to grow. But the market contribution in QSR is still from the top 20 metros. Opportunities come by even in smaller tier II and III markets, which must be viewed differently from the metros. Yet, an aware consumer-base, with fair amount of exposure to global food, means that people know what to demand, he said, adding that Dominos has constantly made innovations in its products.Meanwhile, Dominos Pizza leads the chained pizza market in India, holding on to a 72% market share. The company added 150 new restaurants in FY16, taking the overall tally to 1,039 Dominos Pizza outlets across 240 cities, as of May 28.We are known as delivery and pizza experts. We are open to opportunities in the market. As concerns the BurgerPizza, the product has been developed in India for this market, Narayanaswamy hinted, not divulging further details."

It would insist on investments in farm infrastructure such as cold storage, refrigerator trucks and processing plants.According to a government study, 16% of the total fruits and vegetables produced in the country go waste every year due to a lack of food processing capacities.It pegged the food wastage at Rs 92,000 crore annually.The changes in the FDI policy will ensure more investment in infrastructure creation and employment generation, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said.The minister had earlier mooted that at least 25% of the total FDI in food retail should be dedicated to the creation of infrastructure.More investments in food processing could also help rein in galloping prices of kitchen staples like tomatoes and onions and fruits.If you want to enjoy vegetables during the off season as well, you should be ready for processed food.

Of them, 5,650 or 4.29 per cent, were farmers. Of these, 64.5 per cent were marginal and small farmers.The Bureau also reported that 25.6 per cent of farmers suicides were due to bankruptcy and indebtedness. According to the Niti Aayog head Arvind Panagaria, who conducted a survey in 2008, 20.35 per cent of these suicides were due to drinking and gambling, 16.81 per cent due to failure of crops, 2.65 per cent due to indebtedness and fall in agricultural prices each.The remaining 57.54 per cent were due to other reasons like discord in the family etc. In 2014, 4,400 farmers committed suicide due to drinking and gambling and 1,250 due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices while 3,672 farmers who committed suicide were marginal and small farmers.Suicides committed by farmers due to drinking, gambling and family discordsetc, cannot be termed as agriculture related though persons committing suicides were farmers. But suicides due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices are farmer-specific.Farmers are distressed because of three reasons: their landholdings are uneconomic and unviable; failure of crops due to floods and draughts; and fall in agricultural prices. After Independence, the number of marginal and small land holdings has increased due to land reforms. For example, when land reforms were implemented in Karnataka in 1971, the number of land holdings with less than two hectares was 29,22,000. By 2011, it was 59,87,000.According to the Department of Agriculture in Karnataka, the size of the land holding should be 2.56 hectares to be economically viable. The average size of land holdings of these marginal and small farmers also increased, though marginally, from 0.60 in 1971 to 0.81 in 2011, still leaving the holding economically unviable. It was quite natural that the number of suicides by these farmers also increased.To alleviate the problems of the marginal and small farmers, some people have suggested providing them with improved inputs. But the proper solution to the problem lies in encouraging cooperative farming. If farmers can pool their land by forming a cooperative, then the problem of unviability of the small holdings can be overcome as they will get the benefit of economies of scale. While a single small farmer cannot on his own dig a borewell or buy a tractor, a cooperative farm can easily do so. This may also to a great extent help the small farmers in overcoming the problem of fall in prices of agricultural produce.While a single small farmer may not have the capacity to store his produce and sell it only when he gets a better price and, hence, has to opt for distress sale, a farming cooperative can create such storing capacity and sustain itself when the agricultural prices fall. It is only then that a small land holding can become economically viable and prevent the losses.Since a farming cooperative with large tracts of land in its possession can go for multiple cropping, even if the prices of one or two of its produces fall, no member will be ruined because he will be sharing the profits earned by the cooperative from other produces.Agricultural pricesFailure of crops, which accounts for 16.81 per cent of the suicides committed by farmer, happens mostly due to floods or droughts which are natural phenomena. While crop insurance can be an answer to floods, irrigation could be the answer to droughts.The loss to farmers due to fall in agricultural prices is a man-made phenomenon. Since the demand for agricultural produce is by and large stable, the reason for the fall in agricultural prices is over-production.For example, if tomato fetches a good price in any one year, all farmers opt to grow tomatoes with the result that in the next year, there is over-production and the prices fall. There have been instances when farmers have thrown away their produce on the roads as they could not get a fair price.Some people have suggested solutions sans markets to this problem of fall in agricultural prices. They suggest that a floor price for agricultural produce should be fixed by law and no one should be allowed to sell his produce at a price lower than the statutory price. But then, the problem of fall in agricultural prices is not legal but an economic one and therefore, a legal solution to an economic problem will not ultimately work.Some have suggested the solution of a government intervention in the market by fixing support prices. But since the problem is one of over-production, this will only increase the financial burden on the government rather than solve the problem.The prices of agricultural produce in the markets fall when there is more supply than demand. The demand for agricultural produce, as compared to industrial produce, is more or less fixed. Hence, the demand cannot be reduced. But supply can be regulated to equalise with the demand. In the first instance, supply can be contained at the time of production itself. Since the demand is known, if the farmers can plan their supply, the fall in prices that happens due to over-production can be prevented.To achieve this, production will have to be meticulously planned at the national or at least at the state level. Secondly, if the far-mers can store their produce when the pri-ces fall and wait till the prices rise, they can overcome the problem of excessive supply.If large cooperative farms are encouraged and farming cooperatives can form a federation, it should be possible to plan what to produce and how much to produce depending on the demand. Only such solutions can solve the problems of the farmers and prevent them from committing suicides."

591f62b47be9e025a5d4dbcc,India set to go  on organic diet,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521019/india-set-go-organic-diet.html,2016-01-03,,Deccan Herald,"Mamta Bhardwaj Jan 04, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTOne of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under organic certification, India has an organic food market estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."
591fba827be9e025a5d51795,"FM hits back at Rahul, says NDA has brought down inflation",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560718/fm-hits-back-rahul-says.html,2016-07-28,,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jul 28, 2016, PTI 20:16 ISTHitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today reeled out statistics in Lok Sabha to assert that the NDA government had brought down inflation and expressed hope that prices of essential commodites will come down further after a ""good"" monsoon.After Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the government had failed to control prices, particularly of the essential commodities, Jaitley contended that the NDA government had inherited high inflation from the UPA dispensation.""Any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics,"" he told the Congress Vice President while intervening in a debate on price rise and asked him to compare the status of inflation during the UPA government and that prevailing now.Referring to Gandhi's attack on Modi for criticising the then Congress-led government over inflation in February 2014, Jaitley said, ""This is a topic of statistics and not sloganeering. The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

Urad and tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and 75 in February 2014, has gone up to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month.In a dig at the NDA government's second ""happy birthday"" celebrations, the Congress Vice President said the Prime Minister did not even utter a single word about rising prices during this event and sought to know why he did that.Accusing the government of waiving Rs 52,000 crore of the corporates, Gandhi asked what benefit the government has given to the farmers and housewives of the savings amounting Rs 2 lakh crore it has made from the slump in the crude prices.He also questioned the NDA's flagship programmes like Make in India, Stand Up India and said ""the 'Make in India' programme has not got given a single job to the youth.""Gandhi said the price of pulses and vegetables have gone over the roof after the NDA came to power and the farmers have not been able to get any benefit of the steep rise in the price of these commodities.Recalling Modi's speech at a poll rally in Himachal Pradesh in February 2014, Gandhi said while attacking the then UPA government over the issue, he had said said that 'ma- bachche raat raat rote hain, aasoon pee ke sote hain' (mother and child cry the whole night and sleep drinking the tears).""What a dialogue,"" Gandhi said thrice, taking a dig at Modi who was not present in the House.""I want to remind the Prime Minister of the promises he made to the people of the country during the poll campaign, which Modiji does not talk about now and has forgotten. He had also promised that when the BJP government comes to power, it will bring down the prices,"" Gandhi said.He said there was a gap between the minimum support price for tur dal given to the farmers was Rs 45 whereas its price in the market was Rs 75. Now, the MSP has risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulses was now Rs 180.""So, there is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government. Where is this Rs 100 going,"" Gandhi asked.""People in villages are chanting a new slogan, 'Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi"", Rahul said winding up his speech.Under the Modi government, Rahul said, dal prices have risen 120 per cent.""During the Congress government the difference between the MRP (Maximum Retail Price) and the market price was Rs 30, but today it is Rs 130,"" the Congress vice president said.Rahul declared that the Modi government should name a date when the prices of vegetable and dals will come back down to normal levels. ""This is a very serious matter and the truth is you can't make false promises about this,"" he added."

Leave that job of chowkidari to the Congress, Gandhi said.Rahul took swipes at PM Modi, saying now people are saying Arhar Modi' instead of Har Har Modi.The Congress vice-president listed down how the cost of tomatoes, urad and tur dal have shot up over 100 per cent since the time NDA came in to power.You may make as many hollow promises as you want, but give us a date by when the prices of daal will come down,Rahul said.Here is how Twitter reacted to his speech:# This afternoon I listened to the speech of Rahul Gandhi. I must say he is a great stress buster! Somehow his very sight sets me laughing.This afternoon I listened to the speech of Rahul Gandhi. I must say he is a great stress buster!

This is the geography of the 49 years old Kinathukadavu Assembly Constituency, which came to existence in 1967. Of course delimitations have taken place over the years.So far, only the All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) have been successful in this constituency that has seen 11 assembly elections till 2011. AIADMK has been the most successful party as their candidates have been elected as MLA seven times including hat-trick victories by the sitting MLA S. Damodaran from 2001.But, over the years many woes of the people in this semi urban assembly segment has not seen a solution and in fact they seem to be on the rise.Dump yardThe key issue is dumping 850 tonnes of garbage that Coimbatore Corporation is dumping at the 650 acre Vellalore dump yard every day.It is affecting residents of that town panchayat and Podanur. Even water from borewells 1 km away is yellow and is not potable, says organiser of Vellalore Dump Yard Opposition Committee J. Daniel Jesudas.People suffer breathing difficulty and other ailments in this region.While it will take decades for repairing the damage caused by this dump yard both leading parties dont seem to have understood the magnitude of the issue and demands of the people here. AIADMK candidate A. Shanmugam said Amma has taken steps for redressing this grievance.DMK candidate Kurichi Prabakaran said that Kalaignar in his manifesto announced garbage segregation and electricity generation from the yard without affecting people.On the other hand, Marumalarchi Dravida Munetra Kazhagam candidate V. Eswaran has been fighting for the cause and has even filed a case before the Green Tribunal in 2012.The other important issue is the encroachment of revenue lands and areas close to the forest by educational institutions, agricultural lands and thousands of houses, affecting the course of canals. It has reflected with groundwater depletion and increase in man-animal conflicts.Sadly, candidates of leading parties are not taking up this issue as it would turn into negative votes.Proposal to lay the GAIL pipeline will affect nearly 1,500 farmers in the assembly. Petroleum companies are planning to lay more pipelines for other projects through a vast stretch of agricultural lands in this constituency. We want a representative who will raise his voice in the assembly. This has not happened in the last five years, P. Kandhasamy, State general secretary of farmers association said.Tomato cultivation is widely done at Kinathukadavu and nearby areas rain shadow regions.Farmers are dependent on rain-fed irrigation and expect steady viable price for their produce and units to be established to make value added products that will fetch them a good price.Improving ground water availability would make irrigation possible round the year.Thousands of people from Kinathukadavu worked in large numbers in the industrial units at Kurichi and Malumichampatti SIDCO industrial estates.But, many have lost their jobs due to various reasons that affected the industries there and want these units to be revived and to create more jobs.Speedy completion of the broad gauge conversion between Coimbatore and Pollachi, and establishing more railway stations on this stretch, mending damaged village roads and starting mini bus connectivity between the villages were other important demands of Kinathukadavu assembly segment."

Around six lakh people were affected by floods in Allahabad, reports said.As the floodwater entered thousands of houses trapping the inmates inside, the administration sought help of the IAF personnel to drop food packets and water bottles in the affected areas. In Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ganga was flowing 121 cm above the danger mark and its water has entered many localities in the town. Its tributaries Varuna and Assi were also flowing above danger marks. Boats have been plying in dense localities in the town.Movement of vehicles on the Mirzapur-Allahabad highway came to a halt after floodwater damaged the roads at many places. Teams of National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in the flood-affected districts.Gives birth on boatIn Banda district of Bundelkhand region, a woman gave birth on a boat late on Monday while being taken to hospital. Shankarpurwa, the village which the woman belongs to, was marooned owing to floods.The state government has directed district magistrates to visit the flood-affected areas and monitor the relief and rescue operations.Officials have been asked to coordinate relief efforts with the IAF personnel.The toll in the flood related incidents has gone up to 30. Two people drowned in Ken river after their car was swept away in Banda district on Tuesday, sources said.Vegetable prices skyrocket after floodsEven though the Ganga and its tributariesSone and Punpunhave started showing a receding trend in the last 36 hours, vegetable prices in and around the state capital have skyrocketed, DHNS reports from Patna.The reason is that a large part of the diara areas (riverine belt) and surrounding villages in central Bihar, which grow huge quantity of vegetables, remain largely submerged due to swollen rivers. This has resulted in leafy vegetables going out of stock. The prices of those which are available like ladies finger, brinjal, tomato, parwal, green chillies and coriander have increased by 30 to 50%.The steep hike is primarily because the vegetable-producing areas like Fatuha, Bakhtiyarpur and Raghopur remain submerged due to the overflowing Ganga and its tributaries. Patna is like a saucer. It is surrounded by three rivers with Ganga/Gandak on the north, Sone in the west and Punpun in the south. With all the rivers in spate, most of thevegetable- producing areas are underwater, explained Suresh Kumar, a retailer."

However, not many state governments have evinced an interest as they are not keen to add to the list of items sold through the public distribution system. Only four states Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Maharashtra have lifted some quantity of pulses from the buffer stock.The Centre has offered to supply unmilled toor dal at Rs 66 per kg and urad at Rs 82 per kg to state governments with a directive against selling it beyond Rs 120 per kg."

""The rule on creamy layer is in place since UPA rule in 2004. You are painting a wrong picture...we are just following the same rule,"" he said, adding that the BJP and the NDA government are committed towards reservation for OBCs.Home Minister Rajnath Singh clarified that information is sought from OBC candidates about creamy layer to avoid court cases by other candidates. ""Their interests are not harmed. It is sought to avoid litigation,"" he said.Singh assured that he was ready to get the issue examined, even though there was no confusion.Some members claimed that following the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations, children of government employees working in the lower rung cannot make it to services like IAS and IPS as the income criteria in the creamy layer formula creates hindrances.Hukum Deo Narain Yadav (BJP) said the National Commission for Backwards should be granted constitutional status to give it more teeth in tackling cases of violation of OBC rights.K C Venugopal (Cong) raised the issue of price rise and said there is a ""general feeling"" that the ""government is not taking enough steps"" to curb inflation. While diesel, petrol and kerosene price are already high, prices of other essential commodities are set to go up during festival season, he said.Demanding a short duration discussion on price rise, he said prices of pulses to tomatoes have exceeded their average rates from 40 to 130 per cent.Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (BJP) said some academic institutions have done away with five per cent reservation for children of Kashmiri migrants and demanded action against such institutes by the HRD Ministry.Sanjay Jaiswal (BJP) lamented that Health Minister J P Nadda has not come up with a statement on reports that NEET paper were up for sale.Maintaining that there was a need to hold the entrance exams in a transparent way, he said ""If need be, they should be held again"" and claimed that students were being made to pay anything from Rs 10 lakh to 50 lakh for leaked question papers."

Their votes will go to the one local community leaders will suggest. We dont know which symbol stands for which party. Our village headman will advise us on whom to vote, admitted Jyotilal Hansda, a land tiller hailing from the Santhal community. He was speaking for his wife, Hela, and his son, Karmu, who will be voting for the first time this year. Jyotilal and his familys immediate concerns are four square meals. Their source of subsistence is a kind of gruel, made of steamed rice kept overnight in a bowl of water.The accompaniment is often one burnt tomato mashed in with chillies, both vegetables grown in the familys less than half an acre plot. As Jyotilal talked to Deccan Herald on a searing hot, summer afternoon, slurping in his share of the gruel from a plastic bowl, he said that things have always been like this for them.The village headmen instructed which symbol to cast their vote for and they pressed the button next to the suggested symbol, be it the twin flowers and a blade of grass, representing Trinamool Congress, the hammer-sickle-star of the Left or the Congresss upright palm. Jyotilal, however, finds the reigning government acceptable ever since Mamata started providing rice at Rs 2 a kg. Proper roads snaking through the village, an electricity connection, which keeps the two LED lamps, also a part of the governments largesse, and a deep tube-well that mostly provides clean water, have made him believe that this government is good. Now weve the things we need the most. The field provides us with basic vegetables and the nearby ration shop supplies us a monthly quota of 15 Kg rice at Rs 2, he said. Waving her arms around the singe-storey house, with two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, Hela pointed at the walls and talked of how the house with public funds have helped her family survive the extreme temperatures of Purulia, where on summer days the mercury often touches 47 degrees Celsius and in winters it dips down to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius.Even though the house has been built under Indira Awas Yojana, a Central government scheme, she and Jyotilal believe the present government is to be thanked.Baleshwar Majhi, a landless worker mostly dependent on 100 days work under MGNREGA, however, does not seem happy with Mamata.Although not sure who Mamata is, he does not believe she has done much for people like him. Theres hardly any work available. We wish the government arranged for more work, he said. Like most men from his community, he finds solace in drinking undistilled country liquor, made by fermenting day-old rice in water. Political developments mean nothing for him and he does not know of the changes around, he admitted.I have never even seen this man in my life, he said, pointing at a poster of Nepal Mahato, the sitting Congress MLA, who is fighting to retain his seat. When posed the question to him, he asked, Who should I vote for? The village headman, who did not want to be named, admitted that most voters in the area are like Jyotilal and Baleshwar. Affiliated to the Congress, he hopes the villagers will cast for the symbol of his choice and help his candidate regain the seat.DH News Service"

More than a dozen Congress MLAs and 25 former MLAs and Ministers took part in the march.Rohtak Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was also present.The BJP government in Haryana has been facing major opposition to its recently-launched crop insurance scheme from the Opposition, including the Indian National Lok Dal. The scheme purportedly aimed at protecting the interests of the farmers is, ironically, being opposed by farmers as well at some places.Saying that the march on Saturday was just a warning to the BJP government to mend its anti-farmer ways, Mr. Hooda said, adding that the scheme was being imposed on the farmers without their consent and premium was being directly deducted from their accounts. The terms and conditions of the scheme are all anti-farmers. It is a scheme to benefit the private insurance agencies and not the farmers. The BJP government in Haryana is acting on the behalf of these companies instead of protecting the interests of the farmers. They cannot do this, said Mr. Hooda.The scheme treats a village as a unit, which puts the farmer at a disadvantage while the premium is being collected from all the farmers. If the government claims to be pro-farmer, it must pay the entire premium and insure the farmers, demanded Mr. Hooda.He said that farmers in the State were in a bad shape and not getting adequate price for their produce. Blaming the BJP government for their plight, Mr. Hooda said that though the prices of agricultural produce such as tomatoes, paddy, cotton and onion had nose-dived, the end consumers were not getting it at any cheaper rates.He said that all sections of the society had become fed up with the government and had lost all hopes. The BJP government came to power both at Centre and in State making a host of promises, but they have failed to deliver on them. But now the masses had no hope from them. They have lost all hopes, said Mr. Hooda.The Congress leaders later submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Governor, to the Karnal Deputy Commissioner demanding that the scheme be immediately withdrawn."

PTI photo Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha, Thursday. PTI photoTAKING ON Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the rise in the prices of pulses, vegetables and other essential commodities, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the government of having made false promises and sought a definite date for when inflation will be controlled.You may make as many shallow promises as you want but give us a date by when the prices of dal will come down, Rahul said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on price rise initiated by CPI(M) floor leader P Karunakaran. This was his first intervention in the current session. The Prime Minister was, however, not present in the House.The Modi government celebrated its second happy birthday a few days back. While addressing the people, he spoke about Make in India, Connect India, Digital India, but he does not talk about price rise. Not once did he talk about pulses, potatoes and tomatoes, Rahul said.He also referred to the BJP poll slogan  Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi  to take a dig at the Prime Minister. A new slogan is now getting popular in the villages: Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, he said.The Congress leader said that in 2014, a kilo of tomato cost Rs 18, which, he added, has now gone up to Rs 55. Urad and Tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and Rs 75 respectively in February 2014, have risen to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month, he added. Rahul further said that when the minimum support price (MSP) for Tur dal was Rs 45, its market value was Rs 75. MSP has now risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulse is 180. There is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government, he said, seeking to know were this over Rs 100 was going. He alleged that the government had waived off Rs 52,000 crore owed by corporates and wondered what it had given farmers and housewives from the Rs 2 lakh crore it had saved due to a slump in crude prices.Watch Video: Whats making newsHitting back, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said such issues are settled through policies and not by setting dates. You are talking about a government (UPA) which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts. This is a matter of statistics and not sloganeering, he said.On Rahuls reference to prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said sarcastically, everybody seems to be going to market everyday. He claimed that the Modi Government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country had seen a negative WPI inflation.The finance minister asserted that the NDA government had brought down prices and expressed the hope that with a good monsoon this year, prices would further reduce. He acknowledged that high prices of pulses remained a matter of concern but pointed out that steps were afoot to reduce the gap between demand and supply. He said India produced the maximum amount of pulses, recorded their highest consumption and imported the maximum amount. While the demand was for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes. He said the production of pulses was expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5922dff97be9e01fd59ac29d,A tale of parched Maharashtra village: Each family in Shilatane village spends Rs 100 a day to buy water,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/waterless-maharashtra-pune-water-buy-expensive-parched-each-family-in-shilatane-village-spends-rs-100-a-day-to-buy-water-2814250/,2016-05-23,,Indian Express,"Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day. Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day.AS ONE enters the village Shilatane, around 50 kms from Pune, a prominent sight that meets ones eyes are large-size blue colour barrels placed outside each house. Since past three months, the dwellers of this village have been buying water, spending Rs 50 for each barrel that can store 200 litre of water. On an average, a family buys at least two barrels of water; the number varies if the members in the family are more.Ask Nanda Vilas Chavan, a housewife, whos busy pouring water into a small vessel from one of the barrels, about the water situation in her village, and she responds, Although we have been using water judiciously for last three months, we need at least two barrels of water every day, given that we have five members in the family. A barrel comes for Rs 50 and thus, we end up spending Rs 100 every day. The amount is not easy to shell out as our only source of income is agriculture, which is also badly affected by water shortage.Asha Vijay Bhanusghare, another woman says, Our entire monthly budget has got disturbed. We are spending Rs 3,000 to 4,000 every month only on water. Its a basic necessity for survival and one cannot cut costs here. And so even though we are reducing our expenses in other areas, we are keeping aside this amount every month.The village, which has a population of 2,500 people, is one of the 40 villages that are located around River Indrayani, which is currently completely dry. The river originates in Kurvande village, near Lonavala. The sarpanch of the village Shilatane, Hemant Shivaji Bhanusghare, informs that the rivers water dried in January itself and since then, the water condition has been bad.The villagers, he says, depend on Indrayani for water needed for agriculture and their cattle. It is not the first time that it has happened. This is a struggle we face every year. Hence, all the farmers have shifted to single crops, he says, adding, Theres nothing we can do after January. You can find barren farm lands across this area. The drinking water through water pipeline connected to Pavana Dam is supplied to all villages once in four days. Around 40,000 litre of water cannot last for four days in a village that has 2,500 people. The situation of houses that are situated on the higher side is worse because the water pressure is so low that it cannot reach them. People have no choice but to buy water from the tankers. The villagers are taking their cattle 2 km away from village for water. Even the milk production of cows and buffaloes has reduced due to shortage of fodder and water, he says.Chandrakant Andre, a farmer, shares that in comparison to previous years, when he grew potato, tomato, onion and sugarcane, now he grows just one crop in a year as there is no water for agriculture, which has reduced his annual income. Andre says he is waiting for rains, after which he will sow either jawar or chana.Prafull Kadam, a water activist who works in the area, cites that while Valvan Dam is just six kms from the village, the village gets water from Pavana Dam, which is 16-17 km away. Till 18-20 years ago, the Tata firm that owns the Valvan Dam would leave water in Indrayani river during summers. Later, they shifted focus to hydroelectricity and hence, stopped leaving water. And then began our sufferings. Its sad that people with limited income have to buy water especially when the state water policy GR states that drinking water should be given priority, says Kadam.Kadam says that though people suggest watershed as a possible solution, it doesnt have much scope at this time of the year for various reasons.

Edna Pesis (left) and Susan Luria.After drip irrigation-cum-fertigation, tissue culture and protected cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers, dissemination of Israeli post-harvest know-how is the latest focus of the Indo-Israel Agricultural Project (IIAP).Value-addition in horticultural crops is not just about processing and selling juices. It is also about technologies to maintain the quality of fresh produce for delivering in that form to consumers in distant locations or to harvest, say, pomegranates in September for selling in the US or Europe during the Christmas and New Year season, points out Susan Lurie, professor emeritus at the Department of Postharvest Science of Fresh Produce in the Agricultural Research Organization of Israels Ministry of Agriculture.Israel, according to her, has lot to offer to India when it comes to preservation of quality  texture, appearance, colour, taste, aroma, and nutritional and health attributes  of fresh farm produce, especially for exports to foreign markets.Most of what we produce  from cherry tomatoes and capsicum to mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, lychees, guavas and papayas  is for selling outside Israel. Unlike us, India is big and more like the US, where they grow in California to sell in New York or Boston. Theres no reason you cannot do the same here, which is where we can help, adds Lurie.Edna Pesis, an expert from the same department that is said to be the worlds largest research centre for post-harvest management, illustrates this through the example of mangoes. Mangoes are susceptible to diseases after harvest and prolonged storage, as a result of psychological changes occurring in the fruits that enable fungal pathogen development.An effective means to address the problem is through hot water brushing treatment  spraying a jet of water at about 52 degrees Celsius for 15-20 seconds on the harvested fruits in packing lines. This is followed by drying and waxing or wrapping the fruits with a layer of organic/synthetic waxing material. Hot water brushing significantly reduces decay from fungal development, while waxing prevents water loss that leads to shrinkage and premature ripening of the fruits. Both together help improve the keeping quality and general appearance of the mangoes in supermarket shelves.These apart, there are also other technologies like modified atmosphere packaging that involves covering the fresh produce with special permeable plastic films to reduce humidity. Fruits and vegetables are naturally respiring products, resulting in the condensation of their vapours into water and lowering shelf life. The mistake many people do is to take the harvested fruits directly to the cold storage. Doing that can cause not only shrinkage, but also makes the fruits prone to scalding and chilling injury, explains Pesis.The two Israeli women scientist-experts are part of a visiting team under the IIAP, a programme currently operational in nine states: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. We are now extending this to six other states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Mizoram and Goa, says Dan Alluf, Counsellor (Science & Agriculture) with Mashav, Israels Agency for International Development Corporation.The IIAP, which is a joint collaboration between Mashav and the Indian governments Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture plus the participating states, is being implemented via centres of excellence.Currently, there are 14 such fully active centres: four in Maharashtra (for citrus, pomegranate, and Alphonso and Kesar mangoes), three in Haryana (vegetables, citrus, pomegranate and mango), two in Gujarat (Kesar mango and vegetables), two in Rajasthan (pomegranate and citrus), two in Punjab (vegetables and citrus) and one in Tamil Nadu (vegetables).The programme began in 2009. Our aim is to have 26 centres of excellence in all the participating states, which would act as the catalyst for showcasing Israeli agricultural technology/know-how and taking these to farmers fields. The new areas we are looking at are post-harvest management, water recycling for agricultural use, agricultural machinery and organic farming, informs Alluf.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
592312cf7be9e01fceefed9d,"There's no place like home, even in the Chernobyl disaster zone",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/542440/theres-no-place-like-home.html,2016-04-24,,Deccan Herald,"By Matthias Williams, CHERNOBYL, Ukraine, April 24, 2016, (Reuters): 14:58 ISTMaria Lozbin was one of tens of thousands of people to be evacuated from their homes after the Chernobyl accident in April 1986, but returned with her family six years ago, to live off the land inside a 30 km (19 mile) exclusion zone where the risk of radiation poisoning remains.A 69-year-old with a ready laugh and a green shawl wrapped round her, Lobzin said the village to which she had been evacuated was full of drunks and drug addicts.The house into which she was moved was so shoddily constructed, with a huge crack running from the roof to the basement, that she was afraid of being killed or maimed by a falling object.""Living there was like waiting for death,"" she said.Now she lives with her son and his family back in Chernobyl, in a zone that can only be reached by crossing a checkpoint and where guides accompany curious tourists with radiation meters.By contrast, a deathly silence hangs over the nearby abandoned town of Prypyat, where a rusting fairground wheel, and a kindergarten with toys, dolls and small beds are a grim testimony to the scale and speed of the disaster.Lozbin keeps chickens, geese and ducks, grows potatoes and tomatoes, and goes foraging for mushrooms in nearby woods.""There is no radiation here. I'm not afraid of anything,"" she said. ""And when it's time for me to die, it won't happen because of radiation.""BIRD SONGTuesday marks the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine, caused by a botched safety test in the fourth reactor of the atomic plant that sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe.The disaster and the government's handling of it -- the evacuation order only came 36 hours after the accident -- highlighted the shortcomings of the Soviet system with its unaccountable bureaucrats and entrenched culture of secrecy.Mikhail Gorbachev has since said he considered Chernobyl one of the main nails in the coffin of the Soviet Union which eventually collapsed in 1991.The accident killed 31 right away and forced tens of thousands to flee. The final death toll of those killed by radiation-related illnesses such as cancer is subject to debate.A Greenpeace report ahead of the anniversary cites a Belarusian study estimating the total cancer deaths from the disaster at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation's estimate of 9,000.The Greenpeace study also said people living in the area continue to eat and drink foods with dangerously high radiation levels.In particular, ""the 30 km exclusion zone around the Chernobyl reactor remains highly contaminated and unsuitable to live in,"" it said.But that matters little to Lozbin, one of around 160 people estimated to have returned to the zone. ""What's there to be afraid of?"" said Maria's daughter-in-law Oleksandra Lozbin.""I don't want to go to Kiev. Why would I leave such nature? Where could you hear cuckoos? Where could you hear the nightingale?""Oleksandra's husband, who grew up in a village 7 km away, started coming to Chernobyl in short bursts starting in 2008 and the family settled back there permanently in 2010.""My husband had wanted to come back to his homeland all his life,"" she said. ""He came back when it was all closed here, when it was prohibited to come here. He crossed through barbed wire.""Oleksandra said police initially tried to force them to leave, but the family refused.Oleksandra hopes to inspire others to move back. To remind people what life was like before the accident, the family has created a makeshift museum in a house across the street with objects collected from nearby abandoned cottages.There are books, a doll in a cot, a rusty wheel, an abacus, and a black-and-white photo of two people. One day, she hopes, someone might see it and recognize their great-grandparents.""We decided to save the history of Chernobyl,"" she said. ""We hope that people will come back here and will live here, and their children and grandchildren will see what life was like here, in what kind of cots people were raised here, in what kind of boxes people stored their personal belongings and books.""On a bench lies a Soviet newspaper from Jan. 24 1986, four months before the disaster. The front page headline reads: ""No to nuclear testing""."

Express Avtar Singh with his cotton and cucumber crop. ExpressEven as concern over declining water table and over exploitation of water in Punjab for paddy continues to grow, some farmers in the state are adopting innovative techniques to save water.Avtar Singh, a farmer based in Pandwa village in Phagwara has inter-cropped cotton crop with cucumbers and is practicing capillary action irrigation which also helps in conserving water. Last year, he had inter cropped cotton with maize which, he claims, doubled the yield.He irrigates his fields after every two weeks, helping him save a lot of water which would otherwise have been used to flood the land.Cotton is deep rooted and a long duration crop. It does not need much water but Punjab farmers are in habit of flooding fields, he said. Judicious use of water never came to them naturally. We have inter cropped cotton with cucumber. We are not directly irrigating cotton but instead, focussing on cucumber. The water that seeps into the soil also reaches the cotton crop. Also, through bed plantation, more water is saved.Last year, he harvested 15quintal per acre of cotton compared to the 8 quintal per acre that most other farmers, who used conventional methods, got.This year picking would be even better. I have adopted concept of bio-diversity in agriculture. Farmers need to go the way nature wants and monoculture (growing single crop) is nowhere in nature. I have noticed that cotton balls are thicker if grown like this. Growing cucumber has also controlled pests and no whitefly or bollworms have infected my crop, he added.Paramjit Singh Gill from village Chungawan of Moga cultivated red garlic, a crop that is not familiar to Punjab, and has reaped profit of Rs 1 lakh per acre. Gill said, I got this variety from Jammu and Kashmir and is grown mostly in hilly areas. Punjab farmers are unaware of any garlic except white ones. This variety gives dark pinkish fruit commonly known as red garlic in J&K. Compared to Rs 25,000 per acre saved in paddy/wheat cultivation, I am saving Rs 1 lakh/acre.Another farmer, Sukhvir Singh from village Sampla in Fatehgarh Sahib has grown onions on seven acres, muskmelon on five acres, tomatoes on two acres, chillies on two acres and pumpkin (used for sweets) on one acre. It was always a risky decision to give up paddy farming but now my farm is giving me Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakh profit.Swaran Singh Mann, assistant director horticulture said, It is always advisable to grow two or more crops together. Farmers are now opting for strawberries, papaya, guavas, peaches etc which consume less water than paddy.Dr SS Kukal, additional director research (natural resources and plant health management), Punjab Agricultural University, said, It is absolutely right that inter-cropping cotton with vegetables is best way for natural farming and saving water. With capillary action, water that seeps inside soil will come up and replenish soil. Cotton will not need separate irrigation. It saves almost 90% water and higher yield.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Bengaluru woke up to the Independence Day Flower Show which began at Lalbagh Botanical Garden on Saturday.The Israeli mist technology only bettered the experience. On a rather sultry afternoon on the inaugural day, one could enjoy the cooling effect enabled by the technology. The mist not only ensures lower temperature inside the Glass House and keeps the flowers fresh for long but also prevents dust from rising in the air.The Parliament House, which has been replicated with over four lakh roses, is the primary attraction of the event. The first day saw professional photographers and hobbyists gather at the Glass House to click photographs. Visitors taking selfie was a common sight. Chrysanthemum flowers only brightened the charm of the place. Orchids, roses, anthurium, poinsettias, pentas carnea, gerbera, carnations, fuchsia, beginia... there were too many varieties of flowers to count.I have been coming to the flower show for four years now, and its getting better with each passing year. The creativity of these florists must be lauded, remarked Shylaja who had come with her five-year-old son.Right at the entrance is a dancing peacock made of capsicum and tomatoes with a glitter of gold on it. A walk on the side of the lawns gives a glimpse of petunia flowers. A huge flora cascade, right outside the Glass House, is another crowd-pleaser.If one thought radish would could be about the size of a palm, a visit to Lalbagh could change the perspective. A root, 1.6 feet long, weighing over a kilo and grown in Bengaluru, is on display at the exhibition hall. A bunch of plantains weighing 89 kg from Hulimavu is also on display.Students from the Horticulture Training Institute are lending a helping hand to those who want to grow what they eat. They have put on display a variety of vegetables that can be cultivated in pots. The students were guiding visitors on how to grow crops at home.This years show, organised by the Department of Horticulture and the Mysore Horticultural Society, is a tribute to Dr M H Marigowda, considered the Father of Horticulture in India, whose birth centenary falls on August 8. A sand sculpture of Dr Marigowda and an exclusive stall on his achievements have been set up.Horticulture Minister S S Mallikarjun, who inaugurated the flower show, said that Cubbon Park and Lalbagh would be beautified further. Four other botanical gardens have been planned in the state, he added.On the first day, nearly 13,000 people visited the flower show, including 8,750 adults, 243 children and 3,500 pass holders, said a senior official in the Horticulture Department."

But before those greens reached the markets, farmers had to grow them with all the attendant problems. Did that complex process involve irrigation with highly polluted water sourced from the citys lakes and river streams?It is a tough, but heavily loaded question. Loaded, because repeated studies by city-based universities and scientific institutions have clearly indicated heavy metal contamination in vegetables sold in big markets across Bengaluru.Irrigated by sewage-fed lake water on agricultural land, contamination of the greens has been proved beyond doubt. Analyzing samples of water, soil and crop plants, the tests have shown significant traces of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in the greens that directly influence our food chain.ContaminationTwelve years ago, when the Bellandur lakes pollution levels were high but not at todays alarming levels, a Bangalore University study had shown high heavy metal contamination in vegetables grown in the vicinity. The impact of the lakes polluted water on vegetation was found to be much more than soil.Incessant flow of untreated sewage from multiple inlets, encroachment and wide-spread development have effectively killed vegetable farming in Bellandur. Cultivation has gradually shifted to Varthur and Hoodi lakebeds on the downstream.But here lies the big problem: Highly polluted water from Bellandur flows into the downstream lakes, contaminating the ground water as well. It is mostly this water that is being drilled out through borewells by the farmers.As if this is not hazardous enough, the vegetables are also washed with the lake water before they are loaded onto distribution trucks.Their produce is supplied to vegetable markets in Marathahalli, KR Puram, Whitefield, HAL and other areas within a 20km radius. At the HAL market, for instance, supplies start at around 3 am. Enquiries reveal that most vegetables are sourced from farms in Hoodi, Kadugodi, Varthur and other areas.Customers unawareNot many customers are aware of this supply chain, although most retailers feign ignorance about the irrigation methods for fear of losing clients.Nirupam, a customer, says he has been buying vegetables from the HAL market for nearly a decade. But he admits he had never asked where the greens came from.In recent years, say the retailers, supplies from Varthur side have been declining as farms are being traded for real estate. Huge apartment blocks and malls have come up on once fertile lands. To compensate the shortfall, supplies often come from KR Market.Yet, that is not a safe bet. An ongoing study by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (Atree) has already indicated contamination in vegetables grown in the command area of the Byramangala tank on the Vrushabhavathi river.Vrushabhavathi pollutionOver the last three years, tests on water and soil samples collected from the area growing babycorn have shown accumulation of heavy metals, as Atree researcher Priyanka informs. Heavily polluted with industrial effluents and untreated domestic sewage, the Vrushabhavathi river feeds this water directly into the Byramangala tank.Babycorn cultivation has graduated to tomatoes and other vegetables in recent months. These greens make their way to the KR Market and Kalasipalyam outlets, eventually heading to other vegetable bazaars in the city interior.Heavy metal contamination of water can be effectively tracked only with 24-hour sampling, says Priyanka.For the study on Vrushabhavathi, the water was measured day and night. Heavy metal traces were found to peak during the night.This is a clear indication that industrial effluents are being discharged after dusk to hoodwink the agencies.Stringent quality testsThe message is clear: The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) needs to change its water quality monitoring protocol. Atree is now in talks with the Board to make the testing more scientific and stringent. Its data analysis on Vrishabhavathi and Byramangala tank is also being shared with KSPCB.But water quality monitoring is only a part of the mechanism to prevent health hazards of irrigation with sewage-fed water. Soil and plant quality are equally critical. The University study showed that the presence of cadmium in spinach (4 mg g-1) and radish (2.5 mg g-1) is way beyond the acceptable standards."

Traders warn of difficult days ahead if the vegetable stock continues to shrink.The supply of vegetables to KR Puram market, a major market in Bengaluru, has been declining for the last two weeks. If the market received 200-300 tonnes of vegetables per day earlier, the supply has come down to just 50-60 tonnes now, traders say.KR Puram Market Association president, Yele Srinivas, said the market received vegetables from Kolar, Mandya, Srinivasapur, Hosur, Krishnagiri and the surrounding places. Tomato supply has been particularly hit. Earlier, we would get 5,000 bags of tomatoes but now we get just 2,000, he said, urging the state government to use alternative options as the vegetable shortage was likely to persist.Kalasipalyam, one of the largest wholesale markets in the city, is also facing shortage of vegetables. Wholesale traders said the number of vegetable trucks making trips to the market had come down from 100 to just 25 in the last one week.Biggest supplierKolar is the biggest supplier of tomatoes to Bengaluru. There has been no supply from there for the last 20 days. We are procuring tomatoes from Maharashtra, said Vegetable Merchants Association president, R V Gopi. Fortunately, the supply of fruits has not been affected, he said.Anthony, a vegetable wholesaler from Bazaar Street, Yeshwantpur, said that he was procuring 100 kg of beans every day from Kalasipalyam, down from 200 kg earlier.Tomatoes, which cost Rs 10 per kg in wholesale markets earlier, are now priced at Rs 40. The prices of beans have gone up from Rs 35-40 to Rs 70 and carrots from Rs 20 to Rs 40.

Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."

But surprisingly this time, veggie prices have fallen owing to increased production and arrivals in the markets.A kilogram of tomato is now priced at Rs 6 to Rs 8 in wholesale markets, while carrots, beans and brinjals cost about Rs 20-25. Capsicum and potatoes are priced at Rs 15 and Rs 20, respectively. Exactly a year ago, their prices during the same period had spiked, with tomato priced at Rs 20 and beans Rs 40 per kilo.Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Association president R V Gopi said carrots were priced at Rs 40 in March last year and the cost of other veggies too had increased by 10-20 per cent.This time, however, the prices have fallen, especially in the past week. Last week, one kilogram of tomato was priced at Rs 15, but now it is available at Rs 8 and even Rs 5 in the market.He said the main reason for the low prices was the increase in the arrival of vegetables.Last year, there was a decrease in the crop arrivals and hence the prices had gone up. For consumers, it is a good news this time, but for farmers it is a loss.G M Diwakar from SKR Market Traders Association said it was just the beginning of summer season and there were chances of veggie prices doubling in the next four months.Generally, the prices increase between April and July. Last year, there was no rainfall and hence the prices had increased. It takes three months for crop yield and this time, there has been sufficient rainfall. But when the actual summer sets in, then the prices may increase."

5923bb327be9e01fcef057b4,RBI should go for low interest rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/537652/rbi-should-go-low-interest.html,2016-03-30,,Deccan Herald,"Upendra Goel Mar 31, 2016, 0:01 ISTOnly growth has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and boost Make In India programme too.Growth can waitseems to be the favourite refrain of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait. The aspirati-ons of a billion people also cant.(The writer is a technocrat and a small-scale entrepreneur based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh)"

However, there is some good news, too  the fruit will be much sweeter this summer.Grape production has come down by 15 to 20 per cent in the areas the fruit is grown in Bengaluru Rural such as Devanahalli, Doddaballapur, Nelamanagala and Hoskote, according to the Horticulture department officials.The area under grape cultivation has also reduced, say officials. Devanahalli and Doddaballapur, which register maximum grape cultivation, have seen a decline this year.Last year, the area under grape cultivation was 2,300 hectares in Devanahalli, but this year, it has come down to 2,150 hectares. In Doddaballapur, too, the area under cultivation has reduced from 80 acres to 15 acres, said a Bengaluru Rural Horticulture department official.The heavy November downpour destroyed seedless varieties of grapes, which are harvested only once a year. The area of cultivation has also come down as farmers indulged in growing vegetables such as pole beans, tomatoes and other leafy vegetables this year. They also grew guava and flowers, especially Marigold. In Doddaballapur, many farmers are a part of the mango cultivation and expansion programme and this has resulted in the reduction of the area under grape cultivation, the official added.Speaking to Deccan Herald, K M Parashivamurthy, Additional Director (Fruits and Floriculture), Horticulture Department, said the total area under grape cultivation in Karnataka is 20,000 hectares, of which 2,500 hectares is in Bengaluru Rural. The demand for wine grapes has increased because of the growing market for wine products. Farmers and wine companies have tie-ups, he added.Sweeter harvestS V Hittalmani, former additional director, Horticulture department, said the grape produce is sweeter this year due to the early onset of summer. Normally, grapes are grown in hot and dry regions. This time, because the heat was more, it has helped increase the sugar content in the fruit. As temperatures rise, the sweetness will also increase during the course of this summer, he said. Meanwhile, grape production has not taken a hit in north Karnataka regions such as Vijayapura, Bagalkot and Belagavi."

The second of outrage and indignation: look at them mourning a declared enemy of the state, look at them pelting stones at the army. The third is to fall back on the familiar, comforting narratives. Here, one has the luxury of drawing upon layers of sedimented common sense.When our group, Jamia Teachers Solidarity Association, was compiling cases of malicious frame-ups by the Delhi Polices elite Special Cell, we discovered that in 18 of the 23 cases the Special Cell had passed off Kashmiri businessmen, students, and sundry travellers passing through New Delhi as Hizb or Lashkar operatives.Who would after all raise doubts about these Kashmiris terrorist links? No one did. Between Kashmiri the terrorist and Kashmiri the stone pelter is a difference only of degree in our common sense. Both are ultimately unreasonably opposed to our nation. Both are prone to violence.What has been laid bare in the days past is the intimate link between gross institutionalised communal prejudice that exists in India and the militaristic response to Kashmir, of both, the state and its propaganda underlings, the assorted experts and TV anchors. Night after night, stars of television news scream into the camera that the stone-wielding teenager is either a shield for a terrorist who hides behind him or a Jihad-crazed maniac radicalised by a virulent form of Salafism which has supplanted the earlier gentler Sufi traditions.Nice, Syria, Bangladeshand preacher Zakir Naik thrown in for good measureare all linked up to proclaim the onset of a global jihadist project in the Valley. Leaders and anchors excoriate anyone grieving the blindings and the killings: troubled by blood on the paved road? Where is your patriotism and loyalty towards the uniformed men?The events of the past fortnight, the explanations and the manic commentary around it, hold up a mirror to us, not the Kashmiris. And the image in that mirror is grotesque. We have turned into primal hordes of automatons, exulting in blind jingoism. We are being asked to not feel pain. On the contrary, to take pride in these nationalist kills. We are being asked to abandon understanding, and empathy. We are not to ask why thousands of young people throng the graveyards to offer prayers for Burhan Wani. Indeed, it is not relevant to seek the roots of their rage, a rage so seething that it has inured them to all danger. What matters alone is that Kashmir remains the crowning glory of our sacred map.When an army veteran writes a letter to the dead Wani, warning himbut really, the warning is to those in the streets because the dead dont read lettersthat the Indian Army will kill you, he is talking to us too. He is asking us to corrode our humanity, to leach ourselves of any sensibilities. Death is all that they deserve, even desire. Even to those of us who may be ambivalent about the meanings and consequences of Azadi, it is obvious that Kashmir can only be held by force, awful brutal force.It is immaterial whether pellets can be substituted by a less lethal, non-lethal method of crowd management. Democracy in Kashmir will continue to be endless crowd management, and management of dead bodies and graves. Do we want blood on our hands? Remember that war always comes home. It brings with it its logic and symbols.Technicolour nationalismWhy has the prime minister called upon his workers to undertake tiranga yatras at this moment? The directions are quite specific: BJP leaders are expected to carry flags aloft on an 8-feet pole, ride a two-wheeler, and chant Bharat Mata ki Jai. It is to be a spectacle par excellence. This technicolour nationalism fluttering in the air is meant of course to validate the war in Kashmir, but also to protect the gau rakshak vigilantes who skin Dalits and lynch Muslims, to prepare us for a possible aerial bombing in Chhattisgarh, to render us quiescent in our own surveillance, to normalise, even legalise, communal profiling and to ratchet up the already skyrocketing defence budgets.Possibly at the very moment Wani was shot down by security agencies, I was reading a brief life sketch of Pt Rughonath Vaishnavi by his granddaughter, the anthropologist Mona Bhan. Vaishnavi was a vociferous advocate of Kashmiri nationalism.His paper Jamhoor (Democracy) was banned in 1952. Vaishnavi was jailed repeatedly over the next few years and his habeas corpus petition was rejected on grounds that the protection flowing from the Constitution were not available to him.His writings bear witness to midnight arrests and detentions of Kashmiri partisansthrown into dark cells without being assigned any reason. Vaishnavis life and writings force us to look at the past and our present anew, and to imagine possibilities other than those thrust on us. Is it not possible to excavate these histories, to complicate the army veterans understanding of Kashmir as an artificially manufactured conflict with no history and no legitimacy? Perhaps, it is possible to pause for a moment and turn off the jingoism and simply reflect on the unfolding tragedy.Let us not allow these deaths to become bald and sterile statistics. Let us not allow the Indian states hubris to blind us. Listen to what the Kashmiris are saying  not because it will change official policy, but because in that conversation lies our, and Indias redemption.(The writer is the author of Kafkaland: Prejudice, Law and Counterterrorism in India)"

Its true that urad dal price has shot up this week. The rates of all pulses have risen by at least Rs 5. And, it is likely to increase further in coming weeks, said an official adding that tur dal price per kilogramme on Friday was around Rs 140.However, price in the retail market was more than Rs 200 per kilogramme, admitted the official, adding that shortage of pulses has led to a rise in prices. Another official said vegetables too are witnessing a shortage and rise in prices. The supply of vegetables such as tomato, brinjal, potato is deficient. As a result, average price of vegetables has shot up to Rs 30-50 per kilogramme now, said the official adding the prices were between Rs 10 and Rs 30 per kilogramme in April. The vegetable prices are also likely to increase further, he said.Watch Video: Whats making newsOfficials attributed the shortage of pulses and vegetables to the drought resulting in low production across the state. While weather officials projected a good monsoon this year, its onset has been delayed.In the cabinet meeting earlier this week, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis directed the authorities to step up efforts to boost supply and check hoarding. A report tabled in the cabinet meeting stated that retail prices of vegetables have seen a 21-28 per cent jump in the past week.Fadnavis has directed Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat to rush to Delhi to convince the union government to okay a higher buffer stock of tur dal for the state. While the Maharashtra government had raised a demand that the Centre should release 20,000 metric tonnes of tur dal for the state, sources said the Centre has so far agreed to release just 700 metric tonnes.

The Khar police station registered a case against Mumbai-based Poncho Hospitality Pvt. Ltd, which owns and operates a quick service restaurant (QSR) chain under the brand name of Box8. Unknown employees of the company have been booked for offences affecting public health and safety under the Indian Penal Code.The incident occurred on Thursday afternoon during events organised by the India International Model United Nations (IIMUN), a non-political network of students. Nearly 4,000 students from different colleges were part of the seminar at four venues. About 1,000 consumed the lunch, police said.According to statements recorded by the police, the organizers said the food was manufactured and packed in Bandra Kurla Complex. Investigations, however, reveal the food came from Thane, said Police Inspector Dinesh Kadam of Khar police.We have not yet made any arrests. We are following logistics chain of the food unit and looking for lapses. Prima facie it appears the food was spoilt due to a delay but who is responsible has still not been revealed from our investigation, said a senior police officer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday carried out an inspection of Box8 factory in Thane from where the food parcels, containing rajma, rice and tomato curry, were prepared. We are inspecting how the food was prepared, if any sub-standard procedures were followed. The premises are being checked for hygiene, said Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner of Food at FDA.On Thursday, samples of food and vomit were collected from the event venue and sent for lab analysis at Kalina, police said.According to Jinay Sheth, a 15-year-old student from Green Lawns High School, he experienced stomach pain half-an-hour after lunch. He could smell something foul in the parcel but he was so hungry he did not suspect the food had gone stale, said his grandfather Mukesh Sheth.Jinay first later vomited. By 3.30 pm he was rushed to Jaslok Hospital by event volunteers. On Friday morning, he was discharged. According to doctors, he was put on intravenous drip but did not require a stomach wash.Divya and Vanshika Rajpariya, in sixth and eighth classes of Whistling Wood school, were lucky. They got delayed at lunch and were later given pizzas when organisers realized the food was stale. By the time my children reached for lunch, they realized something was wrong with the food packets as other students had started complaining, said their mother Trupti Rajpariya.The organisers stopped the remaining students from consuming the food and subsequently ordered pizza for lunch. On Friday, pizzas were again ordered for participants but the number of students who turned up for the event had reduced by half, organizers claimed. Of the four admitted to Jaslok hospital, two were discharged on Friday. According to medical director Dr Tarang Gianchandani, no one was critical but two students will be kept under observation for another day. At Bhatia hospital, two students remain admitted but were said to be stable and recovering well.Meanwhile, a statement from Box8 read, We are deeply concerned about news report of illness caused to some students yesterday. Box8 maintains rigorous quality process through preparation of food and delivery system, including tasting the food before serving, which too was followed yesterday without any adverse results. Matter is being inquired by the authorities and we have been fully co-operating to identify the cause. Once the cause is identified Box8 will spare no efforts to deal with the same.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

5937322c7be9e015d564a60d,Charda village: Dalits stood up here and got village to rally behind them,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dalits-stood-up-here-and-got-village-to-rally-behind-them-2969616/,2016-08-12,,Indian Express,"No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed Raja No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed RajaAbout 100 km from the India-Pakistan border, in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha district, Charda village witnessed a revolution of sorts over six years ago. A Brahmins buffalo had died and he called the Dalits to clear it. They refused. Since then, Dalits here havent skinned or cleared a single carcass.There was a fight and we decided not to do it anymore. The buffalo lay there for two days, till the owner buried it himself, says Mulabhai Mansinh Bochiya, a Dalit who was in his second term as sarpanch at the time in 2009-10.I was made the sarpanch for the first time on a savarna (general) seat in 2000, when the incumbent sarpanch, from the darbar (OBC) caste, was booked in a murder case within six months of his appointment. Rajputs and darbars are the dominant community, but the village voted for me again, says Bochiya.At a time when attacks on Dalits have led to a widespread outrage, particularly after the public flogging of seven Dalit youths in Gujarats Una for skinning dead cattle, Charda is on the cusp of change, although there is still some way to go.Bochiyas wife, Sattuben, assures that there has been no untouchability in the village since the buffalo incident. But 15-year-old Bhavna Desai, a member of the cattle-rearing Rabari (OBC) community, who spends most of her time at the Bochiya home, says it does exist subtly in the privacy of homes.For instance, they (Dalits) cannot come into our temple, and they do not come anyway. At community get-togethers, they sit with their community members, not with us, she says.A student of Class VIII, Bhavna says that in school, however, everyone sits together and dines together, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.Sattuben and Mulabhai have six sons and two daughters all of whom are married. Unable to accommodate everyone in one home, the family moved to a plot where they used to store fodder, on the outskirts of the village and have one bigha of land in which they only grow cattle feed for their buffaloes, says Sattuben.All the sons are labourers and do canal-work, she says. The Narmada canal which connected this taluka has come as a blessing to the village. We laid a pipeline spending Rs four lakh to connect to the fields, says Sattuben.But if they (government) evicts us we will have to leave, because this land is not ours, says Sattuben.Her daughter-in-law Jasaben says their staple food is bajra and mung and potato. Rice is made only on occasions, unlike the Desais and the Rajputs in the village, who also eat wheat and vegetables like brinjal, and tomatoes, she says.Bhavnas father Nagjibhai Desai lived in Shilaj on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, taking care of a cow pound till about ten years ago. Then came the Ring Road (Sardar Patel Ring Road), and Ahmedabad became a mega city, and here we are back home to farming, says Desai.He raises cattle and sells milk to the Banaskantha dairy co-operative. Untouchability, he says, does not exist at all in Charda, adding that everyone clears carcasses.Pointing to the children gathered around his home, he says, Look, all of them are Dalits. Can you tell the difference between them and us? If you cut any of us our blood will be red. They all eat together play together. Those who believe in discrimination, may practise it (untouchability). We dont.Shankarbhai Prajapati, an OBC who has been Chardas sarpanch for the last five years, insists that the village has changed. Only last week, my buffalo died, it was worth Rs one lakh. I called a tractor, tied and dragged it, loaded it and buried it with some salt for faster decomposition, he says.Govindbhai Rajput, a farmer, blames politics, for the discriminatory practices. People working on the directions of the Congress and the BJP practise untouchability, because they have political interests. We have no enemies. There is no issue at all. In our weddings, they (the Dalits) play the drums and get Rs 25,000-30,000 for it. Brotherhood is what we believe in, he says.Nanjibhai Adhial, who works in Tharad for Dalit rights as part of the Ahmedabad-based NGO Human Development and Research Centre, says that much has changed since awareness came in.But the awakening has come with its own set of issues, he says. Today, if a Dalit is asked to shut up in a panchayat meet, he will object, and then the oppression begins. Earlier, he would sit quiet, he says.Banaskantha District Collector Jenu Devan says the district administration tries to get communities together at gram sabhas to overcome discriminatory practices. In schools, we have successfully managed to finish it. We have ensured that children sit together and dine together. Our teachers mostly come from towns where untouchability is less and they are partners in this effort, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593cc4447be9e00e964d386d,PM Modi’s interview with Arnab Goswami: Full transcript,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modis-interview-with-arnab-goswami-full-transcript-2879832/,2016-06-28,,Indian Express,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an interview with Times Now has shared his views on a range of issues. Here is the complete transcript of the Prime Ministers interview with Arnab Goswami.ARNAB: Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchPM MODI: My greetings to all the peopleARNAB: This is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.PM MODI: The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.Watch Video: Whats making newsARNAB: I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?PM MODI: When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and its not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the governments functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And its not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So thats the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright future.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?PM MODI: Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasnt given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didnt know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modis personality shouldnt be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldnt know about indias head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.ARNAB: You were an unknown entity in foreign policyPM MODI: More than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Ministers officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. Theres been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because Ive had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldnt consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now its time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speed.ARNAB: That is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of Chinas opposition?PM MODI: Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. Its not that only this government is trying, its in continuity. But its during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardARNAB: Is it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked Indias UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled Indias NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your governments outreach?PM MODI: The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy its not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We dont have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, its a question of principles for them. On some issues, its a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth Indias interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of Indias interests. We dont compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about Indias interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryARNAB: Do you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?PM MODI: See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. Its our ongoing effortARNAB: This statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechPM MODI: Thank youARNAB: There was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?PM MODI: I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingARNAB: Why do you say that?PM MODI: In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesARNAB: Have you become more conscious now?PM MODI: I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.ARNAB: Yes, go ahead.PM MODI: Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.ARNAB: But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterPM MODI: But it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)ARNAB: Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?PM MODI: I am talking about whats happening hereARNAB: But when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said We have to overcome the hesitations of history. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?PM MODI: I would especially like to appeal to my countrys media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the . India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsARNAB: How close can we get to them?PM MODI: There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obamas foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidARNAB: What you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?PM MODI: The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedARNAB: Mr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols? This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?PM MODI: There are two things. One  India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why dont we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two  those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. Its true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansARNAB: When your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze whats happening and whats not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?PM MODI: Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect Indias interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my countrys soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is the Lakshman Rekha that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other Lakshman Rekha is that you must act on 26/11. Theres been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the Lakshman Rekha now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?PM MODI: The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the Lakshman Rekha. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I dont have to explain to the world about Indias position. The world is unanimously appreciating Indias position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we dont have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought Indias theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that its your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. Indias dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardARNAB: Mr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyays philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but its one of the ways. But today the countrys situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the countrys economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. Its estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the peoples expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you cant put a calendar date to it but they dont have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?PM MODI: The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Departments registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls dont have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So wont the employment increase?ARNAB: So is your focus on entrepreneurship?PM MODI: Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?PM MODI: You cant view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, its not in anybodys hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the states responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centres responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentARNAB: Mr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect Indias image, perception as a global economy. Whats your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?PM MODI: When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be  Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi wont let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanARNAB: Why so?PM MODI: I will tell you. Those who sayI believe Raghuram Rajans patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, its not like the nation wont get Raghuram Rajans services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, theres a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter S Sevabhaav (service), Santulan (balance), Sanyam (restraint), Samvaad (dialogue), Samanvay (coordination), Sakaratmak (positivity) and Samvedna (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour. Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajans context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about Sanyam (restraint) and Santulan (balance), is it correct?PM MODI: Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation wont benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.ARNAB: Thats a very clear message.PM MODI: I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.ARNAB: And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?PM MODI: How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. Its a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common mans perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. Its after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that theres something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can saythat yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereARNAB: And you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip servicePM MODI: The result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Courts 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you cant imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussedfor several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you mustve seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isnt generated in India and black Money doesnt go out of India, you can see the results of all this.ARNAB: When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.PM MODI: That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they dont come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.PM MODI: Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if theres someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.ARNAB: Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?PM MODI: I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.ARNAB: Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isnt just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?PM MODI: There are many things which are not visible. One cant imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I cant deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldnt have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Lets see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldnt go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outARNAB: Prime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I dont remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, I am told  You emphasized and said I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship. Then the applause was more. And then you said, You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament. You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many peoples minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?PM MODI: I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or theirs, I ll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament  we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or dont let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the governments work is accomplished or not, I dont see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for ones opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say Opposition, it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us  when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that When you were is Opposition, you did it this way There is a difference between every Opposition party. We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We cant behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves. A party which hasnt been in power or hasnt seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we cant have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.ARNAB: Congress is a very experienced and old partyPM MODI: Thats why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldnt be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldnt be doing such thingsARNAB: Prime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?PM MODI: First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesnt come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itARNAB: The reasonyou had triedPM MODI: Made all efforts.ARNAB: You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadPM MODI: We held talks at every levelARNAB: Still? The word you used ego issue, why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?PM MODI: The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.ARNAB: You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldnt get capsized, the focus shouldnt be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?PM MODI: Its my conviction, its my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure theres food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.ARNAB: So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionPM MODI: Firstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.ARNAB: But they keep making such commentsPM MODI: Dont make them heroes, they will stopARNAB: We dont make them heroes, we make them villains.PM MODI: But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I havent even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVARNAB: Self styled spokesmenPM MODI: I dont know why such people are encouragedARNAB: Mr Prime Minister, lets talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Dont you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?PM MODI: See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of elections.ARNAB: Was that leader from your party?PM MODI: No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this.There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this countrys voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable.When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of it.ARNAB: Can there be a timebound resolution in this?PM MODI: The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate this.ARNAB: Are you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?PM MODI: Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be better.ARNAB: I think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gain.PM MODI: Odisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the difference.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep up.PM MODI: It is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing that.ARNAB: Before I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them. The farmers crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, youve faced it, youve talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?PM MODI: We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didnt do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer.We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but havent started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds.But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, theyre cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasnt been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing.For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldnt go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the fertility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming.Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the resuARNAB: Do you think that the farmers crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it wont be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?PM MODI: See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.ARNAB: Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.PM MODI: This has become too long.ARNAB: Ill club these two (questions) together. Youre also enjoying it and I am glad youre speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. Theyre short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?PM MODI: Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I dont get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldnt have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldnt be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September youd face problems?ARNAB: This was also a warning in a way.PM MODI: It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isnt a small issue. People who werent transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I wont let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I dont want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldnt be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.ARNAB: Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?PM MODI: See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. Ive been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardARNAB: Final question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?PM MODI: Firstly, I dont live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you cant deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I dont run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I cant leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.ARNAB: Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.PM MODI: Thank youARNAB: And thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.PM MODI: I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.ARNAB: Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchPM MODI: Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.ARNAB: Thank you very much.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
593cc5997be9e00e964d3919,Technology and business: When a global Swiss agribusiness giant becomes Chinese-owned,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/chemchia-syngenta-swiss-agribusiness-becomes-china-owned-2762969/,2016-04-21,,Indian Express,"On February 3, Syngenta said that it was being bought by China National Chemical Corporation for over $43 billion in cash. The announcement sent shockwaves as the Swiss agri-science major had, only last August, spurned an acquisition offer from the US life sciences giant, Monsanto. The move, had it gone through, would have merged the worlds biggest agrochemical/crop protection company (Syngenta) with the global leader in seeds and genomics (Monsanto). Meanwhile, on December 3, DuPont and Dow Chemical, also with interests in both crop protection as well as seeds, decided to undertake what they called a merger of equals.In such an environment of consolidation involving Western ag-science giants  driven by the global commodity downturn impacting demand  a Swiss MNC becoming a 100 per cent subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise naturally surprised many.Syngentas global CEO, John Ramsay is, however, clear why his company chose ChemChina over Monsanto. A Monsanto-Syngenta deal resulting in the creation of a single entity with a dominant global position in both hybrid seeds and agrochemicals, he believes, is most likely to have encountered regulatory hurdles across jurisdictions.Read | Farm policy: A game-changing acquisition that India should learn fromOne thing people havent really taken into account is the fact that there has been no major consolidation in thisindustry since 2002. The anti-trust regulators, thus, have not had a big deal to look at for some time now, says Ramsay, in an interview he gave to The Indian Express while on a visit to India last week.The last big merger the ag-science industry saw, he notes, happened in 2002 when Bayer acquired Aventis CropScience to form Bayer CropScience (which is the world No. 2 in crop protection behind Syngenta). Even Syngenta was the product of a merger, in 2000, of the agribusiness divisions of Novartis and AstraZeneca.But that does not still explain, why ChemChina? Ramsays answer to it is that Syngentas existing shareholders  basically asset management firms and hedge funds  are the kinds who want consistent returns in an industry prone to crop cycles. The level of financial returns they expect year after year, according to him, is not in the companys long-term interest, which lies in investing in research & development even during periods of commodity downturns and currency volatility such as the present one.In 2015, Syngentas R&D investment at $1.36 billion was marginally below the $1.43 billion for the previous year, even as the drop in sales was sharp from $15.13 billion to $13.41 billion. This is an industry that, despite the crop cycles, clearly has an excellent future because of the needs of the world in terms of food security and the continuity in demand for agricultural produce globally. What we have in ChemChina is a new shareholder, which understands the cycles. It knows that the winners here are those who will continue to invest in technology through the cycles. This is different from the traditional western fund management mentality of seeking consistent returns, Ramsay points out.For the Chinese authorities, the investment in Syngenta is also of great strategic value, given their high anxiety about food security. For a country with 22 per cent of the worlds population and only 7 per cent of its arable land, it is no wonder that every time they produce a new five-year plan, youll find food security is right on their radar.Read | Monsanto patent under cloud as Bt cotton prone to pink bollwormThe Syngenta buy will give ChemChina access to all its ag-science know-how and patents. Ramsay claims that there would be no fundamental change to the Basel-based company, except that we will be enhancing our Chinese resources to bring technology to China in a more aspirational way, perhaps, than we had done previously. ChemChinas own agrochemicals portfolio is not really of relevance to us. The companys relevance will be only as a shareholder and even there, it wouldnt be an industry participator in the way that Monsanto would have been.Crop protection generated $10 billion of Syngentas global sales of $13.41 billion in 2015, with seeds contributing $2.84 billion. The companys revenues in India amounted to Rs 2,904.75 crore for FY15, with an estimated 60 per cent coming from crop protection and the balance 40 per cent from seeds.Syngenta has the second largest share (after Bayer CropScience) of Indias roughly Rs 14,000 crore agrochem market, which also has other majors like DuPont, Rallis India, UPL Ltd, PI Industries, BASF and Dhanuka Agritech. It also claims to be No. 1 in hybrid sunflower and vegetable seeds  especially of tomatoes, cauliflower, sweet and hot pepper, sweet corn, radish and watermelon  apart from having No. 3 position in corn (behind DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto) and rice (behind Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer).How MNCs have taken over Indias agrochem marketWhile much of the public focus when it comes to farm inputs is riveted on fertiliser and seeds  more so with the brouhaha over Monsantos Bt cotton technology  agrochemicals largely escape attention. The dominance of multinationals in this segment is far more than even in seeds, where there is still a reasonably strong presence ofIndian breeders, both in the public as well as private sectors.Whether it is DuPonts Rynaxypry (Coragen and Ferterra brands), Bayer CropSciences Flubendiamide (Fame) or Syngentas Thiamethoxam (Virtako), these and many such other insecticide products of MNCs, incorporating proprietary new chemistry, have captured a significant share of Indias crop protection chemicals market.The main characteristic of the new generation molecules with novel modes of action for controlling target pests  apart from their being mostly patented  is their low levels of spraying.Read | Monsanto threatens to exit India over govts show cause noticeTo understand this, take Isoproturon, which is used for control of phalaris minor grass weeds (gulli danda) in wheat. Farmers typically had to apply about 500 grams per acre of this herbicide that was originally introduced in the 1970s. But with Sulfosulfuron, which Monsanto launched under the Leader brand in the 1990s, this fell to barely 10 grams per acre.Similarly, Bayer CropSciences Imidacloprid and Syngentas Thiamethoxam seed treatment insecticides  both based on a family of compounds called neonicotinoids  require just 40 milliliters per acre of application in cotton and rice, which used to earlier be 250-400 ml with Monocrotophos, an old generation organophosphate molecule.The new crop protection products have less toxic effect on the environment, humans, flora and fauna. Also, they are less hazardous, being mainly water-soluble concentrate formulations. The earlier formulations were emulsifiable concentrates using petroleum-based solvents, says Sarjiwan Singh Manhas, Syngentas South Asia R&D head. But introduction of new products based on proprietary chemistry is only one part. Equally important is the aggressive way in which the MNCs are pushing these among farmers.Syngenta, for example, has sought to popularise Gromore, which is supposedly an integrated crop protection solution for paddy covering all its four key growth phases.Thus, for the seedling phase, which is up to 30 days from the date of transplanting, the company is promoting Rifit, a herbicide mainly targeted at the Echinochloa species of weeds, and Virtako for control of early-stage rice stem borer insect pest. For the vegetative stage lasting from 31 to 60 days, it is similarly offering Amistar Top against sheath blight fungus and Virtako for both stem borer and leaf folder insects. Then, there is Chess for brown plant hopper and Tilt, a broad-spectrum fungicide, to be both applied during the reproductive phase between 61 to 90 days.By selling a range of its own branded pesticide products for all stages of the crop under a unified Gromore protocols solution, Syngenta has vastly increased its business among paddy growers in India. The cost of implementing Gromore protocols ranges between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,500 per acre, depending on whether the farmer opts for the light (4-5 sprays in all) or full (7-8 sprays) solution. This is more than the normal Rs 1,500-2,000 per acre that paddy growers spend on crop protection.By following our protocols, the farmer harvests 4-5 quintals more paddy per acre. At Rs 1,400 per quintal, this translates into an additional income of Rs 6,000, as against the Rs 1,000-1,500 extra he may spend, claims Manhas. That may be some value proposition for the farmer and, of course, the company.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Twenty kg of rice, 10 kg of wheat and 2 kg of pulses. Sugar, oil, potatoes, tomatoes and onions, and candles. A visit by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat (on Tuesday) and announcement of Rs 10 lakh in compensation. That was an official at the office of the District Magistrate in Bageshwar, listing what Sohan Rams family  his father, wife and two children  is getting as compensation.On October 5, Dalit labourer Ram was killed, allegedly by a government school teacher from the upper-caste Thakur community, who hurled casteist slurs before cutting his throat with a sickle, for entering and defiling a flour mill in Kadaria village.The accused, Lalit Karnatak, was arrested the next day but his brother and father, who have been accused of threatening Rams family against filing a complaint, are absconding. It took two more days for the promised rations to reach Rams family, after the case was reported by local media. But on Monday, with the brutal killing triggering protests in Dehradun and Bageshwar, and the assembly elections scheduled next year, the state government has sprung into action.All efforts are on to nab the other accused, said Bageshwar SP, Sukhbeer Singh, even as district officials and police officers spent most of Monday preparing for Rawats visit. An empty field was being prepared as a helipad, with about 200 police personnel asked to report to the village on Tuesday.The sudden rush for damage-control also led to a bizarre situation. After the Chief Ministers visit was confirmed on Monday, officials at the DMs office inquired about the financial status of Rams widow to facilitate the cash compensation  only to realise that she didnt have a bank account.The Bahujan Samaj Party, meanwhile, has called for a Jan Akrosh rally on Wednesday to protest the killing. We will not let this issue die. Cases of caste-based discrimination are growing and have become a problem in Bageshwar. Karnataks father and brother, who threatened Rams family, are still absconding. We are expecting 2,500 people at the rally, said Sundar Kumar Syunewal, district head, BSP.According to the 2001 census, Bageshwar district has the highest proportion of Scheduled Castes  25.9 per cent  in Uttarakhand. According to local leaders and officials, a few cases of caste discrimination and violence have been reported from the area but such brutality is not common.The National Crime Records Bureau report for 2015 says that crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes grew by 59 per cent in Uttarakhand between 2014 and 2015. While 62 cases were reported in 2014, this number grew to 93 in 2015.This year, conflict over caste-based discrimination in Uttarakhand flared up four months ago, when Dalit leader Daulat Kunwar and BJP MP Tarun Vijay raised the issue of entry of Dalits in temples in the state. Kunwar and Vijay had entered the Silgur Devta Temple near Dehradun in May, following which the priests carried out a nine-day long cleansing ceremony.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(ANI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar speaking to the media. (ANI)Amid reports of clearance given to GM mustard by a government panel, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has sought intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to overrule the approval considering its ill effects on human health. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kumar has sought Modis intervention to immediately overrule the clearance to GM mustard seeds given by a technical panel of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee.He expressed apprehension that approval to GM mustard would open a gate to several genetically modified food crops being developed by public as well private-research bodies like GM rice, maize, rice, brinjal, wheat, tomato among others which are at various stages of approval process. Kumar said GM mustard was a herbicide tolerant (HT) crop. Any gene making the plant resistant to a herbicide locks farmers into using select brands of agro-chemicals. The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already writtent to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology. Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Nobody would have thought that the PM will one day become a model to sell the SIM card of a particular company, he added.Modiji, you are not the nation, Sangh is not the Parliament and the Manu Smriti is not the Constitution. We speak against you, Sangh and the Manu Smriti. We believe in the Constitution and Ambedkar. We believe in the nation of Ambedkar, Kanhaiya said, adding that a 65-year-old could not become the leader of a young nation like India and most people do not believe in his personality-centric politics.Referring to the lynching of Mohammed Akhlaq in Dadri over suspicion that he had stored beef, Kumar said that when India is filled with diversity, numerous languages and varied food habits, how can one ask the whole country to eat a particular thing. He said that Modis is the only government which says it will complete its policies in 2022 and not 2019 when its term gets over.Kanhaiya said the government had failed to deliver on many of its promise. He had promised to give employment to 2 crore people in a year, but could not provide anything. We will go to people with these anti-people actions. Be it the police, sedition, or hurling of shoes and tomatoes, nothing will be able to stop us, he added, demanding unemployment allowance for those who are not provided employment.Kanhaiya said the idea that election of a Dalit or a woman chief minister will lead to development of these sections or that an OBC leaders government will lead to the progress of backward castes is also wrong.He said that people need to form a rainbow coalition based on the ideas of thinkers like Ambedkar, Karl Marx, Lenin and Mao Zedong to create a Samatamulak Samaj.Watch what else is making newsCPI leader Dr Girish said that Kanhaiyas second address, slated for Monday in Faizabad, is yet to get required permissions by the district administration.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in Lok Sabha, Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav of RJD and Dharmendra Yadav (SP) claimed that the government was using the creamy-layer formula as a tool to strangulate OBC candidates by denying them entry into top services the IAS and IPS.But the government hit back, saying the members of the two parties were trying to portray a wrong picture. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the government is ready for any change in the formula. The rule on creamy layer is in place since UPA rule in 2004. You are painting a wrong picturewe are just following the same rule, he said, adding that the BJP and the NDA government are committed towards reservation for OBCs.Home Minister Rajnath Singh clarified that information is sought from OBC candidates about creamy layer to avoid court cases by other candidates. Their interests are not harmed. It is sought to avoid litigation, he said.Singh assured that he was ready to get the issue examined, even though there was no confusion. Some members claimed that following the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations, children of government employees working in the lower rung cannot make it to services like IAS and IPS as the income criteria in the creamy layer formula creates hindrances.Hukum Deo Narain Yadav (BJP) said the National Commission for Backwards should be granted constitutional status to give it more teeth in tackling cases of violation of OBC rights.Watch Video: Whats making newsK C Venugopal (Cong) raised the issue of price rise and said there is a general feeling that the government is not taking enough steps to curb inflation. While diesel, petrol and kerosene price are already high, prices of other essential commodities are set to go up during festival season, he said. Demanding a short duration discussion on price rise, he said prices of pulses to tomatoes have exceeded their average rates from 40 to 130 per cent.Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (BJP) said some academic institutions have done away with five per cent reservation for children of Kashmiri migrants and demanded action against such institutes by the HRD Ministry.Sanjay Jaiswal (BJP) lamented that Health Minister J P Nadda has not come up with a statement on reports that NEET paper were up for sale.Maintaining that there was a need to hold the entrance exams in a transparent way, he said If need be, they should be held again and claimed that students were being made to pay anything from Rs 10 lakh to 50 lakh for leaked question papers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The reports state that lead levels for all samples are within permissible limits.FMCG major Nestle Monday said its popular Maggi has cleared tests conducted by Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) under the directive of Supreme Court, reiterating that its instant noodles brand is safe for consumption.CFTRI has submitted analysis reports on Maggi noodles to the Supreme Court. We have been provided with a copy of the reports. We are happy that all 29 samples tested by CFTRI are clear, Nestle India said in a statement.The reports state that lead levels for all samples are within permissible limits, it added.All 29 samples of Maggi Noodles,( the initial 13 and subsequent 16 samples), were collected by the relevant authorities following due process and then directly submitted to CFTRI, Nestle India said.The second batch of 16 samples were tested not only for lead and taste enhacer MSG, but also for other safety parameters like metal contaminants, crop contaminants, toxic substances that are applicable to instant noodles as a proprietary food.Every single sample was found compliant, the company said.The Supreme Court on December 16 last year, ordered testing of samples of Maggi noodles in Mysore laboratory after the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) had directed that it be done in Chennai.The apex court had passed the December order after noting that both the Centre and Nestle India had agreed that Mysore was well equipped with all tests and being a referral notified laboratory, and sample should be sent there.We strongly re-iterate that Maggi Noodles has always been safe for consumption as demonstrated by tests carried out in independent accredited laboratories, it said, adding the tests included several other national food authorities including the USA, UK, Singapore and Australia, among others.Nestle India said CFTRI has clarified that glutamic acid can be due to presence of ingredients like tomatoes, cheese, hydrolyzed plant protein, hydrolyzed vegetable protein. It has further stated that there are no analytical methods to distinguish between naturally present glutamic acid and additive MSG.Nestle India further said the CFTRI has clarified that the additive MSG is allowed to be added to selected food commodities (seasoning for Noodles is one of them) under Good Manufacturing Practices basis proper label declarations as per Food Safety and Standards Regulations, 2011.We wish to emphasise that health and safety of our consumers is our highest priority and we never compromise on the safety, compliance or quality of our products or services, the company added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo Oinam Anand) Deepak Pental (second from left) with fellow scientists at a mustard trial field in Jaunti village of North West Delhi. (Express Photo Oinam Anand)It is Indias largest source of edible oil.Unlike soyabean, which has only 18 per cent oil content, and groundnut, more than 50 per cent of whose kernels are either consumed directly or exported, rapeseed/mustard is one crop that is a true oilseed. With annual production of around 2.4 million tonnes (mt), mustard accounts for a quarter of the countrys average edible oil availability of 9.4 mt from indigenous sources (see chart).That being the case, mustard would be central to any strategy aimed at reducing Indias reliance on edible oil imports, which, in 2014-15 (November-October), amounted to over 14.4 mt valued at $10.5 billion. The fact that it is a rabi crop with almost 75 per cent area under irrigation  as against barely 25 per cent in groundnut and one per cent for soyabean  and having roughly 40 per cent oil content, makes mustard the most suitable candidate for ushering in a yellow revolution, similar to what wheat and paddy did for the Green Revolution.For years, breeders have exploited a phenomenon known as heterosis or hybrid vigour resulting from crossing two genetically dissimilar plant varieties even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either parent can individually give.Share This Article Related Article Let the farmer judgeLet the farmer judge The other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflationThe other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflation Call Luddites bluffCall Luddites bluff GM row again, with mustard toppingGM row again, with mustard topping A perennial deficit: The other oil problemA perennial deficit: The other oil problem Edible oils up on millers buying,global cuesIn mustard, though, there have been two major constraints standing in the way of realising yield grains from heterosis that can help considerably boost domestic production.The first is the narrow genetic base of mustard varieties grown in India. Scientists at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) in Delhi University, led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, however, showed that this problem could be addressed by crossing Indian mustard cultivars with juncea lines of East European origin like Early Heera and Donskaja. The combination of the two divergent gene pools enhanced the crossing options; the resultant F1 progeny were found to exhibit significant heterosis.The second constraint is more basic, having to do with the absence of a natural hybridisation system in mustard. Mustard flowers contain both female (pistil) and male (stamen) reproductive organs, making the plants largely self-pollinating. To the extent that the egg cells of one plant cannot be fertilised by the pollen grains from the stamen of another, it restricts the scope for developing hybrids  which, in crops such as maize, cotton and tomato, is possible through simple emasculation or physical removal of anthers.Pentals team at the CGMCP initially developed a cytoplasmic male-sterile or CMS line of Pusa Bold Indian mustard. This line (in which the stamen is sterile and cannot produce viable pollen), crossed with the East European Early Heera-2 variety (which is male-fertile and hence capable of pollinating the former), resulted in DMH-1, Indias first ever mustard hybrid. Its average seed yield, at 2.6 tonnes per hectare, was a fifth higher than the 2.1-2.2 tonnes for existing best check varieties, including Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Varuna, Rohini and Kranti.The CGMCP scientists also bred another hybrid DMH-4, from crossing Pusa Bold with S-7, a derivative from Indian and East European mustard lines. The yields from it were the same as DMH-1, but the new hybrid produced bolder seeds.The CMS-based hybrid breeding system, however, had drawbacks. It could work only in a single Indian mustard variety (Pusa Bold). Using the same CMS (female) parental line, thus, limited the crossing options. We tried transferring our CMS system (126-1) to many Indian and East European mustard lines. But in all these cases, the male sterility broke down and such partially fertile lines couldnt be used for hybrid seed production. The system was also unstable, especially under low temperatures, explains Pental.The inherent limitations in CMS-based hybrid breeding, then, led Pentals team to explore the genetic modification or GM route. The technology they chose involved deploying alien Barnase and Barstar genes. The Barnase gene, isolated from a soil bacterium called Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, coded for a protein that impaired pollen production and rendered the plant into which it was incorporated male-sterile. This plant was, then, crossed with a fertile parental line, containing, in turn, the Barstar gene from the same bacterium that blocked the action of the Barnase gene. The resultant F1 progeny was high-yielding and could also produce seed/grain, thanks to the Barstar gene in the second fertile line.The CGMCP scientists used the Barnase-Barstar GM technology, originally patented by Plant Genetic Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience), to create a robust and viable hybridisation system in mustard. This system was also used to develop DMH-11 through crossing Varuna (Barnase) with Early Heera-2 (Barstar). This GM hybrid, which has demonstrated up to 30 per cent heterosis in field trials, is currently awaiting approval for commercial cultivation.The Barnase-Barstar system enables us to breed hybrids from a wide range of Indian and East European mustards yielding higher levels of heterosis. Besides, we can introduce new traits relating to oil quality (zero erucic acid, low glucosinolates content) or resistance to disease (alternaria blight and stem rot), which wasnt possible with just a single, unstable CMS parental line, Pental points out.CGMCP has, in fact, tied up with the University of Arizona to map the Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), which itself has two constituent genomes AA (from the Brassica rapa species) and BB (from Brassica nigra), each containing 30,000 genes.The rapa genome has already been sequenced, while the work on nigra will be completed by the end of 2016. Once this is done, we will be able to know and locate the genes that code for specific traits, be it oil content, seed size, pod length and density, number of seeds per pod or disease resistance, adds Pental.GM technology will only help in developing hybrids with new parental combinations and incorporating these various quantitative, qualitative and disease resistant traits into them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

All the shops on either side of the 5-km stretch were closed, with 30 platoons of policemen and 60 officers deployed to ensure compliance. Some portions of the route were cordoned off with ropes. Several members of the Chhatra Congress and ABVP were detained before they could enter the campus and show black flags.Patnaik has Z-plus security. However, Bhubaneswar Deputy Commissioner of Police Satyabrata Bhoi admitted that the measures were not part of that security detail. We had intelligence reports that there may be disturbances like last year. So security was enhanced, Bhoi said.The disturbances the DCP was referring to related to the February 2015 incident in which students, led by NSUI state president Satyajit Patnaik, had pelted eggs at Patnaiks vehicle while he was on his way to the same universitys annual function.Following the incident, an additional DCP-ranked officer in charge of the states Special Security Battalion, supposed to supervise and suggest alternative routes for Patnaiks travel, was suspended and had to face departmental proceedings. Besides, Satyajit Patnaik and five others were arrested and had a difficult time getting bail as police pressed attempt-to-murder charges.Satyajit Patnaik, who had to spend five days in jail, says, I had been married just four days before the incident happened. After the protest, I left for Dubai and was arrested two months after I came back.Accusing Patnaik of being scared of the public, state Congress chief Prasad Harichandan said, Have you heard of people dying after being pelted with eggs? The security put in place for Patnaiks visit to Utkal University was unprecedented, Harichandan added, especially for a politician who claims to be extremely popular.Other ministers of the state Cabinet have also been victims of egg and tomato attacks in recent months, including Law and Panchayati Raj Minister Arun Sahoo, Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma, Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak and School and Mass Eduction Minister Debi Prasad Mishra.On Saturday, Congress activists pelted eggs and rotten tomatoes at the official residence of Urban Development and Labour Minister Pushpendra Singhdeo. The minister, who was away in his native district of Kalahandi, said his family who was at the house was very shaken.In December last year, girl students, mostly NSUI supporters, had been detained in a room when Patnaik visited Rama Devi Womens University in Bhubaneswar. Trying to justify the detention, Biju Janata Dal MLA Priyadarsi Mishra had likened the girl students to human bombs, causing outrage.The students had later lodged a case against university officers with police, and filed complaints in the Odisha Human Rights Commission and State Womens Commission.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn January this year, ahead of a seminar on higher education to be attended by the CM, the audience was frisked twice. Council of Higher Secondary Education Chairman Basudev Chhaoti and Utkal University registrar S K Das along with college teachers and many others had entered the auditorium after routine frisking and passing through a metal detector, but had to vacate the auditorium and re-enter after another security check, with policemen searching for any egg-like missiles in their pockets.We did not want to take a chance after the egg-throwing incident of February. It was a closed space and the CM would have been more vulnerable, said a police officer who was part of the security bandobast.A senior inspector of a police station in Bhubaneswar said they ensure all local vegetable shops, eggs shops, fruit shops and shops selling water bottles are shut before the CMs carcade passes through an area.Official sources say a proposal is being considered now to install a baggage scanner and a mechanical gate at the CMs residence, as well as to create a buffer zone around it. Besides, a net or a similar obstruction is being installed on the back boundary wall of Naveen Niwas so that no one can scale over it or throw something inside.As per another proposal, officers including drivers in the CMs staff are to be given anti-extremist training. The narrow road adjoining the Naveen Niwas already has concertina wires around it.DCP Bhoi said that in Odisha, both the CM and Governor are entitled to Z-plus security. But the security is more elaborate and changes as per threat perception. If tomorrow the CM goes to Malkangiri, he will get five times the security he gets in Bhubaneswar, he said.Assistant Commissioner of Police Aseem Kumar Panda admitted the egg attacks were indeed becoming a headache. But we can prevent them. We are devising a plan, he said.While Patnaiks Additional Chief Secretary U N Behera refused to talk about the additional security measures, BJD leaders defended that Patnaik needed to be cautious in a Maoist-affected state like Odisha.Police take a call on it. Why are opposition people so worried about his security? said MLA Mishra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Due to cash crunch, the contractor is not able to pay them daily. Things were fine till the old notes were exchanged by banks, but now the labour is hardly getting any wages.Another official said there is no point in letting Pakistani trucks in India. If goods come from Pakistan, there is no labour to unload the trucks, he added.Rajdeep Uppal, president, Confederation of International Chamber of Commerce, said most of the labourers do not have bank accounts and they demand cash. Even those who have accounts dont accept cheques as its not easy to withdraw money from banks these days, he said.Uppal added that the cash crunch has not only affected the labour but also traders. The orders placed by us are still stuck across the border and we are just waiting for the situation to ease.Also, the export from India through the border has also virtually come to a standstill as trucks carrying tomatoes are not getting quarantine import permits from Pakistani authorities due to unknown reasons, traders claimed.Talking to HT, a customs official said, While the import has totally stopped due to cash crunch, only a few trucks carrying cotton are going to Pakistan these days."

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained.

Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash.

Kalawati is entitled to Rs 14,000 as monthly interest, but has been finding it difficult to withdraw money from the nearest bank some 25 km away.She visited the Central Bank of India in Maregaon two days ago and had to return with just Rs 6,000 after a four-hour wait.Read | 1000 raids in 50 days: Taxman monitoring deposits of Rs 2 lakh and aboveResidents of the region notorious for farm distress and farmer suicides have similar complaints, alleging that the situation at banks has not improved.Shrihari Dhoke from Chanoda says non-availability of cash is derailing his plans for Rabi crop despite a good Kharif harvest. As every link in this chain is almost entirely settled in cash, the absence of currency in the system has affected the overall post-harvest activity, he pointed out.Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished. No money meant no queues, they said in the days following the demonetisation announcement.Though declared the states first cashless village, Lanura, about 25km from Srinagar, epitomises the challenges faced by the administration, post-demonetisation.Read | Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayLanura is cashless in the sense it is facility-less.

Weeks later, he still insists demonetisation is ruinous for farmers.Even now there is no money in the banksWe have to wait for days to get meagre cash, which is not sufficient to meet expenses for our family and agricultural needs, he said.He pointed out that vegetable growers have suffered immensely. Potato prices have crashed to Rs 2.5 a kilogram, carrot to Rs 2 and cauliflower to just Rs 1 a kilogram. Traders have no money and farmers are begging before commission agents in mandis to buy their produce at whatever price and commission agents are fleecing them, he pointed out.Punjab farmer Nek Singh complains that vegetable growers like him have been hit by demonetisation as the value of their yield has fallen. (Bharat Bhushan/HT Photo)Singh has had a bumper potato crop but that brings him no cheer. The potatoes that I have grown over 40 acres will accrue me a loss of at least Rs 8 lakh. Is there a plan with the government to compensate the farmers? he asked angrily.His potatoes are ripe and ready for harvest but he has been unable to muster courage to start extracting the vegetables. Other potato farmers have lost Rs 20,000 rupees per acre. Imagine what my loss would be, he muttered.Guruvayoor, KeralaEven the six-odd ATMs in the immediate vicinity of the famous Guruvayoor Sri Krishna temple with a bank balance of Rs 1,500 crore and 500 kg gold reserves had run out of cash following demonetisation.But now, things have improved and the machines are again spewing out cash.Read | Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationThe makers of equally famous Guruvayoor papad are also upbeat.

We are fighting to make our country economically independent and freedom from multi-national companies by promoting indigenous and natural products, he claimed. He also said that it would bail out the crisis-ridden farm sector of Vidarbha that is infamous for farmer suicides.The company plans to develop a modern food park by building a Rs 1000-crore plant, and manufacture juice made from the famous Nagpuri orange. This would be the first time that orange juice made from local fruit would be packaged as a brand, the yoga guru said.Union minister Gadkari, who has been instrumental in getting Ramdev to invest in food parks and allied business in the region, claimed that the yoga gurus company Patanjali would be a boon for the farmers of the region and it would usher in modernization of the Nagpur city.According to him, tribals from Gadchiroli, Gondia and Chandrapur who make a living collecting forest produces, like medicinal plants and herbs would benefit hugely from this initiative.Farmers will be trained by Patanjali workers to grow orange, aloe vera, tomato and herbs according to the specification of the company and given a purchase guarantee. A team of scientists and other experts are also working on the project that is expected to change the farm economy of the region.Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister, Fadnavis dismissed the allegations levelled by the former Union minister, Vilas Muttemwar that the government has given the plot of land to Patanjali at less than half of the cost that other investors have paid at MIHAN.The process involved at giving the land to Patanjali was transparent. We had floated tenders thrice and Patanjali Ayurveda was found to be the right choice in the bidding as per the central vigilance commission norms, Fadnavis said.The government wanted a commitment to procure raw materials to the tune of at least Rs 100 crore per annum from the farmers and members of tribal community within the surrounding area.It also laid a condition that the bidder should commit to train minimum 2,000 farmers per year across Maharashtra to improve productivity, quality and market intelligence to get them ready for agro business development in consultation with agriculture department. Patanjali has assured to fulfill all these norms, the chief minister said. The plant is expected to link nearly 50,000 farmers suppliers, create direct employment for over 10,000 people and eventually provide indirect employment to lakhs of families.Regarding the land deal, senior Congress leader Muttemwar had said that as against the running rate of Rs 60-lakh per acre, Patanjali has been charged only Rs 25-lakh an acre. He said that this deal was against all norms and hence should be probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as the state-run MIHAN had acquired land from farmers and was giving it on a platter to Patanjali as a special favour.Muttemwar alleged that the deal was nothing but the BJP government was repaying a favour to Ramdev who had campaigned wholeheartedly for the party during the 2014 general elections."

What once took up to 15 daysif farmers bothered to apply at allnow takes as little as four days.In doing so, Wild Severun by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), a nonprofit that works with the governments forest departments in 284 villages in Karnataka and Tamil Naduhelps soothe the tension and violence evident between Indias rising human population and falling population of wild animals.Earlier it was difficult to interact with villagers when there was wildlife conflict, as they used to get aggressive. From the time Wild Seve started, it has educated them about the importance of wildlife and sustainability, said a forest official, who asked not to be named, as he is not authorised to talk to the media. It has brought a sense of calmness in villagers while dealing with our department.In Murthys village of Chillakahalli and Gowdas Vadeyannapura on the bucolic outskirts of south Karnatakas largest national parkas on populated forest fringes nationwidehuman-animal conflicts are a growing issue, as IndiaSpend reported in May 2014.Gowda received Rs 9,000 as compensation for his cow, but he is satisfied. Previously, we had to pay money to get compensation, he said. First, we had to hire a photographer to take photos of crop raids or cattle kills. Then we had to travel by bus to the forest department, and there was no guarantee we would find them (officials).Farmer Mahadeva Gowda is seen standing next to the carcass of his cow, which was killed by a tiger in August 2015. Gowda is a beneficiary of a new programme called Wild Seve, or wild service, which deploys specially trained locals called field agents who hand-hold villagers to navigate formidable government compensation procedures.Murthy used Wild Seves toll-free number when elephants destroyed his sugarcane crop. Field agent Mahadevaswamywho also attended to Gowdas callinformed and brought along a forest official to validate and document the claim. Photos must be taken and official documents filled, all of which are handled by field agents.Mahadevaswamy said he gets a call a dayif not morefor crop raids and more occasional cattle or poultry kills. His jurisdiction extends to 70 villages within a 20-km radius of Bandipurs forests, and he attends to a call within eight hours of receiving it.Since its launch last year, Wild Seves team of seven field agents has helped file claims for 3,261 incidents of crop and property damage by elephants and other herbivores, 148 cases of livestock predation by big cats and wild dogs, 11 cases of injury and two human deaths.Of these, 2,998 toll-free calls came from Bandipur and 422 from Nagarahole. Until July 2016, nearly 1,000 families have either received or are about to receive compensation.The hope is that as villagers receive compensation for their losses quickly and clearly, they will be more willing to live with wildlife. The compensation is now coming in good time, and so it has built a sense of relief and confidence in us, Gowda said. Even if the crop is raided several times, we believe it will be compensated.In the absence of easy compensation, many species are attacked. There have been reports of villagers retaliating by poisoning tigers or forcing the government to shoot big cats.Krithi Karanth, the scientist behind Wild SeveIn 2014, conservation scientist Krithi Karanth found that between 74% and 86% of households around five areas in Karnataka (Nagarhole, Bandipur, Dandeli, B R Hills, Bhadra) and one each in Madhya Pradesh (Kanha National Park) and Rajasthan (Ranthambore National Park) reported conflicts with wildlife. Her previous research found that less than a third of villagers who lost crops, livestock, property and family to such conflict received government compensation.Along with mitigation, compensation has a role to play, as conflict will continue to occur, said Karanth. My research showed that although people were trying multiple mitigation measuresfences, guarding fields, noise (firecrackers or drums)very few measures worked. Hence, the solutions have to include both pre- and post-conflict assistance to people.Using her data and research, Karanth, in July 2015, in collaboration with the WCS, launched Wild Seve, now running in 284 villages around Bandipur and its contiguous area in Tamil Nadu, the Nagarhole national park.Wild Seve is challenging because compensation procedures vary across forest ranges in Bandipur and Nagarhole. Some require a certificate from a veterinarian, confirming that cattle were indeed killed by wild animals. Others ask for proof of land ownership.Field agents now take care of these procedures, which often deterred villagers from seeking compensation.Recently, Wild Seve distributed identity cards with unique identification numbers to villagers who face repeated wildlife conflicts. Every conflict is now recorded against this number, building a conflict database, which allows easy tracking and follow-up of the compensation processes.Farmer Shiva Murthy receiving his unique identification number card from Wild Seves field co-ordinator Chikkaningaih and field agent Mahadevaswamy. Every conflict is now recorded against this number, building a conflict database, which allows easy tracking and follow-up of the compensation processes.Basically, Wild Seve has helped in simplifying the logistics and cutting down bureaucracy, said Ghanshyam Iyer, project coordinator of Wild Seve and a WCS member.Back in Chillakahalli village, near gently swaying saplings of sugarcane and cotton, women chat as they harvest tomatoes, aware that they share space with tigers, leopards, wild dogs and elephants and that, at some time, damage from visiting animals might set off a burdensome compensation process.As Gowda said, Now, all it takes is one phone call.(Padmanaban is a Bangalore-based journalist who reports on environment and energy.)IndiaSpend welcomes feedback.

Prices of every day ingredients such as onions and potatoes have risen by about 75% and 50%, forcing many residents to keep them out of the daily diet.Customers in a number of city localities, including South City, DLF, Sushant Lok and Malibu Towne, paid between Rs 75 to Rs 90 for a kilogram of tomatoes on Tuesday. The cost of tomatoes had earlier risen from Rs 30 to Rs 60 around the second week of June.Residents said that tomatoes are essential in any kitchen and the ever increasing prices have forced them to avoid using the fruit in any dish. Chirag Sahani of Sector 31 said, No more tomatoes in salads. The fruit is too expensive that I first thought my vegetable seller was joking about the rates.The prices of onions, potatoes and brinjals have also increased by Rs 20 per kilogram on an average. The prices are likely to rise further in the next couple of days because of a delay in supplies and as the local production has been exhausted.Even the wholesale prices are extremely high. We are trying to reduce our profit window so that the people do not have to pay excessively high amounts for vegetables. The customers are complaining daily but there is not much we can do about it, Jitender Kumar, a retail seller in Sector 40, said.Officials of Gurgaon agricultural marketing committee said that the rise in prices is only seasonal.As the monsoon arrives, prices of vegetables start rising.

We are depending on supplies from Himachal Pradesh, but because of the rain and road blockades, the trucks are not able to reach here on time, Deen Mohammad, state agriculture officer (Haryana), said."

He gets up at dawn to supervise the harvesting of his tomato crop, spread over 45 acre of lush green field. Some days are more hectic when tomatoes are loaded onto a truck bound for Azadpur mandi in Delhi or Attari border in Amritsar.The climate in Nimar is favorable for growing tomatoes- both the desi and hybrid varieties. Besides catering to the domestic market, we export tomatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal by road, Mourya told HT.The hybrid variety of tomato is in great demand in Pakistan where they use it for making meat curries while the small desi variety is much sought after in Nepal, he said.Like Mourya, many farmers in Khargone and Ratlam districts export tomatoes to Pakistan. The trade takes place through export agencies in Amritsar via the Attari-Wagah border. While business was good in 2015, this year, exports have plunged as Pakistan has harvested good tomato crop due to an unusually warm winter.During the peak season in October-November, 50-60 trucks, each with a capacity of 15 tonne, pass through the border every day. Tomatoes are mainly sourced from Nashik in Maharashtra and MP, Sanjiv Puri, an Amritsar-based custom house agent, told HT over the phone.Cold climate is not suitable for tomato crop, especially in areas where there is frost and snowfall so the yield is poor in Pakistan, said Krishnapal Singh, Shivpal Mouryas younger brother. Few people know that tomato prices have crashed in the domestic market not only due to arrival of fresh crop but also because of oversupply as exports to Pakistan through the Wagah border are almost negligible this season, he said.State agriculture director ML Meena said, Areas under tomato cultivation in the state has gone up due to the growing demand in the domestic as well as overseas markets.Tomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in quality, he said.Shortages of tomatoes in Pakistan give handsome returns to growers in MP, farmers said. We get more than double the price in Pakistan compared to the domestic prices but then the transportation costs are higher, said Anoopchand, a farmer who exported tomatoes worth Rs 1.10 crore in 2015.Exports to Bangladesh will pick up in March and we also export to Nepal where the small-sized desi varieties are in demand as they use whole tomatoes in their recipes, he said.The tomato crop, which takes three to four months to mature, is grown twice a year- in July-October period and in November-February.Hybrid versus desiTomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in qualityFor hybrid tomato, two different varieties of tomato plants are combined to produce a variety with beneficial traits from both the parents. Some of the benefits include improved disease resistance, higher-quality fruit and bigger size. Hybrid tomatoes, which have longer shelf life, are often more expensive.In numbers70.23 lakh hectares: Tomato cultivation area in MP (2015)90 tonnes: Average tomato yield in MP (per hectare production)Rs 16 per kg: Average domestic wholesale prices in Oct-Nov 2015Rs 25 per kg: Pakistans average import price in Oct-Nov 2015"
