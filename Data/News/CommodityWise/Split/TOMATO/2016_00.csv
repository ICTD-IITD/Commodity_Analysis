We have enough tomato and other vegetables stocks, which we import from India only in case of shortages in the domestic market,"" he said.The reason behind the ""suspension"" of cotton imports from India was, nevertheless, different, he said.""No. We have not stopped cotton imports from India. It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions. We're looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong,"" Shami said.He said only those cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes where importers had already secured permits from his department and carried phyto-sanitary certificates.""Our cotton consignments are not being allowed to enter Pakistan through Wagah and Karachi for reasons known to the ministry but cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn is being brought in without any let or hindrance. At least 11 trucks of Indian yarn entered Pakistan on Thursday when the department stopped cotton consignments from coming to this side of the border,"" a textile factory owner told Dawn.He said the suspension of cotton import from India would create a huge problem for the textile exporters as the truncated domestic crop target of 11.25 million bales for this year appeared difficult if not impossible to meet.""The industry requires 14 million bales. We will still be short by three million bales of cotton even if the crop target is achieved,"" he said.He said cotton shortages after the ban on Indian imports would make domestic prices shoot up at the expense of exports.Pakistan had imported 2.7 million bales of cotton (1 bale is 170 kgs) - about 40 per cent of India's total cotton exports in 2015-16 - due to crop failure that wiped off 0.5 per cent of GDP growth. The industry is expecting to import 2 million bales this year."

Rivlin appreciated the work carried out by Indo-Israel projects and remarked that Haryana had developed same technologies as Israel. ""Cooperation is something that not only goes between governments, but also between people. We are happy to share what we have our experiences and knowhow. We appreciate India for using Israeli technologies and for improving understanding between people and government.""When asked about technologies India can still learn from Israel, he said, ""We are good not only in agriculture, but also in fields of security and water management. Israel is a dry state.

The team noticed considerable content of morpholine and its derivatives in over a dozen fruits and vegetables collected from supermarkets.Morpholine oleate is a chemical which is mixed with wax to give an 'attractive' look to fruits and vegetables. It gives a fresh and shiny look and kills fungi and bacteria.India does not have any rules and regulations regarding the use of Morpholine oleate because of which its use goes unchecked. The chemical is as dangerous as carbide particularly when it combines with atmospheric and dietary nitrates to form the harmful chemical N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR). Excessive intake of NMOR can cause cancer and damage the foetus in pregnant mothers. It is banned in the UK and other European countries. However in Hyderabad it is being freely used by sellers.""Pilot studies conducted by us indicate presence of Morpholine in some fruits and vegetables purchased from local super market in Hyderabad,"" the researchers said in their study published in the recent issue of the scientific journal, The International Journal of Science Technology and Engineering (IJSTE). The team found average concentration of morpholine of 0.171 mgkg in tomato, 1.831 mgkg in carrots and 0.342 mgkg in capsicum. ""Though the levels are below the acceptable range of 0.48 mgkg body weightday, it does not rule out the risk of formation of NMOR if consumed directly and continuously.Considering the fact that formation of NMOR may lead to cancer over a period of time it is certainly not a situation to be ignored,"" the study warned. Less than 0.3 parts per million of Morpholine may not cause harm to people The study said people should ""wipe, wash and soak fruits and vegetables in water for a longer time"" to reduce the harmful impact of the chemical. The team also suggested that people ""not fall prey to bright and dark colour of fruits and vegetables"" and use local and seasonal fruits and vegetables for a healthy life."

Cost of veggies imported from other states, however, has increased 10% to 30% with shortfall in supply because of transportation hassles. Similarly, rate of seasonal fruits imported from other states and countries have increased by 35% to 50%.Wholesale dealer at the galla mandi Manish Rastogi said potatoes are perishable in nature and come from nearby areas like Kannauj. Since these farmers are not able to get their produce transported to other states, they are dumping the crop in the local market, leading to crash in prices by 50%. Similar is the situation with cauliflower, cabbage and other locally grown season vegetables whose prices have gone down by 30%-75%.Prices of onion and peas has gone up 30% and 8%, recently in the past one month because of drop in supply .Onions are imported from Madhya Pradesh and Maha rashtra and peas from Punjab.""Following the currency crisis, transporters are not running their fleets in full strength. As a result, we are not receiving sufficient supply,"" said Ajay Yadav at Chinhat Mandi. This is also responsible for rise in prices of fruits.Price of tomatoes, which are imported from Karnataka, however, has gone down 10%.The reason, say vegetable dealers, is the highly perishable nature of the vegetable.Retailers said they are forced to sell vegetables at low prices because of drop in demand. ""Those who can afford are preferring super markets for cashless purchase. Earlier, they used to come to us to buy fresh vegetables. This has also led to drop in demand,"" said Rehmat Ali, a greengrocer in Dandaiya market. Sale has also dropped because of lack of loose change. ""People give us Rs 2,000 note and we don't have change, so no transaction takes place,"" said Rajendra Prasad at Nishatganj mandi.Vishakha Dubey, a school teacher who had come to buy fruits said first of all you need to carry change loads the purse and then the prices of fruits have shot up as there are not enough Rs 100 notes in the market."

He secured a bank loan for the onion crop last year, but his hopes were dashed soon after the yields started fetching prices much less than his expectations.The Galande family owns 4.25 acres of land in Bhoyegaon, 14 km from Chandwad taluka in Nashik district, and 23-year-old Somnath was the youngest of three brothers. He ended his life by consuming poison on December 5.After having passed his Class XII exams from a local college, Somnath was the most educated member of the family. All his three brothers are married and work in their own farm as well as in other farms.Somnath's mother Shakuntalabai told TOI that her son had studied in college and was handling the economic affairs of the house. ""However, every year after the produce was sold in the market and income tallied, the balance in hand would upset him. He wanted to construct cement walls for our house, but there was never a significant remainder in his hands.""Rambhaji said his son Somnath secured a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh from Corporation Bank. ""Somnath was delighted with the good monsoon this year and was hopeful of good returns for the produce. But when that failed to materialize, he was very upset. He remained away from the family affairs for two months, but we thought it was a temporary phase,"" he said, adding, ""We never had an inkling that he would take such an extreme step.""Somnath's brother, Vasant, said, ""My brother was looking for jobs in Chandwad and would visit people. He would also work in the fields with us.""""Somnath and we discussed the loan and also the mounting interest on it. We were hopeful of getting some profit this season. But the returns for vegetables, tomatoes and onions were not encouraging and he lost hope. I have also lost all hopes now,"" said Rambhaji."

As a result of low demand, prices of vegetables have also come down drastically.Around 5 lakh tribals in 11 mandals of Visakha agency depend on these weekly markets near their villages. More than 30 weekly markets operate per week in all mandals. Of these, 10 to 13 major markets transact business of more than Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.25 crore per day.The major weekly markets take place at Seeleru, Chintapalli, Pedabayalu, Araku, Paderu, Sunkarametta, Guttulaputtu Maddigaruvu, G Madugula, Hukumpeta, Darakonda, Minumuluru, Kinchumanda and Lammasingi. Traders come from Vijayawada, Rajahmundry and Visakhapatnam as well as from some parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh come to these markets where commercial crops and vegetables are sold.""The yield of many vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and carrot have come down this season. If you do not sell it, they will rot. So we are selling the vegetables for less price as we don't have any storage facility in the agency areas. Tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers rot within a few days,"" P Ramarao Dora, one of the farmers of Hukumpet mandal, said.Prices of various vegetables have come down drastically in the last 12 days since the central government announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.

Nagaraju asked.Amidst the currency crunch, the weekly market in Pedabayalu did business of Rs 50 lakh last Monday against its original average sale of Rs 1.25 crore. The other markets have not done much, sources said.Majority of the tribal farmers are visiting the post offices in their panchayat limits to change the old notes as Visakha agency has only 15 to 20 banks and below 10 ATMs across 11 mandals.

58d6ae71a3d24b1894a69cee,Veggie wholesale prices crash,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Veggie-wholesale-prices-crash/articleshow/55847328.cms,2016-12-07,,The Times Of India,"KOLKATA: The wholesale price of vegetables has started dipping from Monday. However, there is little impact of on retail price. Thanks to the middlemen and the last man in the retail market, the price of vegetables remains quite high compared to their prices the same time last year. With the liquidity crunch continuing unabated, there is an element of distress sale at the source (from the field) by farmers. The overwhelming fear that the perishables may not be sold at all is also working behind the price crash.The potato (jyoti variety), which grows in abundance in Hooghly, is sold at Rs 4 per kg soon after its withdrawal from the cold storages. After sorting the potato, wholesale price stood at Rs 7-8 per kg. The retail price should have been Rs 910 per kg after taking into account the transportation and other costs. But the retail price remains as high as Rs 16-22 in most of the markets in the city. Thanks to demonetisation and the resultant liquidity crunch, a stockpile of 8 lakh tonnes of potatoes remained in the cold storages even after the deadline of clearing the stockpile expired on November 30. Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said the potato price should come down after the potato stockpile is cleared. He has set a deadline of December 8 for clearing the entire stock from the cold storages.The price of brinjal, which grow mainly in Hooghly and Burdwan, crashed to Rs 55-60 per palla (per 5 kgs). The wholesale price should not be more than Rs 15 per kg. But brinjal price in the city retail market hovered around Rs 25-30 per kg.Cabbage, which was Rs 35-40 per palla in the wholesale market, is sold at Rs 20 per kg in the city retail markets.The biggest crash happened in tomato prices. Toma toes grow in huge quantity in Bankura and Purulia. The farmers on Tuesday sold it at Rs 20 a palla. The tomato wholesale price at Khatra and Manbazar stood at Rs 6 per kg. But the retail price of tomato remains as high as Rs 20-25 per kg on Tuesday.Uttam Kundu, a wholesaler at Seoraphuli wholesale market, said, ""We have asked farmers to raise Rs 1 per kg against every vegetable so that farmers get some price. But the fear of liquidity crunch is so high that people did distress sale. The market has become a bit unpredictable.""Agriculture marketing department sources said there is a collusion of middlemen and the last man in the market (last retail outlet) that prevented the plunge in retail price.Dasgupta said, ""We are not sitting idle. We have already carried out raids at several retail markets."""

Only 5,000 crates of pomegranates were supplied by farmers, instead of the regular average of 15,000 crates. In Neera market, the auction of jaggery dropped by almost 50%, with the unloading of about 1,000 boxes as against the daily standard of 2,000 boxes. Meanwhile in Junnar , trade in fresh vegetables, onion, tomatoes and potatoes was down by 40%.Traders and farmers at these local markets have traditionally preferred transactions in cash, and were caught off-guard by the sudden announcement. The cancellation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has affected the payments, while purchases have also suffered. Even prices have dropped because of the low demand for farm produce.Officials in the agriculture produce market committee fear that more time would be required before things return to normal.An official attached to the market committee in Indapur said, ""Pomegranates have a huge market here, and a daylong auction registers transactions amounting to over Rs 50 lakh. This is peak season for pomegranate sales. We were expecting a rise in trade. However, for the last week, it has dropped drastically. Cash crunch forced traders and farmers to suspend auction because of the ban on cash transactions using demonetised notes. The auction finally resumed on Saturday to recover losses.""Local sources said that pomegranates had piled up in the orchards and if not sold soon, will rot, causing losses. So farmers and traders were left with no choice but to go ahead with trade.Soybean is ready for harvest in most parts of Baramati , and growers are likely to face losses if auction is not held.Even auctions of foodgrains like wheat, jowar, bajra, maize and soybean were completely halted for a week. The agriculture produce market committee said that supply of foodgrain dropped by almost 50% in last 10 days, and even traders were not unwilling to auction off their produce at lower prices. The committee was hopeful that action would resume on Monday. Local sources in Junnar-Ambegaon-Khed , which is predominantly known for cultivation of vegetables, said despite a good yield, business has taken a hit.Meanwhile, the government's latest move of increasing withdrawal limits for farmers, to Rs25,000, was met with scepticism. ""Cash is not available at most banks. Farmers cannot spend the entire day standing in queues in banks. Also, there are limited branches of nationalized banks in rural parts so farmers are badly hit,"" said Ashok Banker , a resident of Ambegaon area."

Their 'cash only' tags, they rued, only added to their miseries.Such was the plight of petty traders that many , specially in the Rythu Bazaars, were found slashing their prices by 30-35% or dumping their perishable stocks in waste bins. They claimed that they suffered major losses with footfalls dropping by 60-80 per cent. That is was a weekend didn't make matters any better.Mohd Bashir, a vendor operating out of the Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam, said, ""This has been happening for a few days now. Despite supply of vegetables dropping, we are unable to sell the entire supply .By the end of the day , we are forced to dump the leftover vegetables outside the bazaar, as transporting them and storing them is not possible for us.""The situation is no better at shops in Old City areas such as Lal Bazaar or the Falaknuma Rythu Bazaar.Another vendor, who was compelled to dump Friday's leftover tomatoes and cauliflowers into the bin on Saturday morning, pointed out that locals were even picking up leftover veggies to feed their cattle.""They are unable to buy feed due to the change crunch. So they are collecting the lefto vers,"" he said. Meanwhile, many vendors have gone from making daily payments to suppliers to depending on small loans and deferring payments.Nevertheless, they claim, their losses are running easily up to `2,000`3,000 per day . Abdulla Pasha, a vendor at the Kukatpally Rythu Bazaar , said, ""Even with the new cashless and cardless purchase system introduced here, many customers are unable to make purchases as their bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar number. Hoping for more customers today (Saturday) we had procured extra supply but now we have slashed prices by half.""Harinath, owner of Kevaiah Rice Mart at the Erragadda Rythu Bazaar said that even rice sales have dropped substantially. ""Number of customers have dropped from 100 to 20 per day now. While earlier I used to refill my supplies every two weeks, now it looks like it will take a month before I can finish the current lot,"" he lamented."

But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

As wasted fruits and vegetables fill the area and raise a stink, estimates show that at least 60-70% of the produce is going waste because supply chain has been disrupted by cashlessness. It is the same situation at most mandis that come under Uttar Pradesh State Agricultural Produce Markets Board.On Wednesday morning, potato buyer and whole seller Mohammad Salim ordered throwing 25 sacks into the garbage dump. A single sack contains 1 quintal potatoes. ""An average of 20-25 sacks are going waste since demonetisation was announced,"" said the businessman.His son Mohammad Shaan said wastage over the month was to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh. ""We would have sold the produce to retailers at an estimated rate of Rs 5 per kg which means Rs 12,500 for 25 quintals. If the average for 28 days of demonetization period is calculated, our loss stands at Rs 3.5 lakh,"" he said.But Salim is not the only one to have run into losses. The mandi comprises 50 buyers and at least 500 farmers in the vicinity. ""Cash and change crunch has upset business across levels. Over 60-70% of the produce is wasted for lack of demand. If this goes on, the mandi will have to close down,"" said Arvind Shukla, vice-president of the mandi's vegetable and fruit whole sellers association.General secretary Irshad Hussain added, ""Many farmers are not able to bring their produce to us because they have no money for transport. Some of the growers are dumping their produce either for peanuts at the local level or leaving it to fate. Even those who can manage are not able to get the cost of ferrying goods as prices have nose-dived.""Explaining the price factor, Saroj Pal, a dealer in tomatoes said, ""In October, a crate of tomatoes (25kg) sold at Rs 700 but a farmer gets only Rs 100 for the same now. Clearly, the rates have come down seven times.""Cauliflower, the cash crop of the past two seasons is making farmers regret. ""A single bud is fetching just 1 rupee instead of Rs 6-8 each last season,"" said Dharmu Lodhi, a farmer from Bangermau.Wastage at the fruit sellers' end was estimated to be around 40-50%. Tanveer Ahmed, who dealt with exotic fruits like kiwis , kinnows and grapes said, ""We dealt with these fruits on a daily basis but there have been just one or two business days in the week. The stock is going waste on a daily basis.""Tomato farmer from Rajpur (MP), Angad Singh said ""Will Modiji pay for our losses?"" Nizam Bhai pyazwale said, ""Many farmers had taken loans... the bid to battle black money is fine but not at the cost of human lives. Steps have to be taken immediately,"" he said.Hand-to-mouth locals are perhaps the only happy ones in the mandi because some vendors are giving away their vegetables free. Potato dealer Mohammad Irshad said, ""It will be disrespect of the Almighty if food is thrown away so it is better some human consumes some it without paying."" Beneficiary of this benevolence, Gita from Birdibagh said, ""I will use the best part for the family while feed the cattle on the rest."""

She hands out a kilogram of tomatoes free if a family has constructed a toilet in its house.Sharanamma Bakar, from Danapur village of Gangavati taluk, thought of this unusual incentive when she realized that about 500 of the village's 1,300 families don't have a loo of their own.Sharanamma goes to every nook and corner of the village, educates people on the need of having a toilet in each house and also why it's important to keep the environment neat and hygienic. And she's not offloading tomatoes because of the glut in production.The vendor told TOI she buys 120 kg of tomatoes shelling out about Rs 3,500 from the wholesale market every day. ""I've been selling vegetables for 25 years to eke out a living. I am a fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who's encouraging people to build toilets in their houses as part of the Swachh mission,"" she said.Like thousands of villages in the country, Koppal's Danapur has many villagers who walk a long distance or wait for the dusk to set in to relieve themselves in the open. ""When I go door to door with my Swachh campaign, I tell them about the health benefits of having a toilet in each house. I also give them details of financial support offered by the Union government to construct toilets,"" she said.The woman vendor has handed out nearly 300 kg of tomatoes as part of her campaign, suggesting she has seen at least as many families having built a toilet in their house. ""Sometimes, I have gifted a kilo of tomatoes to families which are willing to build a toilet. I will do this campaign for some more time,"" she said.Channamma, from the village, said, ""The woman vendor is doing an incredible job. She came to our house and enquired about the toilet mission. When we replied in the affirmative, she gave us tomatoes.""Danapur gram panchayat president Mahammad Shafi said Sharanamma has set an example for others by launching a voluntary campaign and parting with vegetables for a noble cause. ""After she started the initiative, more and more people have approached us with queries about the Swachh mission."""

It was then that Shankar Swami arrived in Kashi and cooked khichdi (dal-rice and different vegetables) for Lord Shiva and satiated his hunger.""Swamiji would prepare khichdi with donation from pilgrims at a pedestal raised on Dedhsi bridge at Dashaswamedh temple and serve the needy, poor and the homeless. He came to be known as Khichdi Baba,"" says Sanjay Maharaj.He said that Makar Sankranti, also known as `Khichdi', was named after Khichdi Baba.Khichdi is a customary food item prepared on Makar Sankranti. The trend is believed to have been started by Lord Shiva.But Khichdi was introduced to Lord Shiva by Khichdi Baba and this is the reason the festival is named after him, said Sanjay, adding that the place where Khichdi Baba used to cook was given the shape of a temple and the bust of Khichdi Baba and his disciple Harihar Baba had been installed by the family.Sharing an anecdote narrated by his father Rajendra Prasad Maharaj, Sanjay says that during the British rule, a British Army man had sent the then-Khichdi Baba to jail. That very day, the officer's family members fell ill and their condition started worsening. A local then reminded the officer of his behaviour towards Baba and the Englishman released him from jail. The next moment his family members were as fit as a fiddle.That was the power of Khichdi Baba, he says.According to Sanjay, Bhandaras are run everyday from 7am and needy people who throng the temple are served hot khichdi prepared with as many as 10 types of vegetables including, cauliflower, brinjal, potato, tomato, bittergourd, and others.In one round, more than 200 people are fed khichdi. The count crosses 600 almost everyday, he said, adding that on Mondays and Saturdays, the count of people crosses 800 as both days belong to Baba and it is customary to eat khichdi every Saturday ."

However, farmers are having to bear the brunt of the situation, as they are failing to get sufficient returns on their harvest. The impact was evident with the suicide of a farmer in Mansa, who reeled under losses.Nitin Patel, 37, a farmer from Chandala, said, ""The plummeting of wholesale prices for vegetables have spelled havoc for us. We grow chillies, cabbage and cauliflower on our three-bigha farm. Of these, we harvest about eight tonnes of cabbage in a season. However, cabbage is fetching wholesale price of Rs 2 per kg. Against this, we invest Rs10,000 for seeds, Rs5,000 for fertilizer, Rs2,000 for pesticides and Rs7,000 for labour.""The transportation cost to the respective APMCs adds to the cost, and therefore farmers are ending up with heavy losses. The situation is no different for farmers who harvest other vegetables such as pigeon peas and tomatoes among others.""We harvest pigeon peas (tuvar), which grows once in twelve months. If the weather conditions are not favourable, a large chunk of our crop is destroyed. We harvest around 6,000 kg of pigeon peas every year, for which we get a return of Rs 2,000 per quintal, which is not sustainable,"" said Jayantibhai Dabhi, another farmer from Sukhad village.Even as the export of tomatoes to Pakistan has halted, prices have gone down and the market supply is high putting farmers in loss. ""Tomatoes are being sold at a wholesale price of Rs2 per kg. We invest close to Rs 1 lakh over a period of four months to harvest around 30,000 kg tomatoes. However, what we are getting in return is only about half our investment,"" said Hemant Patel, a 35-year-old farmer."

However, the closure of markets dashed their hopes again. As the auctions at the market yards in Nashik and Girnare had been halted for the last few days, some of the farmers even had to throw away their produce.Lahanabai Fasaal, a farmer who grows tomatoes, said she incurred losses of 40 crates of tomatoes from November 15-18, adding up to a loss of Rs 40,000 per acre.""The markets were closed as the traders refused to pay. As they are perishable items, we had to throw away all the crates. On Monday, we went to the markets with our produce and things seem to improving gradually. But our loss was too much. The prices have come down,"" said Lahanabai.Many other farmers like Lahanabai had to face the wrath of their labourers. ""I could not pay my farm labourers because the produce was not sold and the labourers were not ready to take the banned currency notes which they could have exchanged or deposited at the banks,"" Lahanabai said.Another farmer, Dhondya M, who sends most of his produce to Vasai market, had to throw away 20-25 crates of cabbage and tomato. ""As I knew that the markets were closed, I did not send the crates with my produce to the market. From Monday, we started sending the crates to Vasai,"" said Dhondya.The opening of markets has not helped the farmers though. A tomato grower, Vaman Tople said, ""Even though the markets have opened now, it is still slack. We are getting less value for our produce. All the traders give us Rs 2,000 notes, but nobody gives us change. We have faced heavy losses due to the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."""

In distant rural areas, local vegetable prices  both wholesale and retail  have crashed as the oxygen of currency has been suddenly sucked out. Since the whole economy depended on cash, from transport to mandis to purchase prices, this is unsurprising.But in cities, where there is more liquidity, vegetable arrivals in mandis have increased and wholesale prices have dropped but, surprise, retail prices have remained largely unaffected or are only slightly lower.An analysis of arrivals and prices data from 29 big cities from major states and Delhi shows that for a range of common vegetables, arrivals in mandis have actually gone up since November 8 when 500 and 1,000-rupee notes were rendered invalid. There has been an increase in arrivals of vegetables in many cities across India, including Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Patna and Guwahati.Wholesale traders in Delhi say this was driven by the fact that cash payments were still possible in bigger cities, unlike small rural markets. So, in the surrounding areas, there was a move to sell the produce in urban areas.As a result, barring okra (bhindi) and onions, the quantities of common vegetables like cauliflower, potato, tomato, cabbage, gourds, chillies, brinjal and peas reaching daily in wholesale markets of these cities increased by 10-30% between the week preceding November 8 and the fortnight following it. This should have led to falling vegetable prices for urban consumers. But that was not to be.Wholesale traders seem to have bargained with the desperate producers to push down wholesale or purchase prices substantially but did not pass on the full benefit to consumers. In all the big cities, data shows wholesale prices dipping in the post-demonetisation fortnight compared to the week before. In Delhi, for example, cauliflower, brinjal (round) and cabbage wholesale prices fell by over 50% each, peas and potatoes by about 40% and tomatoes by 13%.Onion prices increased by 14%, possibly because it is not as perishable as other vegetables and hence it was being held back. Okra prices increased by 23% for unknown reasons. But at the local sabziwallah, prices are at their usual levels, except for a downward trend in cauliflower, brinjal and cabbage  all dipping by over a third post-demonetisation.Onion prices have increased by 21%, reflecting the rise in wholesale prices. ""This is the rate we are getting at the mandi. The wholesalers are making money, not us,"" said Mangat Ram, a vegetable seller in East Delhi who claimed that his sales had dipped since November 8."

Vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, potato, tomato, brinjal, gourd, radish, carrot and capsicum are being sold at a far lower price as compared to those of last year.Meanwhile, prices of staples like wheat flour, fine wheat flour, pulses and sugar have increased by around Rs 10 to 20 per kg.""Since there is a decline in the quantity coming from outside, the prices are on the higher side,"" said Jayesh Tandon, a wholesaler."

Express Sandeep Mohans latest film Shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer who grapples with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life. ExpressIF life throws stones and tomatoes at him, he would collect it and make a comedy about Stones and Tomatoes. Thats Sandeep Mohan for you, an indie filmmaker and the man behind The Great Indian Travelling Cinema initiative. As part of this initiative, his latest film Shreelancer was in Chandigarh recently. Shreelancer narrates the story of a freelancer named Shree,in his mid 20s, as he tries to grapple with nagging self-doubts about pursuing an artistic life.Watch what else is making news:Unlike my earlier films  Love Wrinkle Free & Hola Venky, which were termedcomedies, Shreelancer might be slotted as drama. Also in my previous films, the protagonists were in their mid 30sin Shreelancer, for the first time, I am delving into the mind of a mid-20s freelancer. It is a contemporary story told in an engaging manner, says Mohan, who has developed his own kind of cinema  guerilla style, candid, witty, full of observations and reflections on life and people. Cinema for him is a constant process for exploration, and he hopes he doesnt discover fully what cinema is, because then the charm goes out. I want the mystery and magic to remain forever.With the final mix of Shreelancer over just 10 days back, this is the first screening of the film in Chandigarh. Mohan is also travelling with it to alternative spaces across the country as part of his The Great Indian Travelling Cinema experiment. One of the reasons for screening here was that a few of the cast members are from Chandigarh  Chandan Singh Gill, Karanveer Khullar, Vivek Sharma, Krishan Rathee, Nikhar DanielI also shot a part of the film here. There is something charming and big-hearted about this city, says Mohan.Born in Jabalpur, he moved to Mumbai at the age of 21. Being an independent spirit who prefers to learn by making mistakes rather than be taught by an authoritative figure, independent cinema seemed to be the right choice for Mohan. For someone who consciously stays away from film festival circuit and is allergic to the censor board, he conceptualised The Great Indian Travelling Cinema. A one man experiment, Mohan travels to various cities and screens his film. The idea is to see the film with an audience and learn something, while watching and interacting with them. Since my films fall between mainstream and film festival films, I have to see for myself that there is an audience for my films and travelling cinema screenings help. I soak in the energy, feel motivated, and then go back and write another film exactly the way I want to, reassured that there is an audience. However, he would love to go through the festival route for his films. Ideally one would want a right mix of a limited theatrical release, film fest rounds, travelling cinema screenings and a good online release on bigger platforms. To sell the film in India and for satellite rights etc, you need a censor. So, I might have to take one for Shreelancer. It was for my last film Hola Venky that I refused to take a censor and went around travelling and screening it in 92 cities, he says.Its a space where survival is tough, and Mohan feels one has to be very strong internally and think long term. Indie filmmaking wont make you rich but happier especially if you have creative control and if you go about it a little smartly, then you can even survive well. Money will follow for there are better things to run after in life, he adds. He agrees that with Netflix and Amazons coming in, viewing habits will changeit is good time for filmmakers who budget their films correct and tell a good story. As for demonetisation, I downloaded the Paytm app and ask people to pay through it after My Great Indian Travelling Cinema screenings.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The cool weather is not kind to those with joint and bone problems. Though doctors say little can be done to avoid the ill feeling, precautions can be taken to ease it. From keeping oneself warm to making sure one gets enough exercise, inflammation can be controlled if attention is paid.Consulting orthopedic surgeon Dr Rajesh Badiyani said people already suffering from arthritis or other orthopedic disease are more prone to morning stiffness.""For many people winter is welcoming, but for arthritic patients it can be a pain. The weather affects them differently i and it is different from person to person,"" a he said while suggesting that exercising, walking and moving about are the best way to ensure that joints don't stiffen. Dr Prashanth Agarwal , consulting orthopedic, Apollo Hospital , said, ""In some people, frigid temperatures may worsen inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and joint pain, affecting the hips, knees, elbows, shoulders and hands.""Researchers aren't sure why cold weather makes us so stiff and sore, but one the ory , based on a small study , is that inflamed joints swell as barometric pressure drops.The swelling irritates the nerves around the joints, causing pain. ""There is also less supply of blood to the peripheral regions of the body due to which one's joints become stiff, causing pain,"" he said.To keep bones less painful, doctors suggest exercises. Being a couch potato is bad for the joints. Exercises help lubricate them to prevent pain. Walking can reduce joint pain and stiffness, keeping people flexible. ""Exercises can boost a person's mental and physical state. Stretching and exercises with light weights are good, as they strengthen the knee muscles and improve flexibility ,"" added Dr Agarwal.Apart from starting your day basking in the sun, it is also important to include foods rich in vitamins in your diet.""Foods like spinach, cabbage, tomatoes and oranges are rich sources of vitamins and minerals. These vitamins play a vital role in the production of bone cartilage and tissue,"" said a doctor."

She knew this was the best opportunity to realize her long-cherished dream of cultivating her own vegetables and herbs, and she immediately roped in a gardener to help plant spinach, tomatoes, okra, lemons and chillies. Six months on, the entire family not only enjoys spending time in the balcony amid the plants, but also boasts of eating self-cultivated, pesticide-free vegetables at least once a week.A growing discussion about organic food appears to have rekindled an interest in gardening among many citizens, who are now experimenting with not just nourishing plants but also generating manure from their own kitchen waste as part of a conscious decision to move towards more sustainable living.As a result, sunny kitchen corners, balconies and terraces in high-rises , and small garden spaces around bungalow-style homes across the city are turning into 'green labs' with residents trying their hand at growing everything from easy-to-cultivate herbs and leafy greens to vegetables and fruits. Not only is the produce healthier than what is available in the markets, but tastes better too, in part sweetened by the hardwork put in by 'cultivators', who gain more than just good health.It's therapeutic and a deeply spiritual experience, says Meghana Kulkarni , a homemaker who has even been cured of several ailments since she set up a terrace garden at her bungalow in Kothrud. ""I started about 18 months ago and now grow everything from chillies to tomato, pumpkin, gourds, brinjal, herbs and leafy vegetables. I had a chronic problem of thyroid, then swine flu, high BP and even depression. All these were cured as I started eating self-cultivated produce. We now manage to do cook the produce at least four to five times a week. The taste is completely different and we even manage to eat some of it in its raw form, including okra. I am in a meditative state when I am in the garden,"" she said.It's fairly easy to do it, once you understand the technique, shared Aruna Shelke, a resident of Hinjewadi, who has also set up a kitchen garden at her ground floor home. ""Even a small balcony is enough to start a kitchen garden, if it can fit 10-12 pots. I am growing a variety of vegetables. One need not spend more than a few minutes every day. Some basic skills, like how to tie-up the tomatoes, or other fruits, etc, can ensure that the plants stay in good condition,"" she said.It's the best thing one can do for the family's health, said Dnyaneshwar Bodke, president of Abhinav Farmers Club. The association helps people set up kitchen gardens and imparts daylong training for their maintenance. ""Instead of wasting time in the gym, we suggest people register with us to devote about half-hour everyday for their plants,"" he said."

In Unnao district, farmers haven't been able to sell their paddy as buyers are offering to pay in the old currency. Over 70% of perishables are on the verge of rotting. In the case of tomatoes and potatoes, losses are over 80%.In Bengal, Chintamoni Pakhira (54) of Singur had to borrow cash at 11.5% from a moneylender because he was running out of time to harvest his 7 bighas of kharif paddy. This raised his production cost. The loan and anxiety about getting the right price in the middle of the liquidity squeeze haunt him.In UP, the rabi crop is threatened, farmers don't have money for seeds and fertilisers. Many farmers are being coerced into ""futures trading"". ""A seed bhandar told me he'd give seeds on credit but I'd have to repay thrice the amount six months later,"" said Bhuvesh, a farmer in Subhani Khera.Another says he hasn't any funds left to buy fertilisers, so his crop will die. For Chintamoni, in Bengal, time is money. The rabi season has begun and, already late in harvesting the old crop, he's unsure about re-sowing in time. Farmers in rural MP, it appears, faced lesser hardship.They managed to sow their lands, but with a slight delay due to the cash drought. According to official figures, the area sown this season has increased by 1.7 lakh hectares compared to last year. ""Farmers don't have much to do with cash.Compared to cities, things are better in the villages,"" said agriculture production commissioner Prem Chand Meena. Rajkumar Rathore, a farmer from Sehore , agreed. ""Cash is required, but not like other works in farming (sic).""UP's farmers fear that with no crop or very low yields, they'll won't be able to feed their families. Vinay Kumar of Purva village has decided to go to Lucknow and work as a labourer to run his family.Bengal's Chintamoni says smaller farmers are the worst hit. ""I can somehow survive. But small farmers have no option but to struggle,"" he said. The cash crunch has created problems in rural MP. About 15 residents of Sheikhpura village in Sehore are jobless because the tile factory that employed them has stopped working."

One of the boys standing in the patient queue before the ATM kiosk on the other side of the road walked up to him and said, ""Do you take money on Paytm?"" When Akhtar said, ""No"", he replied with a degree of helpless resignation, "" Cash nahi hai mere paas. Paytm hota to achha hota (I don't have cash. It would have been nice, if you were using Paytm).""The scene and dialogue was repeated over the next few days. Several youngsters from the adjacent New Ashok Nagar colony would pose the same query. In regular circumstances, Akhtar wouldn't have spared much thought to the persistent question. For the past two years, the 35-year-old from Bihar's Samastipur district has been peddling vegetable biryani from a mobile food stall near the New Ashok Nagar metro station. For Rs 30 a plate, he serves a decent helping of the flavoured rice garnished with slices of soyabean chop, tiny pieces of paneer, tomato chutney, chopped onion and chilli pickle. And business is generally brisk.But last month his sales plunged after Prime Minister Narendra Moditriggering a sudden shortfall of currency. Daily-wagers, auto-rickshaw drivers, college students and young executives - the bulk of his customers were not turning up. ""I often took back home kilos of unsold biryani. For about a week, I stopped coming here,"" says Akhtar, who goes by the name Aman-ji. When he resumed business, the customers returned but not in the same numbers as in pre-notebandi days. Some would still ask about the option of paying through Paytm.So when an executive from the mobile wallet company came by a week ago and offered him the option of taking payments through the mobile wallet, Akhtar reluctantly decided to give it a try. The biryani seller was uncertain because it meant having to part with a small portion of his earnings as the company's commission. And though, he is ""inter pass,"" Akhtar wasn't fully sure how the technology would work.It is easy to understand Akhtar's hesitance. Like millions of other migrants, the son of a daily-wager came to Delhi in search of a better life about 15 years ago. The third among seven brothers and sisters, he did a variety of odd jobs in the NCR before finding his true calling: selling biryani. The food cart sustains his family- his wife and three kids.He wakes up around 5 am, helps his wife prepare the biryani and sets up his roadside cart by 8 am. The hawking is done by 4.30 pm. A brief rest at home and he sets off to the grocers to buy all that he needs the next day. Has he ever considered selling chicken or mutton biryani? The migrant mumbles something about wanting to sell "" shudh khana .""Akhtar is cagey about divulging details of his daily returns. And he doesn't want to reveal the number of customers who use the mobile wallet. ""About 10-12 customers every day,"" he says after a little cajoling. During the two hours TOI spent interviewing him, four customers paid through Paytm. A couple of others were requested to pay in cash if they were carrying currency. The biryani seller explains why. ""I would have to stand in a bank queue again to get my money. So I prefer people paying in cash. But when they say, they don't have any, I let them use Paytm,'' he says.One such customer is Sumendra Singh, a 26-year-old who works in the customer services division of a mobile phone company. ""I am short of cash. There's too much work and no time to stand in the queue. I haven't even brought my wallet,"" he says.This month, as usual, the company transferred Singh's salary to his bank account. He shifted Rs 1,000 to his mobile wallet. At the food cart, Singh scans the Paytm bar code and transfers Rs 30 to Akhtar's mobile phone. "" Zara mobile check kar lijiye. Mera payment aur number ka message aa gaya hoga (Check your mobile. You would have got a message about my payment and phone number),"" he says. Akhtar asks for the last four numbers of the customer's mobile number, looks into his own phone and serves him.Slowly and cautiously, the migrant from Bihar has embraced the world of mobile wallet business."

But before it could capitalise on natures bounty, the demonetisation exercise delivered a body blow to agriculture and its allied sectors, which primarily deal in cash. The prices of vegetables  both at the wholesale and retail level -- have crashed, leaving farmers, especially the small and marginal ones, in a perilous situation. Most farmers are still dependent on cash for their daily dealings and those engaged in growing vegetables have no support mechanism to hold their crop for long as it is perishable. The result: Last week, at two wholesale markets in Madhya Pradesh, onions were sold for Re 1 per kilogramme. Similarly, tomatoes cost less than Rs 2 per kg in Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh.Read: Farmers hit as vegetable prices crash down after demonetisationWhat is worse is that these farmers will not be eligible for any crop insurance schemes because those are valid only in case of natural calamities such as droughts and floods. Demonetisation is a new phenomenon and so it has never been factored into the list of events that are eligible for insurance cover. Agriculture and the allied sectors  forestry and fishing  account for about 16% of the GDP but more importantly, 60% of India is linked to agriculture. About 40% of the total agriculture loans go towards kharif crops while the rest is given for rabi crops.Read: Workers laid off for refusing to accept salary in demonetised notesIn the last two years, the NDA government has undertaken a host of measures to support the farm sector: First, public sector banks have been given an agriculture credit target of Rs 9 lakh crore for 2016-17, up from Rs 8.5 lakh crore in the previous financial year; second, it has launched the national crop insurance programme, the soil health card and the Krishi Sichai Yojana. Third, the agriculture market committees are also being revamped. But these measures will need time to create the safety net that the farmers need. But the key question that remains now is this: Who will compensate the farmers for crop losses due to demonetisation?"

Nonetheless, it was an interesting and engaging play. I enjoyed my time watching it.""Actor Ranvir Shorey told us, ""Rajat has done adaptations of Shakespearean plays and presented it with clowns, but I found this project to be exciting because we explore the world of clowns, who exude darker emotions.""

If I were to stand in a bank line one day, who will man my stall?"" he asked.Junaid Khan, a vegetable seller on Minto Road, said he had not yet dropped prices, but a lot of his sale was done on credit. ""I know most of my customers. I am doing business in the hope that they will pay me soon,"" he said."

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Even a few years ago, it was rather difficult to get hold of well-grown, leafy greens and exotic vegetables to replicate the taste Jadhav had developed for healthy and fresh foods.The frustration eventually bore solutions and Jadhav, with absolutely no background in farming, took to cultivating greens on her own, albeit at a friend's farm in Holkarwadi on the outskirts of the city. Now, Jadhav's venture has grown from the small, self-feeding model of exotic vegetables to a full-scale operation focusing on all aspects of organic farming , marketing and exporting the produce.By and by, more health-conscious citizens from the city have willingly given up their cushy, well-paying careers to get down and dirty and ensure that only chemical-free and pure farm produce reaches their dinner tables. While some are farming themselves, others are extending a helping hand to farmers engaged in organic cultivation near the city to help them scale up their operations.For Sus Road resident Sujit Agarwal, encouraging reviews from buyers tilted the decision in favour of taking up this work full time. From designing electronic chips for an Indian tech major in a plush air-conditioned office to tilling the land with farmers in and around Pune, Pandharpur, Nevasa, Dehu and Phaltan, the life-changing experience has seen the entire family interact with farmers, understand how they grow their produce and ensure that it reaches a growing customer base in the city.Describing the learnings of the two years since setting up My Farmer, Agarwal said, ""I took this up after reading about farming and farmer suicides as I wanted to do something meaningful. After reviewing our financial condition and lifestyle, my wife and I decided to take the plunge. There are quite a few farmers who have taken up chemical-free organic farming and they need a helping hand to reach out to buyers in the initial years. We started from our own residential society and gradually extended it to a six-kilometre radius. We now have a steady customer base that appreciates the distinct taste and flavour of natural produce including everyday vegetables, fruits, even pulses and rice. The rates are fairly competitive to the market prices but it is insignificant if one considers the quality.""The demand for exotic vegetables in the city is steady and encouraging, says Jadhav, who specializes in organic cultivation of broccoli, golden and red cherry tomatoes, salad leaves, zucchini, red capsicum, among others. She is also marketing other farmers' produce and extends technology know-how to cope with agricultural challenges like water scarcity, going soil-free, etc."

But the mobile ATMs of the State Bank of India were seen attracting crowds in many places, including Thiruparankundram constituency which will go to poll on November 19.Among the affected population were attenders of patients who had been admitted to the corporate hospitals in the city. ""The billing for the patient is being done using the swipe machine, but I am not able to buy even a tender coconut for want of notes in smaller denominations,"" said K Thangavel of Manamadurai, who has a relative admitted at the hospital.Finding change for the bus fare to come and visit the patient has also become a problem, he said.Many like Thangavel are bringing food and other essentials from their homes itself so as to not face any issues. ""we are bringing puliyodharai or bread from our home towns so that we don't have to face the problems of finding change to eat at a hotel,"" said K Saraswathy , who was staying with her relative.Many of the smaller traders continue to be affected. ""I did a business of Rs300 last Monday, but my business today has come down to just Rs50. I am finding it difficult to sell even 25 per cent of the tender coconuts,"" said Ganapathy , a tender coconut seller at K K Nagar. ""This is such a sudden move. Many of us are struggling now and don't know if we will be able to recover,"" he said.Business has been affected at the Oddanchathiram flower market in Dindigul district, as the prices of vegetables has touched an all-time low, mainly due to the crisis caused by the demonetisation move. Farmers who brought their produce were wary of taking the Rs500 or Rs1,000 notes as traders were not able to give smaller denominations. The vegetables were being given away at throwaway prices. Tomatoes sold for Rs 2 at this wholesale market on Sunday.The cattle market in Oddanchathiram also does brisk business on Mondays - over 3,000 cattle were brought to the market last week. On Monday, only 300 animals were brought and farmers could not find a good price for most of them as, again, their counterparts were not ready to accept the old currency notes."

However, looking at the lukewarm response, they scaled it down to a ""Jan Akrosh Morcha "".The march in Nashik was, however, supported mainly by weavers who had come from Malegaon under the leadership of Congress MLA Rashid Ahmed.Only few prominent faces of Congress and NCP, including city and district unit presidents, made it to the morcha where they condemned government's policy of unearthing black money instead of bringing money deposited in foreign bank accounts.The member of legislative assembly, from Igatpuri, Nirmala Gavit also condemned the government for its laxity shown towards providing any relief to the people. ""We are not against demonetisation. But it pains to see that farmers are unable to sell their produce and are forced to throw it in the dump.

The banks are getting one-third of the cash needed. ""It is a precarious situation. The state economy is badly hit. Small and marginal farmers and small traders were severely affected,"" the minister told the assembly.Reminding that chief minister Naveen Patnaik had taken up the issue of cash crunch in cooperative banks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Amat said the state government has taken up the various problems arising out of demonetisation from time to time.Amat's reply came after the Congress members disrupted the assembly proceedings over growing inconvenience to people over demonetisation in the state forcing repeated adjournments while BJD members also raised the issue.During zero hour, Congress whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati pointed out that farmers were forced to throw tomatoes at a weekly market in Bargarh district on Thursday because there were no buyers due to severe cash crunch. Similarly, at another market in Koraput district brinjals were thrown by the farmers, he said.Since the wholesalers are reluctant to lift vegetables, the prices have fallen to dirt-cheap level. While tomato is being sold at Re 1 to Rs 2 by the farmers, brinjal is being sold at less than Rs 5. Even at such low prices, the vegetables remain unsold, Bahinipati said.BJD's Samir Ranjan Dash too raised the issue and said though the state had supported the Centre's move to curb black money, its implementation in the past one month exposed complete failure of the Modi regime. While Dash was speaking, the Congress members jumped into the well of the House seeking the finance minister's statement amid shouting of anti-government slogans. Deputy speaker Sananda Marndi, who presided over, first adjourned the House for 15 minutes.When the House reconvened, BJD MLA Amar Prasad Satpathy started speaking on demonetisation criticising the Centre. However, as the Congress MLAs continued shouting anti-government slogans, the deputy speaker adjourned the House till 3pm. Post-lunch, the finance minister gave his statement. The House was adjourned till Tuesday and will reconvene on Wednesday.Speaking to the media outside the assembly, leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra said, ""It is an emergency like situation. People don't have money. The situation is worsening by the day."""

Soon, they will drop to the ground and wither away. A season's hard work wasted.Yet, for the progressive farmer from Chikkahasala village, it makes economic sense to let go of the tomato crop. Prices have fallen to a new low this season: with a 15kg box of tomatoes selling at Rs 20-40 at the APMC Yard in Kolar in the past few days, Muniyappa doesn't want to spend on labour and other expenses.It is not only Muniyappa, scores of big farmers have allowed the crop to die. Muniyappa attributes two factors to the low procurement price - the major one being demonetization of high-value currency notes, which he said has robbed many middle and upper middle class traders of their purchasing power. He said non-availability of money in banks has also contributed to a cut in buying.He said the other factor for low prices is that both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major tomato purchasing states from Kolar. Normally, between November and December, there would be at least a couple of cyclones in these two states which would have resulted in the crop loss, but with no cyclones in November and the beginning of December in these two states, the tomato crop there was good, leading to little demand for tomatoes grown in Kolar district, Muniyappa said.Byalahalli Govinda Gowda, president of Kolar District Cooperative Central Bank and a farmer, said that he has allowed his tomato crop, grown on about eight acres of land, to wither away. He said since the procurement price is very low, farmers are unable to even get the labour cost. He said in Kolar district alone, the tomato crop grown on over 25,000 acres has been allowed to wither away. He said a farmer will incur an expense of nearly 2 lakh per acre to grow the crop, and the demonetization effect has had a crushing impact on the farmers of Kolar district. He said the procurement prices of most of the vegetables grown in Kolar district have fallen as few people come forward to purchase vegetables at APMCs.CR Srinath, proprietor of CM Ramaiah Tomato Mandi in Kolar, said the traders have very little money in hand, and there is low demand for the crop. He said normal weather, which is conducive for the growth of tomatoes, that prevailed in most parts of the country, resulting in a good yield at various places, including Kolkata, Tamil Nadu and Bengal, and as such, there is little demand for the crop grown in Kolar district. He said during the past two days, 15-kg box of tomatoes was being sold for between Rs 10 and Rs 40."

He sold them for Rs 12 per kg. A week later, it was a dramatically different situation. The price had crashed to Rs 4 per kg. ""Nobody's picking up the stuff in the mandi now. Nuksan ho raha hai (I am suffering losses). The mandi guys are telling me that with shortage of currency, there's little demand at the retail level,"" he says.Another farmer, Virendra Dahiya, said, he had wholesaled the same vegetable for Rs 15 per kg at the mandi before the stunning currency measure announced on Nov 8 and has now been trading them for Rs 9-10 per kg.Those standing in the long queues before a PNB branch complain that cash comes and vanishes with the speed of a rumour.Currency shortage seems to have caused a ripple effect down the supply chain. And the consequence can be seen at the bottom of the pyramid.Ajaypal, who mainly grows vegetables over 16 bighas of land owned jointly by four brothers, is making adjustments to beat the blowback of notebandi, the term everyone uses to describe demonetization in these parts of rurban south-west Delhi.Another batch of cauliflowers would have been ready for the market in a couple of days. But the 46-year-old Jat farmer has stopped watering the plants. ""That would delay their growth. I want to hold on for a fortnight. Maybe we will get a better price after that,"" he says.A similar tactic to beat the falling rates has been employed by Jagbir Singh, a Jat farmer with 15 bighas of land in Asra, a village located in west UP's Hapur district. ""I will not harvest potato for 8-10 days. Let them stay where they are till the mandi rates improve,"" he told TOI last week.Once he has disposed of the cauliflowers and the radish, Ajaypal will sow tomatoes and peas. Like many in these parts with a cash flow problem, he is relying on the bond of traditional association that gets him seeds and fertilisers on loan. ""That's part of our dealings every year,"" he says. Dahiya says credit is part of every transaction in this urban village poised on the edge of south-west Delhi. ""Yahan to kirayedaar ka bhi udhaar chalta hai (Even the tenants pay you later,"") he says.Part of Ajaypal's land is fallow at the moment. He has just harvested jowar and now is ready to sow wheat. He's behind schedule by about 10-15 days. ""I will plant a late variety of wheat to compensate,"" the farmer says.Normally, at this time about 20 people would have been working in the field, says the farmer. But the delay means there are only two farmhands at work on Thursday after noon.Ajaypal pays them Rs 250 for a day's work. But he is unable to pay them in cash right now. Overall, he owes about Rs 4,000 to his other regulars who are now working elsewhere, he says. How much do the shortage of money and the losses bother him? His feelings are mixed. ""No 2 ke paise ko lagaam lag rahi hai (Black money is being brought under control),"" he says.Life is more difficult for Sharmila Devi, one of two daily wagers still working in Ajaypal's field. These days she carries vegetables home as part of her payment. Call it a form of barter or good old jugaad, adjustments like these keep the wheels turning for the marginal and the marginalized in times of the scarce rupee."

And when they do so with just a little more than regular home appliances, the interest only goes up.On Friday, chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar , bankers and farmer came together to think of ways to encourage youth to take up farming, one of the suggestions put forth was to make agriculture financially attractive. A disgruntled farmer even asked why a farmer could not have an AC car.The three engineers-turned-agri-entrepreneurs may not really have luxury sedans but they certainly farm in an air conditioned environment.The innovative idea came to three cousins, Sandeep Metri, Jagdish Naik and Ajay Naik , all in their early 30s. ""I am a foodie and I like to visit restaurants. I did some research and found that most of the exotic vegetables come from outside the state and are commercially using harmful pesticides,"" Ajay, a software engineer, said.The trio took up hydroponics, the technique of growing vegetables in water, which increases produce by 20-30%, while saving on water. Needless to say, the idea ruffled quite a few feathers within the family. ""Our family was surprised and said it was not for us. They said we would not succeed and were surprised that I shifted from IT to agriculture,"" Ajay adds.Ajay is no ordinary IT graduate. A former Persistent employee, he has two successful startups under his belt. His first startup in collaboration with Lucio Misquita , called L&A Tech, was sold to a German company for 1 million Euros.The three rented out a 150sq-m shed at Thivim Industrial Estate where they grow four varieties of Lettuce and Basil in an 80sq-m air-conditioned room. The agri-startup, Letcetra Agritech, produces 100 kg vegetables every day or three tonnes of exotic vegetables per month.""Next, we shall start with cherry tomatoes, bell pepper, cucumbers, other Indian vegetables and even strawberries,"" said Ajay, who looks after the core hydroponics technology and marketing.Sandeep, a 33-year old electrical engineer, looks after operations while Jagdish, a mechanical engineer takes care of production.The trio believe agriculture can be profitable if technology is used efficiently. ""There is a fear that agriculture is risky because you depend on the weather. I have taken out 90% of that risk. There is the fear that you don't get good rates and for that I eliminated the middleman,"" Ajay said.The entrepreneurs do admit that not all risks can be tackled. The demonetization move has dampened the demand for exotic vegetables but they are confident that the market will pick up.Cool as a cucumber did you say?"

The agriculture department in the district, which should have sold 19 tonnes in November, still has a huge stock left. This is despite the Centre allowing government seed depots to accept old currencies.To ensure cultivation during rabi season was not affected by demonetisation, the Centre announced that all national seed corporations could accept scrapped notes from farmers for the sale of seeds and fertilizers, on Monday. On Wednesday, a government order issued allowed state agriculture department-run seed depots to also accept old notes. Even this has not encouraged farmers to buy seeds. ""The slowdown in seeds sales is more due to drought than demonetisation. With absolutely no rains in the district this year, farmers are apprehensive about sowing seeds,"" said an area manager.While the state agriculture department also sells around 19 tonnes of paddy, pulses and millets, the seeds are usually sold out by November-end. ""This year, the sales has dipped because of scanty rain. But a few farmers are buying seeds, hoping it will rain in December,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal.The situation is not much better among private dealers. ""This season it is only paddy, pulses and tomato seeds, which is not much for us. But this drought, which has lowered the ground water level, is going to bring down seed sales by almost 50% over the next few months, after Pongal ,"" said a representative from Sri Rajalakshmi Agro Services.Many farmers, especially those practising organic farming, say they may give the rabi season a miss. K Marappan, a farmer in Sathyamangalam, has decided not to cultivate for the rest of the year. ""I had been practising organic farming for the past three years, but this year we have had no rain. What is the point of spending on seeds, labour, organic fertilizers and pesticides,"" he said.Despite installing drip irrigation, farmers say they have water problems. ""With many borewells going dry, we are paying electricity bills as high as Rs7,000, to irrigate our lands. We are not even getting water from any of our canals,"" said Madukkarai-based banana and tomato farmer, A Kandasamy.

Shortage of valid currency in rural areas has affected the purchase of tomatoes in the wholesale market, leading to a price crash.Tomato is now fetching farmers as little as Rs 2-3.5 a kg. With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day. The rate prior to demonetisation was between Rs 8 and Rs 9kg. But now with the shortage of the new currency, traders are insisting that farmers accept payment in old notes. And because farmers are refusing, they have slashed prices,"" an official from the market committee said.Farmers said since the auction had been stalled in these market yards for the past one week, they have had to throw a lot of their produce away as they cannot store this perishable item. Babanrao Lahane, a farmer, said he had to throw away 40 crates of tomatoes due to low sales last week. ""I have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 35,000 per acre. I continue to get affected by the low sale price.""Traders said since most of them had accounts in district cooperative banks, it was hard to withdraw cash. So they too are forced to work with old notes. Cooperative banks have been barred from exchanging old notes and are also carrying out limited transactions.Meanwhile, arrival of fresh crop lowered prices further.Abundant supplies are arriving at Vashi APMC market from Nashik. The wholesale rate has dropped from Rs 7-10 per kg a fortnight ago to Rs 5-7. Retail rates have fallen from Rs 15-20 to Rs 10-14 respectively.""Over 45-55 truckloads of good quality tomatoes are arriving daily from Nashik, which seems to be in surplus compared to the demand in the Mumbai metropolitan region. So prices are low and will remain so,"" said trader Balasaheb Badade.Also, since Monday, green peas have been getting cheaper.""Farmers have started harvesting the new crop, causing a drop in rates,"" said Mandar Jadhav , a retailer.Prices of other vegetables are fluctuating on a daily basis by Rs 5-10 a kg.

The Lasalgaon APMC had suspended onion auction for almost eight days, from November 10 to 17, due to cash crunch."

However, she was forced to sell her goods at throwaway prices and discard the remaining, as there were very few customers.Shinde is one of the villagers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch following the demonetisation of big currencies.Madhukarrao Kagale (65), a farmer, said, ""This is the worst time to be a farmer . We have returned to the times when all of us were happy eating zunka bhakar . The only difference this time around is that we have to eat zunka bhakar forcibly and that too once a day.""For Shinde, it was the second consecutive weekly market that disappointed her. ""A few days ago, a bunch of 'methi' would fetch us around Rs 10, but now we are forced to sell it for Rs 3-4. The prices of onions, tomatoes and potatoes too have come down to Rs 10 or Rs 20 per kg . We cannot afford to sell in these rates, but there is no other alternative,"" she added.Shanta Sonali, another vegetable vendor, the number of sellers have decreased by at least 30 percent this week. If the same situation prevails, only 40-50 percent might turn up for the weekly bazaar next week, she said.Vishwas Khot, a farmer, said that earlier milk cooperative society gave hard cash, but since the agents and the society is short of cash, the money is being deposited in their accounts at the Kolhapur district bank, which itself is out of cash.""We have money. Believe me, that is not an issue. The fact that we cannot use it or withdraw it is biting hard. We are making our daily sale on credit, but how long can we do that. What are we supposed to do,"" he asked.Rajendra Chougule, another villager, said that in Yalgud village, 75 percent of the residents' accounts are in the district bank. ""We live in a village and that is why at least the grocery shopowner can give us essential goods on credit.""Tukaram Hanbar said banks are giving only Rs 1,000 and that too not regularly. Most of the times, they are out of cash, he added."

Fruit sales, especially those of apples, have gone down by 80%.The sale of vegetables has also taken a hit but not as severely as that of fruits. The retail price of vegetables like potatoes has gone down by about 50% though demand remains more or less constant. As a result, apart from farmers, migrant labourers are hard hit by the sudden turn of events. According to traders, 60% of migrant labourers have returned to their home states.Rajesh Yadav, CEO, Agriculture Produce Marketing Community (APMC), Sahibabad wholesale vegetable and fruit market, said that 1,156 quintals of fruits were sold between November 1 and 8 while between November 15 and 22 the figure nosedived to 390 quintals. ""The same is true in the case of oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava, which saw a dip of about 70% post-demonetisation,"" Yadav said.Rashid Qureshi, manager of MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, said that normally 100 to 125 trucks laden with fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava would come to the Sahibabad mandi but after demonetisation on average only 25 trucks are coming in. ""This being the wedding season our sales should have gone up but demonetisation has upset our applecart and many small traders would take several months to recover from the ongoing shock,"" Qureshi said.MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, one of the biggest wholesale dealers in fruits at the Sahibabad mandi, used to do business worth about Rs 50,000 per day during normal days but, after demonetisation, business has not exceeded beyond Rs 15,000 on any given day, according to Qureshi.As for vegetables, the overall prices have come down Vegetables like potato, onion, cabbage and tomato are still witnessing steady supply,"" Yadav said.""On Tuesday 2,586 quintals of potato found its way into the Sahibabad mandi and the average in the last week roughly comes to around 2,000 quintals a day though the retail price has come done drastically,"" Yadav said.According to Yadav, 1kg of potato before demonetisation came for about Rs 30 but after demonetisation it is now being sold at Rs 15/kg. ""Similarly, cabbage before demonetisation was sold at Rs 20 per kg which has now come down to Rs 4 /kg and tomato has come down to Rs 8/kg from Rs 18/kg,"" Yadav said.Explaining consumer behaviour in the backdrop of demonetisation, said, ""Since there is dearth of cash in the system because of demonetisation, consumers tend to spend only on essential items such as vegetables and they are saving on liquid cash by doing without fruits.

Over the years, the region in Sirmaur district has become known as a place from where men from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab  states with a skewed sex ratio (the number of girls per 1,000 boys)  have found brides.The recent rescue of a woman allegedly abducted for marriage forced the administration to look at a trend described as cross-regional migration of brides. Locals do not like to talk about this, but following the womans rescue, the administration in the regions Shillai area, about 240 km from Shimla, conducted a survey to assess the exodus.The survey conducted across 140 villages revealed that in the last decade nearly 1,100 women from Shillai had married men in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, said Vikas Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Shillai.The report was shocking. A majority of the women were enticed for marriage with the promise of better life, said Shukla. Not all the grooms were youth. He said the Union minister for women and child development, Maneka Gandhi, had sought information on this disturbing trend.Several instances of migrated brides being sent back home, allegedly after facing mental and physical abuse, have caught the administrations eye. Many of these marriages are not registered and solemnised with the chunni-odhna tradition in which a bride and groom tie the knot under a sheet, according to a government official who did not want to be named.Not all women who marry outside are abducted, but the survey has found the enticement is money, a big draw in the region where jobs are few and crop activities are limited to ginger and tomato. Many people from this region make up the workforce in various unorganised sectors across the state. It is generally known that people who come bride hunting either pay her family or purchase land for them. None of the people involved speaks about it, said the government official.Pratap Singh Tomar, convener of the Central Haati Committee, an organisation seeking Scheduled Tribe status for nearly 250,000 people in the trans-Giri region, said, Not all the girls marry for money. They also look for better life. There is so much hardship here. The people in trans-Giri region make up nearly half the population in Sirmaur district.Surinder Rana, head of Millah panchayat in the region, said, We have heard about some families marrying their girls outside for money. I have been trying to discourage this.Incidentally, there have been reports of girls and women of the region being trafficked on the pretext of marriage. Sirmaur police busted an interstate racket two years ago. Three men from Haryana were arrested. Girls had been taken to Haryana on the pretext of finding a match, said Zahur Zaidi, inspector general of police (Law and Order).The survey in Shillai has put the spotlight on the cross-regional migration of brides. Anuradha Thakur, secretary of the states women child welfare department said officials had contacted the Shillai SDM, and the social welfare department was conducting an independent inquiry. We will do whatever is needed so that women and girls dont have to make forced choices, said Thakur."

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow.

On Saturday, the price of the seasonal vegetable was at its lowest  Rs 10 - Rs 15 per kg  in major retail markets. In wholesale markets, the price was almost one-third.This time, there has been a bumper production, especially in the last leg of the harvest.

No seed sellers are ready to give seeds on credit.If the situation did not improve, there will 20-25% shortage of vegetables in the market in December, he saidJharkhand is a surplus vegetable production state. The Jharkhand state horticulture mission figures show that the state produces more than 37 lakh metric tonne of vegetables every year but only 30 lakh metric tonne is locally consumed.The state exports more than one million tonne of vegetables to other states every year.Even though farmers are selling their produces at a lower price to whole sellers, price of the perishable commodity in city retail markets is high. The arrival of vegetables from outside the state has partially stabilized prices.The cash-crunch has also hit harvesting of paddy and sowing of Rabi crops, as farmers have to queue outside banks to withdraw money. I did not start harvesting paddy due to the cash shortage. Who will purchase my produce?, said Jeetu Manjhi, a farmer of Ranchis Angarha.We are also struggling to purchase seeds and fertilizers for Rabi crops.Director of state agriculture department Jatashankar Choudhary, said that they are aware of the condition of farmers and discussions are on to ease farmers trouble.

The hangover of the Raj, complete with the traditional Christmas spread, is what draws us to this place. Windamere, actually, is like an old country house, David told HT.For the past few years, we have been staying in Darjeeling for a longer period. We arrive before Christmas-eve and leave only in the first week of January, said Pat.Originally from Kiama, 130 km from Sydney, the Gates first visited Darjeeling in 1991. We had read about Darjeeling and Calcutta while in school. So we decided to explore the places. Thankfully, it was Christmas that year. And we fell in love with the way Windamere celebrated  the carol, the entertainment, the dinner... Since then, we have not celebrated Christmas anywhere else. It is homecoming for us, said Pat.She also appreciated the fact that Darjeeling has done away with the use of plastic carry bags.Over the years, we have befriended so many of this towns folks. We visit them every year. Many of them have passed away while many others have moved on, David said with a touch of nostalgia palpable in his voice.There are many tourists who keep coming back to Windamere but the Gates are special. Shubhana Rai, sales manager at Windamere, said, They have become a part of the Windamere family. We look forward to their visit every year. And yes, we try to keep our Christmas celebrations as authentic as it was way back in 1939.The Christmas menu of 1960, proudly displayed, reads, Hors Doeuveres Varies; Cream of Tomato Soup; Lobster Mayonnaise and Russian Salad; Roast Turkey and Ham Croquette Potatoes, cauliflower and garden peas; Christmas Plum Pudding and Brandy Sauce; Pickled Sardine on Toast; Dessert and Coffee. The menu has remained the same with minor variations, said Rai.We will keep coming back till our health and wealth permit, quipped David."

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November. The supply dipped to an average of 93 quintals per day from November 9 to November 22. The supply of oranges also dipped from an average of 453 quintals per day to an average of 306 quintals per day, after November 8.However, the supply of guava has remained constant, at 220 quintals per day, from November 1 to November 22."

Their endeavour is now supported by rest of the society members.Recycling and caring about environment is almost a habit now. I have been personally segregating waste for more than eight years, Reddy said.The building terrace holds a variety of vegetables, ranging from chillies to tomatoes and herbs such parsley and celery. There are around 55 baskets of 15 different vegetables on the terrace, said Reddy.Other vegetables and herbs such as brinjal, Romanian spinach, mint, lime, basil , rosemary and curry leaves are part of the terrace garden.We are also planning to plant green garlic, cherry tomatoes and other seasonal vegetables during their appropriate seasons, said Manoj Jain, another resident.With all of the 24 households in the society uniting for the cause, it was easy to the experiment, said other residents.Besides planning to add more variety to its terrace garden, the society also has a unique way of making compost. We call it Amrit Mitti. It is a mix of cow urine, cow dung and neem leaves, which adds to the fertility of the soil and helps get a better produce. It also acts as a pesticide, albeit a natural one, said Pappu Mehra, another resident.The residents said, though small, the terrace garden needs total commitment and round the clock care.Commenting on the societys initiative, resident Kevin DSilva said the primary aim was to tackle the waste generated. Handling wastes at individual-level is the need of the hour.Many residents joined the initiative to experience the thrill of home-grown vegetables. Everyone benefits from it. People can consume these vegetables without fear,as they are free of adulteration and chemical fertilizers, said Madhu Reddy, another resident and a committee member.Start Upcycling Now (SUN), a waste management company, helped the society to start on the terrace garden.Mumbai has an awesome climate and has favourable conditions throughout the year.

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

But PM Narendra Modis decision to demonetize Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes has changed it all.After the announcement, the shortage of smaller denomination currency led to a sharp fall in prices of fruits and vegetables. The traders have now asked farmers to not bring their produce owing to the drop in prices and lack of currency.We are stuck in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the vegetable produce in the farm is ready for cutting. But we cant go ahead with it as there is no point taking it to the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Traders say they dont have the cash to purchase our vegetables, said another farmer Madhukar Gogawale, who produces bitter gourd, tomato and bottle gourd on his 14-acre farm.With the halt in supply of money from buyers to farmers, the rural economy has taken a hit.The number of vehicles supplying vegetables to Pune APMC came down by 40% on Tuesday, compared to the previous week, claim sources from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).The problem, farmers feel, may aggravate further with the district central cooperative banks not being allowed to exchange the higher currency by smaller denominations notes. These banks, considered to be the backbone of rural economy, have been barred from carrying out transactions, as many of them have not completed the know-your-customer formalities by taking PAN and other details.In Nashik, many onion growers did not bring their produce to APMCs on Sunday and Monday, as there was not enough cash with traders. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman at APMC, Nashik, said, We have stopped buying onions for the past two days.Our vegetable produce is not getting good price despite demand. Neither can we exchange old currency from the district central cooperative bank, nor can we withdraw money from our accounts. It is a really tough time, said Ramesh Kondhe, another farmer from Khed Shivapur."

Due to cash crunch, the contractor is not able to pay them daily. Things were fine till the old notes were exchanged by banks, but now the labour is hardly getting any wages.Another official said there is no point in letting Pakistani trucks in India. If goods come from Pakistan, there is no labour to unload the trucks, he added.Rajdeep Uppal, president, Confederation of International Chamber of Commerce, said most of the labourers do not have bank accounts and they demand cash. Even those who have accounts dont accept cheques as its not easy to withdraw money from banks these days, he said.Uppal added that the cash crunch has not only affected the labour but also traders. The orders placed by us are still stuck across the border and we are just waiting for the situation to ease.Also, the export from India through the border has also virtually come to a standstill as trucks carrying tomatoes are not getting quarantine import permits from Pakistani authorities due to unknown reasons, traders claimed.Talking to HT, a customs official said, While the import has totally stopped due to cash crunch, only a few trucks carrying cotton are going to Pakistan these days."

He fired a shot from his licensed revolver which hit the brides brother, Rishabh Gupta, and led to his death. Later, the victims family lodged a complaint and named Chauhan in it, said Majhola police station house officer, Neeraj Kumar.Chauhan, a manager with Ravishs firm, fled Moradabad after the incident. He arrived in Ghaziabad early on Saturday morning and checked into Hotel Mahadev at Bajaria near Ghaziabad railway station.Around 1.30pm on Saturday, he ordered food, and later went out for some work in the local market. He returned in the evening and stayed in his room, said a hotel staff member.Chauhans relatives came to the hotel at 11.30pm. When he did not open the room, they informed police.His relatives told us they got a call from him saying he was going to commit suicide. Later, his mobile was switched off, said Ghanta ghar Kotwali officiating station house officer, Brijesh Sharma.By the time his relatives reached the hotel, Chauhan had killed himself, Sharma said.We have recovered three suicide notes and he shot himself in head with his licensed revolver. His relatives also said they tried to convince him to surrender, but he fled Moradabad, said Sharma.In the note on the room wall, Chauhan accused one Rajesh Singh of harassing him. Singh allegedly shot at him seven months ago and harassed him for three months. Chauhan also mentioned Singhs address.The note on the bed sheet said, Mummy, Papa, Sunita (wife), Rohit and Archit (children)... please forgive me as I am leaving you without any support. I cannot see any way as Rajesh Singh has affected my life... Ravi sir (his employer), I am the person who snatched away the happiness in your family... Please forgive me...The third note written on a piece of paper describes the entire incident and about how Rajesh sent a man to threaten him at the wedding.It is my mistake to undertake celebratory firing. But the man sent by Rajesh to threaten me was trying to take away my revolver and it triggered fire... the note said.He also said he was leaving Rs 11,000 and a gold chain to be handed over to his family."

Mera naam Pablo hai, aapka naam kya hain ? Aap kaise ho ? is stated with a self assurance that makes one think that Agular has spent years in the island city. But the reality is that Agular is a chef in transit. But its a reality that his comrade-in-food, entrepreneur and pastry chef Pooja Dhingra is hoping to change. For the few past weeks, Agular and Dhingra have been working round the clock  to launch the Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today.For Dhingra, this is a dream that she has worked hard to make come true. During the past four years or so, Dhingra has been busy trying to find a suitable spot in South Mumbai to launch a caf, and she almost did. We actually started work on a caf in Breach Candy and then it suddenly fell through and never took off, she says. Pablo was here too. I had called him over to help me.Dhingra met Agular nine years ago, where they both were students at Le Cordon Bleu Paris. She says, He did cuisine and I did pastry. But we never really interacted much. He was working in a caf close to school and that is where all of us went after hours to hang out. Dhingra is clearly admiring of Agulars work ethic, He moved to Paris when he was 18 and worked himself through culinary school. He would do a 10-hour shift and come to school and then study. Then go back to cooking and I would ask him, when do you sleep?So, when Dhingra found the dream location for her caf, right on the street where she wanted it, she promptly dialled Agular to make his way to Mumbai. And he did, Right before I came to Bombay, I used to own two restaurants in Paris. And for some personal reasons, I decided to split from my company. I have been working for close to nine years without taking a vacation, explains the half-Hungarian chef. Right now, I am going through this period in my life where I am going to take some time to enjoy and yet keep working. So coming to India was the perfect opportunity to discover new things.While Dhingra was busy tying up the myriad loose ends that go along with a caf launch  Agular made the long trip to Mumbai. Then they started work on a menu. Between the two, Dhingra and Agular might be able to cook up a storm, but for the cafs offerings, simple has been the motto they have stuck to. She explains, This is an extension of what I have always wanted to do. Dessert is my forte and its what I excel at. But food is something that I was completely clueless about. I had an idea of what I wanted at the caf and that is where Pablo comes in. I wanted a very tight menu. At Le15, we do a few things and we do them well. Theres no point in having a 10-page menu.Agular being agreeable to that thought process, has helped Dhingra develop a far-from predictable menu that has sandwiches, salads, soups and four main courses. For the cafs four-plated desserts; the two named them after French women. For someone who is passionate about chocolate, Dhingras favourite dessert from the menu is a non-cocoa dish that they have dubbed Amlie. You can see her excitement shine through when she describes it while beaming, Its a milk cake, raspberry coulis, pepper crumbs with mint.Agular, chimes in, We arent doing anything to just please people but stuff we like. For example, the burrata  I didnt really want it on my menu because everyone is doing burrata nowadays. But Pooja wanted it so much, that we are doing it. And its become one of the favourite dishes during the tastings. Another dish, the duo is excited about is the crispy parmesan waffle, with tomato sauce and a poached egg and then more parmesan on top.The plan is to keep adding on to the menu as the caf settles into a routine, explains Dhingra, For now, its going to be open from 10.30 am to around 7.30-8 pm for the first few weeks. For Agular, it will also be a time to perhaps try out his newly learned Hindi with patrons.Le15 Caf, Shop No. 18, Lansdowne Building, behind Regal Cinema, near Apollo Hotel, opposite Lings Pavilion, Colaba; 9769341994Agular, Dhingra have been working hard to launch Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today"

The 68-year-old AIADMK supremo breathed her last at 11.30pm.Offices and schools shut or closed early and panic buying sent prices soaring as the city virtually shut down, fearing the worst.Earlier in the morning, there was confusion among parents as social media was flooded with messages about a holiday for educational institutions. There was no official government declaration, but a few schools decided not to function.Sishya at Adyar called off classes at 11am, while the management of Sri Sarada Secondary School at Gopalapuram, close to DMK chief M Karunanidhi's residence, asked students of all classes to assemble in foyer after the first period and sent them home.Employees of many companies also began returning home by afternoon. Staff of a few IT firms at Tidel Park were given the choice of leaving early.All this caused traffic jams in many parts. ""There was choc-a-bloc traffic on Sardar Patel Road and instead of taking my car, I opted to walk toward Kotturpuram,"" said Adyar resident Nithya Murugan.While suburban trains, MTC buses and SETC intra-state services functioned normally, inter-state buses from Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh were suspended. There was dip in the number of cabs and autos on the roads, while the few available drivers demanded huge sums. ""While it took a long time for me to hail an auto, I had to pay Rs 350 from Aminjikirai to R A Puram,"" said Raj M, a resident.Many theatres, including Luxe Cinemas, remained shut through most parts of the day, while some ran shows only until afternoon. All evening and night shows across SPI screens were cancelled and multiplexes said money would be refunded either online or in person.There were long queues at ATMs throughout the day and grocery stores were crowded. Tomatoes and onions retailed at Rs 40 a kg in many parts as stores cashed in on the fear and panic unleashed by 'statements' from various quarters. Essentials like milk, eggs and bread sold out by evening and many grocers downed shutters. Some stores that remained open till late evening closed down after TV channels broadcast 'breaking news' on the AIADMK chief's health.Online food delivery services were down as restaurants in their network downed shutters due to the prevailing confusion. Nandanam resident V Ramya said hotels in her neighbourhood closed by evening. ""I picked up a few essentials from a nearby departmental store. I hope the situation doesn't turn worse,"" she said.The US Consulate operated with reduced staff and temporarily suspended appointments for routine services to US citizens and visa applicants.

Fearing a shutdown on Tuesday, residents flocked to neighbourhood stores to stock up on rations and motorists queued outside petrol bunks.Until Monday morning, the price of tomato and onion remained stable.Soon after the news spread that the chief minister was very critical, traders at the Koyambedu market raised the tomato prices to 20/kg while onion prices went up to 20/kg. Market advisor to the Koyambedu market traders association R Soundararajan said, ""Panic caused by the announcement created an artificial demand, prompting sellers to hike rates. But the rise was minimal at the market.

Farmers have no other option but to reduce the prices to sell their produce. The prices of greens have fallen by almost 50 per cent since November 20.The prices of cauliflower, tomatoes, potatoes, lemons, brinjals, carrots, bottle gourds etc. range between Rs 2 per kilo and Rs 8 per kilo in the wholesale market, compared to Rs 10 and Rs 50 that prevailed before demonetization. Lemon, which was being sold for Rs 80 per kilogram before November 8, is available for Rs 5 per kilogram in the APMC market.Farmer leader Darshan Nayak told TOI, ""Demonetization has literally broken the back of the farmers. Reserve Bank of India 's (RBI) restriction on the district cooperative banks is to be blamed for the farmers' plight. There is no new currency with the banks and they are unable to provide cash to their account holders, who happen to be farmers. The dealings in APMC are done in cash. The farmers and the farm labourers are facing serious situation. The farmers have started destroying their standing crops as they are unable to bear losses in taking their produce to the APMC and pay to the labourers.""APMC secretary Nilesh Thorat said, ""Farmers want to sell, but the traders want to bargain heavily due to shortage of currency notes. This has led to sharp fall in the prices of greens."""
58e4a155a3d24b525e0eba4f,Demonetization slices vegetable prices,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Demonetization-slices-vegetable-prices/articleshow/56146460.cms,2016-12-24,,The Times Of India,"AHMEDABAD: After many years, retail vegetable prices in the city have gone down considerably. The plunge can be attributed to the recent decision to demonetize high currency notes that has led to severe cash crunch in the market. Tomatoes, cauliflower and cabbage are being sold at Rs10 per kg in the retail market.Deepak Patel, secretary of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said, ""There are three reasons for the low prices. First, the winter season is known for plenty of green vegetables. So, there is proper flow of green vegetables in the market. The second reason is cash crunch because of demonetization. People are unable to buy from regular vendors in cash and hotels' demands too are low as there are less customers. The third reason is there is no marriage season in the next one month, leading to low demand.Even though the prices have fallen, the retailers are witnessing lacklustre business because of cash crunch. Hasmukh Vaghela, a retail vegetable vendor in Jamalpur, said, ""Although the prices have fallen, there is no surge in customer numbers because of the note ban.""Most of the vendors are yet to be introduced to digital modes of payment who claim that their daily business has taken a hit. Pallavi, a vendor in Vastrapur, said, ""I am illiterate and I don't know how to use card or anything. I don't understand it. I am not getting enough customers for vegetables. People are asking for credit, but we need some money for our daily bread and butter. Our regular customers have shifted to big shops, as they are facing cash crunch. We try to sell it in wholesale price but still we don't have enough money for food.""M D Patel, 58, who is doing job in ISRO, said, ""The prices of vegetables are low and I prefer to buy them every day in cash. Yes, people are facing cash crunch, but till today, I didn't face any problem as the prices of vegetables are very low.""Even as the retail prices of vegetables like cauliflower have touched Rs10 per kg, the prices of fruits have not been affected much. The prices of bottle guard and brinjal have gone down to Rs20 per kg. While carrot is available at Rs25 per kg, capsicum and peas are available at Rs30 per kg.Unlike some vendors in the city, the 'Sai Vegetable Market' in Vastrapur has backed the government's push for cashless transactions. ""We've made provisions for cashless transactions through Paytm,"" said Giridharilal Malviya , who has been running the store for six years.In Navrangpura, Bhaggaji, who runs a vegetable store, too has started Paytm facility for customers. ""It's been 20 days since I started it. On an average, seven-eight customers buy vegetables through Paytm,"" he said."

Photo: K. VenkateshwarluHANDOUT_E_MAILHow about getting an apartment in an eco-friendly building overlooking the Hudson River and a 13-acre park, while having fresh vegetables and fruits grown on the roof-top at affordable rent?It may look incredible for people with low and moderate incomes in New York, where rented space comes at a premium, but a unique Government private partnership has made this possible, a model that could be replicated in Indian cities.Hunters Point South Living has two buildings with environmentally sustainable features  32-storey Hunters Point South Crossing with 306 apartments and 37-storey Hunters Point South Commons, with 619 apartments in Long Island City. Built on a parcel of post-industrial land, the two buildings were completed last year. The apartments range from studio to three bedrooms, with equal mix of low and moderate income group families selected through a rigorous process, says Luke Falk, Assistant Vice President, Related Companies, that took up the project as part of affordable housing programme. All the lessons we learnt when superstorm Sandy hit New York have been incorporated in these two buildings.All apartments have fittings rivalling high income group housing, that includes dishwasher in the kitchen, while amenities range from lounge with outdoor terrace, tech lounge, fitness centre, childrens playroom. The icing on the cake, of course, is the urban farm on the 14th floor terrace irrigated by a storm water retention tank and pollinated by the bees in the apiary. The vegetables grown include eight varieties of tomatoes, five varieties of peppers, two varieties each of eggplant, radishes, turnip, roots and beets and three varieties of cucumbers. Strawberries, blueberries and raspberries from the fruit basket while the herbs range has chives, cilantro, dill, fennel, lemon verbena, rosemary and three varieties of basil, mint and thyme.The two buildings have silver and gold Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) rating for its green, sustainable, energy-efficient, healthy and cost-effective design features. The residential complex has also won the 2016 ULI NY Excellence in Development Award for best housing project. It has all the conceivable sustainability and resilient features one could think f  from energy efficient lighting to storm resistance, said Charlotte Mathews, Vice President of the Related Companies.The support from the local government and civic authorities include tax credits and subsidies, the details of which Mr. Falk was not prepared to share.But he says such projects are economically feasible and had good future given the difficulties faced by low and moderate income groups in expensive cities like New York where per square foot space could go up to $ 500. We have provided apartments at almost half the rent with all the amenities of high- end apartments.(The author was in the U.S. at the invitation of the U.S. Embassy)"

Its been a colourful year. Admittedly with social media, its easier to manufacture a trend than track one: all you need is an armful of hashtags.Nevertheless, some trends did stand out this year, and after some earnest scouting, here they are.Put your money where your mouth is: You may not have Ashton Kutchers millions (or his enviable jawline) but you can still invest in a startup. Its an easy route to hipster chic, without the man bun and skinny jeans. More importantly, you have the opportunity to bring fascinating creative projects to life, by investing relatively little money. Bakeys spoons, for example, which are edible spoons made with jowar, rice and wheat flour, raised Rs. 24,92,380 on Ketto.org with 1,571 supporters.Theres Foodstart, which helps restaurants and food trucks raise capital online in small amounts. Barnraiser supporting farmers. And of course, the popular Kickstarter, which has one category just for bacon, along with cook books, vegan, farms, food trucks, restaurants and farmers markets in its food category.Dinner in a box: Meal kits, with pre-measured ingredients, became popular this year. Practically every major Indian city has a company doing these now.Theres iChef in Mumbai, specialising in Malaysian, Burmese and African food. Awesome Chef in Chennai, offering Thai-style peanut noodles, kung pao potatoes and paneer makhani. And Built2Cook in Hyderabad, to name just a few. They enable you to cook quick, easy and exotic dinners for two or four people, and expand your repertoire with confidence.Grow your own food: Cocktail party topics have shifted from bistros in Paris to organic farms in Pollachi. Burnt-out executives are increasingly finding ways to grow their own vegetables. Some quit their jobs and move away from the city for what they describe as a fuller existence, growing rice, digging up potatoes and tending cows. Some buy a couple of acres just outside the city and head there on weekends. An easy, and popular compromise: rooftop and terrace gardening. A tomatos tastier when you grow it on your own.Mesmerised by pancakes: Food videos became big this year, as they got slicker than ever before. Faintly hypnotic and surprisingly relaxing, they easily sliced across geographical and age barriers. Everyone was watching them, though hardly anyone was actually trying the recipes in real life. Among the most popular videos this year were mozzarella stick onion rings, ice cream churro bowls and pizza puff pastry twists, which got a mind-boggling 159,908,933 views.Single origin everything: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla Local artisan produce got better than ever this year, thanks to determined entrepreneurs and an audience that was willing to not just pay for quality, but also educate themselves.Try The Indian Beans Monkey Bitten Coffee, cultivated in the forests of Andhra Pradeshs Araku Valley. Or Blue Tokais roastery, where they simultaneously grind beans, make cappuccinos and hold workshops.Prefer chocolate? Earth Loaf in Mysore, Mason & Co in Auroville and Pascati are creating gourmet, hand-made, organic, locally-sourced, single-origin, bean-to-bar, proudly desi chocolate (phew).Geeking out on coffee: If youre still using capsules, go sit in a corner with your finger on your lips, and think about the impact on the environment. This was the year of responsible handmade coffee. The AeroPress became popular, as did the Moka pot. Need something trendier? Buy and learn how to use the Chemex, vacuum siphon, bee house dripper or filtron cold brewer.A latte a day: Turmeric lattes, coconut lattes, pumpkin lattes... Mornings got a lot more interesting this year. Turmeric lattes, made with almond milk, fresh turmeric and honey, ruled. For the paleo and keto nuts, it was all about bullet-proof coffee made by whipping together coffee, butter and coconut oil. If youre less intense, try a cold brew coffee with coconut, almond or cashew milk.Soup in light bulbs: Unusual platters ruled. We ate cheese on the lid of a wine barrel. Dessert in a flower pot. Breakfast on a spade. Coffee in a waffle cone.We even saw a burger served on a weighing scale!IN: Gin. Also called vodka for grown ups. Watch out for a pink strawberry version as part of 2017s ginnaissanceOUT: Carb-heavy, creamfilled, decadently sweet desserts. Watch a Tasty video instead. Then eat an apple"

Processing of tomato can be a remedy to the problem of plenty, according to food scientists here.The technologies developed by Mysuru-based Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) on tomato processing can come to the rescue of farmers when tomato prices fall drastically and they are forced to throw their produce.Tomato is sold at Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.5 a kg in the wholesale market/at farm level in the glut season and during the off season, the price shoots up to an extent of Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg at retail level, according to DFRL.The reasons cited for this uncertainty were lack of cooperative marketing, transportation and processing centres close to the areas of production. Tomato processing, especially primary processing in the form of pulp, juice, and chutneys, at farm level can enable value realisation to the growers.DFRL has developed a range of products and processing technologies for tomato utilisation to reduce the post-harvest losses with special focus on progressive farmers, self-help groups (SHGs), and rural enterprises.Importantly, the technologies are farm-friendly and have been developed keeping in view the traditional Indian taste and palate. The products are stable from up to six to nine months when stored in ambient temperature, according to Mallesha, DFRL PRO. The products are ready-to-serve (RTS) or ready-to-prepare (RTP).In a bid to reach out its technologies to farmers and other interested village groups, DFRL, under the rural development programme, along with Spoorthy Janaabhivruddi Samste, recently conducted an awareness programme and a workshop for farmers of Ahalya village, about 35 km from Mysuru, on various tomato processing and products at DFRL.Rakesha Kumar Sharma, Director, DFRL, spoke about the technologies at the workshop, which was attended by farmers and SHG members from in and around the village. DFRL has proposed to adopt a couple of villages, mostly in the tomato-growing belt, and install the technologies there. If others come forward, the technologies can be transferred for a cost, Dr. Mallesha said."

A plate of vada costs Rs. 20 while the combination of vada and curd cost Rs. 25. On any normal day, one has to squeeze to get into the wholesale shopping complex, but these are unusual times.

The dealers have also stopped accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes since Tuesday. The prices of pulses too are going down, he says.With the big notes out of legal tender, the wholesale business in Lalapet area has taken a hit. Wholesale traders say very few customers have turned up to buy goods in bulk during the last week. Most of them do not have access to the electronic mode of accepting debit or credit cards on Point of Sale (PoS) platforms and rely on traditional mode of payment.The sudden decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 have struck a deathblow to small traders. The daily turnover wholesale business in the town is about Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 crore.

The price has remained constant at Rs. 5 during the past few days.A large number of farmers have raised tomatoes in Omalur and the surrounding villages of Theevattipatti, Nadupatti, Kanjanayakkanpatti, Kundukkal, Karuvalli, Thumbipadi, and Kaamalapuram, taking advantage of the abundant rainfall received in the months of July and August.

But eat, you must, for the food is prettier.At one end of the historic Cochin Club, the eatery does not make a big show of itself. But it is not so undramatic at the table. Enter the salt-baked fish, the house special. A little before it arrives, while we are still going at the seafood platter with a clamour of knives, fork and claws, the attendant has quietly set two smaller tables beside the one at which we are seated. Seafood is one of the eaterys mainstays, as is evident from the menu. But not at all the usual fare one would find in Kerala. Not sure? Try the cured anchovies on toast then. It is a brilliant way to use the slim fish, cured in white wine and vinegar for a day, and laid on crunchy buttered toast. The flavour pops in the mouth.In between each dish, there is hectic admiration of the china. Its a mixed set for us, each of us gets a different colour or pattern. The soup has been had, a creamy tomato with basil, that soothes and rejuvenates and kindles instant desire to try at home. Since we dont care much for order, the salad has been had too somewhere in between--a melange of romaine lettuce, feta, prunes and caramelised walnuts that afford much crunch. If you are a bacon fan, you can opt for bacon bits that come in a small white bowl to go with it.The Drawing Room draws much of its ingenuity from the people around, says Sharath Pulimood, one of the partners. So, there are a lot of recipes from friends that are tried out, a few friends make cakes and desserts for the eatery as well. Sharaths mothers tender coconut pudding is something he wants to try out soon. The Drawing Room is the result of a shared passion for food, music and travel between friends Tharun Thomas, Abraham Thomas and Sharath, who had conceived of a performance-worthy venue, which can host plug and plays and basically, curate music along with top class food.The show-stopper has finally arrived. The salt-baked spectacle, which has got the tourists at the next table curious. As we all look on in wonderment, the attendant cracks open the thick crust of the fish and it sends out curly wisps of steam. This dish is all about the fish. This is a brackish water snapper, but we do use the baramundi as well, says Sharath. It is a relief not to have the usual masala in fish, here you can taste the freshness, with just a faint hint of lime and salt. A Spanish recipe, it has worked well here, adds Sharath. The fish is stuffed with herbs and lime and brushed with a mixture of egg whites and sea salt, which forms a thick crust when baked. The fish cooks in its own moisture and is best had with a butter garlic dip and a wacky accompaniment made of kanthari chilli, parsley, white wine, vinegar, olive oil and capsicum.If you are not the dramatic type, the platters are always there with a delicious variety of meat and fish (a lot of shrimp), not to mention the pastas. While you are there, try the teas and the coffees and the juices, each section of which offers variety of some kind, the chefs special tender coconut water and hibiscus, for instance. Dessert is not fanciful, but have the basics in place such as chocolate cake, cheesecake with a few surprises thrown in such as baked date pudding, carrot cake and tender coconut ice cream with sea salt."

I have a line of credit with the moneylender, said Prem Singh Pawar, 64, military-man-and-clerk-turned farmer.About Rs.10,000 is due but that will remain (in our accounts)and well adjust. I have not had a problem with getting wheat seeds. This assertion seems to be borne out by data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture. As of November 11, rabi crop had been sown on 146.85 lakh hectares compared to 126.71 lakh hectares at this time in 2015. Wheat had been sown/transplanted in 25.72 lakh hectares as opposed to 18.65 lakh hectares last year.Palpable crisisBut the crunch of readily-available cash is palpable. In the towns main vegetable market where, apart from fresh produce, seeds, pesticide and fertilizer are traded, private traders are furious. Sales of pesticides and fertilizers are down 50 per cent, said Ashok Gupta, 30, a trader, Nobody is buying anything and our stocks are fast approaching the expiry date. They will be useless in two weeks.Mr. Gupta said his business was heavily dependent on cash, but added that he occasionally deposited some savings in his bank account. This year, he saw customers shifting to the Haryana Seed Development Corporation store  a State-run store three doors away  that was accepting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. We got a call from the Agriculture Department asking us to accept these notes, said Ajit Singh Gulia, who runs the store.But I spend a few hours after lunch everyday to deposit these notes, he said. The State-run store stocks at least eight varieties of wheat and has a steady stream of buyers. Customers who take more than five sacks (roughly 40 kg a sack) and bring old notes must deposit a copy of their photo identity.Definite lullThe vegetable market, meanwhile, was bustling with deals being struck on tomatoes, cauliflower and potatoes, but Inder Prakash Gupta, general secretary of the vegetable traders association, said there was a definite lull.We have long relationships and can handle the lack of money for sometime, the farmer-cum-moneylender told The Hindu, but added that nearly 40 to 50 people were losing about Rs.15 to Rs.20,000 per day."

But in the past, Blumhouse Productions (founded by Jason Blum) has given us great scares in the form of horror series like Paranormal Activity, Insidious, and The Purge. In fact, the company is responsible for The Hush, a 2016 horror thriller film that has an impressive 100 per cent holding on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, the company has hit a speed-bump in their successful proceedings. The said obstruction is by the name of Incarnate, perhaps the least scary possession film to ever grace a big screen.Wheelchair-bound Seth Embers (a thoroughly wasted albeit sincere Aaron Echart) can enter the subconscious minds of victims possessed by evil spirits. Hes handicapped after a car accident  caused by an inexplicably vindictive demon  that killed his wife and son. For years, hes been hunting Maggie as the evil entity has come to be known. Now shes taken a young boy hostage  one that looks eerily similar to his own deceased son  and Embers must evict the spirit from the boy. Theres also the Vatican involved in the form of a supremely attractive papal agent Camilla (Catalina Sandino Moreno), an unnecessary addition among many. Oh, and Lindsay, the possessed boys mother is played Game of Thrones Carice van Houten. She so stoic, she barely tears up after witnessing the death of her estranged husband.To say Incarnate is derived is an understatement; there have been countless films with demon possessions. This writer didnt sleep for days after watching the 2005 horror, The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Yet, slumber was oh so sound after Incarnate, in fact perhaps even induced by the film. Lets spell it out in case there was any doubt: this film is a crashing bore.Why Eckhart would deign to waste his talent after being in films like Thank You for Smoking (2006) and Sully (2016) is something we will have to live with forever. Thats not to say the actor is wont of trying in Incarnate. Its just that everything is against him. When a director, in this case Brad Peyton (whose only credit is disaster film San Andreas) hooks you up with the two assistants who look like theyve been ousted from a concert for being too wannabe punk, theres little a protagonist can do.Then theres Embers ability to enter other peoples subconscious, wheres hes got full use of his legs and dressed to the nine, nonetheless. Its all so convenient and cheesy. You see the process is not religious, so it cant be termed exorcism. Embers uses science to evict a spirit from a body with several monitors and medical equipment to trace the movements of the parasite inside a host. Basically, its tripe. Last and definitely not least are those possessed with their black eyes; more amusing than scary.Incarnate has no scares, thrills or chills and a glaring lack of originality. What little gore has been incorporated will be censored. So give it a miss, if you value your time and money."

Whether it was Cinderella or Rapunzel and even Enid Blyton, these characters played on our minds as we drifted off to sleep.Anoothi Vishals life was different. As a two-year-old, she remembers her grandmother narrating recipes to her. Those were her bedtime tales. The first recipe I remember bari ma [grandmother] telling me about was gajar ka halwa, says Vishal. One kilo carrot in two litres of milk, she recalls, and confesses that shes never really tried making that particular dessert. As for the other recipes handed down by her grandmother, Vishal has spent hours trying out and perfecting them. And, the result of those many experiments in the kitchen is her first book  Mrs. LCs Table: Stories about Kayasth Food and Culture.Its a narrative of the rich legacy of the Kayasth community, its history and culinary tradition, peppered generously with anecdotes and 20 recipes. The journalist and author says, I stayed with my grandparents for a few years and there was a lot of emphasis on food. My grandmother, Swaroop Rani Mathur, (fondly known as Mrs LC, after her husbands name Lakshmi Chandra Mathur) taught me table manners. Her table was always so wonderfully laid out. As a result, when I used to come back home from school, I would also want the table laid out well for me.Vishal remembers her 13th birthday where as a young girl she cooked an entire meal for the family, under the guidance of her very regal grandmother. She was a bureaucrats wife, reminisces the author. She gave instructions and orchestrated the meals.The authors gastronomical repertoire includes faux meat dishes created using raw banana, jackfruit; and, believe it or not, dal, to make kaliya and kebab. One such dish, is the raw banana fish  the fruit cut like fish slices and cooked in kasuri methi and ajwain. Theres also the delightful shami kebab which is so soft it could well be a galouti kebab. The trick is in the proportion. According to bari mas recipe, its 125 gm of chana dal and 500 gm of mince mutton, and requires a lot of masala during cooking, says Vishal.Despite the variety of non-vegetarian meals that Mrs LC cooked, she was a vegetarian. Kayasth cuisine is unique and inventive, says the author. The food has Indo-Islamic influences. Bhuna and dum are the two main ways of cooking Kayasth cuisine. The most common ingredients are khada masala, amchur powder, fennel and dried methi. Yoghurt is used as the souring agent, and not tomatoes, she adds. And, what are her favourites? takey paise, yakhni pulao and pasande.Mrs. LCs Table took Vishal two years to complete. Since her book is based on Kayasth food, she often gets asked should food not bind instead of marking separate identities? To that, she says: You cant write on the history of food without going into sociology.Mrs. LCs Table: Stories about Kayasth Food and Culture, Hachette India is priced at Rs 350"

Bonda tribals, whose number is around 6,000, live in remote and isolated hilly region in the northwest of Machhkund river. Their remote habitat in Mudulipada and Andrahal panchayats of Khairaput block is called Bonda valley. They have till date tried to preserve their ancient culture and tradition.Demonetisation has also affected lives of Bondas. During past years, efforts of administration and Bonda Development Agency (BDA) have brought in changes related to life and livelihood of these primitive tribals. Bondas had left behind their barter system of transaction and started using currency. According to sources, they store their currency notes, especially the ones of higher denomination, inside small tubular caskets made of bamboo. For their regular needs as well as to sell their forest produce, they travel around 14 kms to reach Khairaput market. They had been using mostly 500 and 1000 rupee notes that they were getting from traders for their cashew produce.After demonetisation, Bonda tribals are facing some problem while making transactions in the Khairaput market. The old 500 and 1000 rupee notes are not accepted in the market. Thus they are now resorting to barter system. They are exchanging their tomatoes for salt or medicinal herbs for biscuit.But along with it, they have also started to stand in queue in front of branches of State Bank of India (SBI) and Utkal Gramin Bank (UGB) at Khairaput to exchange their old currency notes or to get them deposited in their accounts.When contacted, BDS project leader Manga Panna said after the demonetisation process, awareness of banking has increased among Bonda tribals. They have now realised that banks can be the safest place for savings, he added.Mr Panna accepted that out of compulsion some Bondas are also resorting to barter system at Khairaput market. According to him link of Bondas will increase further once the proposed branch of SBI comes up at Mudulipada. According to him, a large number of Bonda families have bank accounts. Speaking to The Hindu , Malkangiri Collector, K.Sudarshan Chakravarthy said 83 per cent of populace in the tribal-dominated Malkangiri district have Aadhar cards. It includes the Bonda tribals."

Instead, they have to pay their way through, with the policemen on watch at the check-post allegedly demanding anywhere between Rs. 20 and Rs. 50 as toll to let the tourists vehicles in.A bus driver from Karnataka told The Hindu that the cops demanded Rs.100 from him to let two buses into the district. If we refuse, they make us wait for 45 minutes to one hour, till the driver relents and pays up, said the driver who did not wish to reveal his identity. I travel to The Nilgiris quite regularly, and its [paying money at the check-post] a regular occurrence. The police in Karnataka do not extort money from Tamil tourists like this, said the driver.The allegation is that the toll collection from cars, private buses and trucks involves most of the policemen at the check-post.A couple of locals also help them out by collecting the money at a spot that is covered by CCTC surveillance, so that the policemen do not get videographed.Even vegetable trucks are not spared. A share of the consignment of tomatoes, onions and other produce is demanded and taken.The Nilgiris District Superintendent of Police Murali Rambha said he would review the evidence against the policemen at the check-post and take immediate action."

As a result, Vizagites are fast turning into kitchen gardeners. If you have always wanted to grow your own food but lack the expertise to do so, there are many options available.Making the dream of creating blooming kitchen gardens come true, city based startup Your Prosperity is offering door-to-door services by planning, designing and providing regular technical assistance in growing a green space organically.Founded by Karthik Chimata, the startup is already in the process of creating rooftop gardens in 10 houses and apartments in the past two months since its inception. Our main thrust is on organically grown vegetables. There are a lot of information and groups who give tips on creating kitchen or rooftop gardens. However, not many are able to maintain a garden for long or lack the basic skills to start a small green space at home. Our idea was to help create a lifestyle where people can grow fresh organic vegetables on their own and improve the familys health chart, Karthik told The Hindu .His team has six members that include nutritional health coach Sangeeta Muddapu and two natural farming promoters. With an initial investment of Rs 4 lakh, the startup has also started a 500 square yard vegetable nursery near Simhachalam which has varieties of vegetables like tomato, green chilly, ladys finger, bitter gourd among others. They provide services from Duvvada to Tagarapuvalasa with customised assistance on kitchen gardens. Green vegetables grow well in rooftop gardens. However, native vegetables require initial support for 15-20 days. We get the grown vegetables from our nursery to the gardens, said Karthik. The startup also provides round-the-clock assistance in pest management by natural methods. You can contact the startup at 7660938918.When Cyclone Hudhud jolted the citys greenscape in October 2014, Varma Datla and Rambabu Karri got together to create the Facebook group Rythu Mitra for reviving the citys green cover by spreading awareness about home and rooftop gardens. The group today has over 10,000 members from across India which includes 40 NRIs while half the group members hail from the farming community in and around Visakhapatnam.We provide training for terrace, ground and home gardening and also give assistance to farmers who are interested in growing vegetables organically, said Rambabu Karri, one of the group administrators. This apart, Rythu Mithra also provides assistance on utilisation of kitchen wastes to create organic manure. Other city organisations that are working towards creating a green awareness are Paryavarana Margadarsi Vaisakhi (vsp.paryavaran@gmailcom) and Green Face giving tips and assistance for rooftop and kitchen gardens to produce organic vegetables."

I have a line of credit with the moneylender, said Prem Singh Pawar, 64, military-man-and-clerk-turned farmer.About Rs.10,000 is due but that will remain (in our accounts)and well adjust. I have not had a problem with getting wheat seeds. This assertion seems to be borne out by data from the Union Ministry of Agriculture. As of November 11, rabi crop had been sown on 146.85 lakh hectares compared to 126.71 lakh hectares at this time in 2015. Wheat had been sown/transplanted in 25.72 lakh hectares as opposed to 18.65 lakh hectares last year.Palpable crisisBut the crunch of readily-available cash is palpable.

Sales of pesticides and fertilizers are down 50 per cent, said Ashok Gupta, 30, a trader, Nobody is buying anything and our stocks are fast approaching the expiry date. They will be useless in two weeks.Mr. Gupta said his business was heavily dependent on cash, but added that he occasionally deposited some savings in his bank account. This year, he saw customers shifting to the Haryana Seed Development Corporation store  a State-run store three doors away  that was accepting the demonetised Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes. We got a call from the Agriculture Department asking us to accept these notes, said Ajit Singh Gulia, who runs the store.But I spend a few hours after lunch everyday to deposit these notes, he said. The State-run store stocks at least eight varieties of wheat and has a steady stream of buyers. Customers who take more than five sacks (roughly 40 kg a sack) and bring old notes must deposit a copy of their photo identity.Definite lullThe vegetable market, meanwhile, was bustling with deals being struck on tomatoes, cauliflower and potatoes, but Inder Prakash Gupta, general secretary of the vegetable traders association, said there was a definite lull.We have long relationships and can handle the lack of money for sometime, the farmer-cum-moneylender told The Hindu , but added that nearly 40 to 50 people were losing about Rs.15 to Rs.20,000 per day.Private traders in the towns vegetable market, where seeds, pesticide and fertilizer are traded, are upset"

In 2014, the government announced that 15 centres would be opened in Visakhapatnam, 10 in Guntur and five each at Tirupati and Anantapur in phase- I. The fact remains that the officials are still studying various models to roll out more canteens across the State. There is no consensus on the food items to dish out to the people.While there is a proposal to serve lunch with all dishes such as curry, chutney and sambar, the officials negate it saying different types of ricesambar rice, tamarind rice and curd rice-- could be served at these canteens. The GoM is, now, also mulling over a proposal to provide region-specific food at the NTR Canteens. The officials would have to study the food preferences of people in the State. It takes back the issue to square one and a Group of Ministers (GoM) on Anna canteens, subsequently, has decided to study the models in Telangana and Tamil Nadu again.A high-powered delegation headed by Civil Supplies Minister Paritala Sunitha already visited Chennai along with a team in 2014 to study how these canteens, taken up by the Jayalalithaa Government in Tamil Nadu function. The delegation studied whether these could be replicated in AP. The officials also studied the model followed in neighbouring Telangana State.The government had planned to initially provide subsidised food to around 1 lakh people in the first phase. The officials are now scouting for places which are labour intensive saying that the government target was to reach out the labourers. We are planning to start 100 canteens at places such as Visakhapatnam, Nellimara, Rajam, Tirupati, SRikakulam, Anantapur, Hindupur, Kurnool and Kakinada shortly, says Ms. Sunitha. The government also plans to supply region-specific food at these canteens. A proposal to provide full meals is also on cards. We are exploring all the options, she adds.The menuThey (the canteens) are modelled on the lines of Amma Canteens that gained immense popularity in Tamil Nadu. An idly costs just Re.1 in Anna Canteens. Two hundred grams of pongal and an equal quantity of tomato bath costs Rs.5 each. Two hundred grams of sambar rice, pulihora (tamarind rice) and vegetable rice costs Rs.5 each, and 150 grams of curd rice costs Rs.3.There was an overwhelming response to the Velagapudi canteen. Not less than700 people visit the canteen every day. About 500 people have meals there. The government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 4.38 lakh as against total expenses of Rs. 7 lakh per month, she explains."

Many tomato growers have left their yield to rot in their farms as they are not sure of getting back even a portion of their investment. And many of those who do go to the market carrying vegetables return without recovering even the transportation cost.Mithun of Hosahalli in Salagame hobli, Hassan, has grown tomatoes on 17 guntas of land owned by his father, Shivappa. He stopped marketing the harvest when the price of tomato went below Rs. 30 for a 15-kg bag. I have left the tomato plants in the field unattended to and have also let cattle into the farm. What else can I do when I am not sure of getting back even what I spent on harvesting? he asked.Tomato growers require at least six workers to harvest 100 packs (each of 15 kg) a day. The payment to the workers comes up to around Rs. 1,500. If my product is sold at Rs. 20 or 30 a pack, I will not be left with any cash. After deducting 10 per cent commission for middleman and the transportation cost of Rs. 500, I will have nothing left, he said.Tomato growers expect at least Rs. 100 a bag, considering their investment. Last month, they were earning up to Rs. 150 a bag.But now, merchants in the market do not have cash in hand. They are not purchasing vegetables in the amounts they did earlier and are also offering lower prices. Meanwhile, farmers are forced to sell their produce at the rates offered as they cannot take the vegetables back.Ganesh of Narasipura grows many vegetables, including tomato, beans, ridge gourd and capsicum. On at least three days a week, he carries vegetables to the market in Hassan. A kilogram of beans was sold for Rs. 25 last month. Now, it has come down to Rs. 8, he said.He says his income is down by Rs. 25,000 a week.

The restaurant is such a draw that visitors to the Capitol are advised to head a few blocks west for lunch at Mitsitam.The chef, a member of the Navajo tribe, sees the restaurant as a resource for helping people see food in new ways while reminding them that the foundation of their diets  corn and beans and tomatoes  is a legacy of native growers.Native culture has always been viewed as a romantic culture, like this lost thing where everything is comic and cute, he said.Genuine representationMr. Bitsoies challenge in presenting American Indian cuisine is specific and far-reaching: There are more than 500 federally recognised tribes across 34 states, according to the National Congress of American Indians.Mr. Bitsoie said he had found a lot of discrepancies in how people were presenting native cuisine, and I thought it was being represented very unfairly.

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

It is week three since demonetisation. And at Rayakottai tomato mandi, it is business as usual  seemingly uninterrupted by demonetisation.But, for the tomato growers, there is a major concern. The price of tomatoes has seen a drastic fall over the past month, even before demonetisation was announced. The reason being an oversupply of the vegetable, left undisturbed by the failed annual monsoons around this time. Last year this time, when the State reeled under the deluge, tomato growers of Rayakottai saw a bumper price for their produce. Their produce was auctioned between Rs.700 a box (23 kg. per box) to Rs.1,500 a box then. The rainfall had affected the quality of the produce in most fields, and the resultant supply. This in turn saw a spurt in the demand for tomatoes vis a vis a fall in the supply.However this year, with the failure of monsoon, there has been an oversupply of tomatoes from all the fields. Today, a box of tomato is auctioned for Rs.180, says Shanmugam, owner of Saravanan tomato mandi in Rayakottai. That would be Rs.7.80 per kg. the mandi. So are the prices for cauliflowers, says Shanmugam.A bag consisting of 20 quality cauliflowers are being auctioned at Rs.180 per bag. An ideal price for a farmer growing cauliflower would be Rs.300 per bag, because that would just about meet the cost of production for the farmer, says Shanmugam. Rainfall affects shelf life of the vegetables, and offsets the oversupply. But this time, there was no rain, and the price of vegetables has fallen, explains Shanmugam.Sitting behind the counter, Shanmugam, had just finished the auctions and was making payments to the farmers. He had refused a wad of notes of Rs.500. Few notes are accepted, but not in bulk, he says.For the farmers, the sharp pinch felt from the fall of price for tomatoes was only intensified by demonetisation. Most of the fields growing the70-day tomato crop are in the midst of harvesting. Here demonetisation has affected the farmers.The sack, the rope, the tempo rental from the field to the mandi all adds up to Rs.300 per bag for Cauliflowers. But now, its going for Rs.180 per bag, says Marappa, who managed to exchange his Rs.500 note for Rs.400 over the past two weeks. He pitches in with his workers on his tomato field, and cannot lose out a day on the field, waiting outside the bank.Until now, the mandi has been operating on old notes to the extent possible, palming off the burden of currency exchange and deposit on the farmers, who come to auction off their produce. The last two weeks, we could withdraw up to Rs.20,000 per week, but my daily requirement will be Rs.3.5 lakh. The real worry, however, is after December 15, when we will completely stop accepting Rs.500s, he says. The mandis had not been accepting Rs.1,000 anyway, since November 9."

That situation may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the latest technologies in drying and preserving fruits and vegetables.All it takes is to cut open a packet of three-month-old dried vegetables and soak them in water for a while before cooking, all without leaving the comfort of the house.Scientists at the CSIR National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology here have developed an energy-efficient technology for drying a range of fruits and vegetables for preservation. Named Refrigeration Adsorption Dehumidification Drying (RADD), the process involves drying the material under controlled temperature and uniform distribution of air to retain the properties and nutrients. The method is cost-effective and dries faster.According to P. Nisha, scientist, Agro Processing and Natural Products division, NIIST, fruits and vegetables dried using the RADD method were found to have a shelf life ranging from three months to one year. Dr. Nisha said the dried product retained its qualities. NIIST has already transferred the technology for drying spices like nutmeg and cardamom.Packets of spinach, bitter gourd, cucumber, pineapple, banana, cardamom and nutmeg dried using the RADD method are on show at the expo organised in connection with the workshop on agro processing and value addition which began at the Kanakakkunu Palace grounds Thursday.Value added products made from coconut and jackfruit are the highlights of the expo.

Sitting on a choupal and sipping afternoon tea, the septuagenarian recalls how his village was full of trees, rivulets with crystal clear water, the scent of fruits and millets that his father grew on the family farm and of the labourers who carried him on their shoulders.I clearly remember that neither my father nor my grandfather paid them any cash. They would come to the fields at sunrise, have breakfast and lunch with us and leave home in the evening, carrying bundles of hay for their cows and bags of grain for their children, he said. But, by the time Mr. Bhalke grew up to take control of his farm, the system of barter had changed form. Only a part of the payment was paid in grain while the labourers demanded the rest in cash. I have been giving away less grain and more cash for nearly 50 years now. But the cash crunch arising out of demonetisation has changed all that, he said. Barter system has returned to Hulyal. It might be the same in every village in the country, he feels.Usually, labourers seek money in cash as only a few of them have bank accounts. But now, due to the confusion about the currency crisis, the labourers dont want to take a chance with notes. They are insisting that we give them grain. What is more, farmers have no money as the agriculture commission agents in the mandi are buying their produce with the new currency, he said. Does he think barter is good? It depends. Sometimes, it is good for the farmers and sometimes for the labourers and may be sometimes both of us benefit, Mr. Bhalke said.When grain prices are low, barter is good for farmers. And when the grain prices are high, barter is good for labourers. But now that I do not have money but I need to sow jowar in the rabi season. I have to pay labourers in soya and invite them to work on my farm. That is not only essential, but also beneficial for us, he said.Mangalabi, his wife, who oversees the work on the familys 15-acre farm, says the format and quantum of the barter system has changed. Earlier, the labourers would take only the staple grain like jowar or soya. But now, we are giving them soya, tomatoes, chillis, milk, oil, salt and even soap, she said. The asking rate for barter in the village is 2.5 quintals of soya for harvesting 10 quintals on around three acres of land.Rajendra Pawar, a farm labourer from Lal Singh tanda near Ekamba, says he has brought home some soya and some black gram as wages. My mother uses black gram for making items like mixed flour rotis, curry, papad, and dosa. But there is a problem with soya. We need to sell it to get some money for daily expenses. But the buyers in the mandi are not giving us cash right away. They are asking us to wait. Barter is not very helpful in that way, he said. Secondly, how do I pay my childs school fees, by giving soya to the teacher?, Mr. Pawar asks with a loud laugh.There exists a barter system, though slightly different, for carrying grain from the field to the village. Vithal Shilke, of Jamalpur who owns a herd of donkeys, is loading soya bags of 80 kg on the back of each of his donkeys to take them to the farmers house. For this, he gets to take home two kg of soya per donkey. I sell that grain and make around Rs. 3,000 per donkey per month, he said. Demonetisation has helped him bargain for half a kg more for each donkey. But some farmers agree to pay while some shout at us and ask whose grain shall I carry next kharif, Mr. Shilke said, adding, In those cases, I agree to the old rate and go ahead with my work."

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, said both wholesale and retail vegetable dealers were facing losses since demonetisation of the two high value currencies. Vegetable markets are yet to bounce back from the effect, he said.The rates of vegetables have dipped by 5 to 6 per cent in the last few weeks. Business has gone down by nearly 50 per cent. At least half of the stock of vegetables is going waste with no takers. Many vendors have been forced to dump the vegetables as they perish quickly, he said.He added that people did not have money, and hence, the markets were dull with no business. Until a few days ago, we were accepting the old Rs. 500 notes from customers, while we were accepting the old Rs. 1,000 till last week. We have stopped accepting these notes as we do not have change to give in return, Mr. Balu added.The cost of tomatoes is Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 a kg while onions are priced between Rs. 8 and Rs. 15 (fresh onions) while the old onions are priced at Rs. 10 to Rs. 20. Small onions cost Rs. 20 to Rs. 30 while potatoes cost Rs. 20.The cost of other vegetables (per kilo): ladys finger  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, drumstick  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, brinjal  Rs. 15 to Rs. 30, cabbage  Rs. 10, carrot  Rs. 15, beans  Rs. 12, green chillies  Rs. 20 to Rs. 25, ginger  Rs. 30 to Rs. 40, broad beans  Rs. 20, bitter gourd  Rs. 12 to Rs. 15, snake gourd  Rs. 12, yam  Rs. 20, peas  Rs. 80, and coriander (a bunch)  Rs. 15."

Shops and business establishments were open. Though there was an apprehension among a section of traders on opening the shops on account of official mourning that would continue till Thursday, some traders opened the shutters as usual. Following this, others also resumed their business.Similarly, hotels, restaurants, eateries which had downed shutters on Tuesday as a mark of respect to the late leader, resumed their business as usual. Cinema halls resumed the shows from afternoon.The Gandhi Market that attracts traders from Tiruchi and nearby areas resumed its activities with the arrival of vegetables from villages. However, the arrival was less than the usual, traders said.The market will witness optimum business from Thursday as loads from far away places and neighbouring States will reach Tiruchi on Wednesday night, a wholesale merchant of tomato said.Normality returned to the Tiruchi Bus Stand, which wore a deserted look on Monday and Tuesday, with the operation of State owned Transport Corporations and private buses. The long distance buses bound for Chennai, Tiruvananthapuram, Coimbatore and other destinations were operated as usual. Similarly, city buses were on roads. However, the occupancy rate in the long distance buses was said to be less than the normal days.Reports from Karur, Ariyalur and Perambalur said that normality had retuned in most of the towns and rural areas. Though the cadres of AIADMK and the people were yet to come out of grief, sorrow and shock over the death of Jayalalithaa, traders and merchants slowly opened their business houses. Most of the textile and mosquito net manufacturing units too resumed their operation as usual on Wednesday.To stay away from courtsThe Tiruchi Bar Association on Wednesday resolved to abstain from attending courts for three days as a mark of respect to the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. A resolution to that effect was passed unanimously at its special meeting.V. Srinivasan, president, and J. Mathiazhagan, secretary, were present. Over 700 advocates attended the meeting. Stating that the death of Jayalalithaa was an irreparable loss to the country, particularly Tamil Nadu, the resolution said that the advocates would not attend courts till Friday as a mark of tribute to her. Earlier, they paid floral tribute to the late leader. They also observed two-minute silence.ThanjavurThe AIADMK cadre and the public displayed enormous resilience in the aftermath of the demise of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa testified by the sombre mood and absence of any untoward incident from any part of the region on Wednesday. Though most people are in grief, normality slowly returned to the delta districts.Most of the shops and trading establishments reopened on Wednesday while fuel stations too started dispensing supplies to motorists. The TNSTC resumed operations but on a vastly reduced scale as the movement of passengers and commuters was dull. Holiday for educational institutions was one reason for the lean movement of passengers, sources said.Meanwhile, people and AIADMK cadre continued to glorify Jayalalithaa, adorning her portraits with flowers in major street corners and in almost all villages in the region. At Koviladi, around 15 cadre tonsured their heads and took bath in the Cauvery. Amma was all for us and we feel orphaned by her death. So we decided to undertake the rituals, normally done in the event of death of their own mother, Sundaram, one among the cadre, said. At Sengipatti nine cadre tonsured their heads as a mark of respect to the departed leader.Thanjavur Kamaraj Market Vegetable and Fruit Vendors Association took out a candle light procession led by association president Dharmaraj.

PeriasamyM_PERIASAMYCome Monday, the Coimbatore Corporation will turn its attention towards the Thudiyalur weekly market to stop the use of plastic bags.The civic body was supposed to have taken up the work on December 5 but due to the sudden turn of events in the State, the civic body would start the work on December 12. It had displayed notices warning traders and customers and also held meetings with the former in this regard a couple of weeks ago. Therefore, the move would not catch the two by surprise, said sources.The reason the civic body focussed on the weekly market was that the volume of plastic bags that changed hands was quite high. The estimate was over 50,000 but this was only a conservative figure. Sometimes, it could be as high as over a lakh bags, they said.S. Suresh, who collects cess from traders at the market, said the number of traders could vary from 1,000 to nearly 2,000. Assuming that each trader sold goods to 50 to 100 customers, they would have used 50,000 to a lakh bags.The traders, who begin business around 11 a.m. and wind up by 10 p.m., sell vegetables, greens, groceries, snacks, footwear, farm implements and clothes. But most sell vegetables and they use plastic bags, he added.By focussing on the weekly market, the Corporation would be able to bring around a significant change, for it would be able to work with a number of traders and customers at a venue. Plus, when the traders move to other weekly markets, there would be changes there too, however small, the sources said.What the Corporation was attempting to do was welcome but it should go beyond initiating penal action against traders packing goods in plastic bags. It should provide an alternative and that should be a workable alternative, said K. Senthilkumar, who sold puffed rice.How could I sell puffed rice in paper bags or cloth bags. Will it remain crisp and moisture-free, he asked and suggested that there should be reasonable exceptions.Vegetable vendor V. Rangaraj said that selling vegetables without plastic bags was not difficult but customers, especially while buying tomatoes, insisted that the traders provided plastic bags.To bring about a total change, the Corporation should also penalise customers, he suggested.Former Councillor of the area V. Vathsala said that Corporations drive to ban use of plastic bags in the market on Mondays needed to be welcomed. But the civic body should do more for the market.The traders and buyers did not have public convenience facility.The vendors resorted to open urination and defecation and that too not far from where they sold goods. To improve the hygiene, the Corporation should build toilets and also platforms for them to sell their goods.Plus, the Corporation should strengthen the conservancy work there, especially on Tuesdays and Wednesdays because after the traders vacated the market, cattle went there to feed on vegetable waste and their dung added to the sanitation problem.She had raised the issue several times. A comprehensive solution would be in order, Ms. Vathsala added."

Not only Chatoi, many other traders at the mandi are facing problems in arranging smaller currency notes even after almost one month of the demonetisation. Most of the traders have to depend on the cash collected from the daily sale of their products to make payments to labourers and meet other expenses. The cash crunch has adversely affected the overall business transactions of the traders at Chatra Bazaar by almost 30 per cent in the past one month. ""Though most of the traders here have started to make payments through cheques to their counterparts in neighbouring states, we are facing problems as we have to make daily payments to the labourers in smaller currency notes, which are not readily available,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi also claimed that the closure of banks for three consecutive days also had led to shortage of cash as most of the ATMs also ran dry till late in the afternoon today. ""I could not make payments to my staff and labourers as I had withdrawn cash for the last time on Friday. The retail traders are also making payments to us in new Rs 2,000 currencies. The situation at the market is unlikely to improve till supply of Rs 500 notes are not increased along with the weekly withdrawal cap of Rs 24,000 per week,"" Chatoi added. Around 5,000 people comprising wholesale, retail traders, middlemen, farmers and labourers are directly involved in the daily fruits and vegetable trade at Chatra bazaar that caters to the bulk of the vegetable requirement not only for the people of Cuttack but for nearby cities also. Chatra bazaar usually registers a daily business to the tune of Rs 2 to 3 crore and 50 to 60 trucks are engaged in transportation of goods to other parts of the state. Now, only 25 to 35 trucks are arriving on a daily basis here. ""There was sharp fall in the booking of stocks from neighbouring states, including Andhra Pradesh and Bengal, during initial period of the demonetisation. However, the situation has improved considerably in the past one week,"" said Kedarnath Lenka, another trader. Lenka said that a truck full of vegetables from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh costs nearly Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000 per trip, while daily payments to labourers vary from Rs 2,000 to 3, 500 per day, including some cash payment to drivers. Earlier, all the traders used to make payments in cash through the drivers arriving from various states with commodities. A senior member of the Chatra Bazaar traders association, Devendra Sahu said despite the financial crisis, there had been no hike in the prices of vegetables in the past one month due to good harvest and production of locally produces from Athgarh, Banki and other nearby areas in the district. ""The retail traders are now depending on the vegetables such as cauliflower, cucumber, tomatoes, brinjals grown by farmers of nearby areas to meet the requirements. As a result, there is no pressure on wholesale traders for bulk import of such vegetables which are perishable items from the neighbouring states,"" said Sahu. Traders at Chatra Bazaar mostly imports tomatoes, peas, coconuts, pumpkin, potatoes and other vegetables and fruits including apple, orange and grapes from neighbouring states, including Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Maharastra."

Picture by Hardeep Singh For once, nature's bounty has become a bane for farmers and boon for homemakers in Ranchi. Surplus yield of tomatoes in these demonetised times is forcing farmers of Bero, Mandar and Pithoria to sell their juicy produce at throwaway prices in the capital. The culinary vegetable (botanically, a fruit) is available for as low as Rs 4 per kg in wholesale markets while the retail price has plummeted from Rs 18-20 a kg a month ago to Rs 8-10 a kg now because of a grave supply-demand mismatch triggered by cash crunch in the market. In Jharkhand, tomatoes are grown in the vegetable belts of Ranchi, Lohardaga, Hazaribagh and Chaibasa. According to K.K. Jha, a horticultural scientist at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Kanke, the total tomato yield is around 13.5 lakh metric tonnes this year against 11 lakh metric tonnes last time. ""Production is surplus, but the demand in market is limited because people are rationing their kitchen needs because of the cash crisis. Farmers have little choice but to sell their produce at throwaway rates because tomato is a perishable item,"" Jha explained how demonetisation had altered market dynamics. Vinod Kumar, a vegetable vendor at Lalpur market, said he had stocked five quintals from the wholesale haat of Makhmandro near Pandra. ""Farmers are selling tomatoes at Rs 4 a kg. They don't have easy access to banks and are in dire need of cash to run their families. The bumper crop has made their labour dirt cheap,"" Vinod said, adding that he was extending the price advantage to his buyers. ""For the past week, I am selling tomatoes at Rs 8-10 a kilo, half the usual rate."" Vijay Gupta, another vendor in Lalpur, said 50 trucks of tomatoes arrived at Makhmandro haat every day, but at least 10 trucks were surplus. ""Farmers have been hit bad. They cannot stock tomatoes on their own and hence, are selling their produce to middlemen too at very low prices,"" Gupta said. Namita Singh, a resident of Circular Road, said she was thrilled to buy 5kg tomatoes for just Rs 50. ""The best part is I spent five Rs 10 coins on the purchase. My purse is lighter for good. Tomatoes add great taste to every curry, especially in winter,"" she beamed."

Jhode says the prices have fallen from Rs 15 to Rs 10 a kg in the wake of the demonetisation move Nagpur/Wardha, Nov. 21: Bandu Ghormade had no choice but to accept the old Rs 500 notes from the procurement agent and a lower price: Rs 200 less for every 40kg crate of his freshly harvested eggplants. ""If I didn't, my produce would have gone waste,"" said the farmer in his late 40s who grows carrots, spinach, eggplants and okra in Chicholi, about 50km from Nagpur. ""Those who grow grains or cotton can hold on to their crop; I can't."" For years, Ghormade would load four quintals (400kg) of vegetables on his tempo every morning from October to December and drive to Nagpur's state-run Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi, where licensed traders buy farmers' produce through agents. Since November 8, when high-value notes were demonetised, Ghormade has been selling at a loss at the mandi every day while his son is going to the nearest bank, 5km away, to stand in queue and deposit the notes. Still, Ghormade is earning something because he is ready to accept the old notes. Some farmers, also with perishable produce, are not - and are taking terrible losses. Many farmers have junked their vegetables in the absence of buyers at markets in Thane and Pune, newspaper reports suggest. At the Hiwarkhed village market in Amaravati, about 160km from Nagpur, orange growers have dumped mounds of the fruit on the roads in protest at a sharp fall in prices. The prices have fallen because the traders have stopped buying. The traders aren't buying because most farmers aren't accepting the old notes. So, is the farmers' plight solely an inevitable consequence of a poorly planned demonetisation, or are they shooting themselves in the foot by insisting on payments in usable cash? Sudam Pawar, 38, was the lone farmer at the mandi in Selu town in Wardha district, about 70km from Nagpur, selling his nine quintals of cotton on Wednesday. The trader offered to transfer the money directly into his bank account. Pawar, former sarpanch of Aamgaon village, agreed. The money got transferred immediately, without any hassles. Later that day, Pawar said, eight more farmers known to him sold about 80 quintals of cotton at the mandi, accepting the old notes. With hardly any other arrivals, the trader bought their cotton at Rs 5,000 a quintal - a little more than the market price of Rs 4,750-4,900. So, why are more farmers not following their example? Pawar explained the point. Most farmers are afraid to put their earnings in their bank accounts because these are in the same banks from where they have taken crop loans. A majority are long-term defaulters because, for years, they haven't earned enough to repay their loans as well as sustain their families. Once their earnings go into their accounts, they fear the banks will discourage withdrawals, pressuring them to leave a balance equal to the sum they would need to repay by March to settle their loans. Most farmers know that this would leave them in serious jeopardy. There's no government order asking the banks to unilaterally deduct the loan repayment from the farmers' accounts, but the banks have used pressure tactics in the past, knowing well that the farmers cannot afford to annoy them because they would need a loan the following year too. ""I could accept the money transfer because I don't have a loan in my name, nor do I need cash urgently,"" Pawar said. ""Our crop loan is linked to my father's account, so the bank cannot deduct the repayment amount from my account."" Nor were the other eight sellers at the mandi in any urgent need of cash, he said. ""But most small farmers, who do sustenance farming and have no other income, won't accept cheques or money transfers."" ""Demonetisation has wrecked the farmers,"" said Ramkrishna Umathe, farmer and deputy chairman of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandi at Selu, which serves about 100 mainly soybean and cotton-growing villages. ""For about a week, sellers and buyers have virtually deserted our market."" So the coolies, transporters and other ancillaries too have been without work, assistant market secretary Mahendra Bhandarkar said. ""This is the time of year for brisk sales but the arrivals have tanked since November 8,"" Umathe said on Wednesday. From 5,000 quintals a day, the arrivals had dropped to zero, he said. ""Yesterday, 100 sacks (quintals) came."" Umathe said the traders were offering cheques and money transfers but the farmers weren't ready to accept these lest the banks ""deduct the crop loan"". ""Most fields are un-irrigated here; the farmers are already under a lot of financial stress. They have to repay hand loans and the cost of inputs taken on credit, and pay their grocers and farm hands,"" Umathe said. ""If there's some residual money, it gets deposited into the bank - else the bank loans remain unpaid."" Sales - and prices - of produce are falling for another reason too: a drop in consumption in the retail markets. ""Forward movements have been affected,"" said Rajesh Thakar, a wholesale tomato trader in Nashik. For instance, orange arrivals at the Nagpur mandi have dried up because of a demonetisation-driven slump in sales at the markets in Calcutta and north India, said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director at the Nagpur APMC and an orange trader himself. ""Orange prices fell 25 to 35 per cent today (Tuesday), from Rs 40,000 to Rs 25-30,000 per tonne,"" he said. ""Ten to 12 truckloads of oranges left the mandi for Calcutta daily; that has stopped."" Madhusudan Harane, a director at the APMC in Hinganghat town in Wardha district, said: ""Our APMC has been shut since November 8."" He questioned the timing of the demonetisation. ""Some Rs 1,500 crore worth of annual business took place in our mandi, over half of it between October and December - the peak months for farm markets,"" he said. The irony is, a favourable monsoon had led to a good harvest this year and the farmers were hoping for good returns after successive years of drought in many regions of the country."

The measures were taken following last week's temporary ban ordered by the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority (Bafra) on import of these vegetables. Confirming the development, the secretary-general of the Bhutan-India Friendship Association, Gelephu chapter, Ugyen Rabten, said: ""There has been strict surveillance on vegetables imported from India. It is much less now, but still continuing as local supply is not enough to meet the demands downstream."" Rabten said the ban is mostly on vegetables produced at Falakata in West Bengal and Barpeta in Assam, which are said to have high pesticide content. ""There will be proper monitoring of the imports now,"" he said. Assam shares 261km of the 700km international border with Bhutan. Of this, Kokrajhar shares 85km, Baksa 83km, Chirang 40km and Udalguri 53km of international border with Bhutan. People from Bhutan purchase most of the vegetables from border areas at Datgiri in Chirang besides Darangamela, Kumarikata, Subankhata and Nikashi in Baksa and Bhairabkhunda in Udalguri districts in Assam. The Bhutan media has reported that the agriculture and forest ministry last week had asked Bafra to clamp a temporary ban on import of beans and cauliflowers following lab tests that showed pesticide residues higher than the permissible limit for human consumption. Reports, quoting a ministry press release, said: ""Following the recent positive test results confirmed through use of the test kits for imported fruits and vegetables, the samples of selected 10 imported fruits and vegetables have been tested in three reference food laboratories in India and Thailand."" Assam agriculture commissioner Amlan Baruah told The Telegraph in Guwahati this evening that he is not aware of the ban, but now that the matter has been brought to the notice of the state government, it will definitely examine the issue. ""Buying and selling of agri/horti produce are private activities and do not come under the purview of the agriculture department, but we will look into it since a neighbouring country is involved. We will be issuing advisories to the growers to follow the guidelines developed by our state university on use of pesticides. The ban would also have its impact on the growers about benefits of using pesticides judiciously,"" Baruah said. Sources said the ban has affected bean growers in lower Assam districts. Initially, the ban was imposed on import of potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, beans, cabbages and cauliflowers from Indian markets. But as the production of organic vegetables goes down in Bhutan, demand for vegetables grown in the border districts goes up. ""So, except beans, all other vegetables have been supplied to Bhutan as before,"" a vegetable vendor from Chirang district said. The demand of vegetables grown in India is more in Bhutan because of their cheap price compared to vegetables produced in that country, a police source at Datgiri in the India-Bhutan bordering area and one of the gateways to Bhutan, told The Telegraph. Bhutan nationals in Sarpang district of that country buy green vegetables from a big weekly market at Datgiri in India every Thursday. ""The market survives on buyers from Bhutan,"" Nandalal Mogor, a youth of Runikhta in Chirang district, said. According to a section of farmers in Chirang, growers in West Bengal use higher amount of fertilisers and chemical pesticides. ""Vegetable farmers in lower Assam use fertilisers and chemicals wisely. Early seasonal vegetables need high amount of chemicals for growth and their prices are also high because of the cost of the chemicals,"" farmers in the Bengtol area in Chirang said."

(Vishvendu Jaipuriar) Hazaribagh, Dec. 16: Ravi Kumar Gupta has a degree in civil engineering from Gaya College of Engineering. But the 30-year-old hasn't taken up a job. Instead, he grows tomatoes. A 'red revolution' is bearing fruit in the red zone of Vishnugarh, where Ravi and his two friends, Pintu Kumar Saw and Awadh Kumar Yadav, have turned a barren 18-acre plot in the non-descript Chalkari village into a farmers' delight, not only growing tomatoes but also creating jobs for fellow villagers in the process. This is no mean feat given that Vishnugarh has its own share of challenges, being a safe den for Maoists because of its topography marked by hills and dense forests and a border that overlaps with Gomia (Bokaro) and Bagodar (Giridih). Chalkari is located on the Bagodar border, some 48km from the Hazaribagh district headquarters. ""I come from a family of farmers at Banka village in Katkamdag block. I was never keen on a job and had always wanted to do agriculture. I convinced my friends Pintu and Awadh, who are graduates and help their fathers in the field, from the same village to join me. After consulting local agricultural scientists, who confirmed that the soil was good for tomato cultivation, we took up the land at Chalkari and started our own farming,"" a visibly proud Ravi told The Telegraph. He added that they started the groundwork in June and till now, had sold 70,000 quintals of tomatoes in the local markets besides sending consignments to Bengal. ""In the next two months, they will grow more tomatoes. Many villagers have been roped in to take care of the tomato plants right from sowing the seeds to plucking the vegetable. This way, we have generated employments,"" said the new-age farmer. Pintu and Awadh, also in their 30s, added they had invested around Rs 10 lakh on this project, but were happy to see that our efforts finally started giving returns. ""One plant produces more then 5kg tomatoes on an average. Hazaribagh is a green belt and very conducive for agriculture. With huge swathes of land lying abandoned, unemployed youths can make farming their profession and earn good money,"" Pintu said. Ravi added: ""Yes, this needs hard work, but if done with honesty will give good results as in our case."" Local villagers hailed the trio, saying their success was an inspiration for others. ""Definitely, this kind of inspiring tales will encourage youths to make a career in agriculture as engineer Ravi and his two graduate friends did,"" said Bhuvaneshvar Patel, RJD district president and resident of Vishnugarh."

Telegraph Picture If all goes well, the 20,000-tonne vegetable processing plant in Kanke, the foundation of which was laid by chief minister Raghubar Das in February this year, will start operations in six months from now. Being set up by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), an autonomous entity working for the state government to boost milk production and market agrarian products, the plant will be the home of Safal products, ranging from fresh vegetables to all kinds of fruits. Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of NDDB, is investing around Rs 70 crore in the project. Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, B.S. Khanna, managing director of Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation (also known as Jharkhand Milk Federation), a joint venture between the state government and NDDB, said work on the plant spread over 27 acres was proceeding in full swing and they were bullish about beginning operations in another six months provided no hurdle crops up. ""Between February and now, there has been considerable progress in this project. We are bang on time with our groundwork. I visited the site two days ago and found the progress to be satisfactory. The process of setting up a boundary in and around the plant is almost complete. This apart, structure of the plant has come up while construction of the roof will begin very soon. Procurement of equipment and machinery is going on simultaneously,"" Khanna said. They had also got in touch with the district administration and power department for setting up an electricity feeder. ""There are some encroachment issues on a small patch of land. We are in talks with the district administration to ensure that it doesn't affect the plant in future. We are hopeful that these issues will be sorted out soon,"" he added. Once it begins functioning, the plant will initially take up pea and tomato processing and marketing followed by seasonal vegetables such as cabbage, beans and cauliflowers that are grown in abundance both on the capital's outskirts and adjacent districts. ""We have plans to take up fruits as well in phases. As far as veggies are concerned, frozen peas, tomato puree and pastes are a few items that we intend to supply in the market. The raw materials will be directly procured from farmers, which will ensure them good returns,"" he said. As for milk production, Khanna said the 1.2-lakh litre automated dairy plant in Hotwar, which also officially debuted this February, had touched the 75,000-litre production mark. ""Earlier, we used to process roughly around 20,000-25,000 litres of milk. Slowly, we touched the 75,000-litre mark. Soon, Ranchi dairy will be producing to its full capacity,"" he signed off."
58e534c4a3d24b500504a431,The capacity for obedience,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-capacity-for-obedience/article16757514.ece,2016-12-04,,The Hindu,"Tyranny is not possible without mass obedience. The murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust was carried out not by sadistic monsters but by ordinary humans who were obeying orders. Writing on the trial of Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann, Hannah Arendt coined the memorable phrase, the banality of evil.The enabler of such evil is the moral imperative to obey. For the Holocaust to have been averted, the majority of German citizens needed to disobey. But they did not. In the words of Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal, We know that one doesnt need to be fanatical, sadistic, or mentally ill to murder millions; that it is enough to be a loyal follower eager to do ones duty.Today, as authoritarian leaders are voted to power in countries around the world, many fear that their ability to command blind loyalty from their followers could erode democratic institutions and practices, with frightening consequences for civil liberties and human rights.The experimentThis has renewed interest in the psychology of obedience, which is a fascinating subject in itself. The most systematic study of obedience was conducted by the American psychologist Stanley Milgram in 1962-63 at Yale University. His findings, published in a book titled Obedience to Authority in 1974, became a bestseller in its time, and makes for an enlightening read in ours.Milgram sought to answer a basic question: To what extent would people obey a command that severely conflicts with their conscience, values, and self-image?The experiment he designed was as simple as it was brilliant. Milgram advertised in the newspaper seeking volunteers for an experiment in learning. From the list of respondents, two people at a time are invited to his lab. One of them is designated a teacher and the other a learner. The experimenter, clad in a grey lab coat, and representing the authority of science and academia, explains to them that the study is about the effect of punishment on learning.The learner is taken to a room and strapped to a chair with electrodes attached to his wrist. He is told he has to learn a list of word pairs for a test, and every time he makes an error, he will receive electric shocks of increasing intensity.The teacher is taken to another room and seated facing a shock generator with 30 switches, ranging from 15 volts to 450 volts. He is told that he will administer the test, and also the shocks for the wrong answers, increasing the level each time the learner makes a mistake.But the teacher, in Milgrams words, is a genuinely nave subject. He doesnt know that the learner is a confederate of Milgrams who receives no shock at all, and has been instructed to give wrong answers. The point of the experiment, Milgram writes, is to see how far a person will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which he is ordered to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim.Shocking resultsMilgrams descriptions of the experiment in his book, his analyses of the subjects justifications for their obedience, even the chapter on research methodology, make for a gripping read. Common sense leads us to expect that most individuals would refuse to administer electric shock to anyone, even as part of an experiment. Indeed, one must be a psychopath  not unlike what the world imagined Eichmann to be  to continue administering shocks to a helpless individual even after he starts to protest.But the results of Milgrams path-breaking experiment shocked (no pun intended) the American public: 65 per cent, or roughly two-thirds, of the participants continued giving shocks to the maximum level (450 volts). Every single participant continued up to 300 volts. (For the sake of comparison: the household electrical circuit in India is typically at 220 volts).The disturbing conclusion of Milgrams experiment was that most people would follow the orders of an authority figure, even if it meant killing an innocent person. With the Eichmann trial still fresh in public memory, Americans bristled at the insinuation that their capacity for a moral response to an authoritys abuse of power was no different from that of Germans under Nazi rule. Interestingly, the same experiment conducted in Germany found an obedience rate of 85 per cent.Milgram reproduced in his book the transcripts of the verbal exchanges between the experimenter and the teacher, which chart the transformation of an ordinary clerk or factory worker into a cold-blooded bureaucrat administering death to someone hed just met. A recent biopic on Milgram, titled Experimenter (2015), starring Peter Sarsgaard (as Milgram) and Winona Ryder, does a splendid job of dramatising the lab experiments.To be fair, nearly every subject turned to the experimenter for guidance when the learner began to scream in pain. But the experimenter would urge the teacher to continue, and the latter would comply. The authority  in this case, the experimenter  had no means of enforcing obedience. The participant stood to lose nothing from disobedience  no danger of material loss, and no threat to life, unlike, say, a civilian in the Nazi bureaucracy. And yet most of them obeyed. How does one account for this transformation?Behavioural modesMilgrams explanation was that people operate in two behavioural modes: autonomous and agentic. It is when a person is functioning as an autonomous individual that his conscience kicks into play, dictating behaviour. The moment he enters a social hierarchy  which could be an army or a state bureaucracy or a company management  he sees himself as an agent of anothers will, thereby shifting the (moral) responsibility for his actions to the authority. This enables him to act in ways that he would not were he to take personal responsibility for his actions.Milgram drew on evolutionary theory to explain this transformation. A potential for obedience is the prerequisite for social organisation, he noted, and because organisation has enormous survival value for any species, such a capacity was bred into the organism through the extended co-operation of evolutionary processes.He switched to cybernetics (the science of regulation and control) to demonstrate why civilisation depends on it: What modifications in its design are required if an [automaton] is to move from self-regulation to hierarchical functioning? Milgram answered: The most general need in bringing self-regulating automata into a co-ordinated hierarchy is to suppress individual direction and control in favour of control from higher components the individuals who enter into such hierarchies are, of necessity, modified in their functioning. We imbibe this modified functioning from family and school, which drill into us values such as loyalty, duty, and obedience to authority.Scope for disobedienceOf course, this does not mean that the scope for disobedience is absent in a hierarchical set-up. In situations where the group pressure to disobey outweighs the imperative to obey, disobedience results. This is something revolutionary leaders have intuitively known, and political activists operate with the understanding that resistance is only possible through collective agency. Hence the popularity of civil disobedience as a tactic to build solidarity and undermine authority.Milgrams work needs revisiting if we wish to understand the workings of authoritarianism and whether its worldwide emergence has anything to do with a deep psychological need to be led, for clear answers, for certainty in an era of ambiguity and uncertainty.His Obedience to Authority is unparalleled as a document of human vulnerability to tyranny, and as an article of faith for humanitys capacity to resist tyranny.sampath.g@thehindu.co.inWhen a person is functioning as an autonomous individual, his conscience kicks into play.

The herd was lingering at the thickets abutting Sivunikuppam village of Santhipuram mandal at 8 p.m. on Thursday.Since Wednesday midnight, forest officials of the Bangarpet range, Krishnagiri range of Tamil Nadu and Kuppam range of A.P. have been camping at the villages.Officials argueThe Karnataka officials refused to allow the pachyderms to enter their side, arguing that the herd had actually emerged from the T.N. side. However, the T.N. officials too remained stubborn, demanding that the elephants be driven towards Karnataka. The Bangarpet range staff had even brought the tranquillizer guns to dart at the herd, in case they kept entering their limits.The Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West), T. Chakrapani, held a series of talks with officials of the border States. A solution was arrived at on Thursday late in the evening.Keeping in view the reluctance of the pachyderms to move towards Karnataka, and their inclination to march towards Tamil Nadu, the forest personnel of Chittoor district readied their path towards Mallanur near Kuppam, close to the Maharaja Kadai forests of Tamil Nadu.During the the last 24 hours, standing crops of paddy and tomato and horticulture crops were reportedly damaged by the herd in Santhipuram mandal. Mr. Chakrapani told The Hindu that with the cooperation of villagers and forest personnel of the neighbouring states, the tense situation in the rural areas was brought under control."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Demonetisation has paralysed wholesale markets in the city, be they of grocery  rice, wheat, pulses, spices and suchlike  or fruits. The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. As one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."

The herds have retreated to the thickets of the neighbouring States. But the prowling of two lone elephants at the tri-State junction continues leaving the farmers in about 100 fringe villages in a grip of tension as they expect the return of the herds to their fields any time.During the last five years, movement of the wild elephants, numbering over 70 and split into five or six herds, between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon in the Kuppam region.Two herds had barged into the fringe hamlets of the two constituencies in the third week of December, and the forest personnel could drive them back into the thickets of TN and Karnataka in separate operations during the last couple of days.Since August, the farmers of the Kuppam mandal have been familiar with the presence of a lone elephant moving along the borders of Tamil Nadu. Another single elephant problem surfaced a couple of days ago in Santhipuram mandal, when it got separated from a herd of seven pachyderms.The farmers who are generally used to drought conditions mostly rely on horticulture crops. Since November, stretches of banana, potato, tomato and beans plantations suffered the ire of the marauding tuskers in many villages. With Sankranthi just two weeks away, the farmers get ready to harvest their crops.However, the man-animal conflict has forced them to abandon night vigils. This gives them an additional headache: scope for theft of motor pump sets and other electrical gadgets and cables by miscreants. Danger also lurks for farmers while moving in the fields during 10.00 pm-2.00 am shift of power supply. In the last two years, five farmers had been killed in the attacks of wild elephants. At the same time, seven pachyderms were reported killed in the same region, due to infighting among the herds and electrocution in the fields. The last quarter of 2015 had witnessed the presence of large herds in the V.Kota and Ramakuppam mandals.Forest Range Officer (Kuppam), Kalappa Naidu, said all efforts were under way to prevent the man-animal conflict in the region, including strengthening of solar fencing, digging of elephant proof trenches and talks with the TN and Karnataka forest department officials, seeking their coordination in monitoring the movement of the wild elephants.Movement of the wild elephants between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon"

All that he was offered for a box of 25 kg of tomatoes was Rs. 60.The frustrated farmer dumped all 350 boxes he had and returned home empty-handed.This is not the first case. We have been witnessing this since demonetisation came into effect, said Srinivas, a clerk with a commission agent.He said the Anantapur farmer preferred to sell the produce in Hyderabad as there were no takers in small markets in the Rayalaseema region. He had to pay Rs. 2,000 for the hamalis [workers who load and unload goods] alone. He will not be able to recover those costs.Daily affairMr. Srinivas said a bag of 80 kg carrots would earlier fetch Rs. 600 to 700 but the farmers are not getting more than Rs. 200 now, thanks to the cash crunch. You can find heaps of vegetables thrown in the yard when the market closes at 10 p.m.The Special Grade Secretary of the market, Y.V.

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."

File PHOTOVegetable farmers in Punjab and Haryana are going through yet another period of hardship as the wholesale price of the seasonal crops has hit the rock bottom, forcing farmers into distress sale.Farmers and officials told The Hindu that with the harvesting season picking up, the supply of green peas, cauliflower, potato, carrot and tomatoes had increased. But the demand is subdued because of the poor cash availability.Farmers have not been able to recover even the production cost.At the Amritsar vegetable market, price of green peas on Moday was down to Rs. 4 a kg, well below the production cost of Rs. 6 a kg. Farmers blamed the poor returns on the increased supply and demonetisation.Cash crunch impactGreen pea prices are so low that I wont even recover the input cost , said Jagbir Singh Maan, a farmer from Manawal Kalan in Amritsar. He said traders were offering low prices, citing subdued demand and the cash crunch post-demonetisation.In the fruit and vegetable market in Chandigarh, the wholesale prices of fresh vegetables have slumped because of the rise in supply and low demand.Rajinder Kumar, secretary of the Chandigarh Market Committee, said in the past week, potato prices ruled at Rs. 5-10 a kilogram. I have been supplying vegetables in bulk to hotels in Chandigarh, but since demonetisation, the orders have gone down by 30 per cent, said Deepak Dhawan, who is a commission agent in the Chandigarh market.The wholesale prices of all seasonal vegetables have dropped in the past month, he said.In the Jalandhar vegetable market, potatoes fetched a paltry Rs. 2 a kg on Monday. Prices are down but I dont have any other option than selling. If I delay, the quality of the potato will deteriorate. I have to sow wheat after potato harvest, hence, Im forced to sell my crop at a poor price, though it means a heavy loss, said Jaswinder Singh, a Jalandhar potato farmer.In Haryana too, farmers are selling seasonal vegetables at throw away prices. In the Shahbad market, potato fetched Rs. 2.75 a kg, while cauliflower went for Rs. 2 a kg. I sold my potato for Rs. 2.75 a kilogram.As the prices have dropped, farmers in my village have started feeding their potatoes to their cattle to avoid buying feed, said Rakesh Bains, a farmer from Kurukshetra, who planted potato on 24 acres.Farmers have been unable to recover cost of productionas the priceshave plummeted"

She said while in West they call it a lifestyle, in India we call it a way of life.Irani said modernity and tradition can go hand in hand and make India proud.Modernity is belief in our way of life, in having a open minded dialogue about it. And it is our family where people can set examples and encourage youngsters to embrace modernity without compromising Indian traditional values, she said.Irani said that for her, the real definition of modernity is if you accept and respect everybodys point of view, if you embrace your traditions without being ashamed of them.Author and award-winning scriptwriter Advaita Kala, who was also present at the session, said modernity can be viewed from different perspectives. Some say modernity has made us automatons of delivery and has dehumanised us. But we should not forget that we are the beneficiaries of modernity. The way forward is to reconcile modernity and traditions. It is high time we move away from the battle of modernity vs tradition, she said."

Last week, Cuttack mayor Anita Behera had to resign after her name was found in the list of NFSA beneficiaries. The government has suspended at least 15 officials in various parts of the state for bungling in preparation of the cards.Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee president Prasad Harichandan said the rising incidents of protests against the ministers showed peoples discontent, particularly after mass irregularities in ration cards. It reflects only peoples anger on the government, he said. Justifying the egg attacks, Congress chief whip Taraprasad Bahinipati said, Not only eggs, the BJD leaders deserved to be attacked by sticks, Bahinipati said.BJD condemned the attacks. In a democracy everybody has a right to protest. But the means has to be democratic. Nobody can take law into ones hands. Those provoking them are also liable for action, said BJD spokesperson and MLA Amar Prasad Satpathy.Though the ongoing spell of egg attacks on the ministers is being attributed to NFSA scam, the trend had picked up after some Congress workers hurled eggs at chief minister Naveen Patnaik in February 2014.In November first week, eggs were hurled on agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy and school and mass education minister Debi Prasad Mishra, among others."

And one of Bapu's original disciples, Abdul Hamid Kureshi , 89 -the chair man of the Sabarmati Ashram - has enclosed a message in his death. Kureshi, who was also an eminent lawyer , chose to be cremated and not buried.Kureshi breathed his last at the breakfast table in his residence in Swastik Society, Navrangpura, on Saturday morning. Sabarmati Ashram was the cradle of Bapu's revolutionary ideas to win freedom from the British.It was a rare sight at the Mukti Dham crematorium in Paldi where Kureshi's illustrious family gathered for his final rites. Senior members of the higher judiciary and distinguished lawyers stood alongside the grieving family . Kureshi was the grandson of Imam Saheb Abdul Kadir Bawazir, a close associate of Bapu in South Africa.Bapu referred to Imam Bawazir as his ""sahodar"", brother born from the same mother.""Kureshi saheb wished to be cremated because he did not want to waste land with his burial,"" said Bharat Naik, the sonin-law of Kureshi's brother, Wahid Kureshi. ""In fact, he made me a witness to the decision in the presence of other family members."" Over the past four years, Kureshi had been reminding his son, Justice Akil Kureshi, and Naik that they should ensure he is cremated. He asserted that if anyone objected, the person should be told of his last wish.Kureshi was cremated after 7 pm.Kureshi was born in the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad where Imam Bawazir had settled with Bapu in 1915. Born in 1927, Kureshi grew up on Bapu's lap till Bapu embarked on the Dandi March in 1930. Kureshi was one of the few kids who ate tomato slices from Bapu's lunch. Bapu wrote letters to a young Kureshi, which were later donated to the National Archives of India.""Kureshi's father, Ghulam Rasool, was part of `Arun Tukdi' that walked ahead of the Dandi March procession,"" said Sabarmati Ashram director Tridip Suhrud. ""The team had to ensure that arrangements for meetings and halts were in place.""After Ghulam Rasool and his wife were arrested during the Dandi March, Abdul Hamid, his brother Wahid, and sister Sultana were brought up for a few years by Anasuya Sarabhai, said the secretary of the ashram, Amrut Modi. ""Sarabhai was a Gandhian and pioneer of women's labour movement in India,"" he said. Rizwan Kadri, an Ahmedabad-based historian, said that in September1942 Kureshi was arrested in Detroj during the Quit India movement.Kureshi became the chairman of the Sabarmati Ashram trust three years ago. A peace activist at heart, Kureshi worked to build bridges between Hindus and Muslims and penned a book titled "" Agnipariksha"" after the 1969 communal riots in Gujarat."

Onion bulbs should be evenly coloured with no signs of sprouting, tomatoes have to be smooth and firm with no cuts or blemishes and greens should look fresh and springy, with no signs of insect damage. ""My mother taught me how to choose vegetables. I am particular that even the potatoes I pick are firm and well-shaped without green patches or sprouts,"" says the 35-year-old bank employee.""I want to feed only the best to my family and won't pick anything with blemishes.""In India and abroad, looks do matter. Not just among human beings but also where produce is concerned. Sellers and buyers, supermarkets and restaurants, all often reject `ugly' food, that is, misshapen and bruised fruits and vegetables.""Customers do prefer fruits and vegetables that `look good'. Sometimes they do reject fruits that are misshapen, so we return them to the vendor from whom we procured,"" says V R Govindasaamy , founder of Amma Naana. According to estimates m the United Nations En from the United Nations Environment Programme, onethird of the produce grown in the world is thrown out simply because it's considered `ugly' though it is perfectly edible. To combat the colossal food waste, the `ugly food movement' is taking off across the world, especially in Europe and Australia. In 2014, Intermarche , the third largest supermarket chain in France, launched a campaign, Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables, to celebrate `ugly' produce and help put an end to food waste.Until recently, the European Union had specific rules that prevented misshapen produce from being sold. For instance, a spear of asparagus could not be sold unless at least 80% of its length was green. Those rules have since been scrapped and 2014 was designated the `European Year Against Food Waste'.While Indians may not reject produce terming them `ugly', fruits and vegetables that do not conform to the way they should ideally look are rejected. India, the second largest producer of fruit in the world, wastes fruits and vegetables worth Rs 13,300 crore every year. According to a 2013 report by Emerson Climate Technologies India, a business of the US-based manufacturing and technology company Emerson, this is because of the lack of adequate cold storage facilities and refrigerated transport.Discriminating against 'ugly' produce adds to wastage. ""We get our produce from various farms. If any of it is oddly shaped or has blemishes -for instance, if carrots have a cut in the middle or the bottle gourd is knotted up, they are filtered out at the farm,"" says Madhusudanan K, director of Dhanyam, an organic store with branches in Adyar, Anna Nagar and T Nagar. ""Customers do tend to like things that look good and have a `normal' shape. And they feel bad feeding anything that looks misshapen to their families,"" he says.""Customers pick and choose, and whatever they reject, we dispose of,"" he says, adding that it is probably just 2% of what they procure.Ramanthan Balasubramanian, a media professional admits he wouldn't buy misshapen fruits and vegetables. ""I wouldn't reject them as they are `ugly' but I would be afraid there is something wrong with them,"" he says.That's also the reason why many stores are careful about placing 'good looking' fruits right in the front.""Most of the shops polish the apples, and also keep the best looking fruits in the front when we stack them up,"" says the owner of a fruit and vegetable store in Mylapore.""People are attracted by the way it looks and are willing to shell out more.""The Indian way of selecting produce also causes damage and wastage, say store owners. ""People like to touch and feel their veggies and fruits. When too many people handle it, even good produce gets spoiled,"" says Madhusudanan.In India, though, wastage is cut as the oddly shaped produce is often sold off at a cheaper rate, says shop owners. ""Even if something has blemishes, we can always cut off that portion and sell it cheap,"" says a fruit stall owner. ""But then, it is only poor people who opt for it.""Experts feel that the Indian market and sensibilities are different from that of the West, so an `ugly food movement' may not be the need of the hour.However, different methods can be employed. ""People here are conservative and look for value for money, so it is but natural that when they go to a store, they pick the best,"" says Shree Periakaruppan, founder of Foodology , a recreational culinary studio. ""But if these oddly shaped produce are sold cheaper, there will definitely be takers."""

After visiting horticulture projects during a press tour organised on Wednesday, collector K Veera Raghava Rao said the administration was planning to bring 900 more hectares under vegetable cultivation.At present vegetables are cultivated in 2,100 hectares in the district during the year. Onions, tomatoes, brinjals and ladies finger are major vegetable varieties cultivated predominantly in Kottampatti, Melur, Alanganallur and Sedapatti blocks.The farmers can't keep incurring losses depending heavily on a single crop. Hence, they will be encouraged to shift to vegetable cultivation to manage the loss, the collector said.Progressive farmers will be identified in each block and encouraged to take up vegetable cultivation. They will be briefed on the schemes available in the horticulture department, he said.This year the district received the subsidy on micro irrigation for 10,000 acres. Deputy director of horticulture G O Poopathi said Madurai district received Rs 4.22 crore this year for integrated horticulture development under the national horticulture mission and Rs 9.26 crore was granted for micro irrigation projects under the prime minister's micro irrigation scheme.The district was granted Rs 43.56 lakh under the national agriculture development project and Rs 21.19 lakh for organic farming. Altogether, the district received Rs 14 crore for various horticulture projects, he said.Vegetables are short term crops requiring minimum water. Micro irrigation can help conserve water.

""The biggest advantage of direct selling is that previously during season time I would sell tomatoes for Rs3 per kg. Today I sell them at Rs20 round the year,"" says Sudhakar Kubde, who has a farm near Kalmeshwar where 17 varieties of vegetables are grown. ""My annual income has doubled from Rs1.5 lakh to Rs3.5 lakh in one year,"" says Kubde.""I was curious after receiving a message for buying farm fresh veggies,"" says Dr Kirti Jaiswal, now a regular customer of these farmers. ""The products were amazingly tasty, fresh and had a longer shelf life. I was surprised to see how politely they would speak to the customers,"" say Jaiswal, who convinced her neighbours at MHADA Colony near Bole petrol pump to also buy from these farmers. ""The fact that this helps the poor farmer to get a fair deal is enough for me to buy from them,"" adds Sonal Barde, a busy entrepreneur.More than the farmer, it is the consumer who should be taking up this movement, feels Vasant Futane a farmer from Warud. ""The direct markets help in forming a relationship between the farmer and the consumer. This way both get sensitive to each other's needs,"" says Futane, who doesn't need to bring his produce to the city as he has a large chain of buyers who contact him directly."

Fish ladders are a series of pools built like steps to enable fish to ascend a dam and enable them to migrate upstream over or through a barrier. The ladders will enable the fish to cross the dam and breed further up the river.Bharti is on record as saying once that happens, the fish, considered a delicacy in East India, will be available in the Ganga in regions as far as even the Chambal in MP and UP, as was the case in the past. Indeed, till the time the Farakka barrage was built in 1975, hilsa which only breeds in fresh water travelled hundreds of kilometres inland to breed. The building of the barrage barred their migration.The hilsa is now like a fish out of water in the Ganga. ""Gone are the days when we relished the choicest preparations of hilsa, which is revered as 'machher rani' (queen of fishes), amid monsoon spells. It is a thing of the past. Today, we can't afford this luxury and have to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 for a kg of fish,"" laments Gauri Das (75), a resident of Bengali Tola area in Varanasi.The last time Das bought hilsa was three years ago on a special occasion. Recalling the old days, when it was available in abundance in the markets, she said, ""Dishes like Shorshe Ilish (hilsa cooked in mustard paste) and Bhapa Ilish (steamed hilsa with chilly mustard paste) were common in Bengali households. Today, we are yearning for hilsa."" Those were the days before the Farakka barrage was built and the hilsa travelled long distances upstream.Das was elated at the thought that hilsa could be fished locally in the Ganga waters in the coming days. "" Sotti! Eta hobe?"" (Really! Would it happen?),"" she wondered with her wide open eyes. ""Hilsa is cooked in a number of ways,"" she said, adding that it can be fried, cooked in spicy tomato or ginger-based gravy (jhol), or mustard-based with green chillies (shorshe batar jhal). It can also be cooked with posto, doi (curd), seasonal vegetables, and steamed inside of plantain or butternut squash leaves."

And if you relish the flavours of piping hot tomato soups, then the latest trend is a tempting option. Souping or an all-soup diet is catching up with individuals looking to shed some kilos and cleanse their system.Typically a three-day routine, souping involves replacing lunch and dinner meals with a bowl of fresh, homemade soup. ""The diet plan includes soups coupled with a bowl of boiled vegetables, fruits, nuts or sprouts. Packaged soups aren't allowed,"" says Suhasini Viswanathan, dietitian, Qua Nutrition.While oil cannot be used, the soups can have a little salt, pepper and herbs. "" Adding a piece of ginger or garlic is advisable for delicate stomachs. The diet doesn't include dairy products, eggs, sugar and non-vegetarian dishes,"" says Suhasini, adding that one portion of cabbage soup is a must.Experts say souping is helpful as it adds a lot of fibre, water, vitamins and minerals to the fare. But certain soups must be avoided. ""Clear soups aren't recommended as they have few calories and can increase the appetite,"" says consultant dietitian Dr Dharini Krishnan, adding that high-calorie creamy soups are off the menu too. Pre-diabetics, diabetics and those on medication must refrain from following this diet as they require planned meals with sufficient carbohydrates after medication.Following the diet has had mixed outcomes. Some people have lost weight and felt `lighter' while others have returned to their cheesy burgers. ""I lost two kilos after trying it with professional guidance as the diet was tailored to my needs,""says Krithika Vidyasagar, who tried the routine recently .The all-soup diet is replacing its juice counterpart as it is considered healthier. ""Juicing adds vitamin C, potassium and some fibre but in souping, the diet has more nutrients,"" says Dr Dharini.However, like any dietary fad, this too can land you in a soup.Giving up on your cravings may help you lose some fat, but a sudden dietary shift is unhealthy. ""People develop nutritional deficiencies when their intake doesn't involve supplements. Mood swings, headaches, exhaustion, and a constant craving for food are common side-effects,"" says Dr Kousalya Nathan, lifestyle and anti-ageing consultant, Apollo Nova Hospital. She adds that a nutritionist's consultation is crucial.It is also essential to keep a watch over one's diet even after the souping detox to maintain weight. ""Diets restricted to one food group, like vegetables, can be followed for a short period as they can cause nutritional imbalances in the long run,"" says Dr Dharini."

On Friday, temperatures of Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Daltongunj were around 3-4C above normal.According to the local met office, maximum temperature in most of the cities in Jharkhand has remained above normal almost throughout the month, while minimum temperature remained close to normal. But the India Meteorological Department has forecast drop in maximum temperatures by 3-5C in many parts of east India from Sunday onwards.A Wadood, agromet advisor at Birsa Agriculture University, said this year the whole of north India has experienced a warm winter and Jharkhand was no exception. ""Though minimum temperature came down to 3-4C, people did not feel the chill because day temperatures remained around 22-24C,"" he added.Wadood said a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal and western disturbance are causing upper air cyclonic circulation in the northwestern part of the country. ""These two wind system act as limiting factor for each other and the western disturbance is likely to indirectly affect the weather in this part,"" Wadood said.IMD observation shows a wind confluence over central India and a fresh western disturbance as an upper air system would affect western Himalayan region from Monday.Rainfall in isolated parts of Jharkhand has been predicted for Sunday and Monday whereas the state is likely to get scattered rainfall on Tuesday with warning for hailstorm in some parts.However, Wadood said that the rain will not impact the crops much but if hailstones are there, vegetables would be damaged considerably. Farmers already have fields full with cabbage and peas and tomato plants are in flowering stage."

Kannauj has nearly 10,000 hectares of agricultural land where vegetables are grown.Kannauj district magistrate (DM) Anuj Kumar Jha told TOI that the work on the project has already begun. ""The Rs 10 crore project will be completed soon. An initial amount of Rs 1.5 crore has already been released to the nodal agency,"" he added.""The farmers of Kannauj as well from nearby districts can earn handsome gains by growing vegetables all through the year after undergoing training from Israeli agricultural experts and procuring seeds from the centre which will be set up in Umardha tehsil of Kannauj,"" district horticulture officer Munna Yadav told TOI.""The construction work has already started in nearly 8.6 hectares of land in Umardha to make farmers aware of advantages of poly houses, green houses, open houses and some of the latest international technology in cultivation of vegetables,"" Yadav added.""Vegetables survive for long in poly and green houses, open houses besides shadenets,"" he said, adding ""this could be an effective means to ward off the crisis of vegetables in off season.""The Israeli farm technology is also effective even in drought like situation, he said. Another senior horticulture officer said farmers will be imparted training free of cost by the centre.Seeds of veggies like tomato, green chilly, cabbage, pumpkin, gourd bottle, brinjal and cucurbits, will be provided and which can be cultivated even in off-season. ""One would be surprised to see a tomato plant as tall as 10-ft instead of usual 2 to 3 ft, cucurbit crops including musk melon one will find here in the month of November and December. One would be able to see all these and many more exotic vegetables at the upcoming centre,"" said the district horticulture officer.""The aim is also to introduce diversity in agriculture so that farmers can choose from value crop instead of usual cash crops like paddy and wheat. Drip irrigation, vertigation and intensive cultivation methods will also be taught to farmers to help maximum utilisation of resources,"" Yadav added."
58f178d7a3d24b245e59a8b4,The cult of Keshav,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/The-cult-of-Keshav/articleshow/50789495.cms,2016-01-31,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: What will you write about me? I'm just a pohawala."" The man who says this is Keshav Mankar. Yes, The Keshav. And that's why, we can almost hear legions of his fans mock-booing in disagreement.For Nagpurians who have been living on may be Mars for the last 25 years, Keshav Mankar has been selling poha tarri and only poha tarri from a tiny shop at Deo Nagar. In a city where you can find a pohawallah before you can say 'Hao', Keshav's Poha has earned something of a cult status, as much for its taste as for the shop's singularly eccentric business hours. The shop opens around 6.15am. On a brisk day, as is usually the case, Mankar will turn you back if you reach at 7:30am. That's right: In a city notorious for being on snooze mode until 11am, Keshav Mankar manages to get people out of their beds at the crack of dawn.He views the adulation with a mixture of bemusement and pride. He took over the shop in 1991 after the death of his father Jayram, who had set up the business in 1974. ""He sold misal, batata wada and poha,"" Keshav remembers. For many years, Keshav and his brother Ashok would sell batata vada and poha. A few years ago, they stopped selling the vada. ""Fights would break out between customers over who would get it first. Tarri would be flung on shirts. It happened once too often and our landlord gave us an ultimatum,"" Mankar recalls, his matter-of-fact tone banishing any comical vada war images forming in one's mind.So, what's the secret recipe of the tarri that's worth fighting for? ""Onions, ginger, garlic, tomato (not a lot), red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder,"" Mankar rattles off. The most ingredient, however, seems to be oil. ""For 2kg of watana, I use 2.5kg oil,"" he says. The tarri is enough for 10kg of poha. Mankar does all the cooking himself 'to ensure that the quality remains exactly the same.'The oft-quoted factoid that he goes for his job at a school or college after closing the shop is a rumour, he says, adding that that even though he does business for less than two hours, the preps and cleaning up take up the remaining part of the day. ""I go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 4am,"" he says, complaining that the younger generation is just not ready for this kind of dedication. He's 57 and he says he can go on for 10 more years at most. ""I don't think my sons will carry on the business,"" he says.Note to fans: Eat all you can while it lasts."
