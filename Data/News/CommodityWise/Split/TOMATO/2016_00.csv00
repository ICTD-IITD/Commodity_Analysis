We have enough tomato and other vegetables stocks, which we import from India only in case of shortages in the domestic market,"" he said.The reason behind the ""suspension"" of cotton imports from India was, nevertheless, different, he said.""No. We have not stopped cotton imports from India. It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions. We're looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong,"" Shami said.He said only those cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes where importers had already secured permits from his department and carried phyto-sanitary certificates.""Our cotton consignments are not being allowed to enter Pakistan through Wagah and Karachi for reasons known to the ministry but cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn is being brought in without any let or hindrance. At least 11 trucks of Indian yarn entered Pakistan on Thursday when the department stopped cotton consignments from coming to this side of the border,"" a textile factory owner told Dawn.He said the suspension of cotton import from India would create a huge problem for the textile exporters as the truncated domestic crop target of 11.25 million bales for this year appeared difficult if not impossible to meet.""The industry requires 14 million bales. We will still be short by three million bales of cotton even if the crop target is achieved,"" he said.He said cotton shortages after the ban on Indian imports would make domestic prices shoot up at the expense of exports.Pakistan had imported 2.7 million bales of cotton (1 bale is 170 kgs) - about 40 per cent of India's total cotton exports in 2015-16 - due to crop failure that wiped off 0.5 per cent of GDP growth. The industry is expecting to import 2 million bales this year."

As a result of low demand, prices of vegetables have also come down drastically.Around 5 lakh tribals in 11 mandals of Visakha agency depend on these weekly markets near their villages. More than 30 weekly markets operate per week in all mandals. Of these, 10 to 13 major markets transact business of more than Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1.25 crore per day.The major weekly markets take place at Seeleru, Chintapalli, Pedabayalu, Araku, Paderu, Sunkarametta, Guttulaputtu Maddigaruvu, G Madugula, Hukumpeta, Darakonda, Minumuluru, Kinchumanda and Lammasingi. Traders come from Vijayawada, Rajahmundry and Visakhapatnam as well as from some parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh come to these markets where commercial crops and vegetables are sold.""The yield of many vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, tomato and carrot have come down this season. If you do not sell it, they will rot. So we are selling the vegetables for less price as we don't have any storage facility in the agency areas. Tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers rot within a few days,"" P Ramarao Dora, one of the farmers of Hukumpet mandal, said.Prices of various vegetables have come down drastically in the last 12 days since the central government announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.

Nagaraju asked.Amidst the currency crunch, the weekly market in Pedabayalu did business of Rs 50 lakh last Monday against its original average sale of Rs 1.25 crore. The other markets have not done much, sources said.Majority of the tribal farmers are visiting the post offices in their panchayat limits to change the old notes as Visakha agency has only 15 to 20 banks and below 10 ATMs across 11 mandals. Like banks in urban areas, the post offices in the agency areas have also put up 'No Cash' boards, sources said."

However, there is little impact of on retail price. Thanks to the middlemen and the last man in the retail market, the price of vegetables remains quite high compared to their prices the same time last year. With the liquidity crunch continuing unabated, there is an element of distress sale at the source (from the field) by farmers. The overwhelming fear that the perishables may not be sold at all is also working behind the price crash.The potato (jyoti variety), which grows in abundance in Hooghly, is sold at Rs 4 per kg soon after its withdrawal from the cold storages. After sorting the potato, wholesale price stood at Rs 7-8 per kg. The retail price should have been Rs 910 per kg after taking into account the transportation and other costs. But the retail price remains as high as Rs 16-22 in most of the markets in the city. Thanks to demonetisation and the resultant liquidity crunch, a stockpile of 8 lakh tonnes of potatoes remained in the cold storages even after the deadline of clearing the stockpile expired on November 30. Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said the potato price should come down after the potato stockpile is cleared. He has set a deadline of December 8 for clearing the entire stock from the cold storages.The price of brinjal, which grow mainly in Hooghly and Burdwan, crashed to Rs 55-60 per palla (per 5 kgs). The wholesale price should not be more than Rs 15 per kg. But brinjal price in the city retail market hovered around Rs 25-30 per kg.Cabbage, which was Rs 35-40 per palla in the wholesale market, is sold at Rs 20 per kg in the city retail markets.The biggest crash happened in tomato prices. Toma toes grow in huge quantity in Bankura and Purulia. The farmers on Tuesday sold it at Rs 20 a palla. The tomato wholesale price at Khatra and Manbazar stood at Rs 6 per kg. But the retail price of tomato remains as high as Rs 20-25 per kg on Tuesday.Uttam Kundu, a wholesaler at Seoraphuli wholesale market, said, ""We have asked farmers to raise Rs 1 per kg against every vegetable so that farmers get some price. But the fear of liquidity crunch is so high that people did distress sale. The market has become a bit unpredictable.""Agriculture marketing department sources said there is a collusion of middlemen and the last man in the market (last retail outlet) that prevented the plunge in retail price.Dasgupta said, ""We are not sitting idle. We have already carried out raids at several retail markets."""
58d6c963a3d24b1894a6b23c,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."

However, the closure of markets dashed their hopes again. As the auctions at the market yards in Nashik and Girnare had been halted for the last few days, some of the farmers even had to throw away their produce.Lahanabai Fasaal, a farmer who grows tomatoes, said she incurred losses of 40 crates of tomatoes from November 15-18, adding up to a loss of Rs 40,000 per acre.""The markets were closed as the traders refused to pay. As they are perishable items, we had to throw away all the crates. On Monday, we went to the markets with our produce and things seem to improving gradually. But our loss was too much. The prices have come down,"" said Lahanabai.Many other farmers like Lahanabai had to face the wrath of their labourers. ""I could not pay my farm labourers because the produce was not sold and the labourers were not ready to take the banned currency notes which they could have exchanged or deposited at the banks,"" Lahanabai said.Another farmer, Dhondya M, who sends most of his produce to Vasai market, had to throw away 20-25 crates of cabbage and tomato. ""As I knew that the markets were closed, I did not send the crates with my produce to the market. From Monday, we started sending the crates to Vasai,"" said Dhondya.The opening of markets has not helped the farmers though. A tomato grower, Vaman Tople said, ""Even though the markets have opened now, it is still slack. We are getting less value for our produce. All the traders give us Rs 2,000 notes, but nobody gives us change. We have faced heavy losses due to the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."""

To resolve this crisis, scientists at DFTRL have developed a range of produces to minimize the post-harvest loss of tomato crop incurred by farmers.The scientists have developed technologies that are affordable and user-friendly to farmers, self-help groups and small and medium enterprises as the target beneficiaries. The wide range of products include tomato sambar paste, tomato rasam paste, tomato curry paste, green tomato chutney, tomato sauce, hot filled tomato pulp and tomato chutney, with a shelf life of 6 to 9 months.DFRL has already started giving training for farmers in a few villages in Chickballapur, Chintamani and Suttur. According to DFRL officials, response from farmers has been good, especially in Chintamani where many came forward with many suggestions. Demonstrations were held as part of the training programme and handbills in the local languages were distributed to farmers.On Sunday, DFRL along with Spoorthy Janaabhivruthi Samsthe, conducted an awareness class for farmers of Ahalya village about various products made of tomato.Speaking after inaugurating the awareness workshop, Rakesh Kumar Sharma, director, DFRL, said, ""There were instances of farmers selling tomato for Re 1 per kg, and some even throwing it to the street.

One of the boys standing in the patient queue before the ATM kiosk on the other side of the road walked up to him and said, ""Do you take money on Paytm?"" When Akhtar said, ""No"", he replied with a degree of helpless resignation, "" Cash nahi hai mere paas. Paytm hota to achha hota (I don't have cash. It would have been nice, if you were using Paytm).""The scene and dialogue was repeated over the next few days. Several youngsters from the adjacent New Ashok Nagar colony would pose the same query. In regular circumstances, Akhtar wouldn't have spared much thought to the persistent question. For the past two years, the 35-year-old from Bihar's Samastipur district has been peddling vegetable biryani from a mobile food stall near the New Ashok Nagar metro station. For Rs 30 a plate, he serves a decent helping of the flavoured rice garnished with slices of soyabean chop, tiny pieces of paneer, tomato chutney, chopped onion and chilli pickle. And business is generally brisk.But last month his sales plunged after Prime Minister Narendra Moditriggering a sudden shortfall of currency. Daily-wagers, auto-rickshaw drivers, college students and young executives - the bulk of his customers were not turning up. ""I often took back home kilos of unsold biryani. For about a week, I stopped coming here,"" says Akhtar, who goes by the name Aman-ji. When he resumed business, the customers returned but not in the same numbers as in pre-notebandi days. Some would still ask about the option of paying through Paytm.So when an executive from the mobile wallet company came by a week ago and offered him the option of taking payments through the mobile wallet, Akhtar reluctantly decided to give it a try. The biryani seller was uncertain because it meant having to part with a small portion of his earnings as the company's commission. And though, he is ""inter pass,"" Akhtar wasn't fully sure how the technology would work.It is easy to understand Akhtar's hesitance. Like millions of other migrants, the son of a daily-wager came to Delhi in search of a better life about 15 years ago. The third among seven brothers and sisters, he did a variety of odd jobs in the NCR before finding his true calling: selling biryani. The food cart sustains his family- his wife and three kids.He wakes up around 5 am, helps his wife prepare the biryani and sets up his roadside cart by 8 am. The hawking is done by 4.30 pm. A brief rest at home and he sets off to the grocers to buy all that he needs the next day. Has he ever considered selling chicken or mutton biryani? The migrant mumbles something about wanting to sell "" shudh khana .""Akhtar is cagey about divulging details of his daily returns. And he doesn't want to reveal the number of customers who use the mobile wallet. ""About 10-12 customers every day,"" he says after a little cajoling. During the two hours TOI spent interviewing him, four customers paid through Paytm. A couple of others were requested to pay in cash if they were carrying currency. The biryani seller explains why. ""I would have to stand in a bank queue again to get my money. So I prefer people paying in cash. But when they say, they don't have any, I let them use Paytm,'' he says.One such customer is Sumendra Singh, a 26-year-old who works in the customer services division of a mobile phone company. ""I am short of cash. There's too much work and no time to stand in the queue. I haven't even brought my wallet,"" he says.This month, as usual, the company transferred Singh's salary to his bank account. He shifted Rs 1,000 to his mobile wallet. At the food cart, Singh scans the Paytm bar code and transfers Rs 30 to Akhtar's mobile phone. "" Zara mobile check kar lijiye. Mera payment aur number ka message aa gaya hoga (Check your mobile. You would have got a message about my payment and phone number),"" he says. Akhtar asks for the last four numbers of the customer's mobile number, looks into his own phone and serves him.Slowly and cautiously, the migrant from Bihar has embraced the world of mobile wallet business."

Other traders, especially farmers, have been severely hit by the non-availability of cash in the market.

As a result, he said, the price of fruits and vegetables were down by at least 25%.""The relaxations announced by the central government have made no impact. Transactions worth crores of rupees take place every day; so, raising the daily withdrawal limit to Rs 4,500 hardly makes any difference,"" said Kriplani.A comparison of maximum and minimum prices from the start of the month to now reveals that there is a major drop in the prices of potato, capsicum, bottle gourd, cauliflower and cabbage. Mahender Sanpal, member, APMC, said: ""These are indicative prices, dependent on arrival in the mandi on a particular day and the quality of produce. Retailers are purchasing at usually the average prices and, as farmers are so desperate to sell, those prices have come down.""In east Delhi's Patparganj, Fateh Singh has had to slash prices at his vegetable stall. ""There is a drop of Rs 10-15 in the prices of all vegetables. Cabbage, for instance, is selling for Rs 40 per kg against Rs 60 per kg earlier. Capsicum is down from Rs 100 to Rs 80 while tomato is selling for Rs 30 per kg against Rs 40. People don't have cash and, if I sell on credit, how do I make ends meet? If I were to stand in a bank line one day, who will man my stall?"" he asked.Junaid Khan, a vegetable seller on Minto Road, said he had not yet dropped prices, but a lot of his sale was done on credit. ""I know most of my customers. I am doing business in the hope that they will pay me soon,"" he said."

And this diversity is best reflected in what's cooking in the kitchens and what's served on the tables on Christmas Day. And Hyderabad, a melting pot of myriad cultures, is where you will get to see some of the best of Christmas feasts from across the country being dished out, come Sunday. Hyderabad Times goes on pre-Christmas gastronomic tour to see what's on the menu. And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

Farmers in villages of Thondamuthur area say sales have dipped in wholesale markets across the district due to excess production and paucity of currency notes.T K Market, one of the biggest vegetable markets in Coimbatore city, has seen a slump in sales despite vegetable prices hitting rock bottom. P M Sivasamy , 61, a farmer from Pullagoundenpudur near Thondamuthur, said he has abandoned fully grown tomatoes in an acre of land. ""Traders are offering 15 to 20 for a box containing 15kg of tomato. But a farm labour needs to be paid 200 per day. In a day a farm worker can harvest eight boxes of tomatoes which means I have to pay him 25 per box. Add to this the daily rent of 12 per box. So I need to spend 2.46 to harvest 1kg of tomato but I end up selling it at 2 per kg. This is not my only loss. I had invested 50,000 to raise the crop,"" he said.His elder brother PM Ponnusamy , 65, and his friend K Kannan , 60, had cultivated tomato in 1.5 acres of land each. They too have chosen not to harvest the crop. ""We won't recover our input costs even if we sell at farmgate prices. If we were to transport the harvest to the market, we would just be adding to our losses. So we have let the crop wilt,'' said S Madusodhanan , a farmer from Karamadai.Farmers say there was a drop in vegetables sales after demonetisation due to paucity of currency notes."
58d81632a3d24b75f2773028,Silver lining: Perishable prices dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Silver-lining-Perishable-prices-dip/articleshow/55393734.cms,2016-11-13,"Kolkata: The severe liquidity crunch in households has triggered a downward slide in prices of perishable commodities as traders attempt to clear accumulated stocks before they rot and also garner some funds to remain in business.While vegetable prices have gone down by 20-30% in several markets across the city, potato, onion and tomato prices have all gone down in the past couple of days. Price of fish is also down by Rs 50-70 a kg. But it has not elicited a smile yet from customers struggling with cash. At Lansdowne market, Jadu Babur Bazar and Lake Market in south Kolkata, onion price has nosedived from Rs 25 a kg prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's demonetization announcement on Tuesday to Rs 18 a kg on Saturday. A similar situation was witnessed at Maniktala market in the northern part of the city.""People are just not buying unless absolutely necessary. One generally says that Bengalis will never compromise on food but I suspect less fish and meat dishes are being made now. So the demand for onion has dropped. Though supply in wholesale market has dipped because of the liquidity crunch across the country, there is still a glut due to lack of demand,"" said Asit Das, a vegetable vendor at Lansdowne Market.With dues piling up and pressure to clear the stock mounting, vendors are reducing prices. Everyone associated with onion, right from the farm in Nasik to here, is desperate to kick-start sales. ""At any other time, a drop in supply would have led to price rise. But it's just the opposite,"" said Mahadeb Mondal of Lake Market. ""While commodity prices dip normally when there is a liquidity crunch, the trend has so far been missing in Kolkata. But this time we see that happening,"" said Shankar Gupta, a vegetable trader in Kolkata.Price of tomato that comes from farms near Bengaluru is also headed southward, having dropped by Rs 2 in two days and is now retailing at Rs 18 a kg. ""The suppliers are not accepting payment in the demonetized currency notes and have agreed to take the payment later. They have slashed the price so that we accept the stock in this adverse situation,"" said Das.Price of Jyoti variety of potato that commanded Rs 20 per kg till Thursday was selling for Rs 18 on Saturday.Lower consumption has also brought down fish prices at city markets by at least Rs 50 per kg across varieties."

The banks are getting one-third of the cash needed. ""It is a precarious situation. The state economy is badly hit. Small and marginal farmers and small traders were severely affected,"" the minister told the assembly.Reminding that chief minister Naveen Patnaik had taken up the issue of cash crunch in cooperative banks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Amat said the state government has taken up the various problems arising out of demonetisation from time to time.Amat's reply came after the Congress members disrupted the assembly proceedings over growing inconvenience to people over demonetisation in the state forcing repeated adjournments while BJD members also raised the issue.During zero hour, Congress whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati pointed out that farmers were forced to throw tomatoes at a weekly market in Bargarh district on Thursday because there were no buyers due to severe cash crunch. Similarly, at another market in Koraput district brinjals were thrown by the farmers, he said.Since the wholesalers are reluctant to lift vegetables, the prices have fallen to dirt-cheap level. While tomato is being sold at Re 1 to Rs 2 by the farmers, brinjal is being sold at less than Rs 5. Even at such low prices, the vegetables remain unsold, Bahinipati said.BJD's Samir Ranjan Dash too raised the issue and said though the state had supported the Centre's move to curb black money, its implementation in the past one month exposed complete failure of the Modi regime. While Dash was speaking, the Congress members jumped into the well of the House seeking the finance minister's statement amid shouting of anti-government slogans. Deputy speaker Sananda Marndi, who presided over, first adjourned the House for 15 minutes.When the House reconvened, BJD MLA Amar Prasad Satpathy started speaking on demonetisation criticising the Centre. However, as the Congress MLAs continued shouting anti-government slogans, the deputy speaker adjourned the House till 3pm. Post-lunch, the finance minister gave his statement. The House was adjourned till Tuesday and will reconvene on Wednesday.Speaking to the media outside the assembly, leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra said, ""It is an emergency like situation. People don't have money. The situation is worsening by the day."""

But, the government's sudden decision has badly hit business.Surekha Nirmale, runs an SHG involved in the sale of spicy Kolhapuri food and spices, said, ""The demand has drastically reduced for the products after demonization. The raw material which was bought before demonetisation is still there. We send the products to Pune, Satara, and Mumbai. But, operations halted after November 8. We have sold products on credit. We have registered a drop of over 50 % in business. It is a difficult time for us now.""Another group leader Pooja Utture said, ""We are engaged in the business selling spices, Kolhapur thecha and chutney. But, demonetisation has broken down our business. We suffered in the first two weeks because of uncertainty in the market. After almost one-and-a-half months, the situation is still far from normal. The average business has declined from Rs 20,000 per month to Rs 8,000 post demonetisation. This has affected our livelihood."" Meenal Bhosale , a small-time entrepreneur who runs a food processing company, told TOI, ""We are engaged in the food processing business. We make tomato sauce, pulp, juice and other food items. Our average annual sale is around Rs 5 lakh. Demonetisation has harmed us as we have been suffering losses of Rs 20 to 25 thousand per month. The demand form Pune and other markets has reduced drastically. We welcomed the decision because it helps to curb corruption. But at the end of day, we have been terribly affected.""The Swyamsiddha NGO trains the SHGs on the businesses and has also suffered after demonetisation. It regularly organises exhibitions to promote the products of self-help groups. It was forced to cancel exhibitions in November and December fearing low response from customers owing to cash crunch ""We postponed exhibitions till January because of the cash crunch. We organise small courses for women. But, the cash crunch in households has delayed our courses,"" Trupti Purekar, the group's trustee, said."
