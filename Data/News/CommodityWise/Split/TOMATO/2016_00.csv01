Many travel agents rued that the announcement was not going to augur well with the travel industry, which is still recovering from the economic slowdown of 2015.Vaishali D*, who is travelling to South-East Asian countries from Sunday, had planned on drawing money on Friday and getting it exchanged for dollars. But the 30-year-old found herself calling her family and friends, requesting them to lend any foreign currency they had with promises to bank transfer the rupee value of it immediately. ""I had planned to withdraw around Rs1.5lakh on Friday and get it exchanged the same day, but with withdrawal limits being fixed at Rs10,000 a day and Rs20,000 a week from November 11 to 24, I'm in a fix,"" she rued. ""Many currency exchanges, including those at the airports, don't accept cheques,"" she added.Like Vaishali, many other travelers found themselves in a similar situation on Tuesday night as the news of the declaration spread. Many families who were planning month-long trips to countries like the United States and Europe next week, are slowly resigning themselves to using credit cards. ""We need at least $6,000 for our five week trip to the United States,"" said Shyam Sundar*, businessman and father of two. ""We had planned to convert at least $4,000 later this week in batches. But with this new withdrawal limit and old notes not being accepted, we are begging friends for dollars, euros and pounds,"" he said. ""We have no options but to use our credit and debit cards, despite each transaction levying a tax of 2.5%,"" he added.Many travelers who had landed in Coimbatore for the national junior athletics meet with a few thousand rupees and no cards found themselves in trouble. A girl from Haryana with a Rs1,000 note found herself unable to even buy a bottle of water or a plate of tomato rice from restaurants. The organisers, not anticipating this move, had not set up a canteen till Wednesday evening.Many travel agents echoed that the move was going to reduce money flow in the economy, hitting business in the remaining part of the financial year and next year. ""It will bring down the number of people travelling, especially the luxury class,"" said Nirupa Raj of Ashok Travels. ""Almost 90% of our clients only pay 50% to 60% of the trip cost by cheque and the remaining in cash, be it for hotels, sightseeing, flight tickets or internal travel,"" said another local travel agent."

Soon, they will drop to the ground and wither away. A season's hard work wasted.Yet, for the progressive farmer from Chikkahasala village, it makes economic sense to let go of the tomato crop. Prices have fallen to a new low this season: with a 15kg box of tomatoes selling at Rs 20-40 at the APMC Yard in Kolar in the past few days, Muniyappa doesn't want to spend on labour and other expenses.It is not only Muniyappa, scores of big farmers have allowed the crop to die. Muniyappa attributes two factors to the low procurement price - the major one being demonetization of high-value currency notes, which he said has robbed many middle and upper middle class traders of their purchasing power. He said non-availability of money in banks has also contributed to a cut in buying.He said the other factor for low prices is that both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are major tomato purchasing states from Kolar. Normally, between November and December, there would be at least a couple of cyclones in these two states which would have resulted in the crop loss, but with no cyclones in November and the beginning of December in these two states, the tomato crop there was good, leading to little demand for tomatoes grown in Kolar district, Muniyappa said.Byalahalli Govinda Gowda, president of Kolar District Cooperative Central Bank and a farmer, said that he has allowed his tomato crop, grown on about eight acres of land, to wither away. He said since the procurement price is very low, farmers are unable to even get the labour cost. He said in Kolar district alone, the tomato crop grown on over 25,000 acres has been allowed to wither away. He said a farmer will incur an expense of nearly 2 lakh per acre to grow the crop, and the demonetization effect has had a crushing impact on the farmers of Kolar district. He said the procurement prices of most of the vegetables grown in Kolar district have fallen as few people come forward to purchase vegetables at APMCs.CR Srinath, proprietor of CM Ramaiah Tomato Mandi in Kolar, said the traders have very little money in hand, and there is low demand for the crop. He said normal weather, which is conducive for the growth of tomatoes, that prevailed in most parts of the country, resulting in a good yield at various places, including Kolkata, Tamil Nadu and Bengal, and as such, there is little demand for the crop grown in Kolar district. He said during the past two days, 15-kg box of tomatoes was being sold for between Rs 10 and Rs 40."

The agriculture department in the district, which should have sold 19 tonnes in November, still has a huge stock left. This is despite the Centre allowing government seed depots to accept old currencies.To ensure cultivation during rabi season was not affected by demonetisation, the Centre announced that all national seed corporations could accept scrapped notes from farmers for the sale of seeds and fertilizers, on Monday. On Wednesday, a government order issued allowed state agriculture department-run seed depots to also accept old notes. Even this has not encouraged farmers to buy seeds. ""The slowdown in seeds sales is more due to drought than demonetisation. With absolutely no rains in the district this year, farmers are apprehensive about sowing seeds,"" said an area manager.While the state agriculture department also sells around 19 tonnes of paddy, pulses and millets, the seeds are usually sold out by November-end. ""This year, the sales has dipped because of scanty rain. But a few farmers are buying seeds, hoping it will rain in December,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal.The situation is not much better among private dealers. ""This season it is only paddy, pulses and tomato seeds, which is not much for us. But this drought, which has lowered the ground water level, is going to bring down seed sales by almost 50% over the next few months, after Pongal ,"" said a representative from Sri Rajalakshmi Agro Services.Many farmers, especially those practising organic farming, say they may give the rabi season a miss. K Marappan, a farmer in Sathyamangalam, has decided not to cultivate for the rest of the year. ""I had been practising organic farming for the past three years, but this year we have had no rain. What is the point of spending on seeds, labour, organic fertilizers and pesticides,"" he said.Despite installing drip irrigation, farmers say they have water problems. ""With many borewells going dry, we are paying electricity bills as high as Rs7,000, to irrigate our lands. We are not even getting water from any of our canals,"" said Madukkarai-based banana and tomato farmer, A Kandasamy. ""Usually, the south-west monsoon and summer rain improve the groundwater levels, but this year, the ground water table has also receded,"" said the district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivaisayikal Sangham, P Kandasamy. ""The North-East monsoon which moistens the soil is yet to arrive. Tomato and onion prices are low. It is only natural that farmers reduce area of cultivation or stop it all together,"" he added."

Shortage of valid currency in rural areas has affected the purchase of tomatoes in the wholesale market, leading to a price crash.Tomato is now fetching farmers as little as Rs 2-3.5 a kg. With the cost of production being Rs 10 a kg, farmers are losing up to Rs 8 a kg. Officials from Girnare market in Nashik say 1.5 lakh crates of 20kg each come to the market every day. The rate prior to demonetisation was between Rs 8 and Rs 9kg. But now with the shortage of the new currency, traders are insisting that farmers accept payment in old notes. And because farmers are refusing, they have slashed prices,"" an official from the market committee said.Farmers said since the auction had been stalled in these market yards for the past one week, they have had to throw a lot of their produce away as they cannot store this perishable item. Babanrao Lahane, a farmer, said he had to throw away 40 crates of tomatoes due to low sales last week. ""I have incurred losses to the tune of Rs 35,000 per acre. I continue to get affected by the low sale price.""Traders said since most of them had accounts in district cooperative banks, it was hard to withdraw cash. So they too are forced to work with old notes. Cooperative banks have been barred from exchanging old notes and are also carrying out limited transactions.Meanwhile, arrival of fresh crop lowered prices further.Abundant supplies are arriving at Vashi APMC market from Nashik. The wholesale rate has dropped from Rs 7-10 per kg a fortnight ago to Rs 5-7. Retail rates have fallen from Rs 15-20 to Rs 10-14 respectively.""Over 45-55 truckloads of good quality tomatoes are arriving daily from Nashik, which seems to be in surplus compared to the demand in the Mumbai metropolitan region. So prices are low and will remain so,"" said trader Balasaheb Badade.Also, since Monday, green peas have been getting cheaper.""Farmers have started harvesting the new crop, causing a drop in rates,"" said Mandar Jadhav , a retailer.Prices of other vegetables are fluctuating on a daily basis by Rs 5-10 a kg. There was a rumour that prices of potatoes and onions have dropped substantially . Dismissing it, Ashok Walunj, former APMC director, said, ""Since the last month, prices of onions and potatoes have stayed constant at Rs 7-14 and 812 respectively at APMC.""Onion auction called off over money woesNashik: Auction of onions was cancelled at the Lasalgaon APMC on Wednesday due to non-availability of cash in traders' bank accounts. However, an APMC official assured that the auction would reopen at the country's largest onion market on Thursday. The Lasalgaon APMC had suspended onion auction for almost eight days, from November 10 to 17, due to cash crunch."

Fruit sales, especially those of apples, have gone down by 80%.The sale of vegetables has also taken a hit but not as severely as that of fruits. The retail price of vegetables like potatoes has gone down by about 50% though demand remains more or less constant. As a result, apart from farmers, migrant labourers are hard hit by the sudden turn of events. According to traders, 60% of migrant labourers have returned to their home states.Rajesh Yadav, CEO, Agriculture Produce Marketing Community (APMC), Sahibabad wholesale vegetable and fruit market, said that 1,156 quintals of fruits were sold between November 1 and 8 while between November 15 and 22 the figure nosedived to 390 quintals. ""The same is true in the case of oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava, which saw a dip of about 70% post-demonetisation,"" Yadav said.Rashid Qureshi, manager of MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, said that normally 100 to 125 trucks laden with fruits like apples, oranges, banana, pomegranate and guava would come to the Sahibabad mandi but after demonetisation on average only 25 trucks are coming in. ""This being the wedding season our sales should have gone up but demonetisation has upset our applecart and many small traders would take several months to recover from the ongoing shock,"" Qureshi said.MKC Agro Fresh Fruits Ltd, one of the biggest wholesale dealers in fruits at the Sahibabad mandi, used to do business worth about Rs 50,000 per day during normal days but, after demonetisation, business has not exceeded beyond Rs 15,000 on any given day, according to Qureshi.As for vegetables, the overall prices have come down Vegetables like potato, onion, cabbage and tomato are still witnessing steady supply,"" Yadav said.""On Tuesday 2,586 quintals of potato found its way into the Sahibabad mandi and the average in the last week roughly comes to around 2,000 quintals a day though the retail price has come done drastically,"" Yadav said.According to Yadav, 1kg of potato before demonetisation came for about Rs 30 but after demonetisation it is now being sold at Rs 15/kg. ""Similarly, cabbage before demonetisation was sold at Rs 20 per kg which has now come down to Rs 4 /kg and tomato has come down to Rs 8/kg from Rs 18/kg,"" Yadav said.Explaining consumer behaviour in the backdrop of demonetisation, said, ""Since there is dearth of cash in the system because of demonetisation, consumers tend to spend only on essential items such as vegetables and they are saving on liquid cash by doing without fruits. I can see a bit of the 'Giffen paradox' in all this."""

Some vendors picked up tomatoes for free, while cattle feasted on the remaining dump.Apparently, he has come all the way to Hyderabad, because tomato prices came down drastically in Anantapur market, Srinivas, a local commission agent, told the media.The situation is similar in other parts of Rayalaseema that are known for production of tomatoes.Read | My business will be finished: Cash crunch hits farmers in PunjabUttar PradeshThe state government has approached several potato-deficit states, offering them to lift surplus potato from the state at an affordable rate in a bid to help its farmers get a better price.The government move comes amidst prevailing low prices of potato that have added to the plight of farmers. The state government has written to potato-deficit states like Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, telling them they can procure potato from UP, horticulture director SP Joshi said.Joshi also blamed farmers, saying they erred in anticipating the price. Potato was selling for Rs 1,500 per quintal till July-August but most farmers chose to sit on the stock, guessing the price will go up further. That did not happen and a new crop of potato from within and outside the state also arrived, compounding the price situation, he explained. UP accounts for 35-40 % of the countrys potato production.Read | Post demonetisation, a farmers wish list from the budgetMadhya PradeshFor the second time this year, onion farmers of Mandsaur-Neemuch belt are forced to sell their crop for as low as Rs 1 per kg. Many are abandoning their produce and the main culprit appears to be demonetisation, say those associated with the trade. Explaining the impact of the move, an official said small traders, who bring in supply from marginal farmers, have vanished due to shortage of cash and big traders seem to have formed a cartel.Cashless transactions could bring traders under the I-T departments scanner  which they dont want  the official added.State horticulture director Satyanand, however, blamed local factors for the crash, saying there was no spike in supply. In April, the government procured onions for Rs 6 per kilogram after prices fell to 25 paise per kg in Neemuch.Lalaram Bhatt, a farmer, was in tears after hearing about the price crash. We are already facing cash shortage problems due to demonetisation and this fall in onion prices is a double blow.

No seed sellers are ready to give seeds on credit.If the situation did not improve, there will 20-25% shortage of vegetables in the market in December, he saidJharkhand is a surplus vegetable production state. The Jharkhand state horticulture mission figures show that the state produces more than 37 lakh metric tonne of vegetables every year but only 30 lakh metric tonne is locally consumed.The state exports more than one million tonne of vegetables to other states every year.Even though farmers are selling their produces at a lower price to whole sellers, price of the perishable commodity in city retail markets is high. The arrival of vegetables from outside the state has partially stabilized prices.The cash-crunch has also hit harvesting of paddy and sowing of Rabi crops, as farmers have to queue outside banks to withdraw money. I did not start harvesting paddy due to the cash shortage. Who will purchase my produce?, said Jeetu Manjhi, a farmer of Ranchis Angarha.We are also struggling to purchase seeds and fertilizers for Rabi crops.Director of state agriculture department Jatashankar Choudhary, said that they are aware of the condition of farmers and discussions are on to ease farmers trouble. The district agriculture officials have also been directed to talk to farmers and find solution of their problems, he said."

Though prices of essential commodities such as wheat, rice, pulses and vegetables have remained stable so far but traders warned that they may increase if the current situation continues to prevail.Wholesalers in Delhi-NCR mandis say that the supply of grains and vegetables has also been hit because transporters have not been able to pay truck drivers. In fact, the entire supply chain which includes from the main wholesaler at the top to the loader at the mandi at the bottom, have been hit due to lack of cash inflow.Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said,We are taking goods from farmers mostly on credit. The vendors and middlemen are also buying from us on credit. This has ensured that the supply we get is less and the quantity being sold is lesser. We cant get a lot and also sell little, too, on credit. The situation wont improve unless the currency chaos gets stabilised, Sharma said.At Khandsa Mandi, the largest wholesale fruit and vegetables market in Gurgaon, the number of trucks bringing onion have come down from 10 to four since last week.

The hangover of the Raj, complete with the traditional Christmas spread, is what draws us to this place. Windamere, actually, is like an old country house, David told HT.For the past few years, we have been staying in Darjeeling for a longer period. We arrive before Christmas-eve and leave only in the first week of January, said Pat.Originally from Kiama, 130 km from Sydney, the Gates first visited Darjeeling in 1991. We had read about Darjeeling and Calcutta while in school. So we decided to explore the places. Thankfully, it was Christmas that year. And we fell in love with the way Windamere celebrated  the carol, the entertainment, the dinner... Since then, we have not celebrated Christmas anywhere else. It is homecoming for us, said Pat.She also appreciated the fact that Darjeeling has done away with the use of plastic carry bags.Over the years, we have befriended so many of this towns folks. We visit them every year. Many of them have passed away while many others have moved on, David said with a touch of nostalgia palpable in his voice.There are many tourists who keep coming back to Windamere but the Gates are special.

They said that the supply of fruits and vegetables to the wholesale market is gradually decreasing.Rajesh Yadav, the secretary of agriculture produce marketing committee, said, The prices of vegetables have dipped a bit while those of fruits have remained stable. However, the sale of fruits has dipped as consumers are mostly buying only vegetables, for daily consumption. The arrival of apples from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Himachal Pradesh dipped considerably after November 8.As per official data, 1,774 truckloads of fruits and vegetables arrived in the first eight days of November, at an average of around 222 loads per day. However, the number of truckloads that arrived from November 9 to November 21 was 2,659, down to an average of 205 loads per day.Officials said that most transactions in the market took place in cash, but now, the traders are depending on the supply of stock on credit as well.As of now, I have nearly Rs1 crore in rotation on account of supplying on credit. Not even a single person came to remit cash on Tuesday. Whenever I approach them, they say they dont have enough cash. The sale of fruits is down by 70%-80% and we have also stopped asking for the supply of apple from J&K. The sale of apple, grapes and oranges has been considerably affected, Raees Ahmad, owner of Sangam Fruits at the market, said.Munim Zafar of Madina Fruit Company said, We used to procure nearly 500kg-700kg of kinu (kinnow fruit) from Punjab. Now, the procurement is around 200kg per day. Consumers dont have much cash-in-hand to buy from here. Generally, we used to order two-three truckloads (of fruits) per day, but we ordered just one truckload in the last three days.Wholesalers said that farmers are also losing money due to dip in sales as they have to pay for parking the truck in the market for additional days.To move our stock, we are selling potato at Rs12-15 per kg against the rate of Rs30 per kg prior to the demonetisation move. Similarly, we are selling cauliflower at Rs2 per kg against Rs20 per kg earlier. Tomato prices have also reduced from Rs20 per kg to Rs8 per kg. This has also led consumers to purchase basic vegetables to meet daily food demand, Haji Sajjad, a wholesaler, said.According to official figures, the market received around 168 quintals (1 quintal = 100kg) of apples per day in the first week of November.

His sales have, however, dropped over the past month since buyers are low on cash. Now, the saplings too are currently threatened for want of farm hands.Read | Demonetisation will hit farmers, informal workers; long-term outlook positiveOur business involves lot of cash rotation. The complications are mounting with every passing day. I have never seen such an uncertain scenario in the past 50 years since I took over my family business and started producing saplings, says Khokh, 70.His problem is he has money, but cant access it. The day Modi made his announcement, Khokh had Rs2.8 lakh in high-value currency which he deposited in a bank. Since then, he has been struggling to withdraw cash for payment to the labourers.He is in a labour intensive business and needs to pay anywhere between 20 and 60 workers daily. These days, I am cash strapped, and there are other expenses to buy fertiliser, pesticides, diesel and equipment which I am unable to do, Khokh laments.Khokhs inconveniences spell bigger trouble for farmers who buy seeds and saplings from him. Coming amid the sowing season for rabi crop, the scarcity of cash is estimated to have delayed sowing in at least one-third of Punjabs 35 lakh hectares of crop land. Khokh says the sowing for vegetables scheduled to start in January could also be in jeopardy.The demonetisation has adversely impacted agricultural activities, admits GS Kalkat, chairman of Punjabs state farmers commission.Khokh could not have agreed more. He is currently preparing saplings of chilly over five acres which should be sufficient to grow the spicy ingredient over 900 acres. He needs money for that purpose but the squeeze in liquidity has put him in a tight spot.He recently sold 1,500 quintals of potato seeds, one-third of which was on credit since farmers did not have the cash to buy. I am sure farmers who come to buy chilly seeds will seek credit again. My business will be finished, Khokh says.Khokh is at one end of the agricultural chain. Sukhwinder Singh of Bhattian in Ludhiana is at the other by being a farmer who usually buys seeds from him.A farmer who plans to grow potato over 10 acres needs a cash investment of around Rs3 lakh. Costs include saplings, festiliser and pesticides. Most of the purchases are in cash, something we hardly have these days, points out Singh.The problem facing Jagdev Singh of Muteon is pressing. He had some cash savings which he spent on his daughters wedding recently. Now no one would give me saplings on credit. Banks are of little help. I do not know how to sow crop this season, he says.Farmers  both growing seeds and crops  are predicting a slump in vegetable produce this coming season. Growing crops will be a challenge. Selling them will be no less a problem. Traders have already lowered the buying price citing cash crunch and farmers will be forced to sell in distress. Traders loss is also farmers loss, Khokh explains.This is Part 5 of our ongoing series on the effect of demonetisation on rural India. The earlier parts focussed on Sunderbans, Bastar, Jammu & Kashmir and Vidarbha."

But PM Narendra Modis decision to demonetize Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes has changed it all.After the announcement, the shortage of smaller denomination currency led to a sharp fall in prices of fruits and vegetables. The traders have now asked farmers to not bring their produce owing to the drop in prices and lack of currency.We are stuck in a difficult situation. On the one hand, the vegetable produce in the farm is ready for cutting. But we cant go ahead with it as there is no point taking it to the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Traders say they dont have the cash to purchase our vegetables, said another farmer Madhukar Gogawale, who produces bitter gourd, tomato and bottle gourd on his 14-acre farm.With the halt in supply of money from buyers to farmers, the rural economy has taken a hit.The number of vehicles supplying vegetables to Pune APMC came down by 40% on Tuesday, compared to the previous week, claim sources from the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).The problem, farmers feel, may aggravate further with the district central cooperative banks not being allowed to exchange the higher currency by smaller denominations notes. These banks, considered to be the backbone of rural economy, have been barred from carrying out transactions, as many of them have not completed the know-your-customer formalities by taking PAN and other details.In Nashik, many onion growers did not bring their produce to APMCs on Sunday and Monday, as there was not enough cash with traders. Jaydatta Holkar, chairman at APMC, Nashik, said, We have stopped buying onions for the past two days.Our vegetable produce is not getting good price despite demand. Neither can we exchange old currency from the district central cooperative bank, nor can we withdraw money from our accounts. It is a really tough time, said Ramesh Kondhe, another farmer from Khed Shivapur."

He fired a shot from his licensed revolver which hit the brides brother, Rishabh Gupta, and led to his death. Later, the victims family lodged a complaint and named Chauhan in it, said Majhola police station house officer, Neeraj Kumar.Chauhan, a manager with Ravishs firm, fled Moradabad after the incident. He arrived in Ghaziabad early on Saturday morning and checked into Hotel Mahadev at Bajaria near Ghaziabad railway station.Around 1.30pm on Saturday, he ordered food, and later went out for some work in the local market. He returned in the evening and stayed in his room, said a hotel staff member.Chauhans relatives came to the hotel at 11.30pm. When he did not open the room, they informed police.His relatives told us they got a call from him saying he was going to commit suicide. Later, his mobile was switched off, said Ghanta ghar Kotwali officiating station house officer, Brijesh Sharma.By the time his relatives reached the hotel, Chauhan had killed himself, Sharma said.We have recovered three suicide notes and he shot himself in head with his licensed revolver. His relatives also said they tried to convince him to surrender, but he fled Moradabad, said Sharma.In the note on the room wall, Chauhan accused one Rajesh Singh of harassing him.

Chauhan also mentioned Singhs address.The note on the bed sheet said, Mummy, Papa, Sunita (wife), Rohit and Archit (children)... please forgive me as I am leaving you without any support. I cannot see any way as Rajesh Singh has affected my life... Ravi sir (his employer), I am the person who snatched away the happiness in your family... Please forgive me...The third note written on a piece of paper describes the entire incident and about how Rajesh sent a man to threaten him at the wedding.It is my mistake to undertake celebratory firing. But the man sent by Rajesh to threaten me was trying to take away my revolver and it triggered fire... the note said.He also said he was leaving Rs 11,000 and a gold chain to be handed over to his family."

Mera naam Pablo hai, aapka naam kya hain ? Aap kaise ho ? is stated with a self assurance that makes one think that Agular has spent years in the island city. But the reality is that Agular is a chef in transit. But its a reality that his comrade-in-food, entrepreneur and pastry chef Pooja Dhingra is hoping to change. For the few past weeks, Agular and Dhingra have been working round the clock  to launch the Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today.For Dhingra, this is a dream that she has worked hard to make come true. During the past four years or so, Dhingra has been busy trying to find a suitable spot in South Mumbai to launch a caf, and she almost did. We actually started work on a caf in Breach Candy and then it suddenly fell through and never took off, she says. Pablo was here too. I had called him over to help me.Dhingra met Agular nine years ago, where they both were students at Le Cordon Bleu Paris. She says, He did cuisine and I did pastry. But we never really interacted much. He was working in a caf close to school and that is where all of us went after hours to hang out. Dhingra is clearly admiring of Agulars work ethic, He moved to Paris when he was 18 and worked himself through culinary school. He would do a 10-hour shift and come to school and then study. Then go back to cooking and I would ask him, when do you sleep?So, when Dhingra found the dream location for her caf, right on the street where she wanted it, she promptly dialled Agular to make his way to Mumbai. And he did, Right before I came to Bombay, I used to own two restaurants in Paris. And for some personal reasons, I decided to split from my company. I have been working for close to nine years without taking a vacation, explains the half-Hungarian chef. Right now, I am going through this period in my life where I am going to take some time to enjoy and yet keep working. So coming to India was the perfect opportunity to discover new things.While Dhingra was busy tying up the myriad loose ends that go along with a caf launch  Agular made the long trip to Mumbai. Then they started work on a menu. Between the two, Dhingra and Agular might be able to cook up a storm, but for the cafs offerings, simple has been the motto they have stuck to. She explains, This is an extension of what I have always wanted to do. Dessert is my forte and its what I excel at. But food is something that I was completely clueless about. I had an idea of what I wanted at the caf and that is where Pablo comes in. I wanted a very tight menu. At Le15, we do a few things and we do them well. Theres no point in having a 10-page menu.Agular being agreeable to that thought process, has helped Dhingra develop a far-from predictable menu that has sandwiches, salads, soups and four main courses. For the cafs four-plated desserts; the two named them after French women. For someone who is passionate about chocolate, Dhingras favourite dessert from the menu is a non-cocoa dish that they have dubbed Amlie. You can see her excitement shine through when she describes it while beaming, Its a milk cake, raspberry coulis, pepper crumbs with mint.Agular, chimes in, We arent doing anything to just please people but stuff we like. For example, the burrata  I didnt really want it on my menu because everyone is doing burrata nowadays. But Pooja wanted it so much, that we are doing it. And its become one of the favourite dishes during the tastings. Another dish, the duo is excited about is the crispy parmesan waffle, with tomato sauce and a poached egg and then more parmesan on top.The plan is to keep adding on to the menu as the caf settles into a routine, explains Dhingra, For now, its going to be open from 10.30 am to around 7.30-8 pm for the first few weeks. For Agular, it will also be a time to perhaps try out his newly learned Hindi with patrons.Le15 Caf, Shop No. 18, Lansdowne Building, behind Regal Cinema, near Apollo Hotel, opposite Lings Pavilion, Colaba; 9769341994Agular, Dhingra have been working hard to launch Le15 Caf that will open its doors to patrons today"

Fearing a shutdown on Tuesday, residents flocked to neighbourhood stores to stock up on rations and motorists queued outside petrol bunks.Until Monday morning, the price of tomato and onion remained stable.Soon after the news spread that the chief minister was very critical, traders at the Koyambedu market raised the tomato prices to 20/kg while onion prices went up to 20/kg. Market advisor to the Koyambedu market traders association R Soundararajan said, ""Panic caused by the announcement created an artificial demand, prompting sellers to hike rates. But the rise was minimal at the market. Some retailers who sourced vegetables from us sold them for prices three or four times higher despite our requests not to exploit people's fears.""Soundararajan recalls that similar scenes had unfolded following deaths of former chief ministers Kamaraj, Annadurai and MGR, when antisocial elements cut loose. Tomatoes which cost 15/kg to 20/kg at the Koyambedu market were sold for 40/kg at retail stores in Thiruvanmiyur.At Indira Stores in Kottivakkam, onions were sold for 28/kg. The price per egg rose from 4 to 4.50 on Monday afternoon. Most shops including those along OMR remained shut, fearing arson and looting. The Koyambedu vegetables and fruits market remained open on Monday.After small stores downed shutters, people thronged supermarkets.At Nigiris Supermarket in Besant Nagar, the queue overflowed into Annai Velankanni Church Road. At Pazhamudir Nilayam in Virugambakkam, tomatoes sold for 15/kg and onion for 20. However, retailers said that it was a select few who sold at inflated rates.Activity at T Nagar, the city's shopping hub, was not subdued.While footfalls did reduced, many shoppers continued to throng areas including Ranganathan Street, which was teeming with hawkers and peddlers.Sathyam Cinemas at Royapettah remained open on Monday and ran all shows till afternoon.Shops that had remained open since the morning downed shutters around 6pm after TV channels made a false announcement that the AIADMK leader had passed away."

Processing of tomato can be a remedy to the problem of plenty, according to food scientists here.The technologies developed by Mysuru-based Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL) on tomato processing can come to the rescue of farmers when tomato prices fall drastically and they are forced to throw their produce.Tomato is sold at Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.5 a kg in the wholesale market/at farm level in the glut season and during the off season, the price shoots up to an extent of Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg at retail level, according to DFRL.The reasons cited for this uncertainty were lack of cooperative marketing, transportation and processing centres close to the areas of production. Tomato processing, especially primary processing in the form of pulp, juice, and chutneys, at farm level can enable value realisation to the growers.DFRL has developed a range of products and processing technologies for tomato utilisation to reduce the post-harvest losses with special focus on progressive farmers, self-help groups (SHGs), and rural enterprises.Importantly, the technologies are farm-friendly and have been developed keeping in view the traditional Indian taste and palate. The products are stable from up to six to nine months when stored in ambient temperature, according to Mallesha, DFRL PRO. The products are ready-to-serve (RTS) or ready-to-prepare (RTP).In a bid to reach out its technologies to farmers and other interested village groups, DFRL, under the rural development programme, along with Spoorthy Janaabhivruddi Samste, recently conducted an awareness programme and a workshop for farmers of Ahalya village, about 35 km from Mysuru, on various tomato processing and products at DFRL.Rakesha Kumar Sharma, Director, DFRL, spoke about the technologies at the workshop, which was attended by farmers and SHG members from in and around the village. DFRL has proposed to adopt a couple of villages, mostly in the tomato-growing belt, and install the technologies there. If others come forward, the technologies can be transferred for a cost, Dr. Mallesha said."

A plate of vada costs Rs. 20 while the combination of vada and curd cost Rs. 25. On any normal day, one has to squeeze to get into the wholesale shopping complex, but these are unusual times.

The dealers have also stopped accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes since Tuesday. The prices of pulses too are going down, he says.With the big notes out of legal tender, the wholesale business in Lalapet area has taken a hit. Wholesale traders say very few customers have turned up to buy goods in bulk during the last week. Most of them do not have access to the electronic mode of accepting debit or credit cards on Point of Sale (PoS) platforms and rely on traditional mode of payment.The sudden decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 have struck a deathblow to small traders. The daily turnover wholesale business in the town is about Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 crore.

But eat, you must, for the food is prettier.At one end of the historic Cochin Club, the eatery does not make a big show of itself. But it is not so undramatic at the table. Enter the salt-baked fish, the house special. A little before it arrives, while we are still going at the seafood platter with a clamour of knives, fork and claws, the attendant has quietly set two smaller tables beside the one at which we are seated. Seafood is one of the eaterys mainstays, as is evident from the menu. But not at all the usual fare one would find in Kerala. Not sure? Try the cured anchovies on toast then. It is a brilliant way to use the slim fish, cured in white wine and vinegar for a day, and laid on crunchy buttered toast. The flavour pops in the mouth.In between each dish, there is hectic admiration of the china. Its a mixed set for us, each of us gets a different colour or pattern. The soup has been had, a creamy tomato with basil, that soothes and rejuvenates and kindles instant desire to try at home. Since we dont care much for order, the salad has been had too somewhere in between--a melange of romaine lettuce, feta, prunes and caramelised walnuts that afford much crunch. If you are a bacon fan, you can opt for bacon bits that come in a small white bowl to go with it.The Drawing Room draws much of its ingenuity from the people around, says Sharath Pulimood, one of the partners. So, there are a lot of recipes from friends that are tried out, a few friends make cakes and desserts for the eatery as well. Sharaths mothers tender coconut pudding is something he wants to try out soon. The Drawing Room is the result of a shared passion for food, music and travel between friends Tharun Thomas, Abraham Thomas and Sharath, who had conceived of a performance-worthy venue, which can host plug and plays and basically, curate music along with top class food.The show-stopper has finally arrived. The salt-baked spectacle, which has got the tourists at the next table curious. As we all look on in wonderment, the attendant cracks open the thick crust of the fish and it sends out curly wisps of steam. This dish is all about the fish. This is a brackish water snapper, but we do use the baramundi as well, says Sharath. It is a relief not to have the usual masala in fish, here you can taste the freshness, with just a faint hint of lime and salt. A Spanish recipe, it has worked well here, adds Sharath. The fish is stuffed with herbs and lime and brushed with a mixture of egg whites and sea salt, which forms a thick crust when baked. The fish cooks in its own moisture and is best had with a butter garlic dip and a wacky accompaniment made of kanthari chilli, parsley, white wine, vinegar, olive oil and capsicum.If you are not the dramatic type, the platters are always there with a delicious variety of meat and fish (a lot of shrimp), not to mention the pastas. While you are there, try the teas and the coffees and the juices, each section of which offers variety of some kind, the chefs special tender coconut water and hibiscus, for instance. Dessert is not fanciful, but have the basics in place such as chocolate cake, cheesecake with a few surprises thrown in such as baked date pudding, carrot cake and tender coconut ice cream with sea salt."

But the crop, of late, is not fetching good price to the farmers. They have to provide wages to the workers for plucking the produce and again spend much for transporting the stock to the markets.

The price nose-dived because of bulk arrival from villages where harvest is in full swing.A large number of farmers at Mallikuntham, Vellar, Thettigiripatti, Aranganur, Panapuram, Sathapadi, and its surrounding villages have raised tomatoes.The Mecheri tomato is popular among homemakers in the State and Karnataka and Kerala for its juice content and gleaming colour.Unlike the hybrid varieties, the Mecheri tomatoes have a distinctive taste that adds flavour to dishes.A 12-kg basket of tomatoes is at present priced at Rs. 40.The farmers are getting a mere Rs. 3 a kg, which is not adequate enough even for meeting the plucking and transportation cost, said a farmer.The tomatoes are being sold at a price ranging between Rs. 6 and Rs. 8 in the open markets and uzhavar santhai in the district.As the vegetable has a poor shelf life, it could not stored in regular godowns.The farmers have been demanding that a cold storage facility be established in Mecheri where the tomato cultivation is very high."

A period of three weeks in June even witnessed the residents to wait for the arrival of loads at Gandhi Market to buy tomatoes.However, the prices had begun to dip from July.

It is sold at Rs.5 to 6 in the wholesale market. It is quoted at Rs.8 in the retail markets and vegetable stores.To cash in on the cheap prices, a number of hawkers have hired mini load carriers to sell tomatoes at the doorsteps of customers. They quote Rs.20 for three kg of high class tomatoes.Since the cost of tomato is cheap, we have taken a mini van for selling tomato in villages. It sells like a hot cake. Each customer buys at least three kg, says V. Mohanraj of Marabanur near Alampatti.He adds that he sells about 500 kg on an average per day as against just 100 kg on normal days.One kg of tomato is enough for my family for two days. Since the rate is cheap, I have bought three kg. I can make a try with tomato based dishes, said P. Lakshmi of Pallakadu near Somarasampettai.Traders say that markets in Tiruchi, Karur and Manapparai have been receiving loads more than the actual demand for the last three weeks. Besides loads from Pollachi near Coimbatore, arrivals from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka too have been coming in."

Compare this with prices just a month ago, when tomato was retailing at Rs. 30 a kg. While a good yield over the last one month has normalised supply, tomato growers have now been affected by the post- demonetisation cash crunch.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to States such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and in case of tomato, even to Kolkata.Supply of tomatoes to Tamil Nadu was affected during the Cauvery crisis. Now there is cash crunch, and transportation has been hit, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato grower from Nukkanahalli in Kolar disitrct, and added that farmers were suffering huge losses.Vegetable prices have also been crashing: a kg of beans is now selling at Rs. 14, onion at Rs. 16 and potato at Rs. 26. The prices took a hit over the last two weeks. This is despite the fact that November and December usually see vegetables retailing at higher prices in Bengaluru.The prices have come down by over 30 per cent in the last week alone, said a senior official heading the vegetable procurement section in a leading retail chain.Keshav S.H., manager, Marketing, Hopcoms, said that another reason for the falling prices has been falling retail sales, indicating lower consumption of vegetables, creating a high supply and low demand cycle.However, procurement officials fear that the supply-demand cycle may soon be reversed if the cash crunch continues for a longer period, affecting crop patterns.Now, vegetable growers are resorting to distress sale. But they are not being paid for their produce immediately, further worsening the cash crunch. If this affects sowing this season, then we will soon stare at low supplies and skyrocketing prices, the official said.Farmers low on cash are at a loss to fund the transportation of tomato and other vegetables to markets"

But the crop, of late, is not fetching good price to the farmers. They have to provide wages to the workers for plucking the produce and again spend much for transporting the stock to the markets. This will prove additional expenditure to the farmers.As such, the farmers have allowed the crop to decay in the fields. Many of them are allowing their cattle to graze in the tomato farms."

With most of them running out of currency, Rajendra maintains a bill book allowing them to pay later.Photo: T. Vijaya KumarA group of daily labourers stand on a narrow lane at the crowded wholesale market in Lalapet on a balmy afternoon. They are waiting for their plate of crispy vada dipped in dollops of curd and garnished by slices of tomato and coriander leaves at this small eatery.Rajendra is a busy man as he serves the vada in steel plates to head loaders and then scribbles numbers in a small note book kept on top of the steel rack. A plate of vada costs Rs. 20 while the combination of vada and curd cost Rs. 25. On any normal day, one has to squeeze to get into the wholesale shopping complex, but these are unusual times. I have been here for the last 20 years and I know most of my customers by name. If they dont have money to pay, they can pay me later. But I can not accept Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, Rajendra says.Rajendra just makes a note of cost of each plate in a book and the customers walk away after having a delicious meal. Trust is the key word in this hub of wholesale market in the town.A head loader Ravi, rues that his daily earnings have come down drastically. I usually get Rs. 600 to Rs. 1,000 daily but now I get only Rs. 500, he says. The narrow lane leads to a cluster of wholesale shops. Koteswara Rao, a wholesale trader dealing in pulses, says he has been feeling the pinch of the sudden decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes.I was selling 100 bags of pulses on an average daily but now, I hardly sell about 20 bags. The dealers have also stopped accepting Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes since Tuesday. The prices of pulses too are going down, he says.With the big notes out of legal tender, the wholesale business in Lalapet area has taken a hit. Wholesale traders say very few customers have turned up to buy goods in bulk during the last week. Most of them do not have access to the electronic mode of accepting debit or credit cards on Point of Sale (PoS) platforms and rely on traditional mode of payment.The sudden decision to scrap Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 have struck a deathblow to small traders. The daily turnover wholesale business in the town is about Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 crore. We urge the State government to allow the traders to deposit the notes entered in books in the current account of banks, president of Indian Chamber of Commerce, Atukuri Anjaneyulu told The Hindu on Wednesday."
