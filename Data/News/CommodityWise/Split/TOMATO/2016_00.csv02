In 2014, the government announced that 15 centres would be opened in Visakhapatnam, 10 in Guntur and five each at Tirupati and Anantapur in phase- I. The fact remains that the officials are still studying various models to roll out more canteens across the State. There is no consensus on the food items to dish out to the people.While there is a proposal to serve lunch with all dishes such as curry, chutney and sambar, the officials negate it saying different types of ricesambar rice, tamarind rice and curd rice-- could be served at these canteens. The GoM is, now, also mulling over a proposal to provide region-specific food at the NTR Canteens. The officials would have to study the food preferences of people in the State. It takes back the issue to square one and a Group of Ministers (GoM) on Anna canteens, subsequently, has decided to study the models in Telangana and Tamil Nadu again.A high-powered delegation headed by Civil Supplies Minister Paritala Sunitha already visited Chennai along with a team in 2014 to study how these canteens, taken up by the Jayalalithaa Government in Tamil Nadu function. The delegation studied whether these could be replicated in AP. The officials also studied the model followed in neighbouring Telangana State.The government had planned to initially provide subsidised food to around 1 lakh people in the first phase. The officials are now scouting for places which are labour intensive saying that the government target was to reach out the labourers. We are planning to start 100 canteens at places such as Visakhapatnam, Nellimara, Rajam, Tirupati, SRikakulam, Anantapur, Hindupur, Kurnool and Kakinada shortly, says Ms. Sunitha. The government also plans to supply region-specific food at these canteens. A proposal to provide full meals is also on cards. We are exploring all the options, she adds.The menuThey (the canteens) are modelled on the lines of Amma Canteens that gained immense popularity in Tamil Nadu. An idly costs just Re.1 in Anna Canteens. Two hundred grams of pongal and an equal quantity of tomato bath costs Rs.5 each. Two hundred grams of sambar rice, pulihora (tamarind rice) and vegetable rice costs Rs.5 each, and 150 grams of curd rice costs Rs.3.There was an overwhelming response to the Velagapudi canteen. Not less than700 people visit the canteen every day. About 500 people have meals there. The government is providing a subsidy of Rs. 4.38 lakh as against total expenses of Rs. 7 lakh per month, she explains."

Many tomato growers have left their yield to rot in their farms as they are not sure of getting back even a portion of their investment. And many of those who do go to the market carrying vegetables return without recovering even the transportation cost.Mithun of Hosahalli in Salagame hobli, Hassan, has grown tomatoes on 17 guntas of land owned by his father, Shivappa. He stopped marketing the harvest when the price of tomato went below Rs. 30 for a 15-kg bag. I have left the tomato plants in the field unattended to and have also let cattle into the farm. What else can I do when I am not sure of getting back even what I spent on harvesting? he asked.Tomato growers require at least six workers to harvest 100 packs (each of 15 kg) a day. The payment to the workers comes up to around Rs. 1,500. If my product is sold at Rs. 20 or 30 a pack, I will not be left with any cash. After deducting 10 per cent commission for middleman and the transportation cost of Rs. 500, I will have nothing left, he said.Tomato growers expect at least Rs. 100 a bag, considering their investment. Last month, they were earning up to Rs. 150 a bag.But now, merchants in the market do not have cash in hand. They are not purchasing vegetables in the amounts they did earlier and are also offering lower prices. Meanwhile, farmers are forced to sell their produce at the rates offered as they cannot take the vegetables back.Ganesh of Narasipura grows many vegetables, including tomato, beans, ridge gourd and capsicum. On at least three days a week, he carries vegetables to the market in Hassan. A kilogram of beans was sold for Rs. 25 last month. Now, it has come down to Rs. 8, he said.He says his income is down by Rs. 25,000 a week. We are forced to sell the vegetables at the price offered by the merchant, as we cant bring the stock back to our village, he said."
58e4fa89a3d24b3f37f78c84,Euphoria around mobile wallets simmering down,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/Euphoria-around-mobile-wallets-simmering-down/article16966963.ece,2016-12-31,"The upbeat mood that came with many vendors jumping on to the mobile wallet bandwagon seems to have dampened at south-west Delhis Dabri fruit and vegetables market.What came across as a new mode of receiving payment in a cash-strapped scenario has now become a reminder of how liquidity woes will continue to cast a shadow over both digital and hard cash. Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."
58e500caa3d24b4437c4a2ef,Tomato growers feel squeezed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Tomato-growers-feel-squeezed/article16739956.ece,2016-12-02,"Tomatoes in varying shades of crimson and mild green merging into shades of orange fill out of plastic boxes here at Rayakottai tomato mandi.The tomatoes loaded in tempos are all set to make it to the markets in the southern districts of the State. It is week three since demonetisation. And at Rayakottai tomato mandi, it is business as usual  seemingly uninterrupted by demonetisation.But, for the tomato growers, there is a major concern. The price of tomatoes has seen a drastic fall over the past month, even before demonetisation was announced. The reason being an oversupply of the vegetable, left undisturbed by the failed annual monsoons around this time. Last year this time, when the State reeled under the deluge, tomato growers of Rayakottai saw a bumper price for their produce. Their produce was auctioned between Rs.700 a box (23 kg. per box) to Rs.1,500 a box then. The rainfall had affected the quality of the produce in most fields, and the resultant supply. This in turn saw a spurt in the demand for tomatoes vis a vis a fall in the supply.However this year, with the failure of monsoon, there has been an oversupply of tomatoes from all the fields. Today, a box of tomato is auctioned for Rs.180, says Shanmugam, owner of Saravanan tomato mandi in Rayakottai. That would be Rs.7.80 per kg. the mandi. So are the prices for cauliflowers, says Shanmugam.A bag consisting of 20 quality cauliflowers are being auctioned at Rs.180 per bag. An ideal price for a farmer growing cauliflower would be Rs.300 per bag, because that would just about meet the cost of production for the farmer, says Shanmugam. Rainfall affects shelf life of the vegetables, and offsets the oversupply. But this time, there was no rain, and the price of vegetables has fallen, explains Shanmugam.Sitting behind the counter, Shanmugam, had just finished the auctions and was making payments to the farmers. He had refused a wad of notes of Rs.500. Few notes are accepted, but not in bulk, he says.For the farmers, the sharp pinch felt from the fall of price for tomatoes was only intensified by demonetisation. Most of the fields growing the70-day tomato crop are in the midst of harvesting. Here demonetisation has affected the farmers.The sack, the rope, the tempo rental from the field to the mandi all adds up to Rs.300 per bag for Cauliflowers. But now, its going for Rs.180 per bag, says Marappa, who managed to exchange his Rs.500 note for Rs.400 over the past two weeks. He pitches in with his workers on his tomato field, and cannot lose out a day on the field, waiting outside the bank.Until now, the mandi has been operating on old notes to the extent possible, palming off the burden of currency exchange and deposit on the farmers, who come to auction off their produce. The last two weeks, we could withdraw up to Rs.20,000 per week, but my daily requirement will be Rs.3.5 lakh. The real worry, however, is after December 15, when we will completely stop accepting Rs.500s, he says. The mandis had not been accepting Rs.1,000 anyway, since November 9."

Bhat of the Hyderabad High Court suspended the orders of the officers who cancelled the licenses of several traders of Khammam, who were facing charges of selling spurious tomato seeds to farmers. However, the traders were asked to give an undertaking before they commenced business again.He was dealing with cases filed by Ushasree Traders and others, who complained that the officers had given notice to them to explain why their license to trade seeds should not be suspended.The officers had then cancelled the license based upon a laboratory report that analysed the leaves allegedly grown on plants which had sprouted after the spurious seeds were used by farmers.Wrong analysisThe rules require analysis of the seed samples and not leaves. The judge perused the orders, rule position, and material relied upon by the department, and suspended the governments orders. Traders have to give an undertaking that they will, henceforth, sell only those seeds certified by the competent authority and from an authorised company."

Photos: A.MuralitharanNormality on Wednesday returned to Tiruchi, Karur, Pudukottai, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts a day after the demise of the Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.Barring schools and colleges, which were closed for three days, all other routine activity resumed. Shops and business establishments were open. Though there was an apprehension among a section of traders on opening the shops on account of official mourning that would continue till Thursday, some traders opened the shutters as usual. Following this, others also resumed their business.Similarly, hotels, restaurants, eateries which had downed shutters on Tuesday as a mark of respect to the late leader, resumed their business as usual. Cinema halls resumed the shows from afternoon.The Gandhi Market that attracts traders from Tiruchi and nearby areas resumed its activities with the arrival of vegetables from villages. However, the arrival was less than the usual, traders said.The market will witness optimum business from Thursday as loads from far away places and neighbouring States will reach Tiruchi on Wednesday night, a wholesale merchant of tomato said.Normality returned to the Tiruchi Bus Stand, which wore a deserted look on Monday and Tuesday, with the operation of State owned Transport Corporations and private buses. The long distance buses bound for Chennai, Tiruvananthapuram, Coimbatore and other destinations were operated as usual. Similarly, city buses were on roads. However, the occupancy rate in the long distance buses was said to be less than the normal days.Reports from Karur, Ariyalur and Perambalur said that normality had retuned in most of the towns and rural areas. Though the cadres of AIADMK and the people were yet to come out of grief, sorrow and shock over the death of Jayalalithaa, traders and merchants slowly opened their business houses. Most of the textile and mosquito net manufacturing units too resumed their operation as usual on Wednesday.To stay away from courtsThe Tiruchi Bar Association on Wednesday resolved to abstain from attending courts for three days as a mark of respect to the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. A resolution to that effect was passed unanimously at its special meeting.V. Srinivasan, president, and J. Mathiazhagan, secretary, were present. Over 700 advocates attended the meeting. Stating that the death of Jayalalithaa was an irreparable loss to the country, particularly Tamil Nadu, the resolution said that the advocates would not attend courts till Friday as a mark of tribute to her. Earlier, they paid floral tribute to the late leader. They also observed two-minute silence.ThanjavurThe AIADMK cadre and the public displayed enormous resilience in the aftermath of the demise of late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa testified by the sombre mood and absence of any untoward incident from any part of the region on Wednesday. Though most people are in grief, normality slowly returned to the delta districts.Most of the shops and trading establishments reopened on Wednesday while fuel stations too started dispensing supplies to motorists. The TNSTC resumed operations but on a vastly reduced scale as the movement of passengers and commuters was dull. Holiday for educational institutions was one reason for the lean movement of passengers, sources said.Meanwhile, people and AIADMK cadre continued to glorify Jayalalithaa, adorning her portraits with flowers in major street corners and in almost all villages in the region. At Koviladi, around 15 cadre tonsured their heads and took bath in the Cauvery. Amma was all for us and we feel orphaned by her death. So we decided to undertake the rituals, normally done in the event of death of their own mother, Sundaram, one among the cadre, said. At Sengipatti nine cadre tonsured their heads as a mark of respect to the departed leader.Thanjavur Kamaraj Market Vegetable and Fruit Vendors Association took out a candle light procession led by association president Dharmaraj.

58e52ef07be9e05a951f534d,Tomatoes for a song,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161220/jsp/jharkhand/story_125632.jsp,2016-12-20,"A mound of tomatoes waits for more customers at Lalpur market in Ranchi on Monday. Picture by Hardeep Singh For once, nature's bounty has become a bane for farmers and boon for homemakers in Ranchi. Surplus yield of tomatoes in these demonetised times is forcing farmers of Bero, Mandar and Pithoria to sell their juicy produce at throwaway prices in the capital. The culinary vegetable (botanically, a fruit) is available for as low as Rs 4 per kg in wholesale markets while the retail price has plummeted from Rs 18-20 a kg a month ago to Rs 8-10 a kg now because of a grave supply-demand mismatch triggered by cash crunch in the market. In Jharkhand, tomatoes are grown in the vegetable belts of Ranchi, Lohardaga, Hazaribagh and Chaibasa. According to K.K. Jha, a horticultural scientist at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Kanke, the total tomato yield is around 13.5 lakh metric tonnes this year against 11 lakh metric tonnes last time. ""Production is surplus, but the demand in market is limited because people are rationing their kitchen needs because of the cash crisis. Farmers have little choice but to sell their produce at throwaway rates because tomato is a perishable item,"" Jha explained how demonetisation had altered market dynamics. Vinod Kumar, a vegetable vendor at Lalpur market, said he had stocked five quintals from the wholesale haat of Makhmandro near Pandra. ""Farmers are selling tomatoes at Rs 4 a kg. They don't have easy access to banks and are in dire need of cash to run their families. The bumper crop has made their labour dirt cheap,"" Vinod said, adding that he was extending the price advantage to his buyers. ""For the past week, I am selling tomatoes at Rs 8-10 a kilo, half the usual rate."" Vijay Gupta, another vendor in Lalpur, said 50 trucks of tomatoes arrived at Makhmandro haat every day, but at least 10 trucks were surplus. ""Farmers have been hit bad. They cannot stock tomatoes on their own and hence, are selling their produce to middlemen too at very low prices,"" Gupta said. Namita Singh, a resident of Circular Road, said she was thrilled to buy 5kg tomatoes for just Rs 50. ""The best part is I spent five Rs 10 coins on the purchase. My purse is lighter for good. Tomatoes add great taste to every curry, especially in winter,"" she beamed."
58e52f497be9e05a951f53c1,"Under debt, farmers dump crops",http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161122/jsp/nation/story_120594.jsp,2016-11-22,"Chandrabhan Jhode, a 12-acre farmer from rural Nagpur, with his spinach crop at Nagpur APMC. Jhode says the prices have fallen from Rs 15 to Rs 10 a kg in the wake of the demonetisation move Nagpur/Wardha, Nov. 21: Bandu Ghormade had no choice but to accept the old Rs 500 notes from the procurement agent and a lower price: Rs 200 less for every 40kg crate of his freshly harvested eggplants. ""If I didn't, my produce would have gone waste,"" said the farmer in his late 40s who grows carrots, spinach, eggplants and okra in Chicholi, about 50km from Nagpur. ""Those who grow grains or cotton can hold on to their crop; I can't."" For years, Ghormade would load four quintals (400kg) of vegetables on his tempo every morning from October to December and drive to Nagpur's state-run Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi, where licensed traders buy farmers' produce through agents. Since November 8, when high-value notes were demonetised, Ghormade has been selling at a loss at the mandi every day while his son is going to the nearest bank, 5km away, to stand in queue and deposit the notes. Still, Ghormade is earning something because he is ready to accept the old notes. Some farmers, also with perishable produce, are not - and are taking terrible losses. Many farmers have junked their vegetables in the absence of buyers at markets in Thane and Pune, newspaper reports suggest. At the Hiwarkhed village market in Amaravati, about 160km from Nagpur, orange growers have dumped mounds of the fruit on the roads in protest at a sharp fall in prices. The prices have fallen because the traders have stopped buying. The traders aren't buying because most farmers aren't accepting the old notes. So, is the farmers' plight solely an inevitable consequence of a poorly planned demonetisation, or are they shooting themselves in the foot by insisting on payments in usable cash? Sudam Pawar, 38, was the lone farmer at the mandi in Selu town in Wardha district, about 70km from Nagpur, selling his nine quintals of cotton on Wednesday. The trader offered to transfer the money directly into his bank account. Pawar, former sarpanch of Aamgaon village, agreed. The money got transferred immediately, without any hassles. Later that day, Pawar said, eight more farmers known to him sold about 80 quintals of cotton at the mandi, accepting the old notes. With hardly any other arrivals, the trader bought their cotton at Rs 5,000 a quintal - a little more than the market price of Rs 4,750-4,900. So, why are more farmers not following their example? Pawar explained the point. Most farmers are afraid to put their earnings in their bank accounts because these are in the same banks from where they have taken crop loans. A majority are long-term defaulters because, for years, they haven't earned enough to repay their loans as well as sustain their families. Once their earnings go into their accounts, they fear the banks will discourage withdrawals, pressuring them to leave a balance equal to the sum they would need to repay by March to settle their loans. Most farmers know that this would leave them in serious jeopardy. There's no government order asking the banks to unilaterally deduct the loan repayment from the farmers' accounts, but the banks have used pressure tactics in the past, knowing well that the farmers cannot afford to annoy them because they would need a loan the following year too. ""I could accept the money transfer because I don't have a loan in my name, nor do I need cash urgently,"" Pawar said. ""Our crop loan is linked to my father's account, so the bank cannot deduct the repayment amount from my account."" Nor were the other eight sellers at the mandi in any urgent need of cash, he said. ""But most small farmers, who do sustenance farming and have no other income, won't accept cheques or money transfers."" ""Demonetisation has wrecked the farmers,"" said Ramkrishna Umathe, farmer and deputy chairman of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandi at Selu, which serves about 100 mainly soybean and cotton-growing villages. ""For about a week, sellers and buyers have virtually deserted our market."" So the coolies, transporters and other ancillaries too have been without work, assistant market secretary Mahendra Bhandarkar said. ""This is the time of year for brisk sales but the arrivals have tanked since November 8,"" Umathe said on Wednesday. From 5,000 quintals a day, the arrivals had dropped to zero, he said. ""Yesterday, 100 sacks (quintals) came."" Umathe said the traders were offering cheques and money transfers but the farmers weren't ready to accept these lest the banks ""deduct the crop loan"". ""Most fields are un-irrigated here; the farmers are already under a lot of financial stress. They have to repay hand loans and the cost of inputs taken on credit, and pay their grocers and farm hands,"" Umathe said. ""If there's some residual money, it gets deposited into the bank - else the bank loans remain unpaid."" Sales - and prices - of produce are falling for another reason too: a drop in consumption in the retail markets. ""Forward movements have been affected,"" said Rajesh Thakar, a wholesale tomato trader in Nashik. For instance, orange arrivals at the Nagpur mandi have dried up because of a demonetisation-driven slump in sales at the markets in Calcutta and north India, said Rajesh Chhabrani, a director at the Nagpur APMC and an orange trader himself. ""Orange prices fell 25 to 35 per cent today (Tuesday), from Rs 40,000 to Rs 25-30,000 per tonne,"" he said. ""Ten to 12 truckloads of oranges left the mandi for Calcutta daily; that has stopped."" Madhusudan Harane, a director at the APMC in Hinganghat town in Wardha district, said: ""Our APMC has been shut since November 8."" He questioned the timing of the demonetisation. ""Some Rs 1,500 crore worth of annual business took place in our mandi, over half of it between October and December - the peak months for farm markets,"" he said. The irony is, a favourable monsoon had led to a good harvest this year and the farmers were hoping for good returns after successive years of drought in many regions of the country."

(Vishvendu Jaipuriar) Hazaribagh, Dec. 16: Ravi Kumar Gupta has a degree in civil engineering from Gaya College of Engineering. But the 30-year-old hasn't taken up a job. Instead, he grows tomatoes. A 'red revolution' is bearing fruit in the red zone of Vishnugarh, where Ravi and his two friends, Pintu Kumar Saw and Awadh Kumar Yadav, have turned a barren 18-acre plot in the non-descript Chalkari village into a farmers' delight, not only growing tomatoes but also creating jobs for fellow villagers in the process. This is no mean feat given that Vishnugarh has its own share of challenges, being a safe den for Maoists because of its topography marked by hills and dense forests and a border that overlaps with Gomia (Bokaro) and Bagodar (Giridih). Chalkari is located on the Bagodar border, some 48km from the Hazaribagh district headquarters. ""I come from a family of farmers at Banka village in Katkamdag block. I was never keen on a job and had always wanted to do agriculture. I convinced my friends Pintu and Awadh, who are graduates and help their fathers in the field, from the same village to join me. After consulting local agricultural scientists, who confirmed that the soil was good for tomato cultivation, we took up the land at Chalkari and started our own farming,"" a visibly proud Ravi told The Telegraph. He added that they started the groundwork in June and till now, had sold 70,000 quintals of tomatoes in the local markets besides sending consignments to Bengal. ""In the next two months, they will grow more tomatoes. Many villagers have been roped in to take care of the tomato plants right from sowing the seeds to plucking the vegetable. This way, we have generated employments,"" said the new-age farmer. Pintu and Awadh, also in their 30s, added they had invested around Rs 10 lakh on this project, but were happy to see that our efforts finally started giving returns. ""One plant produces more then 5kg tomatoes on an average. Hazaribagh is a green belt and very conducive for agriculture. With huge swathes of land lying abandoned, unemployed youths can make farming their profession and earn good money,"" Pintu said. Ravi added: ""Yes, this needs hard work, but if done with honesty will give good results as in our case."" Local villagers hailed the trio, saying their success was an inspiration for others. ""Definitely, this kind of inspiring tales will encourage youths to make a career in agriculture as engineer Ravi and his two graduate friends did,"" said Bhuvaneshvar Patel, RJD district president and resident of Vishnugarh."

Telegraph Picture If all goes well, the 20,000-tonne vegetable processing plant in Kanke, the foundation of which was laid by chief minister Raghubar Das in February this year, will start operations in six months from now. Being set up by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), an autonomous entity working for the state government to boost milk production and market agrarian products, the plant will be the home of Safal products, ranging from fresh vegetables to all kinds of fruits. Mother Dairy, a subsidiary of NDDB, is investing around Rs 70 crore in the project. Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, B.S. Khanna, managing director of Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers' Federation (also known as Jharkhand Milk Federation), a joint venture between the state government and NDDB, said work on the plant spread over 27 acres was proceeding in full swing and they were bullish about beginning operations in another six months provided no hurdle crops up. ""Between February and now, there has been considerable progress in this project. We are bang on time with our groundwork. I visited the site two days ago and found the progress to be satisfactory. The process of setting up a boundary in and around the plant is almost complete. This apart, structure of the plant has come up while construction of the roof will begin very soon. Procurement of equipment and machinery is going on simultaneously,"" Khanna said. They had also got in touch with the district administration and power department for setting up an electricity feeder. ""There are some encroachment issues on a small patch of land. We are in talks with the district administration to ensure that it doesn't affect the plant in future. We are hopeful that these issues will be sorted out soon,"" he added. Once it begins functioning, the plant will initially take up pea and tomato processing and marketing followed by seasonal vegetables such as cabbage, beans and cauliflowers that are grown in abundance both on the capital's outskirts and adjacent districts. ""We have plans to take up fruits as well in phases. As far as veggies are concerned, frozen peas, tomato puree and pastes are a few items that we intend to supply in the market. The raw materials will be directly procured from farmers, which will ensure them good returns,"" he said. As for milk production, Khanna said the 1.2-lakh litre automated dairy plant in Hotwar, which also officially debuted this February, had touched the 75,000-litre production mark. ""Earlier, we used to process roughly around 20,000-25,000 litres of milk. Slowly, we touched the 75,000-litre mark. Soon, Ranchi dairy will be producing to its full capacity,"" he signed off."

The herd was lingering at the thickets abutting Sivunikuppam village of Santhipuram mandal at 8 p.m. on Thursday.Since Wednesday midnight, forest officials of the Bangarpet range, Krishnagiri range of Tamil Nadu and Kuppam range of A.P. have been camping at the villages.Officials argueThe Karnataka officials refused to allow the pachyderms to enter their side, arguing that the herd had actually emerged from the T.N. side. However, the T.N. officials too remained stubborn, demanding that the elephants be driven towards Karnataka. The Bangarpet range staff had even brought the tranquillizer guns to dart at the herd, in case they kept entering their limits.The Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West), T. Chakrapani, held a series of talks with officials of the border States. A solution was arrived at on Thursday late in the evening.Keeping in view the reluctance of the pachyderms to move towards Karnataka, and their inclination to march towards Tamil Nadu, the forest personnel of Chittoor district readied their path towards Mallanur near Kuppam, close to the Maharaja Kadai forests of Tamil Nadu.During the the last 24 hours, standing crops of paddy and tomato and horticulture crops were reportedly damaged by the herd in Santhipuram mandal. Mr. Chakrapani told The Hindu that with the cooperation of villagers and forest personnel of the neighbouring states, the tense situation in the rural areas was brought under control."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Demonetisation has paralysed wholesale markets in the city, be they of grocery  rice, wheat, pulses, spices and suchlike  or fruits. The vegetable wholesale market was also hit in the first two days after the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were banned on November 8, but the demand later recovered. Marufganj market, the citys biggest wholesale market which on an average day notches up sales of not less than Rs 10 crore, is barely doing business worthRs 2.5 crore per day. Lalit Agrawal, a trader from the Marufganj area, said footfall has plummeted by around 75 per cent. The demonetisation has hit business in a big way, Agrawal said. It seems like the will to shop has completely vanished. There are no customers in the market. People are coming with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which we are not accepting as it has been scrapped. Very few people have smaller denomination notes or the new Rs 2,000 notes. We are not accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as we have to deposit those with the banks, and going by the crowd at the banks and ATMs with people lining up for hours its not feasible for us to accept bigger notes. As one travels from market to market, its almost like a chorus  no customers, no money, worries galore. Maharajganj market in Patna City generally sees daily sales of around Rs 2 crore; it is now scraping up just about Rs 25-30 lakh. People are not coming, said Akhilesh, a trader. There is a drop in customers as well as overallsales. The market is usually overcrowded, but nowadays it is silent. Most people now want to meet their basic needs first, and they are saving lower denomination currency notes for emergency situations. Patnas biggest wholesale fruits market, Bazaar Samiti, which generally witnesses huge crowds in the morning, wore a deserted look on Wednesday. The market, which used to have daily sales of more than Rs 10 lakh, has virtually collapsed. Sales at present stand at Rs 1-2 lakh only, said Haji Mohammad Min Alam, president, Patna Food Merchant Association. We accepted Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in the initial two-three days on humanitarian grounds as people come to us from far-flung areas such as Ara, Danapur, Naubatpur, Fatuha. However, we have now stopped accepting the bigger notes and the people are short of lower denomination notes. This has hit the market significantly as people in general are saving the smaller notes for their basic necessities. He added: At times, the situation spirals out of control and there is fear of violence as people insist on paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as they want to get rid of those. Its not just demand; supply to the markets has been hit as well. Before demonetisation, if 20 trucks used to come daily from other states like Kashmir and Maharashtra, the number now has gone down to five or six, saidRazi Ahmed, another trader. The reason is that we are not beingable to send money to those states. The sellers problem has been further compounded here as they are unable to recover money from retailers, which in turn has made sending money to other states adifficult task. To ensure the fruits dontrot, traders are sending them tocold stores. We dont have hope that the market transactions will revive this month,"" Ahmed added. Another problem we are facing is that the transporters and porters working in the market have also refused to accept the invalid currencies as payments. As a result, several trucks from other states are still stationed here. Another wholesale fruit dealer Wasim said: As fruit markets are cash-oriented markets, scrapping of the bigger notes has brought market activity to a grinding halt. The footfall has fallen by 90 per cent with sales dropping to one-tenth of the usual figures. Unlike malls, transactions here take place in cash. When there is not much cash available, how will people shop? Vegetable markets are the only silver lining. Dinesh, a wholesaler at Anta Ghat, Patnas biggest wholesale market for vegetables, said: During the first two-days, the market witnessed very low turnout of customers as sudden action of the government banning notes left the customers with no choice. Sales had dropped by 50 per cent. The market on a normal day has a daily turnover of around Rs 10-15 lakh. However, as people cannot live without vegetables, they have no choice but to buy them. This necessity brought the customers back to the market. People are paying in smaller notes for buying vegetables. At times, we are also accepting bigger notes if people are buying large quantities just to save the customers from more agony. Prices of vegetables have remained stable. Prices of potato and tomato remain the same as before the demonetisation with potatoes being sold at Rs 20 per kg while tomato ranges between Rs 20-25 per kg, said Another seller, Rajesh Singh, a trader. Onion, which we were earlier selling at Rs 15 per kg, has shot up to Rs 20, but that is due to delay in consignment from Nashik and not due to demonetisation."

The herds have retreated to the thickets of the neighbouring States. But the prowling of two lone elephants at the tri-State junction continues leaving the farmers in about 100 fringe villages in a grip of tension as they expect the return of the herds to their fields any time.During the last five years, movement of the wild elephants, numbering over 70 and split into five or six herds, between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon in the Kuppam region.Two herds had barged into the fringe hamlets of the two constituencies in the third week of December, and the forest personnel could drive them back into the thickets of TN and Karnataka in separate operations during the last couple of days.Since August, the farmers of the Kuppam mandal have been familiar with the presence of a lone elephant moving along the borders of Tamil Nadu. Another single elephant problem surfaced a couple of days ago in Santhipuram mandal, when it got separated from a herd of seven pachyderms.The farmers who are generally used to drought conditions mostly rely on horticulture crops. Since November, stretches of banana, potato, tomato and beans plantations suffered the ire of the marauding tuskers in many villages. With Sankranthi just two weeks away, the farmers get ready to harvest their crops.However, the man-animal conflict has forced them to abandon night vigils. This gives them an additional headache: scope for theft of motor pump sets and other electrical gadgets and cables by miscreants. Danger also lurks for farmers while moving in the fields during 10.00 pm-2.00 am shift of power supply. In the last two years, five farmers had been killed in the attacks of wild elephants. At the same time, seven pachyderms were reported killed in the same region, due to infighting among the herds and electrocution in the fields. The last quarter of 2015 had witnessed the presence of large herds in the V.Kota and Ramakuppam mandals.Forest Range Officer (Kuppam), Kalappa Naidu, said all efforts were under way to prevent the man-animal conflict in the region, including strengthening of solar fencing, digging of elephant proof trenches and talks with the TN and Karnataka forest department officials, seeking their coordination in monitoring the movement of the wild elephants.Movement of the wild elephants between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon"

Most vendors seem to have realised that fewer customers, even if they are equipped with mobile wallets, will mean less business.Business has dried upYes, we embraced the idea and that is not something we should regret. But with daily, or even weekly payments, to be made at wholesale shops, and vegetables remaining unsold, it does come down to what we sell and how much we sell. It is not about how the money lands in my drawer or Paytm account. The fact is that business has dried up in the last month, said Irshad, a vegetable vendor.Since he had little money in the bank to begin with and no smartphone, Irshad shares his Paytm account with Kishan, a tomato seller. Interestingly, Kishan was among the first to opt for mobile wallets, a trend others were to follow.Kishan, meanwhile, considers himself to be in a better position as he deals in a single product and makes payments through cheques. But the Rs.25, 000 withdrawal cap is something he wishes would change as both Irshad and his payments come to the same account.Dip in prices adds to worryIrshad, however, is more worried about the prices of seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and carrots coming down even by normal winter standards. The urgency to replenish stocks or make fresh payments means he will have to sell vegetables at the wholesale price.Then there are those like Mithun and Jagat Pal Patel, who never opted for mobile wallets. However, they have their reasons for doing so. While Mr. Patel deals in onions and potatoes, which last longer than most vegetables, Mithun said that considering the small scale of his business, making a daily trip to the mandi where only cash works would make a mobile wallet a luxury."
