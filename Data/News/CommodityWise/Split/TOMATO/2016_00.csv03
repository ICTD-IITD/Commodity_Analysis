Onion prices also tumbled from Rs 80 per kg in August last year to Rs 8 per kg.The previous all-time high prices for tomato was Rs 100 a kg on July 27, 2014.The prices of tomatoes and onions have dropped due to rise in supply, making them the cheapest vegetables in the market.Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said: ""There had been poor supply from May to July that had led to rise in prices. But the supply has increased due to the revival of monsoon and the prices have decline.""""Farmers are bringing their produce to market in large quantities. Tomato and onions are the cheapest vegetables in the market now,"" said Aba Shevale, vegetable vendor.The average wholesale tomato price had touched Rs 7,000 per quintal in July at the Nashik APMC. On Wednesday, it has declined to Rs 700 per quintal.

It is the same old sad story for city residents, as the prices of essential pulses are showing an upward trend yet again. Hamish Gupta, a city-based retailer from Ghumar Mandi, says: ""Though prices have hiked suddenly, it's just a temporary phase. Generally, the prices of pulses are stable in nature. The recent price hike is mainly due to the advent of supermarkets and bulk buyers who create a shortage in the wholesale stock. Such demand creates a rise in prices for retailers.""""It's quite astonishing to see that cooking a meal of four with 'daal chawal' will cost me four times compared to cooking a dish of 'aloo matar' and 'saag'. There used to be time when veggie prices used to fluctuate, and then I used to opt for dal and pulses, but now the situation has reversed,"" says Rashmi Chadda, housewife from Kidwai Nagar. To this, another resident from SBS Nagar, Sushmita Kalra, adds: ""These days, three kg of peas (costing Rs40 per kg) is less than one kg pack of 'arhar dal'. The case is similar for other veggies, be it tomato (Rs40per kg), potato (Rs10 per kg) cauliflower and carrots (Rs15 per kg).

And one of Bapu's original disciples, Abdul Hamid Kureshi , 89 -the chair man of the Sabarmati Ashram - has enclosed a message in his death. Kureshi, who was also an eminent lawyer , chose to be cremated and not buried.Kureshi breathed his last at the breakfast table in his residence in Swastik Society, Navrangpura, on Saturday morning. Sabarmati Ashram was the cradle of Bapu's revolutionary ideas to win freedom from the British.It was a rare sight at the Mukti Dham crematorium in Paldi where Kureshi's illustrious family gathered for his final rites. Senior members of the higher judiciary and distinguished lawyers stood alongside the grieving family . Kureshi was the grandson of Imam Saheb Abdul Kadir Bawazir, a close associate of Bapu in South Africa.Bapu referred to Imam Bawazir as his ""sahodar"", brother born from the same mother.""Kureshi saheb wished to be cremated because he did not want to waste land with his burial,"" said Bharat Naik, the sonin-law of Kureshi's brother, Wahid Kureshi. ""In fact, he made me a witness to the decision in the presence of other family members."" Over the past four years, Kureshi had been reminding his son, Justice Akil Kureshi, and Naik that they should ensure he is cremated. He asserted that if anyone objected, the person should be told of his last wish.Kureshi was cremated after 7 pm.Kureshi was born in the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad where Imam Bawazir had settled with Bapu in 1915. Born in 1927, Kureshi grew up on Bapu's lap till Bapu embarked on the Dandi March in 1930. Kureshi was one of the few kids who ate tomato slices from Bapu's lunch. Bapu wrote letters to a young Kureshi, which were later donated to the National Archives of India.""Kureshi's father, Ghulam Rasool, was part of `Arun Tukdi' that walked ahead of the Dandi March procession,"" said Sabarmati Ashram director Tridip Suhrud. ""The team had to ensure that arrangements for meetings and halts were in place.""After Ghulam Rasool and his wife were arrested during the Dandi March, Abdul Hamid, his brother Wahid, and sister Sultana were brought up for a few years by Anasuya Sarabhai, said the secretary of the ashram, Amrut Modi. ""Sarabhai was a Gandhian and pioneer of women's labour movement in India,"" he said. Rizwan Kadri, an Ahmedabad-based historian, said that in September1942 Kureshi was arrested in Detroj during the Quit India movement.Kureshi became the chairman of the Sabarmati Ashram trust three years ago. A peace activist at heart, Kureshi worked to build bridges between Hindus and Muslims and penned a book titled "" Agnipariksha"" after the 1969 communal riots in Gujarat."

Markets were closed in most areas of the city, and the few that were open had three-day-old stocks.Vegetable prices are sky-high with tomato selling for Rs 80 per kg, while cauliflower sold for Rs 100 per kg, and green chillies reaching a high of Rs 200 per kg.An average increase of 10-15% was seen for most vegetables in the market.""There is one strike after another; first by the commission agents at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), and now by retailers. The result is the same and consumers have to pay more for poor quality vegetables as we have no option. No one concerned about us,"" Bhandarkar Road homemaker Rutuja Sawant said.A new resolution by the state government has passed the burden of six per cent paid to commission agents, who act as middlemen between farmers and retailers, to retailers who claim they have to bear other costs and paying the agents would leave them with nothing as profit.At a news conference in Mahatma Phule Mandai in the city, the retailers demanded that the role of commission agents be eliminated. They claim that getting rid of the commission agents and letting the farmers sell directly in the open market will benefit the retailers, farmers and the consumers.Accusing the government of not listening to them, Padmashree Patil, secretary of Swami Samarth Shetimaal Vyapari Sanghatna said, ""The standard procedure when you pass a law that affects various stakeholders is you speak to all of them. But the committee that made this recommendation had no representative from us, even though this affects our livelihood.""She also said that the government had not communicated with them even once after their strike started, although they have repeatedly sought time from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and guardian minister Girish Bapat.Claiming that the relationship of trust between the agents and the retailers had been eroded because of malpractices of the agents she added, ""The agents have permission to sell to only 2-3 retailers, but they sell to 7-8 of their own people. Their people get the cream of the crop, while we are given inferior quality produce.""Shivlal Bhosale, chairman of the Market Yard Commission Agents' Association, said, ""If some people say certain things, they don't hold any meaning. The law is what matters, and we function according to the law. Retailers are free to go to the fields and buy the produce from the farmers themselves. They won't have to pay commission then."""

The remaining 12 are safe and they will be discharged on Tuesday,"" Kodaikanal GH chief medical officer R Balaji told TOI.The students say they have been demanding better facilities and quality food, but no action has been taken by the government's backward class welfare department that runs the hostel.Mother Terasa Women's University was set up by former chief minister MGR to cater to the education needs of rural women. It is situated at Attuvampatti village, 10 km from Kodaikanal. The university also runs a college on its campus. A total of 850 students belonging to various districts, including Theni, Madurai, and Dharmapuri, study there.

If the food was said to be the reason for the illness, other students too would have suffered.""But the students differed. ""It is said the permitted student strength of the hostel is 50. Based on this there is one cook. But many more students have been accommodated in it. Besides, the hostel warden did not stay in the hostel. She comes only once in a week.

Based on their promise we relented. But the authorities have failed to fulfill their promise. Nothing has changed,"" said a student.""It is the authority which should redress the grievances. Our vice chancellor took the issue to the notice of the authority. We wanted them to limit the inmates' strength to 100, which will help to some extent.

""The people who come to buy from here are so happy that farmers are selling it to them,"" he says, amazed at the respect that is coming his way. So used to the wily ways of the middlemen at wholesale markets, Namdeo grows bitter even as he recalls those days. ""It was totally up to the 'dalal' what rates he will offer and how much quantity will he pick.""Buying her weekly requirement of vegetables from this market is homemaker Shanti Kothari. ""These are fresh, taste good and are very reasonably priced. These farmers weigh the vegetables correctly too. I make it a point to visit this market,"" she says.In what is proving to be a win-win situation for both the producer of farm commodity and the end buyer, weekly farmer's markets being organized by Nagpur division of Maharashtra State Marketing Board and also groups of food growers, is helping farmers to regain their confidence. Forced to sell their produce for even Rs1 to 2 per kg in the wholesale markets like Kalmana, the farmers are now getting to sell fresh farm produce for Rs25 to Rs28 per kg. ""We take an average of the prices that are existing in Kalmana, and Gokulpeth which is a retail market,"" says Suhas Kale, district marketing manager. ""This way whatever premium was being earned by the middlemen is now going to the farmer,"" he says.Around 1,500 farmers from Katol, Gondia, Bhandara, Karanja, Saoner, Paradsinga have joined this initiative. Nearly 22 varieties of vegetables and commodities like linseed, tur dal, rice, golden berry along with vegetables are being sold. ""We have set up two other similar organizations in Gondia and Bhandara,"" says Kale. The farmers have also tied up with various hotels and caterers in the city, so whatever remains after three to four hours of selling is sold in bulk to these commercial establishments, adds Kale.So far, the two markets are held on Sundays at Lendra Park in Ramdaspeth and at Ravi Nagar on Thursdays. Efforts are on to set up one at Ram Nagar too. The effort has had a very positive impact on the farmers, says Sachin Chopde, deputy general manager, marketing. ""Their confidence levels have gone up tremendously. They are getting a direct feedback from the customers about the quality of their product which helps to learn and improve,"" he says.Some farmers have also taken an initiative by approaching people through WhatsApp groups and social media. ""Being a vegetable grower can be very disheartening,"" says Suresh Bhattad, a farmer with 12 acres of land near Nagpur. ""Inspite of bumper production of tomato, I suffered a total loss as I would sell in wholesale market at Rs2 for a kg. After deducting the cost of transportation, I was getting barely 50 paise on one kg, whereas brokers in the market were pocketing huge amounts,"" says Bhattad, who then made an effort to sell it directly by posting messages on WhatsApp. It's been just 25 days since he started getting his produce to the city, which includes bottle gourd, tomato and brinjals. ""People are happy with what we bring but are now asking for a larger variety,"" says Bhattad.Another group of 400 farmers is also selling their produce through a permanent outlet at Lendra Park, Ramdaspeth. ""The biggest advantage of direct selling is that previously during season time I would sell tomatoes for Rs3 per kg. Today I sell them at Rs20 round the year,"" says Sudhakar Kubde, who has a farm near Kalmeshwar where 17 varieties of vegetables are grown. ""My annual income has doubled from Rs1.5 lakh to Rs3.5 lakh in one year,"" says Kubde.""I was curious after receiving a message for buying farm fresh veggies,"" says Dr Kirti Jaiswal, now a regular customer of these farmers. ""The products were amazingly tasty, fresh and had a longer shelf life. I was surprised to see how politely they would speak to the customers,"" say Jaiswal, who convinced her neighbours at MHADA Colony near Bole petrol pump to also buy from these farmers. ""The fact that this helps the poor farmer to get a fair deal is enough for me to buy from them,"" adds Sonal Barde, a busy entrepreneur.More than the farmer, it is the consumer who should be taking up this movement, feels Vasant Futane a farmer from Warud. ""The direct markets help in forming a relationship between the farmer and the consumer. This way both get sensitive to each other's needs,"" says Futane, who doesn't need to bring his produce to the city as he has a large chain of buyers who contact him directly."

Fish ladders are a series of pools built like steps to enable fish to ascend a dam and enable them to migrate upstream over or through a barrier. The ladders will enable the fish to cross the dam and breed further up the river.Bharti is on record as saying once that happens, the fish, considered a delicacy in East India, will be available in the Ganga in regions as far as even the Chambal in MP and UP, as was the case in the past. Indeed, till the time the Farakka barrage was built in 1975, hilsa which only breeds in fresh water travelled hundreds of kilometres inland to breed. The building of the barrage barred their migration.The hilsa is now like a fish out of water in the Ganga. ""Gone are the days when we relished the choicest preparations of hilsa, which is revered as 'machher rani' (queen of fishes), amid monsoon spells. It is a thing of the past. Today, we can't afford this luxury and have to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 for a kg of fish,"" laments Gauri Das (75), a resident of Bengali Tola area in Varanasi.The last time Das bought hilsa was three years ago on a special occasion. Recalling the old days, when it was available in abundance in the markets, she said, ""Dishes like Shorshe Ilish (hilsa cooked in mustard paste) and Bhapa Ilish (steamed hilsa with chilly mustard paste) were common in Bengali households. Today, we are yearning for hilsa."" Those were the days before the Farakka barrage was built and the hilsa travelled long distances upstream.Das was elated at the thought that hilsa could be fished locally in the Ganga waters in the coming days. "" Sotti! Eta hobe?"" (Really! Would it happen?),"" she wondered with her wide open eyes. ""Hilsa is cooked in a number of ways,"" she said, adding that it can be fried, cooked in spicy tomato or ginger-based gravy (jhol), or mustard-based with green chillies (shorshe batar jhal). It can also be cooked with posto, doi (curd), seasonal vegetables, and steamed inside of plantain or butternut squash leaves."

And if you relish the flavours of piping hot tomato soups, then the latest trend is a tempting option. Souping or an all-soup diet is catching up with individuals looking to shed some kilos and cleanse their system.Typically a three-day routine, souping involves replacing lunch and dinner meals with a bowl of fresh, homemade soup. ""The diet plan includes soups coupled with a bowl of boiled vegetables, fruits, nuts or sprouts. Packaged soups aren't allowed,"" says Suhasini Viswanathan, dietitian, Qua Nutrition.While oil cannot be used, the soups can have a little salt, pepper and herbs. "" Adding a piece of ginger or garlic is advisable for delicate stomachs. The diet doesn't include dairy products, eggs, sugar and non-vegetarian dishes,"" says Suhasini, adding that one portion of cabbage soup is a must.Experts say souping is helpful as it adds a lot of fibre, water, vitamins and minerals to the fare. But certain soups must be avoided. ""Clear soups aren't recommended as they have few calories and can increase the appetite,"" says consultant dietitian Dr Dharini Krishnan, adding that high-calorie creamy soups are off the menu too. Pre-diabetics, diabetics and those on medication must refrain from following this diet as they require planned meals with sufficient carbohydrates after medication.Following the diet has had mixed outcomes. Some people have lost weight and felt `lighter' while others have returned to their cheesy burgers. ""I lost two kilos after trying it with professional guidance as the diet was tailored to my needs,""says Krithika Vidyasagar, who tried the routine recently .The all-soup diet is replacing its juice counterpart as it is considered healthier. ""Juicing adds vitamin C, potassium and some fibre but in souping, the diet has more nutrients,"" says Dr Dharini.However, like any dietary fad, this too can land you in a soup.Giving up on your cravings may help you lose some fat, but a sudden dietary shift is unhealthy. ""People develop nutritional deficiencies when their intake doesn't involve supplements. Mood swings, headaches, exhaustion, and a constant craving for food are common side-effects,"" says Dr Kousalya Nathan, lifestyle and anti-ageing consultant, Apollo Nova Hospital. She adds that a nutritionist's consultation is crucial.It is also essential to keep a watch over one's diet even after the souping detox to maintain weight. ""Diets restricted to one food group, like vegetables, can be followed for a short period as they can cause nutritional imbalances in the long run,"" says Dr Dharini."

""Though minimum temperature came down to 3-4C, people did not feel the chill because day temperatures remained around 22-24C,"" he added.Wadood said a low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal and western disturbance are causing upper air cyclonic circulation in the northwestern part of the country. ""These two wind system act as limiting factor for each other and the western disturbance is likely to indirectly affect the weather in this part,"" Wadood said.IMD observation shows a wind confluence over central India and a fresh western disturbance as an upper air system would affect western Himalayan region from Monday.Rainfall in isolated parts of Jharkhand has been predicted for Sunday and Monday whereas the state is likely to get scattered rainfall on Tuesday with warning for hailstorm in some parts.However, Wadood said that the rain will not impact the crops much but if hailstones are there, vegetables would be damaged considerably.

That's right: In a city notorious for being on snooze mode until 11am, Keshav Mankar manages to get people out of their beds at the crack of dawn.He views the adulation with a mixture of bemusement and pride. He took over the shop in 1991 after the death of his father Jayram, who had set up the business in 1974. ""He sold misal, batata wada and poha,"" Keshav remembers. For many years, Keshav and his brother Ashok would sell batata vada and poha. A few years ago, they stopped selling the vada. ""Fights would break out between customers over who would get it first. Tarri would be flung on shirts. It happened once too often and our landlord gave us an ultimatum,"" Mankar recalls, his matter-of-fact tone banishing any comical vada war images forming in one's mind.So, what's the secret recipe of the tarri that's worth fighting for? ""Onions, ginger, garlic, tomato (not a lot), red chilli powder, garam masala, coriander powder,"" Mankar rattles off. The most ingredient, however, seems to be oil. ""For 2kg of watana, I use 2.5kg oil,"" he says. The tarri is enough for 10kg of poha. Mankar does all the cooking himself 'to ensure that the quality remains exactly the same.'The oft-quoted factoid that he goes for his job at a school or college after closing the shop is a rumour, he says, adding that that even though he does business for less than two hours, the preps and cleaning up take up the remaining part of the day. ""I go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 4am,"" he says, complaining that the younger generation is just not ready for this kind of dedication. He's 57 and he says he can go on for 10 more years at most. ""I don't think my sons will carry on the business,"" he says.Note to fans: Eat all you can while it lasts."
