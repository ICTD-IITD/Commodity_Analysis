SM Deshmukh, assistant commissioner, FDA, Kolhapur said, ""Besides using palm oil for making food, they were also continuously reheating it, which is dangerous to health.""All the charges are finalised after the inspection report was shown to the officials present at the food outlets and hotels and after their confirmation.A copy of the notice is being served on the outlets and hotels.A notice issued on January 7 reads that a fastfood outlet had not displayed the board declaring what type of oil is being used for cooking. It was violation of the very first condition of licence under the Food Security and Standards Act 2006.Continuous heating and reheating of oil leads to formation of trans-fatty acids, which is dangerous to health.This is also in violation of the Schedule 4 of part 5 of regulation II-3 (j) of the Food Security and Standards Act 2006, the notice states. A copy of the notice is with the TOI.In case of a multinational outlet that boasts about its high standards of hygiene and cleanliness, the report says that it has not kept the document certifying that the packing material used by them is of food grade quality. Hence, there are doubts about the quality of the packing material.The food serving trays were kept near cleaning and sanitary equipment; edible and non-edible items were stored very close to each other in the store rooms.As per the Act, there has to be sufficient distance between such items. The dust bins in the kitchen had no cover, while raw food items like tomatoes were kept in the open at the entrance of the kitchen.The notice was served on the food outlet on January 7 and it was given 21 days to respond.The notice also states that the outlets and hotels have to comply with the recommendations and submit a report accordingly.If any party fails to do so, it may lose its licence, Deshmukh said.A former mayor who owns the property of one of the hotels under scrutiny confirmed that his hotel has received a notice from the FDA. He said, ""I owned the property but it is being managed by another group. The issues raised are minor such as cleanliness and covering some items properly. We will comply with it and submit the report.""Cleanliness, use of packed items past expiry most common violations: In most of the cases, the FDA officials have said that cleanliness, use of package food items that have crossed expiry dates are the common violations. ""If the operators fail to comply with our recommendations, then we will lodge complaints with the adjudicating officer in Pune, which may impose fines as high as Rs 2 lakh on the hotels."""

58f17c86a3d24b245e59ac55,"CBSE says ‘no’ to samosa, kachori in school canteens",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/CBSE-says-no-to-samosa-kachori-in-school-canteens/articleshow/50489857.cms,2016-01-08,,The Times Of India,"Nagpur: CBSE wants its schools to strike off food items like samosas and kachoris from canteen menus and offer children healthier options. Though the latest letter to schools is not the first time CBSE has raised this issue, the urgency and seriousness is prodded by a central government report slamming the ""easy availability"" of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) in school canteens. The report, prepared by a working group constituted by ministry of women and child development (MCD), has suggested a complete ban on HFSS not only inside campus but also within a 200 meter periphery (during school hours).Stepping up pressure on schools, CBSE secretary Joseph Emmanuel on Thursday wrote that ""it is expected that all schools affiliated to CBSE will take the necessary measures"". While the board has not mentioned what penal action it will take against erring schools, the letter's tone clearly suggests that it means business. Schools have been asked to constitute a School Canteen Management Committee (SCMC), which will take charge of menu preparation. Emmanuel wrote that the SCMC should have ""about 7-10 members including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators. The committee will coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food available to students in the school"".The MCD report said child obesity is one of the biggest concerns in India and suggested that ""incorporation of healthy snacks needs to be right at the top of the agenda and intensive intervention should be undertaken by the government along with active involvement of parents, teachers and community as a whole"".Well-known city-based paediatrician Dr Rajiv Mohta agrees, saying, ""Healthy eating is a lifestyle and that has to be practised by parents, which eventually children will follow. Once in school, the availability of food items can be controlled and snacks like poha, upma etc should be made available. Even when serving idli, sambar dal must be compulsorily mixed so that it's a perfect combination of carbs and proteins."" Even the MCD report suggests that the above mentioned items along with cutlet, stuffed paratha, dalia, pulao etc can be introduced as healthy options on the menu.Schools too welcomed CBSE's push in this regard and accepted that they have a key role to play. Sumathi Venugopalan, principal of Centre Point School (Wardhaman Nagar), said, ""It is possible to implement this change in schools because if we don't provide unhealthy snacks students will not buy it. There are a variety of options available in Indian cuisine, so it shouldn't be difficult to substitute unhealthy options with healthier ones.""Akhilesh Chaturvedi, principal of Delhi Public School, said, ""This option is feasible and we are trying to implement this in our school by banning such items from our canteen. We do not promote the consumption of unhealthy snacks but if students bring those items from home, we can't possibly check lunch boxes of all students.""IS Tuli, director of Edify School, said, ""It is practically not possible to ban all unhealthy options, but we can control them. Heeding the advice of CBSE, we have hired a caterer and by doing this we give our students homemade snacks, which are more beneficial for their health.""Shashikala Naidu, principal of Jain Heritage school, said, ""It is an extremely positive step taken by CBSE because children today practically live on junk food. We confiscate any junk the students carry, so that at least for the majority of their day they stay away from unhealthy choices.""Ensuring that snacks prepared in canteen are not only healthy but appealing is key according to Bharti Bijwe, principal of Sandipani School. ""Presentation also matters a lot so we make nutritious food look appealing and children are attracted to it and also enjoy it thoroughly.""FOOD CHANGEHIT LISTChips, fried foodsSherbets, ice golas, soft beverages including sweetened carbonated and non-carbonated beveragesSweets like rasagulla, gulabjamun, pedha, kalakandReady to eat noodles, pizzas, burgers, tikka, gol gappasAll types of chewing gum and candiesSweets composed of more than 30 per cent sugar like jalebi, imarti, boondi etcPlain chocolates, including dark chocolateAll confectionary itemsCakes and biscuitsBuns and pastriesJams and jelliesEAT LISTMulti/whole wheat roti/paratha stuffed with seasonal vegetableRice, vegetable pulao and dalVegetable pulaoRice & black chanaWheat halwa with black chanaSweet dalia & namkeen vegetable daliaRice & white chanaRice and rajmahKadhi chawalBulgar wheat upma or khichri / greens and dal kootu, payasam, papaya/tomato/eggTamarind rice/greens kootu with dal /balahar payasam, papaya/tomato/green gramDal rice, greens and dal kootu, balahar payasam, papaya/tomato, Bengal gramRice, sambarIdli, wada, sambarSambar and riceKheer, phirni, milk and milk products like curd, butter milk, lassi (low sugar)Vegetable upmaVegetable sandwichVegetable khichriCoconut water, shikanji, jaljeera etc(Inputs by Nidhi Thakur)"

Prices of several vegetables are down by as much as 50% in the wholesale markets. Retail markets, too, reflected the decrease.This, say traders, is because of the rich harvest in the state and neighbouring regions.More than 300 lorry loads of vegetables are pouring into the Koyambedu wholesale market every day compared to the 250 lorries that were coming in a day two weeks ago.Broad beans, which cost `Rs 50 a kg two weeks ago fell to `Rs 30 a kg and the price of a kg of cabbage had dropped from `Rs 20 to `10, said V R Soundararajan, advisor to the market association in Koyambedu However, the price of toma toes, the most sought after vegetable, only dropped by a mere `Rs 5kg from ` Rs 30kg.The price, however, is ex pected to drop further, said M Saravanan, a wholesale tra der, adding that farmers in Karnataka's Mulbagal region, the main source od supply to the city , had reaped a rich tomato crop this time.Green peas, which had soared to `150kg, fell by more han half to `70kg, while the cost of cauliflower, popular during this period, dropped o `25kg from `35 kg, he said. The prices are expected to remain stable for another month, traders said.Such a decrease in prices s usual for this period due to he increase in production, hey added.""We have a wide range of vegetables available in the market and in enough quan ity,"" said Soundararajan.The city gets carrot, beans, beetroot, cauliflower, radish, broad beans and chowchow from Karnataka, brin al, ladies finger (okra), bit er gourd and snake gourd from Dindigul, Kodaikanal and Kumbakonam.Lima beans, which are available only during January , come to the city from Tiruvanamalai, Gudiyatam, Kancheepuram and Andhra Pradesh.Restaurant owners admitted to a drop in prices. R Anil, manager of a restaurant in Nungambakkam, said, ""Prices keep fluctuating and we cannot raise the prices when prices of vegetables go up. Since the last few days prices of vegetables like peas has come down.""Residents, however, said the decrease in retail prices was marginal.""The price of cauliflower per flower was `25kg at Koyambedu but I had to shell out `40 at a retail shop today,"" said Sarika Benjamin, a home maker in Kilpauk."

""Under the smart city mission, we are working on framing bylaws to make city terraces green. We picked this cue from some foreign countries where partially covering the rooftops of new buildings with plants or solar panels is a must. We are planning to replicate the same in Jaipur,"" says Ashutosh Pednekar, chief executive officer (CEO), JMC.Some demonstrations on how to grow vegetables on rooftops have already been done at JMC headquarters here.For this, what is required is a plant-growing kit comprising light-fibre `grow bags'. A variety of vegetables, including leafy ones, tomatoes, brinjal and chillies can be grown on the terrace with the help of the kit. ""We have received a proposal from six companies so far out of which three have started the demonstration process. Other companies that are interested are welcome.We will award the work to the company we find is best-suited,"" said a senior JMC official.The official further said a variety of vegetables, including leafy ones, tomatoes, brinjal and chillies can be grown on the terrace with the help of the kit, which is available in the market.As of now, the vegetables consumed in the city are fed by the `polluted' waters of Dravyavati river. ""There is no use of chemicals or pesticides for home-grown vegetables. Organic methods will be used for this green endeavour. We are also planning to rope in consultants to guide people on this. Besides, we are considering subsidy to residents who would be growing vegetables at home,"" the official said.""The cost of a `grow bag' depends on its size. The cost of a 6X10 feet bag is about Rs 15,000,"" the official said."

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchThanks a lot. Thank you very much."

This has affected the quality and quantity of vegetable and fruit crops.Heavy showers and lack of sunlight has led to discolouring of the veggies and fruits, their nutrient levels have also dropped and the size and shape has also been affected.Moreover, the bad weather has led to huge losses to the farming community as most of their produce has got spoilt and had to be thrown away.The change in rainfall pattern has also affected the consumers who have to pay more for the vegetables and fruits. The prices of cabbage and cauliflower have almost doubles. While the price of cabbage was Rs 20 and cauliflower was Rs 15 till last week, this week the rates have gone up to Rs 40 and Rs 30, respectively.""The prices had to be increased as the demand is high and the produce is low. Even the prices of tomato, onion and chilli has doubled. The rate of coriander has soared by over 200%. A bunch of coriander which was sold at Rs 20 or Rs 10 for a bunch till just a week back is now being sold at Rs 60 to Rs 70. The reason for the increase in rate is that these vegetables get spoilt soon and we have to make special arrangements to store them till the fresh stock arrives,"" said a vendor Kamlesh Singh.While the retail prices have gone up, the cost of vegetables at the APMC market has decreased. ""Though the production has not been hit till now, the continuous rains have affected the produce and quality of crops. Everyday, around 100 to 150 trucks carrying vegetables are unloaded at the APMC market. But the prices of leafy vegetables have shot up by almost 200%,"" said secretary of Kalyan's APMC market Yashwant Patil.Due to the hike, many farmers at the weekly market at Gaodevi have stopped selling vegetables like methi, palak and coriander."

Water scarcity has affected production, thus affecting inflow into the city. The upward spiral of prices is likely to prevail for at least a month. The quality of vegetables available, however, has largely been unaffected.While tomatoes are selling for as much as Rs 60 per kg in some parts, prices of beans, cluster beans, lemons, green chillies, ginger and garlic too are skyrocketing. French beans are selling for a whopping Rs 150 per kg in many area. Kitchen regulars like ladyfingers, brinjal, cauliflower, bitter gourd and bottle gourd are commanding at least 30% more than their usual rates.Officials of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee attributed the the surge in prices to diminished supply from regions supplying to Pune.Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section, estimates that inflow of vegetables has dropped by almost half. Warning of a further hike in prices, he said, ""Most vegetables reach us from Nashik and Karnataka and the drought and water scarcity is wreaking havoc on the farms. The inflow is unlikely to increase for at least a month, till the monsoon sets in and farmers are able to reap more abundant produce.""Supply of vegetables sourced from within Pune district has not not been affected as much as that from Solapur or Satara, said Amol Tambe, cofounder of a company selling agricultural produce at farm rates in the city. ""Farmers in Solapur are really strapped for water, which is supplied just twice a week. The situation is similar in Satara district, from where Pune gets its beans. There is a sharp drop in output and this demand-supply gap is causing the prices to escalate,"" he said.Prices have gone up more in the last two weeks, said Anup Gupta, a retailer on Sus Road, who admits that his sale has largely remained unaffected. ""Tomato prices have shot up since the week began. Prices of most other vegetables, too, have increased more in the last two weeks. The drought has affected production everywhere and limited stock is reaching the wholesale market every day,"" he added.Customers have no option but to buy vegetables at the prevailing rates, Pashan resident Varsha Vora said. ""I have a family of four. Rates have changed drastically since Sunday when I last bought vegetables. Tomatoes are an essential for all types of cooking so we are helpless about the prices, which keep oscillating for some or the other reason,"" she said.The rising prices of vegetables have the residents of Pimpri Chinchwad worried too. Sunita Deshpande, a resident of Pradhikaran, said, ""I bought vegetables on Wednesday and found tomatoes to be the only item to be a little overpriced at Rs 40/kg. Most of the other vegetables are in the usual range of Rs 60/kg. Thankfully, onion prices are keeping low so that balances things out."""

Actually, most of us are obsessed by the colour of our skin and tanned appearance is actually not liked by many. So, when I noticed my skin getting dull and ugly, I made it a point to visit the parlour on regular interval.""Rahul Tiwari, owner of a unisex salon on Boring road, says, ""Every day around 20 customers are visiting our parlour just to get the skin treatment and, at least, half of them are men. These people mostly go for de-tan treatment and then whitening facial. The cost varies with the product,"" For one treatment, which also includes a facial, starts at Rs2,500 and goes up to Rs4,500. Many go for a package, which has three or four treatments and it helps them save around Rs2,000. He advises people to take treatment at 15 days interval for a better result.Those who cannot afford the expensive facial, could simply go for de-tan face pack, which is available in the Rs300 to Rs600 range.Anju, who has been a practising beautician for the last 20 years, says the facial after de-tan treatment is a good way to relax and pamper oneself. ""In facial, we give different services, which include cleansing, scrubbing, massaging, applying serum and pack. It is done for 60 to 70 minutes and it lightens the skin colour and removes the dust particles deposited in the pores.""Meghna Rajvanshi, a beautician at a unisex salon on Fraser Road, points out how men have outnumbered women recently in her parlour. ""Gone are the days when only women were obsessed with their skin colour and texture. Now, men, too, are rushing to beauty salon for better looks,"" she said.Meghna, apart from a practising beautician, is also doing research in Ayurveda. ""Those who have time can prepare their face pack at home with natural ingredients. For example, mix half tomato with two drops of lemon and half papaya and smash them properly. Then apply this pack on face and massage for ten minutes with the finger tips. Leave this pack for two more minutes and rinse them with plain water. Another pack could also be prepared with egg white, milk powder and lemon. After applying this, leave it for ten minutes and make sure that while the pack is on the face, do not talk. Later on, rinse it with lukewarm water gently in upward direction,"" she said."

The reason for such high rates for the green chilli is lesser produce arriving in the market  a mere 25 truckloads came in APMC market this week, lesser than the usual 40 trucks. Many retail chains and supermarkets have already run short of green chilli.Experts attributed the hike to scanty supply from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, as production was hampered due to unseasonal rains.

Called 'rural tourism' or 'community tourism', the activity is about living the farmland life for a day or two, where you actually learn to drive a tractor, plant crops and harvest some, too! Say hello to the farm escape that's giving folks an insight into local village life, food and more...Plenty! And it's like a complete return to nature. The idea of just going on a nature trail, having breakfast with butterflies, sleeping in a wooden hut and learning ways to save the environment has caught on. Says Rashmi Sawant of an enterprise dedicated to promoting sustainable rural tourism. ""Citygoers are now looking at leisure breaks that offer offbeat activities. Most travel for aesthetic purposes, which may not really teach you much. But connecting with a local experience like this satisfies the soul. They get a feel of community activities in a rural atmosphere and this makes for an unforgettable memory.""Visitors to such farms also pay a visit to the local cashew and other plantations, they can bathe a buffalo, spend time with rural home-makers, go fishing, visit paddy fields and even have lunch with a potter! What's very popular, especially with kids is to try rangoli and garland making as well as see the pinguli (puppetry) performances.

There are waterfalls here even in summer, one learns. Founder Hemant Chhabra says it's quite the antidote to the gadget-hungry crowd. ""More people are opening to a pure honest hands-on farm experience as it is so different,"" says Chhabra. Society folk can live the rural life here  learning to bake bricks, weave bamboo baskets and pick vegetables for the daily meal. ""At a mental level people want to experience what a farmer's life is all about  right from farming, to cooking the food in the right way so as to get the highest nurition from the soil and more, plus on another level it touches the five senses.""Farms like this also grow their own crops and prepare fresh frood using them. One can relish fresh nautral traditonal Indian foods here like bhakri, unpolished rice and local chutneys like khurasini (made of a nut) or even til chutney. A big part of the fun is to harvest fruits. ""Families love to go fruit-picking,"" says Chhabra. ""They pick chikoos and bananas (20 varieties are grown here) as well as apples, starfruit and cherries. They also plant seasonal palak, ambat chuk (sour spinach) and local tomatoes."""

The huge scarcity created a sudden surge in demand and retail vendors queued up at his vehicle to purchase his tomatoes. On seeing the direct sale to retailers, wholesale dealers stayed out of the picture.He sold his tomatoes at Rs 650 per 10 kgs, up from the usual rate of around Rs 400 for the same quantity. In the retail market, the price touched Rs 80/kg and it could well shoot up to Rs 100.Usually, the Belagavi vegetable market depends on Karad tomatoes in summer because of decrease in tomato production in the region. However, the Ghataprabha riparian belt, especially villages coming under Gokak and Hukkeri taluks, produce vegetables in summer but this time, the output fell drastically due to the drying up of the Ghataprabha river.Salim Hanchinamani, a wholesale vegetable dealer who supplies vegetables to Goa, said, ""For the past week, the price of tomatoes has been going up triggered by the scarcity. Tomatoes from Karad and Satara region have stopped arriving here. On Sunday, Vishwas Sankapal came with his first produce and was able to cash in on it."""

""The advantage of textiles is they already have a 3D structure so they are great at absorbing light, which in turn speeds up the process of degrading organic matter,"" Rajesh Ramanathan from RMIT University said.The researchers, including Dipesh Kumar and Vipul Bansal, also from RMIT University, worked with copper and silver-based nanostructures, which are known for their ability to absorb visible light. When the nanostructures are exposed to light, they receive an energy boost that creates ""hot electrons."" These release a burst of energy that enables the nanostructures to degrade organic matter.The challenge for researchers has been to bring the concept out of the lab by, working out how to build these nanostructures on an industrial scale and permanently attach them to tex tiles. The team's approach was to grow the nanostructures directly onto the textiles by dipping them into a few solutions, resulting in the development of stable nanostructures within just 30 minutes.When exposed to light, it took less than six minutes for some of the nano-enhanced textiles to spontaneously clean themselves.""Our next step will be to test our nano-enhanced textiles with organic compounds that could be more relevant to consumers, to see how quickly they can handle common stains like tomato sauce or wine,"" Ramanathan said.The research was published in the journal Advanced Materials Interfaces."

And they are all spread out as offering at the Jagannath Temple in Hauz Khas. The Saturday evening aarti is in progress. A group of priests are chanting hymns. Devotees stand reverentially in attendance with folded hands, some with eyes closed. Outside on the terrace, the sounds of mridang, jhaanj and bells ring loud and clear.The setting is perfect for an intersection of food and faith - where every morsel nourishes the body, purifies the soul. And that is what the latest edition of Times Passion Temple Food Trail is all about.Raj Jain, CEO Times Group , put the concept of food trail in perspective. He said that the role of a newspaper is not just to ""talk politics"" but also help everyone ""understand our heritage and culture"". The temple food trail was born out of this idea to provide a platform where everyone could do so, he said.Renowned food historian Pushpesh Pant, who's involved with the initiative as an Experience Architect for the participants, explained the concept of chhappan bhog or mahaprasad.He said that the concept came from the simple mathematical calculation of seven days a week and eight prahars, a three-hour period. He dwelt at length on the 17th chapter of Gita where food is discussed in detail. Pant said that the prasad is satvik in nature with no chillies, potatoes, tomatoes, onion or garlic. ""The prasad is for everyone,"" Pant said referring to its egalitarian character.Some items on the Chhappan bhog list are: dahi bara, peeta, khachudi, khaja, puri, dalma, khua, moog dali and papudi.The participants in the temple food trail also visit temples in Mathura, Vrindavan, Jaipur and Nathdwara. ""In Mathura too, the prasad is called 56 bhog but has a predominance of the madhur ras. The emphasis there is on sweets,"" Pant said. He also pointed out that the nature of the offering changes with the geography of the land.Ravindernath Pradhan, secretary, Sri Nilachal Seva Sangh, spoke at length about the challenges in organizing the event. ""The preparation for the chhappan bhog started around 3am and was over only by 7pm. In all, it took about 16 hours,"" he said. A six member team came especially from Jagannath Temple, Puri to prepare the mahaprasad. ""Satvik bhojan guides us our mind and body in the right direction,"" said Manoj Kumar Mahapatra, a senior member of the team.Akrita Kalra, who's participating in trail, said that the evening felt like ""the discovery of a whole new world. ""Even looking at the varieties of offering before the Lord was a feast for the eyes. One got a sense of fulfillment just by looking at it,"" said Kalra, an education counselor by profession.Another participant Smita Dugar said that listening to Pushpesh Pant on food was like hearing a voice right out of a history book. ""I am a pure vegetarian and being a food consultant as well, I wanted to learn about temple food, its origins and history. Mr Pant puts everything in perspective,"" said Dugar."

Blame it on shortage owing to the drought-like conditions or the recent traders and commission agents' strike, supply of fruits and veggies in the city has been affected. Plus, the common man has to bear the brunt of the proceedings. Taking cue from all this, a growing number of Puneites are increasingly turning to home gardening, an organic way of life, in order to rely less on the market.It's been four years since Sunita Gaikwad, a retired teacher, stopped heading out for her daily requirement of fruits and vegetables. ""Prices were escalating even then. That's when I decided to turn to home growing produce,"" said Sunita, who converted her 2000-sqft terrace into a garden. From coriander and chillies to fruits like pomegranates and figs, Sunita's garden is home to a variety of produce. She's found difference in quality and taste while cooking with home-grown produce. ""Besides the obvious joy of eating from one's own garden, the vegetables are fresher and high on taste, sans pesticides,"" said Sunita, who sources good-quality seeds from a local nursery, at a minimal cost.If you thought growing at home is only possible with the luxury of a sprawling space, think again. Anuradha Sawhney, a resident of Uday Baug, achieves similar results in a small space. ""For my food service, my focus was on using organic ingredients. I was never sure if what was availalbe in the market was organic,"" said Anuradha, who turned to growing produce in her limited terrace space. Learning to use the limited space was a challenge. But she adopted methods like vertical gardening and 'living pots'. ""It's a myth that space is a constraint. One needs to use what's available, effectively. I grow everything, from capsicum, asparagus, rajma and spinach, to the exceptionally hot bhut jolokia chilli,"" she added.Individuals turning to home gardening isn't new in town, but several housing societies have taken to gardening in community. For Nina Shah and Kalpana Lapsiya, residents of NIBM area, the idea of a common terrace garden happened by chance. ""Our major need was to minimise the wet garbage being generated daily. After necessary permission, we initiated the pilot project on our building terrace first,"" said Kalpana. The building members began generating vermicompost from their wet garbage in the 25 odd bins provided by the society and local corporator. When seeds in the wet garbage began germinating, they decided to use the facility to grow produce. ""We've grown brinjal, tomatoes, curry leaves and lemon grass and fruits like mangoes, papaya and jamun. The process was however hampered by the drought. We are tying up with an NGO that will provide basic training and a volunteer who'll monitor the compost generation daily and will resume work soon,"" Kalpana added.Today, there's nothing one can't learn online. But just last week, a group of city gardening enthusiasts, met at Kamala Nehru Park near Deccan Gymkhana, to share gardening tips and exchange plant seeds and cuttings. ""Our online group that started this year has over 90 members from Pune alone. We felt the need to meet in person because there's much to learn from each other in practice, beyond the photos and links online,"" shared Sadhana Sarpotdar, who spearheaded the meet of over 20 members.Besides sharing tips and exchanging seeds, gardening expert Ashok Marathe shared insights on the kinds of produce that could be home grown. ""Every meet now will be dedicated to training members to become better gardeners. The meet next month will focus on effective vermiculture,"" Sadhana added. ""Gone are days when growing at home was restricted to few people. With access to knowledge online, anyone can start off now. Many people I know grow their own produce. Whenever we meet, we also exchange seeds or cuttings. Chat groups to guide each other have also gained pace,"" Anuradha added.Not just individuals, but city chefs also rely on home-grown produce. For Tanuj Sinha and Swati Jindal, who run a meal kit service, quality and freshness are key. ""We source ingredients like lemon and mint from friends into home gardening. Besides these, we rely on larger enterprises for other farm-fresh supply,"" said Tanuj, adding that space is the only reason they haven't started growing their own produce yet, but they are open to the idea in future. Now running a pure vegan service, Anuradha continues to grow Thai basil and spearmint that find place in her recipes. Chef Ajmer Singh, a city bistro chef-incharge, also goes for produce from his herb garden, for sheer freshness sans any harmful pesticides. ""Growing herbs like thyme and rosemary isn't difficult. They require the right amount of water and sunlight,"" he shared.Growing produce at home works on the lines of zero budget farming, say these enthusiasts. ""There's minimal expenditure as compared to yield. Seeds are reasonable and kitchen waste serves as an ideal fertiliser that I then blend in with coco peat and cow dung,"" shared Wanowrie-based Prescilla Braggs, who recently turned to home growing produce. Besides pureeing and introducing vegetable and kitchen waste into plants as a fertiliser, Anuradha suggests that some everyday items, like white vinegar, neem and turmeric are effective pesticides. ""One does not need huge earthen pots that cost money and take up space. Sturdy gunny bags can do the job,"" said Anuradha."

Unable to marry her because his wife was not granting him divorce, he hatched a plot to bump her off.In late 2009, Dedhia, who then lived in Meghchhaya Apartments, Lalbaug, with his parents, wife and son, was led to Hasruddin Malik, a tomato vendor, by a vegetable vendor, Rajnikant Wagh. Malik, in turn, made him meet Nazim Khan, a taxi driver. On October 4, Dedhia, Malik and Khan met at Lalbaug and worked out the particulars of the conspiracy. Malik and Khan were to carry out the killing. The amount offered for the 'supari' was Rs 1 lakh.Early morning on October 27, Dedhia prodded Beena to go on their usual walk. Around 5.30am, Malik and Khan, who were on a motorcycle, with Khan riding pillion, attacked Beena. She was stabbed on the neck, but afraid that she may not succumb to her injury, Dedhia told Khan to finish the job properly. Khan then stabbed Beena twice in the stomach. Jitendra made himself suffer minor injuries and made the crime look like an incident of chain snatching horribly gone wrong. The police initially probed the chain snatching angle, but about a month later received information that the murder was contract killing (after solving the case, the police said that three previous attempts had been made on Beena's life).On December 17, 2009, acting on a tip-off, the crime branch arrested Khan, who used to live in Vijay Nagar, Antop Hill. The police said that during interrogation, he revealed the name of Malik. It was Malik who spilled the beans on the conspiracy.Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian told TOI that the clinching evidence was Dedhia's call data records, which showed that he had contacted the killers half an hour before the attack, telling them about the area of the morning walk. She said what sealed the case was the recovery of the murder weapon, a knife, from the killers, an advance payment of Rs 29,000 made by Dedhia and a photograph of Beena provided by him.The quantum of sentence against the three convicts will be decided by sessions Judge Sanjay Patil after prosecution and defence present arguments on Monday. The maximum sentence under the charge of murder is death while the minimum is life imprisonment. Wagh had been earlier acquitted. The Dedhia couple's son was 11 when the crime was committed. Dedhia hails from Kutch, and owned and ran a grocery store in Lalbaug."

His initiative to take up cultivation of vegetables on 2.5 acres of land owned by his school, PKHMO UP School at Edathanattukara, near Mannarkkad, has won him the Kerala governments first Student Farmer Talent Award (Vidhyarthi Karshaka Prathibha Award).Now a Class 8 student at nearby GO Higher Secondary School, Akshay has taken up the project in the new school apart from using his weekly holidays to continue with the vegetable cultivation at PKHMO School. Inspired by Akshay, over 200 students of PKHMO are now actively engaged in vegetable cultivation in the school compound, making the institution the top in terms of agricultural production.Akshay received the recognition from Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the State-level Farmers Day function held in Palakkad Town Hall on Tuesday. The audience comprising agriculture experts and successful farmers received him with thunderous applause.My father Murali is a daily wage rubber tapper. Mother, Sumithra, is a homemaker. Agriculture is in our blood and by brother, Adarsh, who is in Class 4, too has begun showing interest in vegetable farming, said Akshay in an interaction with The Hindu .Akshay said he wished to become an agriculture scientist who could contribute significantly to the nations food security. V Rasakh and Abdul Wahab, his teachers at PKHMO, had inspired him to focus on vegetable farming.We planted almost every vegetable, including plantains, tapioca, tomato, beetroot and potato. There was high yield despite our stringent determination on organic farming. The produce was sold in the local market and the profit was used to ensure various student amenities, said Akshay. He said he is cultivating vegetables even on the seven cents of land owned by his family."

Though sowing is set to get under way, only a few pits are ready. As more women trickle in, panchayat vice-president Kuthirakulam K. Jayan arrives to launch the programme. He sows seeds of ladys finger and long beans in a couple of pits, besides giving the women some tips.Indian cucumber will also be grown on the 20 cents of land by the Area Development Society (ADC).Though each unit is required to cultivate only on two cents of land, the ADS decided to farm 20 cents, says Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana block coordinator Anandu R. Jayan. This is apart from what individual Kudumbasree units are doing, he says.Seeds from VFPCThe seeds from the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council (VFPC), Keralam, are supplied through the Krishi Bhavan.Radhamani, who is a microenterprise convener, says the ADS has another plot of land nearby where it will grow tomatoes and a type of chilli.The plots, she says, have been taken on lease as little land is idle in the panchayat. We did not have to pay any money though. We can farm on this plot till Onam. There are no such stipulations for the other plot.The land, she says, became available only on Sunday, and could not cleared up completely. But once that is done, pits can be prepared and seeds sown. The work will be over by Tuesday, she says.Polivu aims at a good harvest around Onam, but the ADS members worry whether the crops will be ready by then.IntegrationMr. Jayan says farming will be integrated with other aims of Polivu such as waste management and conservation of water resources and soil.There is much non-segregated waste lying all over the panchayat. We will remove it once in association with the Suchitwa Mission. Then, we will put in place a programme to ensure that waste is segregated, he says.Biodegradable waste management will be decentralised. Vermicomposting will be done and biogas plants set up. Kudumbasree units will be roped in to make compost. This will be sold or used by the units involved in farming. Non-biodegradable waste will be collected at regular intervals and taken to a collection centre where a recycling mechanism will be set up, or it will be handed over to some agency. Use of compost and biofertilizers for farming will help soil conservation.The Kudumbasree members hope Poliv will prove to be a success, more than their earlier initiatives such as making soaps, lotions, or even mushroom farming which did not find a large enough market.Last year, the panchayat got the award for maximum output at the district agri fete held in connection with the District Kudumbasree Mission anniversary."

Photo: AFPTheres not a lot of green in the urban jungle of Sao Paulo, but thanks to Fernanda Danelon, restaurants in the Brazilian mega-city are turning their waste back into food at innovative gardens tucked amid the skyscrapers.Ms. Danelon, a 43-year-old journalist by training, quit her day job two years ago to launch the Guandu Institute, which recycles restaurants food waste and helps them set up gardens to put all that compost to good use.Cities in Brazil, the economic giant of Latin America, throw out more than 75 million tons of trash a year, according to the Brazilian Association of Public Sanitation Companies (ABRELPE).About half of it is organic waste, according to the Brazilian environment ministry.There are no municipal recycling or composting programs to reduce all that garbage, and triaging trash is a foreign concept to most Brazilians.The country recycles about three per cent of its waste, according to ABRELPE.To fill the void, Ms. Danelon decided to put her passion for composting and gardening to work on behalf of restaurants in her hometown.Turning into compostHer organisation collects restaurants food waste at their doors, turns them into compost over the course of three to four months, and delivers the compost back to the restaurants to fertilize in-house gardens  which the institute also helps them set up and maintain.She started with just one restaurant. Today, she has 17, and is in talks with 10 more. At first, I collected the trash myself in my car, Ms. Danelon said with a laugh as she turned over dirt with a shovel in the leafy courtyard of her house in Sao Paulo.But now weve grown, and today we recycle 30 to 40 tonnes of organic waste per month.Her partners include French restaurant Le Bilboquet, in the chic downtown neighbourhood of Jardins.With Ms. Danelons help, the restaurant now has cherry tomatoes, lemons and lavender plants growing on its rooftop, a stones throw from the skyscrapers of the Brazilian economic capitals financial district.Its French chef, 34-year-old Julien Mercier, signed up for Ms. Danelons program six months ago.What we grow here isnt enough to supply the whole restaurant. But the important thing is to understand that were part of a process. These things are growing here, and we can also boast that we recycle a tonne-and-a-half of organic waste every month, he told AFP as he inspected his vegetables and herbs.The waste is composted at a facility about 50 km (30 miles) outside the city, where it is mixed with earth and allowed to biodegrade over the course of months.It is a traditional composting technique, without enzymes or earthworms to accelerate the process, said Ms. Danelon. But with a little patience, all that waste turns into rich, nutrient-packed compost.The average 50-table restaurant pays 900 reals ($275) a month for the composting and gardening service  about the same as the municipal waste collection fee.We have to look squarely at our own waste, value it and know that it can be reused, said Ms. Danelon.Starter kitsShe offers starter kits for people looking to make their own compost at home. More and more people are contacting her to ask about setting up communal gardens on the roofs of their apartment buildings, she said.At Mesa III, a deli in a working-class neighbourhood, customers are greeted by basil, sage and rosemary plants ever since the Guandu Institute trained the staff.If we as a society realise how much trash were producing, well see its just atrocious, said owner Ana Soares, 63.Her restaurant has installed a recycling system for glass and switched to cardboard take-out containers to cut down on plastic. Thats why we joined this beautiful project, she said. We have to learn to look at things in a new way.  AFP"

But there is no provision to award compensation to crops damaged by monkeys. But at least 30 per cent of crops are damaged by the primates.Officials of the Forest Department told the farmers to give a representation through the farmers association. Following this, the farmers at the meeting passed a resolution and handed over it to the district administration seeking steps from the government to make crop damage caused by monkeys eligible for compensation.Wild boarsFarmers from various areas complained that wild boars were continuously entering into agricultural lands causing damage to crops such as groundnuts. They said that the population of wild boars is on the increase in certain pockets.S. Kalanithi, district forest officer, said following representation from farmers, an enumeration of wild boars was taken up in the district. This has been sent to the government. The government will take a policy-level decision on how to control wild boar population. Till then, we will be able to compensate for damages caused by the animals.

While Karnataka is the largest producer of arecanut and coffee in India, it stands third in coconut production. The market turmoil has hit arecanut and coconut right around harvest, when supplies are most abundant and grain prices are at seasonal lows.""For the last 15 years, farmers in western ghats and the coast have benefited from both increased production and higher price - leading to rising rural income and declining poverty rates. That happy story may now be nearing its end - which could be the precursor to a renewed crisis in the agriculture sector of the state which is struggling to overcome from the spate of farmer suicides last year,"" N Raghavendra, agriculture expert from Shivamogga, said.The price of a quintal of high-quality red arecanut has plummeted to Rs 24,000-Rs 25,000 from Rs 35,000 last year, while other normal varieties ranges from Rs 18,000 to 20,000. The crisis, the growers complain, is due to abundant supply from Saarc countries after India opened up the market last year.""We have been getting cheap quality arecanut from Sri Lanka and it's being procured by Gutka-manufacturing companies. More than 1.01 lakh tonne of arecanut was imported till August 2016,"" said Ravi G, a member of Malnad Arecanut Marketing Cooperative Society.The situtation of coconut growers is no different. They are in a deeper crisis owing to price crash partly because of imports and bumper harvests in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The price of coconut, which until recently cost between Rs 20 and Rs 30 in the wholesale markets, crashed to below Rs 10, the lowest since 2006. A quintal of copra was hovering around Rs 6,500- Rs 7,000 in Tiptur, a major copra market of the state, while it was Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000 a year ago.The coffee season has also ended on a tepid note for growers. The farm gate price of the new arabica parchment is still hovering between Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,500 per 50 kg bag compared to Rs 10,000-Rs 11,000 last year. Attributing the current downtrend to excess global supplies and recession, Naveen Somaiah, a grower in Kodagu, said: ""The future looks bleak for us considering the problems we have been facing with shortage of labour and high production cost.''MSP for cash cropsWhile the Centre has assured it would look into the request to restrict import, chief minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with growers last week, told them that the state could not intervene since there's no provision to declare minimum support price (MSP) for cash crops. The growers want the state to set up revolving fund to tackle the crisis.Tomato growers see redThe price of tomato has plummeted to Re 1 per kg following heavy arrivals at wholesale markets across Karnataka. At retail shops in tomato-grown villages, it was being sold at Rs 5-Rs 6 per kg while in the wholesale market, the price was Re 1 per kg on Sunday, said APMC officials. Farmers held a protest in some places by spilling the vegetable on road demanding government's intervention.State bags awardThe Karnataka government has bagged the 'DL Shah Award-Platinum' at the 11th national quality conclave hosted by the Quality Council of India.

When he increased the quantum of fertiliser used, the yield increased. However, his fertiliser costs increased from 6,000 to 15,000 a year. Sensing that something was amiss, he sent soil samples from his field for testing.That's when he found out that his soil had low nitrogen and carbon levels. Thangaraj is not alone in his dilemma. Nitrogen and organic carbon levels of much of the agricultural land in the district has plunged over the past few years.An analysis of the soil across across the district has revealed that 90% of the samples tested were found to be short of nitrogen and organic carbon, critical elements for healthy growth and absorption of nutrition for agriculture and horticulture crops. The agriculture department started testing soil samples under the Mission Soil Health Card' scheme in 2015 and so far has tested 26,000 samples.""On a scale of 1, organic carbon content was found to be less than 0.5, the desired level, in 11 of the 12 blocks in the district,"" said soil scientist and tester, Gurusamy.""This means that the crop will not be able retain essential nutrition from the soil like phosphorus, potassium and calcium, and thus humans and animals too miss out on those nutrients when consuming the crop,"" said Arumugam Karthikeyan, plant pathologist and scientist at the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding.As part of the study, the agri department had divided 3.3 lakh hectares of cultivable land into grids of 10 hectare. To identify soil health, all a farmer needs to do is submit his land survey number to the block's agricultural department, and based on the grid his land falls under, he will get the results. ""We can prescribe the sort of crops he can cultivate, ways to reverse a bad situation like low nitrogen, carbon or phosphorus content and the inputs he requires,"" said the deputy director of the agriculture department, Coimbatore, Mohammed Iqbal.""While one hectare of land is supposed to have 280kg of nitrogen, in many parts of the district the nitrogen content was as low as 90kg. In fact, the average content was only 100kg,"" said Gurusamy.One of the main reasons behind this situation is intensive agriculture practices, say officials. ""Cultivating throughout the year without giving the soil a break, cutting and removing all leaves instead of putting it back into the soil, or even choosing varieties with low leaf production, has depleted the soil of its nutrients,"" said Iqbal.Restoring the nitrogen in the soil is a complicated process. ""The easiest way to deal with low carbon or nitrogen content is planting green manure crops for a couple of months, then mixing unused parts of the crop into the soil as it encourages growth of organisms,"" said retired soil scientist V Krishnamurthy. ""Farmers should also follow crop rotation,"" he futher said."

The prices have declined to Rs.500 per 30 kg box in the market. It was Rs.1,000 last week.Market sources say that bumper tomato production in Tamil Nadu early this season had forced the farmers in the Udumalai area to abandon their produce by the roadside as it could not even meet their transportation cost. Now yields from faraway places such as Hosur are arriving in the main markets. When there is a good demand, the prices tend to skyrocket and it had touched Rs.2,400 recently.Two varietiesSwapnesh, a retail vegetable seller, said that two varieties  nadan and apple tomato  are being sold. The nadan variety is locally available and the shelf life is too short. However, the market price for it is nearly half of the apple variety. The apple variety is in high demand in the market, he says.Shift in cropsTomato farmers of Vattavada and Kanthallur say that they shifted to other vegetables due to lack of timely procurement.Unlike other vegetables such as cabbage, potato, beetroot, and carrot, the harvest of ripe tomatoes cannot be delayed even for a day.We have to harvest them even if there is no demand for it, says Planisami of Vattavada. He added that it was one of the reasons for the farmers to abandon tomato cultivation.He said that timely procurement and proper storage facility were the need of the hour. Even when prices were at its peak, it was the middlemen who benefited and not the farmers. Only a steady price will benefit the farmers."

The kitchen essentials have turned into budget-spoilers for families.Insufficient rainfall and high temperatures have resulted in a severe shortage of tomatoes the dearest of them all as it is now retailing at Rs 80 a kg. Experts say no change is likely for at least a month.The city's supply of tomatoes is down by almost half, largely because of limited cultivation this year in areas like Nashik and Narayangaon. Other vegetables particularly cauliflower, green leafy vegetables, capsicum, chillies and garlic also face a similar scenario. Their rates have also soared over the past few weeks.According to those dealing with the commodities in the wholesale market, the situation is particularly worrisome this year with rainfall hardly picking up evenly across the state. Some express fear of a further upward spiral in prices, with supply coming from Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and even northern parts of the country selling at high rates. in the wholesale market.So limited is the stock reaching the city that the wholesale market clears out in just a few hours, said Anna Gule, who is in-charge of the fruits and vegetable sub-section of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Describing the problems affecting the supply, Gule said, ""The inflow of vegetables is down by more than 40%. Besides tomatoes, prices of coriander and other green leafy vegetables are sky-rocketing. The problem is the lack of water in all vegetable growing districts. Unless the monsoon compensates for the drought, the situation is unlikely to change.The only saving grace has been onion, which has been cultivated in abundance this year, so its prices are stable till now.""The situation this year is completely different from the summer of 2015, when tomato growers sold their produce at throwaway prices, said city-based retailer Amol Tambe. , a city-based retailer who buys directly from them. ""Such was the glut of the tomato crop last year, that farmers actually got very poor market rate for their produce in the summer months. Prices, however, had surged around October and November 2015. This year water scarcity has meant dry fields for long stretches. As a result, the quality selling for Rs 45-55 a kilo hardly has any takers. Prices could stabilize by mid-July if it rains sufficiently in the next few weeks,"" he said.The steadily rising prices have already impacted the Consumer Price Index for May. Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed food inflation shot up to 7.55% in May, from 6.32% a month ago.Consumers, though unhappy, have no option but to adjust. City resident Seema Mangaonkar said, ""With the surge in prices, there are many things that are currently out of reach for me. We have no option but to adjust with the spiralling prices"".Another citizen Anshula Madan said, ""Tomatoes are a must in our cooking, so we buy and use them in limited quantities.

The past week witnessed the election campaign of Donald Trump descend into a vortex of violence against protestors and the media, to a point where the candidate had no choice but to cancel a major rally in Chicago.Those observing Mr. Trumps campaign know that the wave of intolerance characterising it has been, for months, laced with a snarling undertone of aggression towards critical opinion in general  aggression that was focussed on the media until recently.Speaking of political journalists earlier, Mr. Trump said: I do hate them... Some of them are such lying, disgusting people [Theyre] among the most dishonest groups of people Ive ever met.At the receiving endLast week, the media continued to face his wrath, though he has arguably been the biggest beneficiary of news media coverage of the Republican presidential campaign.Last Tuesday, Michelle Fields, reporter with the conservative Breitbart website that is friendly towards Mr. Trump, said that her arm was violently pulled by Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as she was trying to ask Mr. Trump a question.Although Mr. Trumps campaign denied the accusation, Ms. Fields tweeted a photograph of the bruise on her arm and this week she and one of her colleagues resigned from Breitbart, saying the site should be ashamed of the way she was treated. One week before this, a photographer for Time Magazine was subjected to a chokehold by a Secret Service agent in Virginia after he stepped outside the press area to photograph protesters.While Mr. Trump has made no bones about his distaste for the media, of late he has also turned his ire towards protestors at his swelling rallies, reprising his famous Youre fired! punchline from The Apprentice, the U.S. reality game show that he created, with Get em out of here!, a signal for Secret Service agents to eject protesters from his rallies.That somewhat jarring, but relatively contained, spectacle has acquired a menacing edge in the past few months as Mr. Trump has apparently started encouraging his supporters at rallies to hit back.In early February in Iowa, Mr. Trump said: If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the [expletive] out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay?... I promise you I will pay for the legal fees.During a rally in Las Vegas last month, he said about protesters: You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? Theyd be carried out in a stretcher, folks... Id like to punch him in the face...Earlier this month he said during a rally in Warren, Michigan, Get him out! Try not to hurt him. If you do, Ill defend you in court.In the past week, he has reprised his promise to pay the legal fees of a man who was arrested after throwing a face-punch at an unsuspecting Black Lives Matter protester.The man got carried away, Mr. Trump said in media interviews after the assault, adding: He obviously loves his country, and maybe he doesnt like seeing whats happening to the country.Perhaps bristling at having had to cancel his Chicago rally because he didnt want to see people hurt or worse, Mr. Trump attempted to blame Vermont Senator and Democratic Party underdog Bernie Sanders for the protests.While both Mr. Sanders and Democratic nomination front runner Hillary Clinton have blasted Mr. Trump for fuelling violence amid his supporters, even Mr. Trumps Republican rivals such as Texas Senator Ted Cruz have come out saying Mr. Trump has created a toxic environment at rallies.At the heart of Mr. Trumps campaign rhetoric is a constant allusion to the U.S. having become a weak and scared nation, the reason his campaign promises to Make America Great Again. Yet, many wonder if this notion of an angry America  a pejorative assessment of the grand strides made by the Obama administration after the Great Recession  could ever set the tone for a successful Trump presidency, terrifying as that prospect seems to many Americans.Apart from the media, protesters at Trumps rallies have been at the receiving end of his ire"

The food is prepared at home, loaded in large containers, and taken to different locations.The sales used to be high when the concept of selling food out of vans started in the city. But now-a-days we are facing stiff competition. Nevertheless, we usually have an agreement among ourselves not to sell the same item, says the driver of a food van near GKNM Hospital.

A full-fledged garden needs a lot of planning and organising, says the homemaker.From sourcing quality seeds to sowing them, personally tending the plants to distributing the produce to workers and neighbours along with promoting organic food in a big way, Ms. Prasuna pays personal attention to every step of gardening. I derive immense satisfaction in the process. The more we consume organic food; the better will be our health. Moreover, it is an effective workout and an excellent relaxation technique, she says.The harvest not only caters to Ms. Prasunas kitchen needs but also to a number of staff members.Earlier, this backyard was dotted with snake pits and weeds. Today, the same place has beds of coriander leaves, spinach, tomatoes, mint, bachala and other varieties that will yield not less than 200 kg.

Kolar Deputy Commissioner K.V. Trilokchandra has conceived an idea of converting tomato into animal fodder. He has submitted a plan to the State government, which has given the green signal for setting up a plant at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard in Kolar.Mr. Trilokchandra got the idea after seeing a huge quantity of the vegetable being abandoned at the yard, one of the largest tomato marketing yards in Asia. On an average, transactions involving 150-200 tonnes take place every day during lean season. About 15 tonnes are wasted during loading and unloading. At the same time, farmers dump huge quantities of tomatoes on the roadside when there is a glut. Now, this will be fed into the plant that will turn it into a lycopene-rich meal for poultry, cattle, pig, and fish. The plant is coming up on a 5,000 sq. ft. site at a cost of Rs. 1 crore and expected to produce around 20 tonnes of fodder every month, Mr. Trilokchandra said told The Hindu . The plant would be the first of its kind in the country, he said and added that the State government will provide money under the Challenge Fund, which is meant to encourage innovative projects.The methodLycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, which gives the red colour to tomatoes. It would be the main ingredient to produce the feed.The manufacture of fodder from tomato involves the following steps: Crushing waste through a roller, expeller and vibrator; dewatering of solid residue using a water extractor (centrifuge); cooking of solid residue using microwave reactor and dehydration of the cooked solid residue using alcohol in a microwave reactor."

The deceased was identified as Purushottam Dehuri who hailed from Janardanpur village under Sadar Block. According to sources, Dehuri consumed poison on Tuesday night and was admitted to the district headquarters hospital at Keonjhar town. He breathed his last in the morning. The deceased had taken loans amounting to Rs.40,000 from different sources, and had cultivated tomato in two acres of land. But the crop was damaged due to scanty rainfall.Of the three other cases, two were reported from Balangir and Bargarh districts in western Odisha where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally a few weeks ago, and one from Dhenkanal.The State government, however, has not admitted a single such death of farmer to be due to crop loss or debt burden although it has admitted in the State Assembly a few days ago that 175 farmers had committed suicide in the State during 2015-16.Enquiries by the respective district administrations showed that none of the farmers ended their lives due to crop failure, said School and Mass Education Minister Debi Prasad Mishra while making a statement on behalf of Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy in the House.Mr. Mishra had said that the State government was not in favour of giving compensation to families of farmers who committed suicide because the move may encourage others to end their lives. While demanding adequate compensation for the family of the farmers who had committed suicide, the Opposition parties had demanded a change in the method and approach to probe into the farmer suicides taking place in the State.The State government, however, has not admitted a single death due to crop loss or debt burden"

It was done in association with the Consulate of Israel in Bangalore.The festival spread included Mediterranean, Arabic and East European cuisines, made from local ingredients.In an interview with City Express, Chef Shachar Aschengrau spoke about different aspects of Israeli cuisine.Chef Aschengrau started his culinary journey 25 years ago, at an Israeli coffee shop and since then has been through different geographies and jobs. I have worked in several countries, even in Japan and Mexico, trying my hands at several things like TV shows, teaching at gastronomical schools, training teams at restaurants and even writing about food for blogs and newspapers, he says.But through it all, his love for Israeli cuisine remained. I am constantly intrigued by its diversity and sub-cuisines, he says. The chef keeps trying variations of the recipes, without straying too far from the traditional.His idol, in cooking, is the famous Israeli chef Haim Cohen. Chef Haim was among the very first ones, outside of Middle East, to use local ingredients to create traditional Israeli food, says Chef Aschengrau .Despite being inspired by the local, Chef Aschengrau knows how important it is to tailor traditional dishes to suit different palates. I have learnt a great deal just by observing my culinary comrades, says the chef. The most significant takeaway was learning and acquiring the skill to differentiate the same dishes in order to match the palate of local diners.Israeli cuisine has a tremendous variety in traditional foods. We often eat them at home because they are easy to make and quite filling, he says. A chopped Israeli salad is often served on the side. Some of the other dishes are bourekas, falafel, hummus, pita bread, shawarma and sahlab among others.People in Bengaluru love experimenting with their food and different cuisines. But, Israeli cuisine is less familiar. Will it be appreciated by diners here? When it comes to food, it is nearly impossible to educate someone, says the chef. If you are a food enthusiast, the dishes will definitely appeal to you.The ingredients used in Israeli cuisine  cinnamon, cardamom, garlic, tomato, olive oil, chilies and sesame seeds  are similar to ones that are used in India. In the food fest, the texture and blend of spices will be different, says Chef Aschengrau. The well-travelled chef finds it fascinating how every ingredient influences the dining experience.Israels culinary tradition has a history of three thousand years, he says. Over this period, our cooking has been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, even by religious and ethnic groups. But, some ingredients, such as olives, figs, dates, pomegranates, wheat, barley and grapes, have stayed.People prefer healthy, organic and more local foods, and I am serving these, he says . I believe in the best quality ingredients that will suit diners palate... It is time to go back to basics, offering dishes that are simple, yet exotic.The food fest, at Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, will be on till August 26."

Paddy cultivation has been affected extensively in Alappuzha and Malappuram districts, the total estimated area under the crop hit by the heat conditions being 604 hectares.Bunched bananas in an area of more than 230 hectares have been lost, mostly in Thiruvananthapuram. Seventy-one hectares of non-bunched bananas also have been hit by the persisting hot weather conditions.Reports from Thiruvanthapuram, Kollam and Alappuzha districts said that around 11 hectares under betel vines had been hit.Around 60 per cent yield reduction is the least of the fallouts of the heat conditions, said a department official, who pointed out that vegetable cowpea, tomato and brinjal would be the most-affected vegetable crops.The most visible effect of the dry condition is the sharp drop in neera production. Production of the unfermented sweet sap from coconut flowers has fallen by about 65 per cent over a month, said Biju John, chief executive officer of Thirukochi Coconut Producer Company (TCPC).The average yield of around two litres of neera per day per tree in wetter conditions has fallen to between 600 and 800 ml a day, he added.

In retails outlets, beans are being sold for anywhere between Rs.120 to Rs.135.

Lemon prices traditionally increase in summer, but this year has seen them rise to Rs.12 for a single lemon. Lack of stock was to blame, a vegetable vendor at Karamana said.Chilli and capsicum too are expensive, while a host of veggies have shown minor price increase.

Kitchenmate is one of the six food processing companies, with interests ranging from tomato puree to green peas and cashew nut processing, that are expected to set up units soon at the 56-acre park, which can accommodate as many as 30 units. The other five - Eastern Manufacturing & Exports (frozen potato patties), Raha Enterprises (frozen snacks), Vijay Cashew Processing (cashew nut processing) and Mishti Foods & Engineering (tomato powder and vegetable dehydration) and Jharkhand Green Peas (green peas processing) - are likely to follow suit soon.

The police stopped the vehicle at the border and allowed the load to be transferred to another lorry with a Tamil Nadu registration from where it was taken to Gudalur. Similar procedures were followed with a load of LPG cylinders.As both milk and LPG are essential supplies, we were instructed to allow them to stop at the check post. The goods were transferred onto Tamil Nadu registered trucks and taken for distribution, a police official told The Hindu .Tourists flowThe flow of tourists crossing into Tamil Nadu had also decreased considerably on Wednesday, with mostly visitors from Kerala making up the numbers.Small businesses, such as vegetable store owners seemed to be the hardest ones hit by the continued closure.K Nagarajan, a vegetable seller from Kotagiri, said that he has been forced to hire Kerala-registered vehicles to transport the produce from Karnataka to the Kakanallah check post.Kerala vehiclesUsually, it would cost us just Rs. 3,000 for a complete trip.

""We used to live in abject poverty... travelling to Burdwan four times a year in search of work. We used to survive on a swill of wheat and maize... we had it on salpata, once a day. Sometimes, we would go to the forests and gather leaves,"" Tudu, 45, said. Four years ago Trickle Up, a US-based NGO, met Tudu at her Mahuldanga village in Purulia's Boro block. Officials of the NGO urged Tudu and her neighbours to form a self-help group. ""We were apprehensive. How would we give Rs 10 a week to form a group?"" she said. Trickle Up gave them Rs 11,280 as seed money. Officials told Tudu and the others that they would help them farm, rear livestock and sell their produce if each of them could save Rs 10 a week. So Tudu and nine of her friends formed Maranguri Mahila Samity. They bought goats, chickens and ducks. ""We took land on lease and started growing gourds, chillies, tomatoes and ladies fingers. We take our produce to the Jan Bazaar haat,"" Tudu said. ""Sometimes, Trickle Up takes our produce to bigger markets in the city. We made a profit of Rs 36,000 over three years."" Tudu, Anima Manna from Sambhunagar, Rina Das from Gosaba in the Sunderbans and Pushpa Dherkuri from Sundargarh in Odisha shared their stories at a city hotel. The family income of each of these ""ultrapoor"" women ranges from Rs 100-150 a day. ""The ultrapoor have two primary issues - food security and continuous employment,"" said Amalendu Pal, Asia regional representative of Trickle Up. The NGO encourages multiple skill development such as farming and rearing livestock while providing access to financial services in three of the poorest states - Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. The programme is part of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM). ""NRLM was launched in 2011 with the idea of establishing effective financial institutions for the poor and building a cadre of rural women who can drive the programme further,"" said Paritosh Upadhyay of Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society. It is imperative to keep a watch on the most vulnerable families in these self-help groups, he said. Often, they slip back into their earlier condition because of setbacks like death, disease or natural calamities. ""We work through community-based partners and in collaboration with governments to provide vulnerable people with business training and financial education and seed capital to start or expand business,"" said Jaya Sarkar of Trickle Up, US. Trickle Up India, with support from MetLife Foundation, will build a coalition of seven community-based partners to reach out to 100,000 ultrapoor households and enable them in financial skill development, Sarkar said.

Agriculture professors and farmers on the ground hailed the pro-agrarian sweep of the Union Budget. Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) professor A. Wadood, who was admittedly overwhelmed with Jaitley's proposals, said, ""Notwithstanding several other grey areas, for a change, we should all be happy that farmers' priorities were the high-point of the budget this time. In Jharkhand, barely 10-12 per cent cultivated land has irrigation facilities. No wonder, in spite of good or poor rain, droughts often dog the state. So, it's a welcome step to focus on improving capacity for better farming."" Agreed BAU soil department chief scientist Vinay Aggarwal. ""This is for the first time, any Union government looked seriously towards agriculture. An allocation of close to Rs 36,000 crore, Rs 500 crore for improving pulse output, introduction of unified market, Rs 20,000 crore initial corpus for a dedicated long-term irrigation fund in NABARD, farmers have all the reason to rejoice,"" he opined. Farmers were happy too. Jai Prakash, a Mandar-based progressive farmer, said they were particularly pleased with the Prime Minister's crop insurance scheme and subsidies on fertilisers which would be credited directly to banks. ""We have experienced how subsidies were being openly looted by middlemen in the past. This promises to curb this trend,"" he said. About the concept of a unified market, which was expected to be launched later this year, Prakash said it would help them get proper market prices round-the-year. ""For example, there are times when farmers of Jharkhand have to sell tomatoes at 50 paise or Re 1 per kilo. On several occasions, they have had to throw away produce, suffering heavy losses. A unified market, as I understand, will help us give due prices all year round,"" he hoped. Dileshwar Sahu maintained that the unified market concept would reduce suicide rates and encourage farmers to take up crop diversity. ""Proper rates and a market for all sorts of agri-produce will encourage farmers to do all sorts of farming"" said the farmer. Prakash wanted fair price shops to be able to sell their produce 365 days a year at villages. ""Funds from Krishi Kalyan cess can be utilised for this now. Also, the need of the hour in Jharkhand is to have agriculture land clusters with all facilities so that fragmentation of farmland can be stopped,"" he said, adding that besides investments and better funds allocation, both the state and Centre should also focus on farmers' capacity building."

Picture by Prashant Mitra In a double delight for farmers, chief minister Raghubar Das on Thursday morning commissioned Jharkhand's biggest dairy plant in Hotwar, Ranchi, and in the afternoon, laid the foundation of a fruits and vegetables processing plant in Kanke block of the district. Touring the dairy before the formal launch, Das hailed it as a state-of-the-art facility. He said they were planning to set up similar plants in Deoghar and the Kolhan region in collaboration with NDDB ""to lay a network of milk routes and turnaround the socio-economic status of farmers living in the remotest parts of the state"". Built with an investment of Rs 19 crore, the fully automated dairy plant boasts an expansion capacity of up to 1.2 lakh litres, officials said. The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) completed the project, sprawling over 47 acres, in record time of a year. While the plant has a one-stop control hub, it is equipped with modern conveyor belts and a pasteuriser unit that can kill bacteria in 10,000 litres of milk at a time. Among the units that are ready is one where paneer, curd, lassi and ghee will be produced. Also ready are three cold storages with a combined capacity to hold 1.10 lakh litre of milk and its allied products. Dedicating the plant to dairy farmers in the state, the chief minister urged every citizen and villager to drink milk and eat milk products under Medha, the indigenous brand under Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation. ""When you start consuming, the money will go to our poor farmers. You get quality milk and milk products and farmers get a livelihood. This circle will put the state on the road to progress."" Sharing a thought from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Das said, ""When the government gives rebate to industries, it is called incentive; but when it gives the same to the poor, why is it called subsidy? I think the subsidy culture should end. From now on, we will focus on giving incentives to farmers."" Present on the occasion were NDDB chairman T. Nandkumar, state agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, Ranchi MP Ram Tahal Choudhary, agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni and the chief minister's secretary Sunil K. Barnwal, besides hundreds of farmers from across the state. Nandkumar underscored that no one should think that the plant belonged to NDDB. ""It is your plant, your property, we are only caretakers for five years. Our aim is to ensure scientific and transparent collection of milk and make payments to you weekly, bi-weekly. So, you should connect with us and form a co-operative,"" he told farmers. Das agreed. He said through the government's ""cow distribution scheme"", farmers would be motivated to form co-operatives. On the food processing plant, managing director of Jharkhand milk federation B.S. Khanna said it would be set up by Mother Dairy on 27 acres in Titratoli village of Nagri in Kanke block. Mother Dairy will invest around Rs 70 crore for setting up the plant to yield products under Brand Safal or a new local brand if decided later. ""Initially, peas and tomato will be marketed. Frozen peas, tomato puree and pastes are some of the items that will be made available first. Later, vegetables like cabbage and beans will be available along with fruits like mango and guava,"" Khanna said, adding that tentatively it would take around two years for the plant to start functioning."
58f4cfd560de470aa339bfe6,The unhappy city,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160416/jsp/opinion/story_80304.jsp,2016-04-16,,Telegraph,"There is a German word: unbehagen. Often mistranslated as 'discontent', its meaning is much more nuanced. In the last century, amid the death and destruction of the two World Wars, Sigmund Freud used it to denote the fundamental 'discomfort' that arises when an individual's quest for instinctive freedom clashes with society's demand for conformity. A similar 'discomfort' seemed discernible in the many of the works showcased at the 3rd Emami Annual Exhibition 2016 (February 26 to March 31). The 'discomfort' appeared to be directed towards baneful urbanization, the decrepit city space and the dissonance generated by city life. The exhibition saw the submission of around 1100 entries by new artists out of which an initial selection of 200 was made. A three-member jury of Jogen Chowdhury, Shuvaprasanna and Prayag Shukla hacked these down to 95, among which were contributions in painting, sculpture, photography, drawing and print making. The urban landscape, depicted in muted tones of grey, black and white dominated the work of Debajyoti Das. In his work, Identity dissolved in motion, the ominous structure of Howrah Bridge stands in the backdrop as apparition-like figures of men with missing torsos roam around on the streets. It is as if the city has literally robbed these men of their identity and turned them into ghostly automatons. The desolation of the industrial space is captured in Bharat Dodiya's surrealist etching, Devoid of being (picture). An enormous, barren factory is contrasted with a small bin in the foreground filled with discarded sickles. The barrenness is both a commentary on the loss of human labour and that of industrial work. The repressive apparatus of the State, particularly its police system, is hinted at in Ritwik Kar's mixed media work, Eradicator of Maladies, while in Anjan Modak's creation, the modern real estate developer's demonic figure looms large over urban shanties. The sculptures were a telling mix of political commentary and personal recollection. Bikram Das's impressive bronze work, Hungry, is an upside down grotesque figure with emaciated limbs and a humongous mouth. K Sirish Reddy's miniature version of a rickety autorickshaw is an ode to urban decay, while Phalguni Samanta's poignant ceramic work, Shoes, is evocative of the weariness of human life. In contrast, the familiar 'hurricane lantern' of our childhood days gets a colourful remake in Sudipta Ghosh's Nostalgia. Apart from the artists in competition, there was a selection of work from a range of invited artists. There were the usual suspects: Ganesh Haloi with landscape in abstraction, Ramananda Bandyopadhyay with his characteristic doe-eyed, voluptuous women and Shuvaprasanna with the familiar crow, an enduring leitmotif of the city and its will to survive."

Earlier this month, the state tourism department had asked hoteliers to list at least one dish made of organic vegetables in their menu. The Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association, an apex body of hoteliers that has around 300 members, has agreed to the proposal. State agriculture minister Somnath Poudyal today said he will request each hotel and restaurant owner to adopt at least one village and procure organic items directly from the farmers there. ""I held a meeting with the association in Gangtok recently and requested the members to adopt at least one village (each) so that middlemen can be avoided. Farmers would be able to sell their produce to hoteliers directly,"" Poudyal said in a press conference today. ""Hoteliers have agreed in principle to include an organic dish in the menu but for that, they need regular supply. By adopting a village that practices organic farming, both farmers and hoteliers would be in a win-win situation."" Sikkim banned the use of fertilisers and pesticides in farming in 2008 and now, 74,000 hectare has been brought under organic cultivation across the state. Some of the locally grown organic vegetables are potatoes, spinach, peas, beans, tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers. On January 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Sikkim as the first state in the country to practise organic farming. However, the hotels and restaurants mostly use vegetables and fruits brought from Siliguri. ""We are yet to ascertain the total requirement but we are confident that locally grown vegetables are enough to cater to tourists in peak seasons. Organic items have high nutritional value"" said agriculture secretary, Khorlo Bhutia. President of Sikkim Hotel and Restaurant Association, Pema Lamtha, said they will discuss the proposal to adopt villages. ""We have agreed to include organic food in the menu although it might be slightly more expensive. We will hold a meeting with farmers to work out the modalities. The rates could be worked out later,"" he said. On February 8, tourism minister Ugen Gyasto Bhutia had requested hoteliers to serve organic food. ""We want at least two-three organic dishes in the menu. Items can be decided by the hoteliers,"" he said. He added that a notice with the appeal would be issued by the end of the month."

February 11 is a red letter day when the chief minister will lay the foundation of a 20,000-tonne plant, set to be the home of Safal products, ranging from fresh vegetables to all kinds of fruits, marketed under the over-reaching arm of Mother Dairy. Das will, on the same day, also inaugurate a 1.2 lakh litre automated dairy set up for around Rs 19 crore under the aegis of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). ""Yes, February 11 will be a great moment for Jharkhand. Besides the dairy, we will also kick-start work to set up the food and vegetable processing plant. We have been trying for this project for a long time. Finally, with the chief minister's nod, it is off the ground,"" B.S. Khanna, MD of Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, told The Telegraph . The action is shifting to Kanke, where the Safal fruits and vegetable plant would come up, and Hotwar, where the milk plant is coming up. Both are on the outskirts of Ranchi, about 25km and 6km from the district headquarters respectively. The state cooperative federation, popularly referred to as Jharkhand Milk Fed, is managed by NDDB as a part of Jharkhand's tie up with the autonomous entity to boost the milk sector. Besides milk promotion, NDDB is also marketing other agrarian products and facilitating linkages. Brand Safal is owned by Mother Dairy, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of NDDB. Mother Dairy is investing around Rs 70 crore for setting up the plant across an area of 27 acre. To begin with, Khanna said, peas and tomatoes would be marketed. Later, vegetables like cabbage and bean would be added along with fruits like mangoes and guava. ""Frozen peas, tomato puree and various pastes are some of the items which will be made available first,"" he said, but added that it was yet to be decided whether these would be sold under the Safal brand or a new local brand. It would take around two years for the plant to start functioning. ""Two years is the buffer time. We expect it to be ready in one-and- a- half years,"" Khanna said. At Hotwar, the Rs 19 crore dairy, spread over 47 acres, is ready. Once operational, it will be the biggest milk processing unit with production capacity of 1.20 lakh litre. The three other state dairies at Ranchi's Ormanjhi, Koderma and Deoghar have a combined capacity of 40,000 litres. The Hotwar dairy boasts a programmed logic controller (PLC), which functions as a one-stop control hub. It is also equipped with modern conveyor belts and a pasteurizer unit that can kill bacteria in 10,000 litres of milk at a time. Among the units that are ready is one where paneer, curd, lassi and ghee will be produced. Also ready are three cold storages with a combined capacity to hold 1.10 lakh litre of milk and allied products. NDDB appointed plant manager Manoj Kumar said another unique feature of the dairy was its linkage with an effluent treatment plant (ETP). ""The ETP will recycle waste water from the dairy and make it suitable for irrigation. Thus, each and every drop of milk will be used,"" he said. After the new Hotwar dairy is in operation, Jharkhand's dependence on Bihar's Sudha brand of milk and milk products would come down drastically. ""Currently, Jharkhand requires 3 lakh litres of milk daily. The three existing dairies at Ranchi, Koderma and Deoghar produce 40,000 litres in all.

A total of five research professionals would be engaged in the project. Apart from assessing the arsenic contamination in groundwater of Bihar and Bangladesh, we aim to provide arsenic-free water in one of the villages of Bhojpur district, which has the highest amount of arsenic presence in its groundwater. The amount of arsenic is 1,861 parts per billion (ppb) against the permissible limit of 10 parts per billion. An arsenic-free borewell would also be dug up in the village."" Ghosh said his department was working on this issue for over a decade during which 18 districts were found to have high levels of arsenic. The districts include Darbhanga, Supaul, Purnea, Begusarai, Bhojpur, Munger and Lakhisarai. Ghosh said: ""Arsenic contamination in water is a grave issue. In Maner, when we carried out a project, we found at least 35 people suffering from diseases related to arsenic contamination in water.

After the noodles cleared the tests and returned to the market in November, the FSSAI had appealed to the apex court, which ordered tests at the CFTRI.The FSSAI had banned the noodles citing lead levels and the packet labels that said Nestle did not add any monosodium glutamate (MSG).The CFTRI has clarified that glutamic acid can emerge in tests from ingredients such as tomatoes, cheese and hydrolysed plant and vegetable proteins. It said no analytical test can distinguish between naturally present glutamic acid and added MSG."

The show, which runs until April 16, consists of recent work by five artists making inventive and incisive use of quotidian life in and around provincial Bengal. There are photo etchings designed with Odia mud and iron ore; objet trouve such as common neon plastic toys; and paintings that take industrial tarpaulin as their canvas or traditional needlework as their mode of composition. Shreyasi Chatterjee, Kingshuk Sarkar and Sumitro Basak all make a return to CIMA after having had solo shows at the gallery in recent years, while the other two artists in this exhibit, Sangita Maity and Pitambar Khan, were both young winners of the 2014 CIMA (Jury) Award. Taken together, these artists' motley assortment of new work shows that a great fecundity of inspiration and idiom is locally available. Accordingly, the subject of many of these works can be found in the source of their materials. Maity has been studying the mining industry in land occupied by the Santhal tribes of Odisha and Jharkhand. Calculative Divisions, one of Maity's photo etchings, transposes a picture of a local forest scene onto an iron plate drawn from the mines. The metal has been manually rusted by the artist, and visible specks of iron burn through the otherwise Arcadian image. The mines employ Santhal workers while also doing harm to their traditional crops, and Maity's work suggests a documentary concern with what is being lost. Basak and Khan find their medium in cheap, mass-produced synthetics, material that is acquired provisionally, used offhandedly, and discarded unthinkingly. In addition to his Pop Art paintings, CIMA is also exhibiting an array of pieces by Basak that feature flimsy, brightly coloured plastic toys of trucks, houses, and people. They are the sort of trinkets a child would use whose parents could not afford something better. What might seem harmless and playful, however, is revealed to be something more sinister: the bendy toy men are stuck onto cars in one composition as if in an accident; in another, piles of the figurines trail a toy truck like so much dumped sand. Are there actual men and women as deprived of agency as these two-bit automatons? Khan's paintings, which make use of the imagery and language painted on the back of buses, trucks and auto rickshaws, vividly pop out from their tarpaulin canvases. His large and clearly delineated illustrations of everyday sights such as wire boxes, pipes and brand insignias suggest an impulse to subdue and classify the urban pell-mell. But his unframed paintings are also unfussy: the edges of the hung tarpaulin curl casually outward. If Khan's appropriation of the style of truck art is an index of the road, then Sarkar's blurry, violent street scenes, painted on stretched silk or jute, point to the chaos of the street. One of the only well-defined items in his Public Moods and Mass Melancholia series of paintings is a sneaker that clearly evokes the urban sidewalk. Nearby is a fuzzily rendered naked man struggling to break free from shackles as an indistinct crowd seems to call for his lynching. Sarkar, who grew up amid strife in Assam, portrays a world in which violence seems routine. The disorder of the lives of many in villages and towns outside of Calcutta is made evident by all these artists; Shreyasi Chatterjee's lovely stitchings show there to be harmony as well. Her landscapes, both woven and painted, depict towns and fields in verdant green, rosy pink, and chartreuse. The mood of the little structures and figures that dot these scenes is set by the balance of colours that surrounds them."

To start with, Vocational Rehabilitation Centre for Handicapped (VRCH), in association with National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities, had launched a programme four months back where around 20 disabled youth and children were engaged in Khandagiri. ""The beneficiaries are already growing vegetables such as coriander, lady's finger, tomatoes and radish in a kitchen garden. They are maintaining all the records of sale and already making profits. Now, that the government has identified the land, the same project will be substituted there. We will include more youths,"" said rehabilitation officer of VRCH, Ram Kishor Sharma. The youth work for the entire day and also undergo therapy, said Sharma, who was speaking at a programme held here on the occasion of World Down Syndrome Day yesterday. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, social security and empowerment of persons with disabilities secretary Niten Chandra said: ""There are about 100 special schools in the state now and we are planning to come up with more in future,"" he said. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder and individuals with the symptoms display some degree of mental retardation or cognitive disability or other developmental delays. The day aims to raise awareness about what it is all about and how people suffering from it can play vital roles in our lives. The theme of this year's event was ""My friends, my community,"" which urges people to include those suffering from the syndrome in our lives. Eminent paediatrician Arabinda Mohanty spoke about the need for work inclusion as per abilities. ""Early intervention and diagnosis is very important for the development of children having Down syndrome. Such children must be sent to early infant stimulation programmes for better development,"" said Mohanty adding that parents must provide exposure to the children by taking them out on a regular basis, especially to social functions. Social security and empowerment of persons with disabilities minister Usha Devi said the state government was committed to address the varied rehabilitation needs of the intellectual disabilities. The day was observed for the first time in Odisha and was followed by an awareness workshop. A short film on Down syndrome was also showcased. On Sunday, the department had also organised a campaign on down syndrome during Raahgiri where children participated."

Smith, who wrote the immensely popular How to Be Both (2014), and her editor were strolling through London's Covent Garden when they chanced upon a building with the word, 'LIBRARY', clearly visible above the entrance. Their interest piqued, they made their way inside to investigate further, and found themselves in a dark, modish hallway. ""Is this a library?"" they asked the woman at the reception desk. ""No"", she replied coldly. ""Was this a library once?"" The answer to that, too, was no. LIBRARY turned out to be a private members' club, with luxurious suites and spa treatments. ""Have you actually got actual books?"" Smith asked. ""We do do some books as a feature,"" was the terse reply. Smith glanced at the business card handed to her, and noticed that a thin, poker straight line skewers its way harshly through the word ""LIBRARY"". This is the visual metaphor that is echoed throughout the rest of the book, and one that is uncomfortably true: Smith reveals that in the years she took to write this book, ""draconian and politically expedient cuts"" resulted in the closure of about 1,000 libraries in the United Kingdom. This is a distressing reality, and one that many authors, including Smith and Julian Barnes, have protested against vociferously. With the 12 stories in Public Library, Smith has committed further to the cause - this book, she says, is about ""the ways in which our public library tradition is being traduced, pressurised, changed and taken from us without us seeing it - and also quite visibly with us seeing it."" Now that book stores and libraries are rapidly shutting down, some of our most cherished pleasures are in danger of disappearing - the joy of idly browsing through library shelves, exploring those intimate spaces, and then suddenly stumbling upon something precious that you did not even realize you were missing. These are pleasures that one will never find online. In spite of the title of the book, no story in Public Library is actually called ""Public library"". The tales are neither set in a library, nor do they openly talk of one. Each piece, however, is a lament and a plea for those magical spaces; to this end, Smith has incorporated reflections from her friends into the collection, to hold it together and to enhance the themes of her own stories. Placed in italics between Smith's tales, these are all reflections of lovers of books on the libraries that shaped their lives; some of these people are not well known, while the others are (for instance, the Scottish poet and novelist, Jackie Kay, and the Canadian writer, Miriam Toews). They talk about the importance of libraries, as well as the ""recent spate of closures""; the nostalgia in their words is sharp. A number of these reflections hark back to the days of youth - one of Smith's friends remembers feeling overjoyed and very important for having been awarded an ""adult ticket"" at the age of six for borrowing lots of books, while another talks about the excitement of turning seven and finally being allowed to use the library. Anna James remembers how a tiny library gave her ""access to worlds and lives that a child growing up in rural Northumberland could never have hoped to experience anywhere else."" A passionate will to defend the written word underlines these reflections. However, Smith's own stories provide a far more powerful defence. She highlights the democratic, liberal spirit of the public library, a space where everyone can have access to learning in order to educate and empower themselves, a space where readers can pick what they want to read, for free, and be at liberty to re-imagine each book with each re-reading. The collection itself is political and also profoundly democratic, since Smith shares her privileged position as the author with her friends. She has called public libraries 'division melting places', and with this work she shows that books and shared civic spaces resolutely tear down walls. Her stories create an animated puzzle where quotes and writings fit together, weirdly and beautifully. In ""The beholder"", the vocabulary invented by John Milton - Smith observes that he coined the words ""fragrance"", ""lovelorn"" and ""padlock"" - struggles against the staccato, brusque sentiments of medical lingo: ""'Results, hospital, inconclusive,' the voice said. 'Urgent, immediate, straight away.'"" Smith delights in the contingency of language and the changing meanings of words: readers are taken through the origins and the different usages of ""stamina"" and ""buxom"", and are informed that in Shakespeare's works, ""stone"" often meant ""mirror"". Smith also reminds one of the tale of Ariadne, Theseus and the Crete labyrinth when she reveals that the word, ""clue"", originated from ""a ball of thread"". In ""Good voice"", a deceased father hands out life advice to his daughter. Moreover, fragments of deceased writers keep peppering the book: readers are left to wonder whether D.H. Lawrence's ashes may be floating around, undetected, in the ocean, and whether film rolls of Katherine Mansfield - she sits giggling on a park bench in one story - may have been melted en masse and used to coat the wings of aeroplanes. Smith's stories leap with abandon across physical and virtual spaces, and are filled with the joy of unexpected, unlikely connections. Her characters are transported out of their daily routines with the help of dreams, hallucinations, unpredictable events (a wheelchair-bound woman is trapped on a train that has finished its run; the imaginary friend of a toddler refuses to get up and leave the table) and conversations with the dead. A character walking into Regent's Park wanders past the pond where Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley set sail to their paper boats, and across the hilltop once shared with a past lover: ""...endless stories, all crossing across each other"". All of Smith's tales are jagged, breathless and incongruous, every situation rendered interesting by sardonic humour. The author's frustration with the idiosyncrasies of modern bureaucracy is evident: there is a famous media house's security system that tells a living man that his records show that he is dead, on account of which he will not be granted entry until a meeting with the company's lawyers is convened; there is also the ""matey automaton"" which is unable to comprehend the simple command, ""I'd like to speak to someone"", over the phone. It is this officialdom, all-powerful and faceless, that is ruining library services on account of its obsession with order and efficiency at the cost of common sense and happiness. Smith also laughs derisively at bureaucratese when she writes about the thuggish tone of a sign at a railway station: ""If we find you trespassing you will be fined."" ""I found I was thinking about the person, or people, who'd originally worded that sign. Had there been special meetings held to decide the wording? Did they or he, or she, pause for a moment at all over find and fined?"", she wonders. Above all - and rather appropriately - Smith makes readers want to visit a library to find the books she writes about (instead of just searching for them online). In ""The poet"", the searing poetry of the Scottish poet, Olive Fraser, is discovered alongside music hidden beneath the dusty spines of old novels. In ""Grass"", the accidental discovery of a book of Robert Herrick's poems takes a character back to boyhood afternoons; the book itself thinks about being read in the future among the wild grass and flowers in a village lane. Smith's politics result in her investing physical copies of books with magical powers; this turns public libraries into places of worship or treasure troves, sacred places where one is miraculously changed or healed upon contact with the artefact - the book."

But this year, they're adding one more piece of sage advice: go with an empty stomach too. Some of the state's yummiest snacks - gulgula, marwa pitha, sarli soup, dhuska, pakori, chilka roti, barra - can be had at the Jharfoods stall set up by Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society at the ongoing khadi fair from February 5 to 17. Twenty-one sari-clad women, their aprons, caps and gloves giving them a professional air of competency, are serving these Jharkhandi delicacies at Jharfoods stall. Of the 30 food stalls put up at the mahotsav, the stall catches attention for authentic snacks prepared and served by the women from remote districts. Kumar Vikas, programme manager of Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society, said the register kept at the stall was bursting with compliments from customers. ""The food was really good.

Photo: AFPScientists unveiled on Monday the gene in carrots that gives rise to carotenoids, a critical source of Vitamin A and the pigment that turns some fruits and vegetables bright orange or red.Un-poetically dubbed DCAR_032551, the star gene emerged from the first complete decoding of the carrot genome, published in the scientific journal Nature Genetics .Vitamin A deficiency is a global health challenge, the study pointed out.Its plentiful carotenoids make carrot an important source of provitamin A in the human diet.Carotenoids were first discovered in carrots (hence the name), but which among the vegetables newly tallied 32,115 genes was most responsible for their formation remained a mystery. The researchers sequenced the genome of a bright orange variety of the vegetable called the Nantes carrot, named for the French city.Daucus carota now joins a select club of about a dozen veggies  including the potato, cucumber, tomato and pepper  whose complete genomes have been sequenced.Laying bare the humble carrots genetic secrets will make it easier to enhance disease resistance and nutritive value in other species, the researchers said.Having identified the mechanism controlling the accumulation of carotenoid, it may be possible  through gene-editing, for example  to import it to other staple root vegetables such as the cassava, native to South American and widely grown in Africa. These results will facilitate biological discovery and crop improvement in carrots and other crops, said Philipp Simon, senior author and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Among vegetables spinach and peas are widely associated with growing up strong, but its hard to beat the carrot when it comes to health boosters.Carrots are loaded with beta-carotene, a natural chemical that the body can transform into Vitamin A.The deeper the orange colour, the more beta-carotene.Carotenoids are also antioxidants, which are thought to protect against heart disease and some forms of cancer by neutralising so-called free radicals, single oxygen atoms that can damage cells.Some of these compounds can prevent disease, Mr. Simon said.Carrots are an interesting crop to work on because of their wide range of diversity. They are familiar to everyone, and generally well-regarded by consumers, but like most familiar things, people dont necessarily know the background stories, said Mr. Simon, led the study published in the journal Nature Genetics .Interestingly, carrots  along with many other plants  have about 20 per cent more genes than humans.Looking back at the plants family tree, scientists have been able to determine that it split with the grape about 113 million years ago and from the kiwi about 10 million years after that, when dinosaurs still lorded over the planet.Originally white, the wild ancestors of the carrot likely came from central Asia. The earliest record of carrots as a root crop dates from 1,100 years ago in Afghanistan, but those were yellow carrots and purple ones, not orange ones. Paintings from 16th century Spain and Germany provide the first unmistakable evidence for orange carrots. Global crop production of the root has quadrupled in the last 40 years and is today eaten everywhere in the world.  AFP/Reuters"

Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income.""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha. We don't have money even for transporting them,"" said Kamal Singh.""Almost 5,000 farmers in the entire district are facing this problem while, Prime Minister Modi launched the National Agriculture Market on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar'', Vidisha district panchayat member Kailash Raghuvanshi told TOI.He said farmers are in a poor condition and cannot get money in return as so many of them have not availed crop insurance policy due to administrative hassles. ""Chief minister Chouhan had sowed tomatoes in a 10 acre area. Initially he sold 15 quintals at a high price but the moment price crashed, he asked for free distribution in slum areas,"" said Raghuvanshi.The cost of sowing tomatoes in one bigha (2.5 acres) is estimated to Rs 40,000. As the district recorded a bumper crop, one bigha received 17,500 kgs of tomatoes. But at a rate of Rs 2 a kg or less, the farmers are not getting even Rs 35,000 from a bigha.""The farmers are compelled to throw away their crop in the garbage or feed the cattle. There is no alternative,"" said Radhuvanshi, adding, many farmers were also cheated by middlemen who pay less than Rs 2 for a kg and sell the crop in retail markets of Bhopal and nearby cities at Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg.With government making efforts to double the income of farmers, the new crisis will not only hit the farm community financially but also mentally, who were looking for 'ache din' after numerous schemes announced by the Centre.-----------Photo caption :Workers distributing tomatoes grown at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's farm house, to poor families on Friday------"

For instance, if farmers grow tomato, we can provide them with post harvest storage and processing technology that helps them make a product they can market, he said.Biodigester toiletDepending on the need, Dr. Sharma said a biodigester toilet can be installed in the village, which can help generate energy for the community from human waste. Already, DFRLs biodigesters have been used by the Railways and other private players. DFRL will also work on installing a solar energy plant in the village, he said. After identifying the village and the technologies to be used, Dr. Sharma said the DFRL will deploy its staff to liaise with the village to ensure its effective implementation. After a couple of months, the DFRL proposes to invite Mr. Parrikar to the village to see for himself the change brought about by the technology. Dr. Sharma said the project will be funded either by the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) or under Mr. Simhas MP Local Area Development (MPLAD) funds.It may be mentioned here that Mr. Parrikar, during his recent visit to Mysuru, directed DFRL to share its technological expertise with the villages to not only improve its economic standards, but also raise their cleanliness and hygiene levels."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives. RSN MKJ ABI"

Spain, the former colonial power, relinquished the territory in 1975 to Morocco, which has formally claimed the land since 1957, and Mauritania.Then there was conflict between the two countries and the Polisario Front - the Sahrawi liberation movement. Mauritania withdrew in 1979, leaving Moroccan security forces in nominal control. Controversially, an extensive wall was built through the desert to exclude Polisario fighters accused of coming into the country from refugee camps in neighbouring Algeria.A national referendum was promised after a UN-brokered ceasefire in 1991, in which the population could vote for complete independence or integration with Morocco; but the plan stalled when Rabat and Polisario disagreed over who was entitled to vote. Morocco remains implacably opposed to independence but says it is prepared to talk about ""autonomy"". The UN continues to push for a negotiated settlement. In December, Christopher Ross, personal envoy in the dispute to the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, admitted the situation was at a stalemate.France, which has strong historical links with Morocco, has consistently opposed calls for UN action against Rabat by exercising its veto in the Security Council. Now Polisario is finding new ways to put pressure on Morocco to come back to the negotiating table.In December it managed to put a stick in the spokes of the European Union's agriculture agreement with Morocco. Many of the tomatoes sold in British and European supermarkets are labelled as Moroccan produce, but most are grown in Western Sahara.The EU's Court of Justice ruled last month that the favourable tariffs Morocco enjoys should not apply to goods from the territories it occupies. The EU failed to consider the impact on the rights with the Sahrawi people when it signed the deal, the court ruled. Campaigners in Britain are taking legal action to stop Moroccan exports to the UK enjoying similar tax breaks.Buoyed by its successes, Polisario has brought a further case to the EU courts over an EU-Moroccan fisheries deal, which includes the territorial waters of the Sahrawi people. Norway has already started fining any of its vessels which trawl in Western Saharan waters. Oil companies such as Total which have explored for off and on-shore oil fields are facing growing local and international criticism, as are companies that import Western Sahara's minerals, including its massive phosphate deposits. United States, Canadian and Australian miners have all been blacklisted by Scandinavian pension firms.Polisario and its supporters are also keeping up the political pressure. Adala, a British NGO, recently submitted a report to the European Parliament and the UN Commission for Human Rights highlighting the regular human rights abuses taking place in the region. Sahrawi protestors face persistent harassment and persecution by security forces. Peaceful demonstrations are routinely disrupted by state violence and those taking part have been illegally detained.Beccy Allen, of Adala UK, said it was essential the UN mission in the territory was given a human rights mandate. ""There are plenty of white UN vehicles around but they don't intervene on human rights issues. They are the only UN mission around the world without one and that has to change,"" she said."

""What we have been selling so far in the name of orange juice is actually juice of kinoo or malta fruit grown which is not actually orange. Now the oranges for which Nagpur is famous will be used,"" he said. The plant will also have a line for making herbal extracts, apart from personal care products.The company plans to hold a ground-breaking ceremony on September 10.

Balkrishna said the Katol land had not come into company's possession yet. The main focus would be on Mihan and it was likely the area in Katol may be used for training the farmers in the future.

MADC has fixed a rate of Rs1 crore per acre for land outside SEZ area in Mihan.However, when tenders were called, the reserve price was fixed at Rs25 lakh an acre. After the first round in which two bids were received, Patanjali emerged as the sole bidder and bagged the deal in third round. Sources said Patanjali had quoted around 5% above the reserve price. The reserve price was lowered on grounds that land offered in the tender was not developed.In order to compensate its loss, MADC has hiked the rates for rest of the land by 15%. The matter was reported by TOI on August 12.Balkrishna said the company wanted land cost to be low but had gone through all formalities and had bagged the deal in competitive bidding. It is ready to give away the land at same rate at which it got from MADC if any other company was ready to do business following the same terms and conditions as Patanjali."

The recent rains had resulted in almost all the farmers going in for tomato cultivation in addition to other crops, which has resulted in the high supply to markets.He said that even farmers in Chekkanoorani and Alanganallur in Madurai, Theni and Andipatti in Theni district, had cultivated tomatoes in large areas, resulting in the high yield.Even two weeks ago, a 15 kg box of tomatoes had sold for Rs 60, but now it has come down to just Rs 15, and the wholesale price in the market on Saturday was Rs 4 per kg. Sekar predicted that the price would go down further at least for another month.Horticulture department sources from Dindigul where tomatoes are cultivated in over 6,000 acres in Palani and Oddanchatram blocks, said that the crops, which have a 65-day growth period will continue to yield from 140 to 150 days after which the prices would go up, as summer seasons do not favour pollination and tomato cultivation.A farmer from Reddiarchathiram in Dindigul district said that they are facing heavy losses.

After we returned the fire, the armed assailants fled the spot,"" ASP Ashwini Mishra said.In a daylong operation backed by two special action teams and a CRPF company, a group of policemen destroyed crops on around 100 acres of land. ""The operation will continue till the crop on the remaining 400 acres is destroyed,"" said Chatra SP Anjani Kumar Jha.Police said Maoists patronize opium crop cultivation in inaccessible terrains to make money to fund their struggle. In some places, however, criminals have also got into this illegal trade to make moollah. ""Only two shots were fired by the criminals whereas Maoists generally fire multiple shots. The objective was to discourage our team from destroying the crop,"" the ASP said.A police officer said the cultivation of opium crop on one acre requires an investment of Rs 30,000. An acre of crop yields around five to six kilograms of raw opium, which fetches Rs 25,000 per kg in the market. The growers pay Rs 10,000 to the local police for each acre of harvested poppy crop. Ultimately the grower ends up earning Rs 60,000 mullah from every acre of poppy crop.ASP Mishra said the raw opium is preserved in households in Maoist-hit areas before being divided into small packets and finally being loaded into trucks passing through the GT-Road and crossing Chatra to reach Punjab, Haryana and other north Indian cities. In the past, raw opium packets being transported via GT Road have been seized.""The poppy plants look similar to tomato plants in the initial 20 days of their 30-40 day life. It is difficult to differentiate between the two. In inaccessible lands where police do not venture due to the Maoist fear, opium crops are sown, harvested and sold,"" the police officer said.In the past, police have destroyed such crops in Khunti, Giridih, Palamu, Garhwa, Latehar, Hazaribag and other districts.Confirming this, police spokesperson S N Pradhan said, ""It has been observed that the cultivation is backed by Maoists and criminals. We gather information through our network and pass it on to the SPs to take action,"" Pradhan said."

In the US, it caught 10 thieves; in Australia, it caught 100. In China, it caught 1,000. In India, someone stole the robot. You may want the joke to come true because robots are coming to steal your jobs, particularly if your work is mostly repetitive, mechanical, motorised; something that is programmable.It's no secret that automation is taking over low-wage jobs, but as robots and drones get increasingly sophisticated, a White House economic report released on Monday has put numbers on a trend that should give pause to anyone who thinks low-wage manufacturing is the panacea to economic salvation in India, or anywhere else for that matter.In the US, there's an 83% chance that automation will take a job with an hourly wage below $20, a 31% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage between $20 and $40, and just a 4% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage above $40, a report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) warned. The risk of having your job effectively taken over by a robot, CEA chairman Jason Furman told reporters on Monday, ""varies enormously based on what your salary is."" In other words, the more skilled, creative, and high-earning you are, less likely your job will be taken over by automatons.Mechanical and assembly-line tasks, from laying bricks to making cars and even driving them, are already being taken over by drones, robots, and other ""intelligent"" forms even as scientists are trying to infuse them with intuition and emotions, their memory and computing power long having surpassed that of human beings. Furman said the risk of many current jobs being performed by robots is another example of why it is important to invest in education that helps people have skills that complements automation.Developments in US industry serve as a warning against over-reliance on low-grade, assembly-line manufacturing that can be replaced by robots. Even some of the low-level service jobs, such as dispensing food or gas or money, have been destroyed in the US with the advancement of automation - from ATMs to self-serve kiosks for photographs.Manufacturing jobs have declined by more than 7.2 million, or 37%, since employment in manufacturing peaked in 1979. In 1965, manufacturing accounted for 53% of the US economy; by 1988 it only accounted for 39%, in 2014, it accounted for less than 9%.Not all of the destruction is accounted for by flight of jobs to China or Mexico. Lurking in the background, technological advancement. University of Oxford researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne estimated in 2013 that 47% of total US jobs could be automated and taken over by computers by 2033. Even jobs in medicine, law, and education are not immune. Remarkably though, even as employment is shrinking, productivity is growing, thanks to the technological advancements. So, while the GDP is soaring, median income in many jobs is falling even as the job market itself is becoming smaller."

Of the total 133 hectares (332 acres) land, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares (208 acres). As only five wineries became operational in the wine park, the industries had demanded the government to allow food processing units on the remaining 50 hectares (125 acres).During an industrial exhibition in April last year, Nashik-based industrial associations had approached state industries minister Subhash Desai with their demand. Desai too had given positive response to the industrial associations. Accordingly, the MIDC gave approval in September for allowing industries to set up food processing units at Vinchur.Now, the MIDC is in the process of developing infrastructure such as roads, water supply and streetlights among others and is also conducting a survey for the purpose.

This has kept traders away from taluka's villages, a villager said. The farmer's decision has boomeranged on farmers and the result is that tomato prices at the beginning of the season itself has fallen below Rs 10 a kg.Nagjibhai Takore, sarpanch of Lakshmipura village, said the prices will further fall when the tomato season is at its peak in the last week of November.""As of now, the tomato crop which is arriving in the markets in Ahmedabad is coming from Nasik apart from Kadi area. Once the crop from Kadi starts flooding the market, the prices will fall further,"" said Takore.Sarpanch of Yashvantpura, Dashrath Patel, said lack of exports is making tomato an unprofitable for farmers in the region. ""The are many reasons for this,"" said Patel. ""The first is that exporters who usually arrive have not come this time. Moreover, there has been a bumper crop in Nasik and other areas. Also this year the the climate was hotter than last year and, hence, the quality of our tomatoes suffered.""Takore said that several villages had announced that they would not sell their produce to traders for Pakistan. ""Hence the traders from Delhi and Punjab have stayed away from the villages,"" he said.However, sarpanch of Vekra village, Nikul Patel, said prices being offered for tomato are very low and hence the farmers are incurring huge losses. The farmers are not even able to recover their investment, forget profits. At least six traders from Punjab and Delhi come to the village regularly by the last week of October but this year they have not come because trade with Pakistan has almost come to an end due to tension on the border.Chairman of Khadi Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Vinod Patel, said the quality of the crop is also not good. ""Apart from quality, the traders from Punjab are keeping away from the region this year as there are no exports to Pakistan,"" Patel said.Ramesh Patel, member of Kisan Agro, says that sowing of tomato takes places in nearly 5000 bigahs of land.

Inspecting the trading outlets and dumping of tomato produce at the market yard, the Minister observed that Chittoor district holds the best potential to become a horticulture hub.Though the price of tomatoes was plummeting from time to time, the crop had turned into a good business in the region.He said that when the prices of tomatoes were stabilised, the farmers would reap rich benefits and escape the threat of falling prices. The farmers said that they never craved for bumper benefits, but were bogged down with sudden dropping of prices which would force them to abandon the crops in the fields as the scenario would throw them into a quandary with the labour charges becoming more than the tomato market price.They informed the Minister to take measures for stabilising the prices at at least Rs. 350 per crate with 30 kg of tomatoes.

In the south, levels failed to rise enough to fill dried-out rivers and aquifers.The drought crisis -- which has caused wildfires, decimated forests, threatened animal species and deprived thousands of homes of access to clean water -- is far from over, and the authorities of this vast West Coast state say its 39 million residents had better get used to the new reality of climate change.A quarter of the Sierra Nevada Mountains' snow cover -- essential for feeding rivers and maintaining groundwater levels -- will disappear by 2050, California's Department of Water Resources (DWR) predicts on its website. Half will vanish by the turn of the century.That prospect is especially worrying because rising temperatures are also increasing soil evaporation in America's most populous state.Californians aren't ready for ""an increasingly dry climate with a population that is continuing to grow without a long-term strategy to address the imbalance,"" Emile-Geay says.Others agree.Heather Cooley of the Pacific Institute praises California for ""tremendous progress"" by decreasing water use to less than its level 30 years ago.But she says the wealthy state has yet to turn the page on its culture of abundance.Governor Jerry Brown's mandatory 25 percent water savings enacted a year ago signaled the end of an era and earner widespread praise.But the state still sees a huge amount of water waste.In the middle of the Californian desert, golf courses in the opulent resort city of Palm Springs abundantly water their greens during the heat of midday while drainage pipes pour rivers of water down the middle of streets.- Need for reflection -The authorities must employ financial incentives to encourage adoption of more efficient toilets and appliances -- otherwise drastically increase the price of water used after a certain limit is reached, experts say.In a region where most urban consumption comes from watering gardens, maintaining green lawns could become an unaffordable luxury.Among other failures, Californians do nothing to collect their rainwater.Worse still, ""everything has been designed to drain water as quickly as possible to avoid flooding,"" Emile-Geay says. ""The water doesn't have time even to wet the soil before it flows into the ocean.""California must accelerate recycling, desalination, and generally ""reflect"" about its system of water rights, which he criticizes as inequitable, archaic and encouraging of ""more use than needed.""Farmers, who consume some 40 percent of California's water, are also coming under fire.Fewer than half have invested in water-conserving micro-irrigation systems. Many grow water-intense crops such as almonds and alfalfa in the middle of the desert.Wholesale water rationing for many has done little to discourage irrigation because revenues from agriculture have stayed level and even reached record levels in 2014, chiefly thanks to soaring commodity prices.Bill Diedrich farms walnuts, almonds and tomatoes in central California -- whose abundant agriculture has earned it the nickname ""salad bowl of the world"" and where each farmer decide decides what to grow according to what's profitable.He believes the solution must come from ""engineering to better collect and distribute the water we have.""Emile-Geay says that won't be enough.""If you compare GDP per liter of water, growing alfalfa in California is very inefficient"" and viable only because of cheap prices for water.""Silicon Valley consumes much less and generates more revenue,"" he says. ""If the agriculture industry paid the real price for water, it wouldn't make sense to grow certain things.""ved/grf/mdl"

Baskaran exhorted the farmers to raise fruits by making the best use of red soil and water conditions.Collector S. Malarvizhi, who chaired the seminar in the presence of Sivaganga MP P.R.

Pudur, Singampunari, Sivaganga, Kallal and Tirupattur areas.The department, which organised block-level melas in the first week of August, had selected about 700 farmers, he said adding these farmers were taught canopy management of high-density crops in the seminar. The fruit saplings were ready at State Horticulture Farms at Devakottai and Nemam near Kundrakudi and the cultivation would begin in September ahead of northeast monsoon, he said.Mr. Rajendran said the department would organise a workshop on hi-tech horticulture at Kalayarkoil on August 18 to train the farmers on cultivation using poly houses, shade nets, plastic mulching (to suppress weeds), anti-bird nets and protected cultivation practices of all crops.The department also proposed to cultivate hybrid vegetables, especially tomato, brinjal and green chilly, on 120 hectares. The department had kept ready about 40 lakh seedlings and the farmers would be given an insight into the scheme at a seminar to be held at S. Pudur on August 24.

Mohinder Singh Sidhu's attempt to get out of the conventional crop cycle about two decades ago in Sheron village of Sangrur has been a fully spiced-up example of it.Sidhu started planting red chillies in his village known more for wheat and paddy rotation, season after season. Today, farmers from even Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of neighbouring Haryana come to Sheron to buy chilli seeds from Sidhu. For the forthcoming planting season, he has prepared seeds for 200 acres.Even near home, farmers of his village plan to have at least 50 acres under red chillie as planting starts in a week from now. Till a few years ago, chilli were planted over 10-15 acres. Sidhu's advice to his fellow farmers and higher prices fetched by his crop are the key reasons for the shift.Known as 'chilli king', 53-year-old Sidhu is, however, not limiting himself to one crop only. He also grows various vegetables and oil seeds, including tomatoes, grams, mustard and potatoes in half of his 30-acre landholding.His tryst with the spice crop began in 1995. A trendsetter, Sidhu are first in the area to set up net house at his farm to grow vegetables and chillies.Speaking about his foray into spices and vegetables, Sidhu said, ""A farmer has to spend nearly Rs 30,000 for sowing chilli in one acre and can get an average yield in the range 80-100 quintals. Going by today's price of about Rs 14-15 per kg, one can easily earn up to four times of the total input costs, which is roughly over Rs 1.2 lakh per acre. Having seen the high returns, more than a dozen farmers in my village alone have decided to grow chillies in the season which starts from the middle of February.""He says his motivation to diversify into other crops was simple. ""I wanted to increase my income from existing landholding. That's the reason I decided to grow chilli in 1995, and soon started reaping benefits of my new venture and carve a niche for myself in Punjab. Recognition followed sometime later as I was conferred with the state award for progressive farmer in 1998 from PAU. Next year, I received the Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal Award, and in 2000 PAU bestowed 'Chilli King' title on me. In 2005, I got the Chief Minister's Award."""

Ultimately, the aim is to provide top-class players for Manchester United who can go on to win the Champions League.""Times may have changed since the likes of Butt and Ryan Giggs were cleaning mud off the boots of the seasoned professionals as part of their footballing education.""You don't really want your top young players climbing over the rood to retrieve balls"" -- but knows the danger of producing Academy 'robots' with little intuition,"" Butt said.Great United winger George Best learned his skills dribbling a tennis ball around parked cars on the streets of Belfast.These days of health and safety overload is a challenge for Academies, meaning a little creativity is required.Head of Performance Tony Strudwick recently introduced gymnastics to the club's nine-year-olds with British Olympic athlete Beth Tweddle taking the sessions.""We've also got plans to develop climbing areas, we want to create an environment of controlled chaos where players can start to express themselves,"" he told Reuters.""You look at the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani, they were instinctive athletes, gymnasts. Nani grew up doing back somersaults on the beach.""It's a big challenge for all academies. You don't want automatons. We have to do things differently. Make them strong enough so they don't break.""Nicky's appointment was great for the club,"" he added.""The future is bright and we have some real young dynamic kids here."""

Sadashiva, one of the main criteria for the award was the social and economic impact the research work had on society. These tomato varieties are not only high-yielding, but also show high resistance to three major diseases.This reduces the cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards the cost of fungicides and pesticides, he noted.The fruits of these varieties are suitable for long-distance transportation as they are firm and have a shelf life of 15 to 20 days as against 10 to 12 days of other hybrids, and six to eight days of ordinary tomato varieties, Dr. Sadashiva added.Arka Rakshak, which gives a yield of up to 19 kg a plant, is already sought after by farmers and traders in eight countries.The award for the year 2013-14 was presented recently at a programme held in New Delhi to the nine-member team led by Dr. Sadashiva, principal scientist and Head of the Division of Vegetable Crops, IIHR.The other members of the team are Dr. Peter Hanson, Dr. M.

A more recent survey has shown that over 36% of children in the state are stunted. A meeting on Tuesday of NGOs, which health minister Rajendra Singh Rathore also addressed, dwelt on nutrition financing in the state. The one speaker who had much to offer in terms of learning was Suprabha Agarwal, head of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra.Jack Clift of international NGO Results for Development said his studies had shown that there was a 69% shortfall in nutrition financing in the state. Not only is the allocation insufficient, what money is indeed allocated is not entirely utilized. Under the ICDS programme, for instance, figures for 2014-15 showed 41% underutilization of funds in Rajasthan.Suprabha Agarwal, director of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra, said the nutrition mission in her state was not an implementing agency - it was concerned with proper utilization of resources and strengthening the work of field workers. The mission was launched in 2005, and in the first phase, the emphasis was on strengthening ICDS. In the second phase that began from 2010, the need for effective communication was understood; some feedback received from the community was worked into the programme. It was also recognized that malnutrition cannot be 'treated' - it was best to work for prevention, and for that, women in the fertile age range needed to be properly nourished. The programme has now entered its third phase.Agarwal said the mission worked with a slim team of less than 10 experts for the whole state. However, working with grassroots level workers and encouraging them to adopt imaginative ways to resolve problems has shown great results.""We asked communities to contribute, and received Rs200 crore. We told our anganwadi workers that they should hang out baskets in front of their anganwadis and encourage people to contribute whatever they could. A farmer might only put in one tomato and another might deliver two brinjals - all this could go into the meal cooked for children. The response has been phenomenal. We thought we might only gather enough material for the use of the angwanwadi on one day, but we find we are gathering a surplus and have now devised local earthenware-made refrigeration to store vegetables. During the drought, some farmers told us that they could not offer vegetables, and so gave us some grain. We now have a storage problem to deal with!""Agarwal spoke of effective partnerships with corporate firms under the CSR head, and also networking and collections from communities. ""However, even now, we often have to explain the need for our work to other departments of government.
