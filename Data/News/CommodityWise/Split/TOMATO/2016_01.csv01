While Karnataka is the largest producer of arecanut and coffee in India, it stands third in coconut production. The market turmoil has hit arecanut and coconut right around harvest, when supplies are most abundant and grain prices are at seasonal lows.""For the last 15 years, farmers in western ghats and the coast have benefited from both increased production and higher price - leading to rising rural income and declining poverty rates. That happy story may now be nearing its end - which could be the precursor to a renewed crisis in the agriculture sector of the state which is struggling to overcome from the spate of farmer suicides last year,"" N Raghavendra, agriculture expert from Shivamogga, said.The price of a quintal of high-quality red arecanut has plummeted to Rs 24,000-Rs 25,000 from Rs 35,000 last year, while other normal varieties ranges from Rs 18,000 to 20,000. The crisis, the growers complain, is due to abundant supply from Saarc countries after India opened up the market last year.""We have been getting cheap quality arecanut from Sri Lanka and it's being procured by Gutka-manufacturing companies. More than 1.01 lakh tonne of arecanut was imported till August 2016,"" said Ravi G, a member of Malnad Arecanut Marketing Cooperative Society.The situtation of coconut growers is no different. They are in a deeper crisis owing to price crash partly because of imports and bumper harvests in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The price of coconut, which until recently cost between Rs 20 and Rs 30 in the wholesale markets, crashed to below Rs 10, the lowest since 2006. A quintal of copra was hovering around Rs 6,500- Rs 7,000 in Tiptur, a major copra market of the state, while it was Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000 a year ago.The coffee season has also ended on a tepid note for growers. The farm gate price of the new arabica parchment is still hovering between Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,500 per 50 kg bag compared to Rs 10,000-Rs 11,000 last year. Attributing the current downtrend to excess global supplies and recession, Naveen Somaiah, a grower in Kodagu, said: ""The future looks bleak for us considering the problems we have been facing with shortage of labour and high production cost.''MSP for cash cropsWhile the Centre has assured it would look into the request to restrict import, chief minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with growers last week, told them that the state could not intervene since there's no provision to declare minimum support price (MSP) for cash crops. The growers want the state to set up revolving fund to tackle the crisis.Tomato growers see redThe price of tomato has plummeted to Re 1 per kg following heavy arrivals at wholesale markets across Karnataka. At retail shops in tomato-grown villages, it was being sold at Rs 5-Rs 6 per kg while in the wholesale market, the price was Re 1 per kg on Sunday, said APMC officials. Farmers held a protest in some places by spilling the vegetable on road demanding government's intervention.State bags awardThe Karnataka government has bagged the 'DL Shah Award-Platinum' at the 11th national quality conclave hosted by the Quality Council of India. Rashtriya e-Market Services MD and additional secretary, Manoj Ranjan, who spoke on 'Online agricultural markets-Karnataka model' highlighted the problems plaguing the marketing sector. He deliberated on the model's success in ensuring transparency in the functioning of markets by adopting better technology options.Of the 157 agricultural markets, 142 transact online, a first-of-its-kind in the country. The online markets have 25 lakh registered farmers.""Till date, we have traded 49 lakh lots with cumulative volume of 320 lakh quintals, valued at Rs 26,000 crore on the electronic platform."

When he increased the quantum of fertiliser used, the yield increased. However, his fertiliser costs increased from 6,000 to 15,000 a year. Sensing that something was amiss, he sent soil samples from his field for testing.That's when he found out that his soil had low nitrogen and carbon levels. Thangaraj is not alone in his dilemma. Nitrogen and organic carbon levels of much of the agricultural land in the district has plunged over the past few years.An analysis of the soil across across the district has revealed that 90% of the samples tested were found to be short of nitrogen and organic carbon, critical elements for healthy growth and absorption of nutrition for agriculture and horticulture crops. The agriculture department started testing soil samples under the Mission Soil Health Card' scheme in 2015 and so far has tested 26,000 samples.""On a scale of 1, organic carbon content was found to be less than 0.5, the desired level, in 11 of the 12 blocks in the district,"" said soil scientist and tester, Gurusamy.""This means that the crop will not be able retain essential nutrition from the soil like phosphorus, potassium and calcium, and thus humans and animals too miss out on those nutrients when consuming the crop,"" said Arumugam Karthikeyan, plant pathologist and scientist at the Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding.As part of the study, the agri department had divided 3.3 lakh hectares of cultivable land into grids of 10 hectare. To identify soil health, all a farmer needs to do is submit his land survey number to the block's agricultural department, and based on the grid his land falls under, he will get the results. ""We can prescribe the sort of crops he can cultivate, ways to reverse a bad situation like low nitrogen, carbon or phosphorus content and the inputs he requires,"" said the deputy director of the agriculture department, Coimbatore, Mohammed Iqbal.""While one hectare of land is supposed to have 280kg of nitrogen, in many parts of the district the nitrogen content was as low as 90kg. In fact, the average content was only 100kg,"" said Gurusamy.One of the main reasons behind this situation is intensive agriculture practices, say officials. ""Cultivating throughout the year without giving the soil a break, cutting and removing all leaves instead of putting it back into the soil, or even choosing varieties with low leaf production, has depleted the soil of its nutrients,"" said Iqbal.Restoring the nitrogen in the soil is a complicated process. ""The easiest way to deal with low carbon or nitrogen content is planting green manure crops for a couple of months, then mixing unused parts of the crop into the soil as it encourages growth of organisms,"" said retired soil scientist V Krishnamurthy. ""Farmers should also follow crop rotation,"" he futher said."

The prices have declined to Rs.500 per 30 kg box in the market. It was Rs.1,000 last week.Market sources say that bumper tomato production in Tamil Nadu early this season had forced the farmers in the Udumalai area to abandon their produce by the roadside as it could not even meet their transportation cost. Now yields from faraway places such as Hosur are arriving in the main markets. When there is a good demand, the prices tend to skyrocket and it had touched Rs.2,400 recently.Two varietiesSwapnesh, a retail vegetable seller, said that two varieties  nadan and apple tomato  are being sold. The nadan variety is locally available and the shelf life is too short. However, the market price for it is nearly half of the apple variety. The apple variety is in high demand in the market, he says.Shift in cropsTomato farmers of Vattavada and Kanthallur say that they shifted to other vegetables due to lack of timely procurement.Unlike other vegetables such as cabbage, potato, beetroot, and carrot, the harvest of ripe tomatoes cannot be delayed even for a day.We have to harvest them even if there is no demand for it, says Planisami of Vattavada. He added that it was one of the reasons for the farmers to abandon tomato cultivation.He said that timely procurement and proper storage facility were the need of the hour. Even when prices were at its peak, it was the middlemen who benefited and not the farmers. Only a steady price will benefit the farmers."

The kitchen essentials have turned into budget-spoilers for families.Insufficient rainfall and high temperatures have resulted in a severe shortage of tomatoes the dearest of them all as it is now retailing at Rs 80 a kg. Experts say no change is likely for at least a month.The city's supply of tomatoes is down by almost half, largely because of limited cultivation this year in areas like Nashik and Narayangaon. Other vegetables particularly cauliflower, green leafy vegetables, capsicum, chillies and garlic also face a similar scenario. Their rates have also soared over the past few weeks.According to those dealing with the commodities in the wholesale market, the situation is particularly worrisome this year with rainfall hardly picking up evenly across the state. Some express fear of a further upward spiral in prices, with supply coming from Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and even northern parts of the country selling at high rates. in the wholesale market.So limited is the stock reaching the city that the wholesale market clears out in just a few hours, said Anna Gule, who is in-charge of the fruits and vegetable sub-section of the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC). Describing the problems affecting the supply, Gule said, ""The inflow of vegetables is down by more than 40%. Besides tomatoes, prices of coriander and other green leafy vegetables are sky-rocketing. The problem is the lack of water in all vegetable growing districts. Unless the monsoon compensates for the drought, the situation is unlikely to change.The only saving grace has been onion, which has been cultivated in abundance this year, so its prices are stable till now.""The situation this year is completely different from the summer of 2015, when tomato growers sold their produce at throwaway prices, said city-based retailer Amol Tambe. , a city-based retailer who buys directly from them. ""Such was the glut of the tomato crop last year, that farmers actually got very poor market rate for their produce in the summer months. Prices, however, had surged around October and November 2015. This year water scarcity has meant dry fields for long stretches. As a result, the quality selling for Rs 45-55 a kilo hardly has any takers. Prices could stabilize by mid-July if it rains sufficiently in the next few weeks,"" he said.The steadily rising prices have already impacted the Consumer Price Index for May. Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed food inflation shot up to 7.55% in May, from 6.32% a month ago.Consumers, though unhappy, have no option but to adjust. City resident Seema Mangaonkar said, ""With the surge in prices, there are many things that are currently out of reach for me. We have no option but to adjust with the spiralling prices"".Another citizen Anshula Madan said, ""Tomatoes are a must in our cooking, so we buy and use them in limited quantities. Some of the really expensive vegetables are not even in season, so I pick what is easily available and reasonably priced."""

Regular visitors to these vans include daily wage earners and office-goers. On any given day, the customers are able to choose a variety and have a sumptuous meal at an affordable price.The minimum we charge is Rs. 20 a plate. We serve a wide range of food items - tomato rice, curd rice, vada. We have it all, says Saraswathi, who is part of a self-help group that prepares and sells food out of mobile vans. The food is prepared at home, loaded in large containers, and taken to different locations.The sales used to be high when the concept of selling food out of vans started in the city. But now-a-days we are facing stiff competition. Nevertheless, we usually have an agreement among ourselves not to sell the same item, says the driver of a food van near GKNM Hospital. Another problem that the owners of these vans face is packets that remain unsold.They also say that sales are usually low during the summer months compared to the rest of the year. We get about 70 customers a day. The group members invested the initial funds. After that, they received financial support from the government. Now, it is a profitable venture, says Saraswathi.There are about 2,000 such vans in the city and many of them are run by women self-help groups. They need to get a licence for this from several departments. In any given location, only one mobile unit functions within one km radius.A. Mujibur Rahman and G. Shakila Begum, a couple from Edayarpalayam, sell food packets near Nehru Stadium. The concept of selling food packets in a mobile van started in the city a decade ago. It is becoming popular now as customers get a wide variety at prices lower than that of hotels, says Ms. Begum. Since food is prepared and served by a group or a family and there is a continuous demand, it is a profitable venture, she says.Like hotels, we do not need tables, chairs and fans. That is the reason why the price is lesser by Rs.5 to Rs.10 compared to hotels and we will not function on Sundays, she adds.Some serve non-vegetarian dishes too. At the beginning, we would cook meat around three kg. But customers order biryani more than any other variety, and now we cook 10 kg of meat every day.Some vans donate the remaining food to non-government organisations for distribution to the needy.(With inputs fromS.

The price of chicken has also gone up, with a kilo being sold at Rs.135 in retail poultry outlets in Ernakulam. Chicken was sold in the Rs.100 range earlier.

Kolar Deputy Commissioner K.V. Trilokchandra has conceived an idea of converting tomato into animal fodder. He has submitted a plan to the State government, which has given the green signal for setting up a plant at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard in Kolar.Mr. Trilokchandra got the idea after seeing a huge quantity of the vegetable being abandoned at the yard, one of the largest tomato marketing yards in Asia. On an average, transactions involving 150-200 tonnes take place every day during lean season. About 15 tonnes are wasted during loading and unloading. At the same time, farmers dump huge quantities of tomatoes on the roadside when there is a glut. Now, this will be fed into the plant that will turn it into a lycopene-rich meal for poultry, cattle, pig, and fish. The plant is coming up on a 5,000 sq. ft. site at a cost of Rs. 1 crore and expected to produce around 20 tonnes of fodder every month, Mr. Trilokchandra said told The Hindu . The plant would be the first of its kind in the country, he said and added that the State government will provide money under the Challenge Fund, which is meant to encourage innovative projects.The methodLycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, which gives the red colour to tomatoes. It would be the main ingredient to produce the feed.The manufacture of fodder from tomato involves the following steps: Crushing waste through a roller, expeller and vibrator; dewatering of solid residue using a water extractor (centrifuge); cooking of solid residue using microwave reactor and dehydration of the cooked solid residue using alcohol in a microwave reactor."

Seventy-one hectares of non-bunched bananas also have been hit by the persisting hot weather conditions.Reports from Thiruvanthapuram, Kollam and Alappuzha districts said that around 11 hectares under betel vines had been hit.Around 60 per cent yield reduction is the least of the fallouts of the heat conditions, said a department official, who pointed out that vegetable cowpea, tomato and brinjal would be the most-affected vegetable crops.The most visible effect of the dry condition is the sharp drop in neera production. Production of the unfermented sweet sap from coconut flowers has fallen by about 65 per cent over a month, said Biju John, chief executive officer of Thirukochi Coconut Producer Company (TCPC).The average yield of around two litres of neera per day per tree in wetter conditions has fallen to between 600 and 800 ml a day, he added. The situation is difficult for companies like TCPC because the business is just taking off the ground and there is a big demand for neera in the market, said Mr. John.K. Krishnankutty, former MLA and head of the committee which drafted the Kerala agricultural development policy, said the State government should have acted in advance given the previous years experiences."
58f4bc6da3d24b0b70c18deb,Vegetable prices shoot up in city,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/vegetable-prices-shoot-up-in-city/article8554249.ece,2016-05-04,"The prolonged heat spell has started having an impact on vegetable prices in the city.In vegetable outlets, prices of beans, coriander, and lemon have risen steeply. In a wholesale outlet in the Chala market, beans were being sold at Rs.130 a kg, and tomato at Rs.40.The price of salad cucumber has shot up to Rs.38 from Rs.15, and beetroot to Rs.45 from Rs.28. In retails outlets, beans are being sold for anywhere between Rs.120 to Rs.135. The variation in prices depended somewhat on the wilting and damage to the vegetables, retail shop owners said.Those looking to savour the crunch and flavour of coriander as garnish are being forced to think again before buying the leaves, as the prices are hovering around Rs.160 a kg. Lemon prices traditionally increase in summer, but this year has seen them rise to Rs.12 for a single lemon. Lack of stock was to blame, a vegetable vendor at Karamana said.Chilli and capsicum too are expensive, while a host of veggies have shown minor price increase. The quality of vegetables was poor and a lot had to be thrown away because they started rotting quickly in the heat, the vendor said.There was not much decline in arrival of stock, but for veggies such as salad cucumber and capsicum that came from Bangalore. We did not get a load on Saturday and Sunday from Bangalore, as there is no stock there, the wholesaler outlet owner said.Vegetables such as tomatoes and ladys finger were particularly vulnerable to the heat, he said.While prices are a tad less in Horticorp outlets, they suffer from stock shortage and poor quality, and make up for it with purchases from Chala.Beans cost Rs.98 a kg in Horticorp outlets, and lemon Rs.140 for a kg. Salad cucumber costs Rs.42 a kg, and coriander Rs.120.Fruits such as oranges, guava, and pineapple too have become costly. Oranges cost Rs.120 a kg, pineapple Rs.50 to Rs.60, and guava Rs.100, a vendor at Poojappura said.Shops, both wholesale and retail, are stocking only what is needed. This place would have been full of vegetables usually, but now there is only what we can sell in a day or two, the wholesaler said.The prices would not change much in days to come, the vendors said, as the lack of rains had affected the crops."

Telegraph picture Finally, things have started moving in the right direction at the Jharkhand Mega Food Park at Getalsud, on the outskirts of capital Ranchi, providing a much-needed impetus to the long-delayed facility that is eyeing debut in the next couple of months. Kitchenmate, a firm owned by Ranchi-based entrepreneur Seema Jain and one of the first six companies to have shown interest in setting up shops, held bhumipoojan at the food park in Angara block, around 25km from the city, on Sunday. The Rs 4.75-crore unit, which has been allotted a one-acre plot, is likely to come up in five-six months. Kitchenmate managing director Seema (51) said the unit would process tomato, green chilli, garlic, tamarind etc for preparing paste/pure, ketchup and batter for idli, dosa, and bada under ready-to-cook and ready-to-serve categories. ""It will take another five-six months to complete the construction and start operations. We will procure vegetables from Bundu and Tamar blocks of Ranchi district, apart from Gumla and Lohardaga, for the unit with an installed capacity of 5MT ready-to-cook produces per day and 4MT ready-to-serve products per day,"" she told The Telegraph. Seema, a postgraduate in applied chemistry from Bhopal University, is a first generation entrepreneur. She and her husband Suresh Jain, who is a PhD in environmental sciences, are very enthusiastic about this venture that proposes to employ 20 local people for operations and maintenance. Food park project manager Rakesh Sahay said the Kitchenmate unit would help farmers earn better returns on their vegetables grown in different parts of Jharkhand, apart from making better use of forest produces. Kitchenmate is one of the six food processing companies, with interests ranging from tomato puree to green peas and cashew nut processing, that are expected to set up units soon at the 56-acre park, which can accommodate as many as 30 units. The other five - Eastern Manufacturing & Exports (frozen potato patties), Raha Enterprises (frozen snacks), Vijay Cashew Processing (cashew nut processing) and Mishti Foods & Engineering (tomato powder and vegetable dehydration) and Jharkhand Green Peas (green peas processing) - are likely to follow suit soon. Their cumulative investment will be around Rs 20 crores. Sources said the Rs 114 crore mega food park, the foundation of which was laid way back in 2009 by then Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay, was likely to be inaugurated within a couple of months. The park will have facilities like cold storage, warehouses, ripening chamber, water storage, power supply and effluent treatment plant (ETP) for the use of food processing units."

Picture by Prashant Mitra In a double delight for farmers, chief minister Raghubar Das on Thursday morning commissioned Jharkhand's biggest dairy plant in Hotwar, Ranchi, and in the afternoon, laid the foundation of a fruits and vegetables processing plant in Kanke block of the district. Touring the dairy before the formal launch, Das hailed it as a state-of-the-art facility. He said they were planning to set up similar plants in Deoghar and the Kolhan region in collaboration with NDDB ""to lay a network of milk routes and turnaround the socio-economic status of farmers living in the remotest parts of the state"". Built with an investment of Rs 19 crore, the fully automated dairy plant boasts an expansion capacity of up to 1.2 lakh litres, officials said. The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) completed the project, sprawling over 47 acres, in record time of a year. While the plant has a one-stop control hub, it is equipped with modern conveyor belts and a pasteuriser unit that can kill bacteria in 10,000 litres of milk at a time. Among the units that are ready is one where paneer, curd, lassi and ghee will be produced. Also ready are three cold storages with a combined capacity to hold 1.10 lakh litre of milk and its allied products. Dedicating the plant to dairy farmers in the state, the chief minister urged every citizen and villager to drink milk and eat milk products under Medha, the indigenous brand under Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation. ""When you start consuming, the money will go to our poor farmers. You get quality milk and milk products and farmers get a livelihood. This circle will put the state on the road to progress."" Sharing a thought from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Das said, ""When the government gives rebate to industries, it is called incentive; but when it gives the same to the poor, why is it called subsidy? I think the subsidy culture should end. From now on, we will focus on giving incentives to farmers."" Present on the occasion were NDDB chairman T. Nandkumar, state agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh, Ranchi MP Ram Tahal Choudhary, agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni and the chief minister's secretary Sunil K. Barnwal, besides hundreds of farmers from across the state. Nandkumar underscored that no one should think that the plant belonged to NDDB. ""It is your plant, your property, we are only caretakers for five years. Our aim is to ensure scientific and transparent collection of milk and make payments to you weekly, bi-weekly. So, you should connect with us and form a co-operative,"" he told farmers. Das agreed. He said through the government's ""cow distribution scheme"", farmers would be motivated to form co-operatives. On the food processing plant, managing director of Jharkhand milk federation B.S. Khanna said it would be set up by Mother Dairy on 27 acres in Titratoli village of Nagri in Kanke block. Mother Dairy will invest around Rs 70 crore for setting up the plant to yield products under Brand Safal or a new local brand if decided later. ""Initially, peas and tomato will be marketed. Frozen peas, tomato puree and pastes are some of the items that will be made available first. Later, vegetables like cabbage and beans will be available along with fruits like mango and guava,"" Khanna said, adding that tentatively it would take around two years for the plant to start functioning."
