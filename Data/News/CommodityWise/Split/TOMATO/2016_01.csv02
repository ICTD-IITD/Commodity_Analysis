But with many NGOs and philanthropists coming forward to serve people the process has been made easy, leaving smiles on the faces of lakhs of pilgrims each day.During the past five days, tens of lakhs of pilgrims were served lunch and dinner by the government-sponsored Akshaya Patra and many other NGOs based out of various parts of the State and city.Huge kitchenAkshaya Patra, which established one of the largest mechanised kitchens in south India in just 18 days, is alone capable of serving three lakh and more meals in a day. Starting with 75,000 people on day one the foundation is now serving about 2 lakh pilgrims a day at 15 locations near ghats and Pushkar Nagars, according to Project coordinator K. Pattabhiram.The kitchen which has 19 cauldrons that can cook food for 12,000 persons in just 15 minutes is headed by foundations city chapter president Maha Vishnu Dasa.Dishes like bisi bele bhath, khara pongal, lemon rice, vegetable biryani, zeera rice, coconut rice, sweet pongal and tomato rice are being distributed in plastic containers to the pilgrims.NGOs and associations like Krishna District Rice & Oil Millers Association, Sri Satya Sai Seve Organisations, Seethapathi Rama Annadana Trust, Pithapuram, East Godavari district and several others are actively contributing food to the pilgrims. Thousands of volunteers, including students from the city and other parts of the State, are behind these organisations.Chaos at timesHowever, on the flipside distribution of food in packets, instead of serving it in buffet style or with seating facility arranged, is causing chaotic situations now and then at the ghats and Pushkar Nagars.Sometimes its like distributing food during floods. Extending help to pilgrims is a great deed but an improper way should not lead to problems or minimise access to all, said Satyanarayana Raju, a pilgrim from East Godavari.I waited for half an hour in the crowd but failed to receive anything as food was finished. Government must set up specific counters from where food can be distributed in an organised manner which will prompt everyone to have it, he added. Also giving away food in packets and plastic containers excessively is leading to wastage as many pilgrims are dumping them later.It is servingfood to about2 lakh pilgrimsevery day at15 locations"

But Safal outlets like this one will take another two years to come up, even though a 27-acre land for a fruits and vegetable processing plant at Kanke is being handed over to Mother Dairy on February 11. Picture by Prashant Mitra If milk, veggies and fruits are the mainstay of a healthy diet, then Jharkhand is set to have ample supply of all three soon. February 11 is a red letter day when the chief minister will lay the foundation of a 20,000-tonne plant, set to be the home of Safal products, ranging from fresh vegetables to all kinds of fruits, marketed under the over-reaching arm of Mother Dairy. Das will, on the same day, also inaugurate a 1.2 lakh litre automated dairy set up for around Rs 19 crore under the aegis of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). ""Yes, February 11 will be a great moment for Jharkhand. Besides the dairy, we will also kick-start work to set up the food and vegetable processing plant. We have been trying for this project for a long time. Finally, with the chief minister's nod, it is off the ground,"" B.S. Khanna, MD of Jharkhand State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, told The Telegraph . The action is shifting to Kanke, where the Safal fruits and vegetable plant would come up, and Hotwar, where the milk plant is coming up. Both are on the outskirts of Ranchi, about 25km and 6km from the district headquarters respectively. The state cooperative federation, popularly referred to as Jharkhand Milk Fed, is managed by NDDB as a part of Jharkhand's tie up with the autonomous entity to boost the milk sector. Besides milk promotion, NDDB is also marketing other agrarian products and facilitating linkages. Brand Safal is owned by Mother Dairy, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of NDDB. Mother Dairy is investing around Rs 70 crore for setting up the plant across an area of 27 acre. To begin with, Khanna said, peas and tomatoes would be marketed. Later, vegetables like cabbage and bean would be added along with fruits like mangoes and guava. ""Frozen peas, tomato puree and various pastes are some of the items which will be made available first,"" he said, but added that it was yet to be decided whether these would be sold under the Safal brand or a new local brand. It would take around two years for the plant to start functioning. ""Two years is the buffer time. We expect it to be ready in one-and- a- half years,"" Khanna said. At Hotwar, the Rs 19 crore dairy, spread over 47 acres, is ready. Once operational, it will be the biggest milk processing unit with production capacity of 1.20 lakh litre. The three other state dairies at Ranchi's Ormanjhi, Koderma and Deoghar have a combined capacity of 40,000 litres. The Hotwar dairy boasts a programmed logic controller (PLC), which functions as a one-stop control hub. It is also equipped with modern conveyor belts and a pasteurizer unit that can kill bacteria in 10,000 litres of milk at a time. Among the units that are ready is one where paneer, curd, lassi and ghee will be produced. Also ready are three cold storages with a combined capacity to hold 1.10 lakh litre of milk and allied products. NDDB appointed plant manager Manoj Kumar said another unique feature of the dairy was its linkage with an effluent treatment plant (ETP). ""The ETP will recycle waste water from the dairy and make it suitable for irrigation. Thus, each and every drop of milk will be used,"" he said. After the new Hotwar dairy is in operation, Jharkhand's dependence on Bihar's Sudha brand of milk and milk products would come down drastically. ""Currently, Jharkhand requires 3 lakh litres of milk daily. The three existing dairies at Ranchi, Koderma and Deoghar produce 40,000 litres in all. Another 10,000 litres are procured from local dairy farmers, while the rest is imported from Sudha Dairy,"" said an agriculture department official."

""It said Ruchi's products had failed tests in some states.""The four-member team reached the Ruchi manufacturing unit around 3pm and left two hours later after collecting nine samples of edible oil and a mango drink. ""We found they had acquired licence only for edible oil storage and not for the mango drink, present in large quantities there. We have sought an explanation, within a week, on how they could store the drink without licence,"" Kashyap said.Food safety official Sudama Choudhary said the team found evidence of carrots being used in preparation of tomato sauce at Patli Gramodyog Kendra. ""Though processing was not done , we suspect carrot were being used because of its presence in very large quantity. The owner of the unit was missing and even the staff had absconded."""

PHOTO: Sudhakara JainWith the onset of the festive season, the prices of flowers have more than doubled since Monday. The month of Shravana flags off the wedding season and marks the beginning of the festive season with Varamahalakshmi this Friday. This has resulted in a huge demand for flowers and fresh fruits. The prices of quality Dutch roses have risen from Rs. 3-4 to Rs. 8 per piece in a span of a few days.This is the beginning of the wedding season  we send them (Dutch roses) across the country for decorative purposes. This demand is what pushes the prices northwards, said Jayaprakash Rao, general secretary, The South India Floriculture Association.Meanwhile, the price of Kanakambara has shot up from Rs. 1,000 a fortnight ago to Rs. 2,000 per kg . An arm-length of strung flowers is retailing at Rs. 100. Every flower costs 100 per cent higher now  prices could increase further by Thursday evening and Friday morning, said S. Srinivas, a wholesale flower vendor and member of the City Market Flower Vendors Association.Sampige and jasmine are now selling for Rs. 400 a kg and Rs. 200 per arm-length. Sevantige, Sugandha Raja and Kanigle flowers cost Rs. 200 per kg while the stringed cost Rs. 50 per arm-length, Mr. Srinivas added.Dutch roses, Gerbera and Coronation are grown in protected cultivation in 400 hectares in Dodballapur, Nelamangala, Tumakuru, Chickballapur and Hosur belt, the highest in the country. Nearly 4,000 roses are grown in every hectare. While the total number of roses grown this season that is sent to every part of the country is approximately 16 lakh, Bengaluru consumes 30 per cent of this, said Mr. Jayaprakash Rao.Veggie prices fallThe prices of vegetables have dropped considerably compared to last month, said B.

Photo: AFPScientists unveiled on Monday the gene in carrots that gives rise to carotenoids, a critical source of Vitamin A and the pigment that turns some fruits and vegetables bright orange or red.Un-poetically dubbed DCAR_032551, the star gene emerged from the first complete decoding of the carrot genome, published in the scientific journal Nature Genetics .Vitamin A deficiency is a global health challenge, the study pointed out.Its plentiful carotenoids make carrot an important source of provitamin A in the human diet.Carotenoids were first discovered in carrots (hence the name), but which among the vegetables newly tallied 32,115 genes was most responsible for their formation remained a mystery. The researchers sequenced the genome of a bright orange variety of the vegetable called the Nantes carrot, named for the French city.Daucus carota now joins a select club of about a dozen veggies  including the potato, cucumber, tomato and pepper  whose complete genomes have been sequenced.Laying bare the humble carrots genetic secrets will make it easier to enhance disease resistance and nutritive value in other species, the researchers said.Having identified the mechanism controlling the accumulation of carotenoid, it may be possible  through gene-editing, for example  to import it to other staple root vegetables such as the cassava, native to South American and widely grown in Africa. These results will facilitate biological discovery and crop improvement in carrots and other crops, said Philipp Simon, senior author and a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Among vegetables spinach and peas are widely associated with growing up strong, but its hard to beat the carrot when it comes to health boosters.Carrots are loaded with beta-carotene, a natural chemical that the body can transform into Vitamin A.The deeper the orange colour, the more beta-carotene.Carotenoids are also antioxidants, which are thought to protect against heart disease and some forms of cancer by neutralising so-called free radicals, single oxygen atoms that can damage cells.Some of these compounds can prevent disease, Mr. Simon said.Carrots are an interesting crop to work on because of their wide range of diversity. They are familiar to everyone, and generally well-regarded by consumers, but like most familiar things, people dont necessarily know the background stories, said Mr. Simon, led the study published in the journal Nature Genetics .Interestingly, carrots  along with many other plants  have about 20 per cent more genes than humans.Looking back at the plants family tree, scientists have been able to determine that it split with the grape about 113 million years ago and from the kiwi about 10 million years after that, when dinosaurs still lorded over the planet.Originally white, the wild ancestors of the carrot likely came from central Asia. The earliest record of carrots as a root crop dates from 1,100 years ago in Afghanistan, but those were yellow carrots and purple ones, not orange ones. Paintings from 16th century Spain and Germany provide the first unmistakable evidence for orange carrots. Global crop production of the root has quadrupled in the last 40 years and is today eaten everywhere in the world.  AFP/Reuters"

Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income.""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha. We don't have money even for transporting them,"" said Kamal Singh.""Almost 5,000 farmers in the entire district are facing this problem while, Prime Minister Modi launched the National Agriculture Market on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar'', Vidisha district panchayat member Kailash Raghuvanshi told TOI.He said farmers are in a poor condition and cannot get money in return as so many of them have not availed crop insurance policy due to administrative hassles. ""Chief minister Chouhan had sowed tomatoes in a 10 acre area. Initially he sold 15 quintals at a high price but the moment price crashed, he asked for free distribution in slum areas,"" said Raghuvanshi.The cost of sowing tomatoes in one bigha (2.5 acres) is estimated to Rs 40,000. As the district recorded a bumper crop, one bigha received 17,500 kgs of tomatoes. But at a rate of Rs 2 a kg or less, the farmers are not getting even Rs 35,000 from a bigha.""The farmers are compelled to throw away their crop in the garbage or feed the cattle. There is no alternative,"" said Radhuvanshi, adding, many farmers were also cheated by middlemen who pay less than Rs 2 for a kg and sell the crop in retail markets of Bhopal and nearby cities at Rs 15 to Rs 20 a kg.With government making efforts to double the income of farmers, the new crisis will not only hit the farm community financially but also mentally, who were looking for 'ache din' after numerous schemes announced by the Centre.-----------Photo caption :Workers distributing tomatoes grown at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's farm house, to poor families on Friday------"
