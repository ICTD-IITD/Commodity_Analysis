Halalingaiah, Senior Assistant Director of the Horticulture Department told The Hindu on Friday.However, this will prevail provided there are no gusty winds, which will result in fruit-falls. Since it is the development stage of mango fruit, the rain is good for it, he said.But the same cannot be said in the case of tomato. Though a decline in temperature will help the crop, there are chances of aggravation of diseases owing to a sudden fall in the temperature and increase in humidity, he said. Continuous rain like in November last might also spell doom for tomato, he added.A water-starved region, Kolar is bereft of a perennial water source. With the lakes and tanks drying up, there is a crying need for a permanent irrigation project. Implementation of G.S. Paramashivaiah report has been the main demand of the people of the region. Yettinahole project, a part of this plan, is swamped in controversy.In spite of several plans and proposals, people are suffering and eagerly awaiting a scientific and sustainable project to quench their thirst and irrigate their crops."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives. RSN MKJ ABI"

It will be for the first time that orange juice made of the fruit grown in this region will be packaged as a brand, said Patanjali Ayurved's managing director Acharya Balkrishna . This will also be the first expansion of existing facility near Haridwar Another unit is also being planned in Bundelkhand that also faces agrarian distress with talks under way with both UP and MP governments. There are plans to gain foothold in the north-east after that. The company has tied up with SBI and PNB for funding. The project will have a 75:25 debt to equity ratio, he said.""We are not here for business alone. The larger aim is to develop this region which is infamous for farmers' suicides. The plant is expected to link nearly 50,000 farmers as suppliers, create direct employment for over 5,000 people and eventually provide indirect employment to nearly 5 lakh families,"" said Balkrishna.The main focus will be on food products using the produce grown in the region and nearby. ""What we have been selling so far in the name of orange juice is actually juice of kinoo or malta fruit grown which is not actually orange. Now the oranges for which Nagpur is famous will be used,"" he said. The plant will also have a line for making herbal extracts, apart from personal care products.The company plans to hold a ground-breaking ceremony on September 10. MADC sources said other formalities like payment of first tranche of land cost are under process. The final approval to ground-breaking ceremony will be given only after the payment is made. Ramdev Baba is expected to come for the function.""Farmers will be trained to grow crops like orange, aloe vera, tomato and herbs according to our specifications and given a purchase guarantee. A team of scientists and other experts is also working on the project that is expected to change the farm economy of the region,"" Balkrishna said.Apart from Mihan, Patanjali also had plans to start a food park in Katol for which the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) has begun acquisition of over 200 acres land. Balkrishna said the Katol land had not come into company's possession yet. The main focus would be on Mihan and it was likely the area in Katol may be used for training the farmers in the future.

MADC has fixed a rate of Rs1 crore per acre for land outside SEZ area in Mihan.However, when tenders were called, the reserve price was fixed at Rs25 lakh an acre. After the first round in which two bids were received, Patanjali emerged as the sole bidder and bagged the deal in third round. Sources said Patanjali had quoted around 5% above the reserve price. The reserve price was lowered on grounds that land offered in the tender was not developed.In order to compensate its loss, MADC has hiked the rates for rest of the land by 15%. The matter was reported by TOI on August 12.Balkrishna said the company wanted land cost to be low but had gone through all formalities and had bagged the deal in competitive bidding. It is ready to give away the land at same rate at which it got from MADC if any other company was ready to do business following the same terms and conditions as Patanjali."

The recent rains had resulted in almost all the farmers going in for tomato cultivation in addition to other crops, which has resulted in the high supply to markets.He said that even farmers in Chekkanoorani and Alanganallur in Madurai, Theni and Andipatti in Theni district, had cultivated tomatoes in large areas, resulting in the high yield.Even two weeks ago, a 15 kg box of tomatoes had sold for Rs 60, but now it has come down to just Rs 15, and the wholesale price in the market on Saturday was Rs 4 per kg. Sekar predicted that the price would go down further at least for another month.Horticulture department sources from Dindigul where tomatoes are cultivated in over 6,000 acres in Palani and Oddanchatram blocks, said that the crops, which have a 65-day growth period will continue to yield from 140 to 150 days after which the prices would go up, as summer seasons do not favour pollination and tomato cultivation.A farmer from Reddiarchathiram in Dindigul district said that they are facing heavy losses. ""It is only profitable when a 15 kg box sells for Rs 100.Anything lesser is a loss,"" he said. The cultivation cost for an acre of tomatoes works out to about Rs 50,000. About seven people have to be employed to pick the tomatoes and each worker is paid Rs 150 per day as wages. The picking is done twice a week.

After we returned the fire, the armed assailants fled the spot,"" ASP Ashwini Mishra said.In a daylong operation backed by two special action teams and a CRPF company, a group of policemen destroyed crops on around 100 acres of land. ""The operation will continue till the crop on the remaining 400 acres is destroyed,"" said Chatra SP Anjani Kumar Jha.Police said Maoists patronize opium crop cultivation in inaccessible terrains to make money to fund their struggle. In some places, however, criminals have also got into this illegal trade to make moollah. ""Only two shots were fired by the criminals whereas Maoists generally fire multiple shots. The objective was to discourage our team from destroying the crop,"" the ASP said.A police officer said the cultivation of opium crop on one acre requires an investment of Rs 30,000. An acre of crop yields around five to six kilograms of raw opium, which fetches Rs 25,000 per kg in the market. The growers pay Rs 10,000 to the local police for each acre of harvested poppy crop. Ultimately the grower ends up earning Rs 60,000 mullah from every acre of poppy crop.ASP Mishra said the raw opium is preserved in households in Maoist-hit areas before being divided into small packets and finally being loaded into trucks passing through the GT-Road and crossing Chatra to reach Punjab, Haryana and other north Indian cities. In the past, raw opium packets being transported via GT Road have been seized.""The poppy plants look similar to tomato plants in the initial 20 days of their 30-40 day life. It is difficult to differentiate between the two. In inaccessible lands where police do not venture due to the Maoist fear, opium crops are sown, harvested and sold,"" the police officer said.In the past, police have destroyed such crops in Khunti, Giridih, Palamu, Garhwa, Latehar, Hazaribag and other districts.Confirming this, police spokesperson S N Pradhan said, ""It has been observed that the cultivation is backed by Maoists and criminals. We gather information through our network and pass it on to the SPs to take action,"" Pradhan said."

Of the total 133 hectares (332 acres) land, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares (208 acres). As only five wineries became operational in the wine park, the industries had demanded the government to allow food processing units on the remaining 50 hectares (125 acres).During an industrial exhibition in April last year, Nashik-based industrial associations had approached state industries minister Subhash Desai with their demand. Desai too had given positive response to the industrial associations. Accordingly, the MIDC gave approval in September for allowing industries to set up food processing units at Vinchur.Now, the MIDC is in the process of developing infrastructure such as roads, water supply and streetlights among others and is also conducting a survey for the purpose.

This has kept traders away from taluka's villages, a villager said. The farmer's decision has boomeranged on farmers and the result is that tomato prices at the beginning of the season itself has fallen below Rs 10 a kg.Nagjibhai Takore, sarpanch of Lakshmipura village, said the prices will further fall when the tomato season is at its peak in the last week of November.""As of now, the tomato crop which is arriving in the markets in Ahmedabad is coming from Nasik apart from Kadi area. Once the crop from Kadi starts flooding the market, the prices will fall further,"" said Takore.Sarpanch of Yashvantpura, Dashrath Patel, said lack of exports is making tomato an unprofitable for farmers in the region. ""The are many reasons for this,"" said Patel. ""The first is that exporters who usually arrive have not come this time. Moreover, there has been a bumper crop in Nasik and other areas. Also this year the the climate was hotter than last year and, hence, the quality of our tomatoes suffered.""Takore said that several villages had announced that they would not sell their produce to traders for Pakistan. ""Hence the traders from Delhi and Punjab have stayed away from the villages,"" he said.However, sarpanch of Vekra village, Nikul Patel, said prices being offered for tomato are very low and hence the farmers are incurring huge losses. The farmers are not even able to recover their investment, forget profits. At least six traders from Punjab and Delhi come to the village regularly by the last week of October but this year they have not come because trade with Pakistan has almost come to an end due to tension on the border.Chairman of Khadi Agriculture Produce Market Committee , Vinod Patel, said the quality of the crop is also not good. ""Apart from quality, the traders from Punjab are keeping away from the region this year as there are no exports to Pakistan,"" Patel said.Ramesh Patel, member of Kisan Agro, says that sowing of tomato takes places in nearly 5000 bigahs of land.

The farmers said that they never craved for bumper benefits, but were bogged down with sudden dropping of prices which would force them to abandon the crops in the fields as the scenario would throw them into a quandary with the labour charges becoming more than the tomato market price.They informed the Minister to take measures for stabilising the prices at at least Rs. 350 per crate with 30 kg of tomatoes. Responding to their plea, Mr Pulla Rao said that he would place the same before Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.Later, the Minister inspected the rain guns at K.V.

Sadashiva, one of the main criteria for the award was the social and economic impact the research work had on society. These tomato varieties are not only high-yielding, but also show high resistance to three major diseases.This reduces the cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards the cost of fungicides and pesticides, he noted.The fruits of these varieties are suitable for long-distance transportation as they are firm and have a shelf life of 15 to 20 days as against 10 to 12 days of other hybrids, and six to eight days of ordinary tomato varieties, Dr. Sadashiva added.Arka Rakshak, which gives a yield of up to 19 kg a plant, is already sought after by farmers and traders in eight countries.The award for the year 2013-14 was presented recently at a programme held in New Delhi to the nine-member team led by Dr. Sadashiva, principal scientist and Head of the Division of Vegetable Crops, IIHR.The other members of the team are Dr. Peter Hanson, Dr. M. Krishna Reddy, Dr. Girija Ganeshan, Dr. C. Gopalakrishnan, Dr. K. Madhavi Reddy, Dr. S. Shankara Hebbar, Dr. T.H. Singh and Dr. K.V. Ravishankar."

58f54da17be9e01a17c96c72,Maharashtra shows the way in dealing with children's nutrition,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/Maharashtra-shows-the-way-in-dealing-with-childrens-nutrition/articleshow/53939728.cms,2016-08-31,"JAIPUR: JIn January last year, the state government identified 4,300 children less than five years old who were 'severely, acutely malnourished' (SAM). A more recent survey has shown that over 36% of children in the state are stunted. A meeting on Tuesday of NGOs, which health minister Rajendra Singh Rathore also addressed, dwelt on nutrition financing in the state. The one speaker who had much to offer in terms of learning was Suprabha Agarwal, head of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra.Jack Clift of international NGO Results for Development said his studies had shown that there was a 69% shortfall in nutrition financing in the state. Not only is the allocation insufficient, what money is indeed allocated is not entirely utilized. Under the ICDS programme, for instance, figures for 2014-15 showed 41% underutilization of funds in Rajasthan.Suprabha Agarwal, director of the nutrition mission of Maharashtra, said the nutrition mission in her state was not an implementing agency - it was concerned with proper utilization of resources and strengthening the work of field workers. The mission was launched in 2005, and in the first phase, the emphasis was on strengthening ICDS. In the second phase that began from 2010, the need for effective communication was understood; some feedback received from the community was worked into the programme. It was also recognized that malnutrition cannot be 'treated' - it was best to work for prevention, and for that, women in the fertile age range needed to be properly nourished. The programme has now entered its third phase.Agarwal said the mission worked with a slim team of less than 10 experts for the whole state. However, working with grassroots level workers and encouraging them to adopt imaginative ways to resolve problems has shown great results.""We asked communities to contribute, and received Rs200 crore. We told our anganwadi workers that they should hang out baskets in front of their anganwadis and encourage people to contribute whatever they could. A farmer might only put in one tomato and another might deliver two brinjals - all this could go into the meal cooked for children. The response has been phenomenal. We thought we might only gather enough material for the use of the angwanwadi on one day, but we find we are gathering a surplus and have now devised local earthenware-made refrigeration to store vegetables. During the drought, some farmers told us that they could not offer vegetables, and so gave us some grain. We now have a storage problem to deal with!""Agarwal spoke of effective partnerships with corporate firms under the CSR head, and also networking and collections from communities. ""However, even now, we often have to explain the need for our work to other departments of government. That is one challenge, working in coordination with different wings of the government whose functions overlap. And we need our experts to serve longer terms so that there is continuity in our work. We also feel the need to develop a robust database so we can validate the data we receive from ICDS and other government efforts. "" she said."
