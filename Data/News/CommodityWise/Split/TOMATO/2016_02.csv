Another 41 nursing students were treated as out patients. Nursing students who take up duties at OGH and turn up for academics from 11 am to 3 pm simultaneously -- blamed the unhygienic food being served by a private contractor at the hostel mess for their sickness.""The students fell ill soon after they consumed tomato rice and onion curry, served at our hostel mess on Friday,"" complained a nursing student, on condition of anonymity, while blaming a private mess contractor for the incident. In fact, unsafe water is being suspected for the food contamination as several students pointed out how that the overhead tank used for storing water for cooking purposes, was not cleaned even once in the last one year.""With the Rs 12,00 per month they collect from us, they not just serve us unhygienic food but also use cheaply available vegetables in the market like onions, ivy gourd (dondakaya), potatoes and lady fingers for making curries,"" said another student.The students expressed fear that other students too may show symptoms of food poisoning as a total of 179 nursing students had consumed the same food served at the hostel. When contacted, Dr Mohd Rafi, resident medical officer (RMO), Osmania General Hospital, said that condition of all the admitted nursing students are stable.""There appears to be bacterial contamination in the food that the students consumed at their hostel mess. We are questioning the mess caretaker,"" said Dr Rafi, adding that they have administered intravenous fluid to the admitted students.Meanwhile, water samples from the hostel mess of the school of nursing has been sent for testing to the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) on Saturday."

File PhotoThe price of tomato, which had shot through the roof barely two months ago, has plummeted now. Tomato is not being sold for Rs. 4 a kg in the retail market.The price crash has been attributed to a glut in the production. Tomato has been grown in large quantities in and around Mysuru, leading to a fall in the price, president of the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS), Mysuru, Bore Gowda told The Hindu .Tomato was being sold at around Rs. 70 a kg during May and early June.Extension leader and assistant professor at the College of Horticulture in Mysuru Harish B.S. attributed the good harvest of tomato to two reasons  delayed monsoon which helped farmers reap a large quantity of disease-free crop and use of advanced horticulture technologies such as mulching, drip irrigation and fertigation (injection of chemicals in the irrigation system).He attributed the fluctuation in the price of tomato to erratic supply. The lack of proper planning often leads to such a situation. The crop has to be planned to meet the needs of the market, he said.The price of tomato had shot up sharply because of extremely poor output during the summer days. A large number of farmers cultivating it in a big way has resulted in the glut.Earlier, farmers used to grow tomato only in small plots of land. But now, we have farmers growing tomato in 50- and 100- acre plots in different parts of Mysuru district. Cultivation of tomato is not restricted to rain-fed areas. It is being grown even in irrigated areas also, said Mr. Harish.He pointed out that there was a need for the Horticulture Department to plan cultivation of a particular crop.Retail price of tomatoRs. 65 to Rs. 70 a kg in May and early JuneRs. 4 a kg in August"

Vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed around two weeks ago, have now declined.Chillies and tomatoes, which were selling for as much as Rs 200 per kg and Rs 120 per kg, respectively in the retail market, now cost around Rs 80 per kg and Rs 50 per kg, respectively. Onion prices, too, have dropped from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 15 per kg in Nashik's retail market.Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik Agrucultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), told TOI, ""The supply of vegetables had been affected in Nashik APMC due to the strike by traders and incessant rain around 12 days ago. The supply was already poor due to drought. This, overall, had led to high vegetable prices. But supply has regularised because of the rain and because the strike has been called off by traders, leading to a drop in prices.""He said the vegetable auction process has normalised in the APMC, with farmers bringing their produce for auction regularly. The supply is likely to improve further after a month, given the good monsoon till now, Kale added.Laxman Gade, a farmer, reiterated that vegetable arrivals would increase in around one-and-a-half month's time.""After the rains, vegetable supply has increased to some extent. I sold 25 crates of tomatoes for Rs 600 each (20 kg a crate). Moreover, I also did not have to pay commission to the agent. Earlier, I had to pay 6% commission,"" Gade said.Poor supply had caused retail tomato prices to double from Rs 40 per kg in May to Rs 80 per kg in June. The price of the kitchen staple had touched an all-time high of Rs 120 per kg on July 12, following incessant rain and the traders' strike. But it is now selling for around Rs 50 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, chilli prices have also dropped after improved supply.The onion was the only vegetable whose price had remained unaffected in June. It was selling at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market. But this had also doubled to Rs 20 per kg on July 12. The price has now declined by 25% to Rs 15 per kg.Homemaker Shweta Salunke said, ""Vegetable prices have dropped as compared to the prices a few days ago. Our budget had taken a severe toll due to costly vegetables, but the prices seem to be coming under control now. Farmers must sell their produce directly to consumers so that vegetables remain affordable."""

On the 18,000-strong Nagpur Foodies group on Facebook, effusive praise of how Param ennobles the humble lentil dish into something sublime is common. At Satranjipura on Old Bhandara Road, inquiry about the dalwallah prompts almost reflexive pointing in the right direction. And yet, for a first-timer, the place might as well be invisible.Reason? The eatery has no real name. No board, however tiny or rickety, announces its presence. ""It's the place where all the big vessels are kept out front,"" a paan seller says.Like quite a few eateries in the West which similarly choose to make themselves obscure by not having any signage, Param remains hidden in plain sight, a haunt for only those who care to seek it out.And when they do, they can't stop licking their fingers. The tiny, ramshackle place with four tables and benches and a vestibule for a kitchen serves all of three things: Dal, tandoori rotis and a fried rice with tomatoes and onions, fried in butter until it goes a mellow brown. No wonder, the wait for a table can be as long as an hour and a half. Taking a parcel is the most sensible thing.Every other restaurant makes dal that is more or less tasty. So, what exactly is it about Param ki dal that draws the people here from far and wide? ""I honestly don't know, baauji,"" the painfully reticent owner, who identifies himself as only Param to this journalist, says. ""You will have to ask that to our customers."" Those who love it say the charcoal-fired tandoor gives it an unparalleled smoky flavour, and that the balance of flavours is perfect.Keeping an eye on a large vessel containing boiling dal and kneading dough for the roti, Param reveals that the eatery has been running since 45 years. ""My elder brother, my four sons and I run it,"" Param, a spindly Sardar with a silver beard and his trademark orange turban, says.Despite the rundown appearance of the place, Param insists that even families don't hesitate coming here to eat. ""The only problem is drunkards from the bars nearby,"" he says. True enough, a tipsy man soon totters in and demands food. He is promptly shooed away.Why don't they spruce up the place or move to a bigger location? ""No, no, we have a small business. We make a limited amount every day. This place is enough,"" he adds.It's true. The joint remains open for only five hours a day: 1pm to 3pm and 5pm to 8pm, or until stocks last. They never do. And when they run out, foodies fondly remember Param saying apologetically: ""Baauji, khana khatam ho gaya.""No matter. Tomorrow, they will return, like they always do, to the dal shop with no name."

You can take your beloved for a movie in Chennai, but not to eat out if you don't want to burn a hole in your pocket.As per a latest study on living conditions, Chennai is the least expensive city when it comes to movie tickets, but on the steeper side when it comes to eat-outs and fine dining -with the city being 25% more expensive than Bangalore for food away from home. For young wannabes, Chennai can't really be considered an ""it"" destination for clothes, footwear or alcohol.While the state boasts of a booming textile and leather industry, the cost of manufacturing locally doesn't make branded accessories and clothing cheaper here. Chennai heads India as the most expensive city when it comes to branded clothing and leather goods -with the sector seeing an inflation of 4% -followed by Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata, according to Mercer's 2016 Quality of Living Rankings.Globally the city has a ranking of 158 among 209 cities in the world, which looks at many different metrics like the cost of eat-outs, movie tickets, clothing, footwear, ho me rentals to rank cities.Mumbai heads the country as the most expensive city on all criteria measured with a global ranking of 82, followed by New Delhi and then Chennai at third place.Over the last three years, Chennai as a city seems to have become more expensive in comparison to metros worldwide with its position moving up to 158 in 2015-16 from 185 in 2013-14. Among the noticeable trends we have seen is the surge in house rents in Chennai, rentals of unfurnished apartments have gone up on average by as much as 13%,"" says Ruchika Pal, India Practice Leader, Global Mobility Mercer. And cooking at home really wouldn't be that much of a money saver as the cost of grocery, dairy and poultry products in Chennai is as expensive as in Mumbai and Delhi.""Crop damage because of the recent heat wave, has also pushed up the prices of vegetable. Among metros, Chennai recently recorded the high est price of tomato, at Rs 80 per kg today compared with Rs 44 per kg on June 1,"" said Mercer in a statement.Only with regard to the transport issue does Chen transport issue does Chennai score well. Chennai has a working, affordable public transport system and lesser state taxes on fuel making it more cheap than cities like Bengaluru. The garden city ranked highest in India when it came to transportation expenses, which includes taxi fares, cost of auto and auto parts as well as running costs and road tax, fuel tax.When it comes to people wanting to live on the wild side, Chennai does believe in making them pay dearly for their vices. Chennai ranks second, only after Mumbai, in the country in alcohol and tobacco prices."

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166. The maximum prices of tomato and potato was Rs 80 and Rs 35/kg, respectively."

The price of lady's finger varied between 29 and 44 while native tomato was priced between 14 and 22.These prices are even higher than those quoted at the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Retail Market on Friday. At the retail store, high quality brinjal and lady's finger were priced at 30 while the native tomato cost only 10 per kg.Uzhavar Sandhai was started in 1999 by the state government to promote direct contact between farmers and consumers. Though it was called off between 2001 and 2006, it was revived in 2006 and has been continuing since. The prices are fixed by the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board, based on the day's wholesale and retail prices. The aim of the initiative is to ensure fresh vegetables and fruits are sold to the public at a reasonable price daily.Customers who regularly shop for vegetables and fruits at the farmers'markets say that it has not been the case for many months now. ""We regularly visit the Uzhavar Sandhai at Vadavalli to buy vegetables, but when we go to Pazhamudhir Nilayam to buy certain fruits, we notice that the prices are hardly 2 more per kilo there,"" says S Saritha, a domestic maid in Kurumbapalayam. ""In fact, if you visit Anna Market in the morning, vegetables are often the same price as Uzhavar Sandhai and often even cheaper,"" she says.The agriculture officers posted at the farmers' markets however deny that their prices could be as high as retail prices. ""We usually take the previous night's prices from Thyagi Kumaran Market, the morning prices from Anna Market and Thondamuthur Market and retail prices from Saibaba Colony,"" said an administrative officer at R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai, who refused to be named.""We take an average and fix the price 20% higher than the wholesale price and 20% lower than the retail price. If the farmers insist, we increase the prices by 2 to 3 above the fixed price. But it cannot be more than the prices in retail supermarkets,"" he insists.Consumer activists say that a 20% mark up gives farmers an undue advantage. ""The bus fare for farmers and their vegetables is free. They have no rentals or commission to pay for the stalls. Thus, they basically have no expenses. If they are bypassing traders, their prices should at least match wholesale prices,"" says secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Voice, N Logu.""The men selling vegetables and fruits there are not farmers but traders or people who make use of their identity cards, claiming to be their employees or relatives,"" says G A Wahab, secretary of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Traders Association. ""They claim to be selling better quality vegetables at a higher price. This is not true. They sell surplus and trader rejected vegetables and fruits at a higher price,"" he added.Farmers however say their profit margins are not high. ""We usually get 5 more per kg when we sell directly at the Sandhai. Sometimes, we procure the vegetables from neighbouring farms and sell them at these markets. My onions are priced 5 lower than the retail price,"" said D Pandiavel, a farmer.Saravanan, another farmer in Vadavalli market: Our land and cultivation practices were seen by the horticulture officer in our block who gave us the ID cards. It was also seen by the village administrative officer who verified the ID card. It also mentions the specific vegetables we grow. We do admit that we sometimes buy a few vegetables from Ooty farmers and sell them here. But we are farmers."

On Thursday, as hungry consumers walked into certain stores of the world's largest burger chain here, they were surprised to find their burgers and wraps bereft of the familiar vegetable.A notice displayed at the out lets by Connaught Plaza Restaurants, which operates McDonald's stores in northern and eastern regions of the country, explained that the company was unable to add tomatoes in various products due to temporary unavailability. Unpredictable conditions have impacted the tomato crop, its quality and supply, the notice said.In the past few months, tomato prices in the country have spiked. The latest wholesale price inflation data showed vegetable prices jumped 17% year-on-year in June. Retail prices also revealed a similar stubborn trend. On Thursday, online grocer BigBasket listed the price of tomatoes as Rs 69 per kg on its website.However, senior executives at McDonald's India said the move to curtail the use of tomatoes in its offerings was not the result of high prices but poor quality . ""We are working towards resolving this issue,"" said a spokesperson for McDonald's India (North & East).Executives at several McDonald's outlets in the capital that TOI spoke to said the company was currently not using any substitute for tomato. ""We are making do with lettuce and onions.

Veggie prices have not just hit the roof but blown a hole right through it with green peas and beans touching Rs 190 per kg, putting them beyond the reach of the common man.Prices of vegetables have swung wildly from one extreme to the other in the last few months. In March, prices crashed with most vegetables selling at even Rs 10-15 per kg but that was before the onset of summer. Traders blamed the soaring temperature for pushing up prices to record levels, saying that supplies had reduced as vegetable crops have wilted under the scorching heat.""The rates will remain high for at least a month till the city receives steady supplies from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka,"" said Vegetable Market Association advisor, V R Soundararajan. He said a box of tomatoes weighing 14kg was sold in the wholesale market for Rs 800 while the retailer was selling it at around Rs 80 per kg.In branded supermarkets, even green chillies are selling at Rs 120 per kg. ""The prices of vegetables are so expensive that even a bunch of coriander costs Rs 10.

Though it's all in jest, Rakesh knows it's their way of winking at the dark cloud that settled over their family in June last year. A medical test revealed that their obedient son - who had pursued mechanical engineering to join the family's steel manufacturing business - didn't quite see the world the same way they did. ""We had all only heard of night blindness,"" says Rakesh, who was diagnosed with colour blindness. ""It was as if the world blacked out for me,"" says the engineer, who realised he won't be able to gauge the differences in metal at various stages of steel processing and would have to kiss goodbye to his dream.A resident of a small city in North India, Rakesh is now sitting in a family-run medical centre in Chembur where hope has drawn him. Though there is no known cure for colour blindness, he wants to believe in the clinic's claim of reversing fate within months. Here, in a test that asked Rakesh to pick up two matching crayons and draw parallel lines with them, there is a green line next to a red one. Previously, a doctor he approached had compared the retina to a TV with three antennae - red, blue and green. ""If one of them doesn't work, it could damage how you see all shades,"" the doctor had told Rakesh who suffered from red-green colour blindness, the most common variant. He often tries hard to recall if he ever painted skin blue or mixed colours wrong in art class but only ends up confused. Someone up there had messed with his antennae but, to him, the transmission always felt normal.Globally, nature is known to fiddle with the colour palettes of one out of every 12 men and one of 200 women. While describing this genetic condition, doctors are wary of using the word 'blindness' and prefer 'deficiency'. ""It's not that patients cannot see colour at all,"" says opthalmologist Kavindra Rajoria. ""Due to deficient photo-receptors, they are not able to see certain hues and tell the difference between them."" Among the visuals explaining what the world looks like to patients, a local clinic uses a Tom and Jerry screen grab in which both cat and mouse look jaundiced. ""It's like tone-deafness,"" says a colour-blind musician in the international short 'No Such Thing As Color'. ""Colour is an artefact of perceptions. Who's to say what you are seeing is really the colour you say it is?"" he rationalises.Philosophy, however, is a poor comforter for patients in India, who grapple with a bleak future. It isn't until later in life, when they appear for medical tests for government jobs that most Indian men realise they have a problem and many have to abandon dreams of joining the army, navy, aviation or jobs involving chemicals or colours. For 26-year-old Sarvesh, who grew up in Jabalpur and now lives in Mumbai, the verdict came in 2005 when he couldn't pass the medical test for aviation in India. ""Before that, I had been flying in Australia on a pilot's license,"" says the well-built pilot, who was forced to look for new career options on moving back to his home country. ""I don't know why India sees it as an impediment for pilots. There have been no accidents in Australia and in fact, during World War II, colourblind people were used in spy planes as they could see contours better,"" says Sarvesh, who usually boasts a thick skin but recalls not being able to laugh off deliberately-posed questions like: ""Can you get that blue bag for us?""While coping with the invisible condition, desperation takes over. ""Many break down,"" says opthalmologist K K Goyal, recalling a phone call from Kerala at two in the night. ""I am going to commit suicide,"" said a despondent man who had spent nearly Rs 30 lakh on aviation training before the diagnosis clipped his wings. Goyal has also met patients from small villages who have sold their lands for the sake of education.Problems could range from everyday situations such as not being able to see the queen on a carrom board to not being able to read traffic lights. Besides an aspiring cricketer who complained that he could not see the ball, Goyal has also come across an exporter of green tomatoes in Gujarat whose business suffered because of his deficiency. ""If there happened to be a red tomato in a vehicle full of green ones, his eyes would see the entire cart of tomatoes as red,"" says Goyal.Many prefer hiding the deficiency from the world like stutterers, some fear it hurting marriage prospects and others hate the questions. ""People's usual reaction,"" says 28-yearold Pradeep, ""is to point at things like walls and bedsheets and ask what colour they are."" For this Delhi-based power system consultant, the diagnosis in 2009 brought with it genuine confusion. Today, he has learnt to be smarter. Pradeep, who drives from Noida to Sector 15 daily for work, has memorised the order of the traffic signal and knows that the arrow denotes green and the circle, red."" Someone told him that wearing glasses of the colour that poses a problem would help but he has yet to try it.In retrospect, Rakesh, clinging to hope at a Mumbai clinic says he would have studied chartered accountancy if he had discovered his problem earlier.

It now costs Rs 30-35 at the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai. This is due to a shortage as the yield has been low.Tomatoes are sourced from Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border and the central and southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Since the yield is low, some tomato consignments are being diverted to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where there is a shortage. So the prices have increased in Tamil Nadu. Retail prices in different parts of Chennai varied from Rs 60 to 90 on Monday. In Madurai, tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kg in May last year now costs as much as Rs 70.Experts are blaming climate change for the price rise. Tomato crops in thousands of acres were lost due to high afternoon temperature that prevailed in the months of February and March, says project officer of the Center of Excellence for Vegetables K Srinivasan. ""Tomato is a temperature-sensitive plant. The flowers open up and pollination takes place during the Feb- March season when the afternoon temperature is around 35 degree Celsius. But this year, temperature had soared to above 40 degree Celsius in many places, affecting the crop,"" he told TOI.Such a change in temperature has not been witnessed in the past five decades, he says. ""The stigma of the plant has to be supple to aid pollination, but this year, most of the plants developed rigid stigmas, which affected the flowering process,"" he added.In the southern region tomato is cultivated in about 8,000 acres in Dindigul district, mainly in Palani, Reddiarchathiram and Oddanchathiram blocks. However, the area under cultivation was reduced to less than half because the plants were not able to survive the heat, farmers said. One such farmer, K Sundaramoorthy from Dindigul, lost his entire crop due to the prevailing temperature and lack of rain.In Madurai, another vegetable that has become costly is the green chilli, which is selling at Rs 90 in the retail market and Rs 70 in the wholesale market. ""This is due to the high temperatures, which has affected the flowering of crops,"" says K Vivekanandan a farmer from Theni. The supply to the market had come down from 10 truck loads last week to just two to three loads now.Farmers say that the price of the tomatoes will come down only after the monsoon sets in, in June. ""The prices are going to keep skyrocketing because there is no production of tomatoes throughout Tamil Nadu at present to meet the market expectations,"" added Thiagarajan.In Trichy, the areas around Vaiyampatti near Manapparai account for a considerable production of tomatoes. According to horticulture department officials, around 50 hectares in Vaiyampatti are involved in tomato production during March, April and May."

Earlier, I would spend around Rs 300 per week for vegetables. Now I am spending Rs 450-500 instead. The government needs to take strict measures to bring inflation under control.

The duty is, however, lower than 25 per cent proposed by the Food Ministry.India, the world's second largest sugar producer after Brazil, has exported 1.6 million tonnes of sugar so far in the 2015-16 marketing year (October-September). Further exports are unlikely to take place with this decision.With retail sugar prices soaring to around Rs 40/kg from Rs 30/kg six months ago, the government has taken various steps to contain prices including withdrawal of export-linked production subsidy and imposition of stock limits on traders.Last week, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan had announced that his ministry has proposed to ""levy 25 per cent custom duty on export of sugar"" to keep exports under control.""Global sugar prices are rising and therefore traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" he had said.Industry body Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) did not offer any comments immediately.However, a senior industry official welcomed the decision in view of tight demand-supply situation expected in the next 2016-17 marketing year starting October.With imposition of export duty, the official said that exports have become unviable.An increase of 50 per cent in global sugar prices in last three months due to disruption in supply from Brazil had made exports viable.The country's sugar production is estimated to decline to 25 million tonnes in 2015-16, as against 28.3 million tonnes last year. The annual domestic demand is pegged at 26 million tonnes.Moreover, the government has forecast further decline in output in next year at 23-24 million tonnes. However, it has maintained that there would be no shortage as the country would have the opening stock of 7 million tonnes at the start of the next marketing year, taking total availability to 30-31 million tonnes."

As a result, a full meal which used to cost Rs.60 at a conventional mess till recently, now costs Rs. 80.Generally, escalating prices of vegetables, pulses and other commodities have an impact on the costs of meals. This year, along with these factors, mess owners are forced to hike the meals charges due to the abnormal rise in rents in the city.It is a general practice for landlords to revise rents by 10 per cent every year. But ever since the government announced Vijayawada as the temporary capital of the State and has been focusing on shifting the durbar from Hyderabad to Amaravati, rents have been jacked up drastically.This was anticipated. My landlord increased the rent abnormally and I had no choice but to pass on the increase in the operational costs to consumers. Hence, a meal now costs Rs.80, said an owner of mess on Tikkle Road. The worst thing, most owners are demanding the tenants to vacate the premises in hope of getting higher rents from their next tenants. We are on a sticky wicket. After establishing the business, neither can we vacate the premises for the fear of losing income nor can run the business from a fresh location as it will cost even more, adds another mess owner.It is not just mess owners, hotels and restaurants too are planning to revise the charges shortly. Escalating rents are definitely a factor, but one has to consider the rising prices of pulses, labour costs, vegetables too. A kg of red gram still costs more than Rs. 160 and the price of a kg black gram continues to hover around Rs.170, explains a member of Vijayawada Hotels Association.This apart, prices of tomatoes, carrots, ribbed gourd, lady fingers have increased drastically when compared to last year. Vegetable traders inform that it is mainly due to poor arrivals. Earlier, vegetables used to be supplied from rural areas like Mylavaram in Krishna district and neighbouring areas but now most arrivals come from Prakasam district. Citing transportation costs, traders have increased the vegetables prices, he informs.Sharp increase in rentals andhike inprices of essential commodities make eatery owners in the city pass the rise in operational cost on to consumers"

A number of shops were seen dealing with endless customers who have been swarming to meet their last-minute needs. Vegetable vendors were striking a fair deal with the visitors who were stuffing their bags with brinjals, tomatoes, onions and potatoes.This was the early morning scene at Peethalavanipalem located between Sivajipalem and Pithapuram Colony. This century-year-old village, where the locals once grew crops like maize and tobacco, is now a bustling colony. With a perennial stream flowing through the area, the place was once a convenient place for farming. As one explores deep into the neighbourhood, some of the original residents talk about how the colony has been witnessing accelerated growth in terms of urbanisation for the last six decades. Though the entire colony stretches up to four acres, there are about 7,000 people who live in this locality. Today, there is no trace of the natural stream as it has been replaced by a number of concrete structures. Cattle rearing and farming used to be the prime sources of income for majority of people.However, with urbanisation taking a toll on the natural rural setting, there is barley any original landmark existing in Peethalavanipalem, says Peethala Sanyasi Naidu, who has been living here for decades.There are several multi-storeyed group houses that dot the area. Sri Krishna Nilayam school, a Shiva temple, a number of grocery stores, health clinics, and a cancer screening prevention research centre cum Translational Research Institute of Molecular Sciences form a part of the map. People say major portion of the site was once owned by Peethala Paidiah, a colony resident. His descendants, who continue to live in the same place, reveal that the neighbourhood suffers from poor sanitation.Since there is no proper drainage system in place, the area is flooded with sewage water during rainy season. In addition to this, the open drains that pass through the lanes have been blocked at several points as many residents conveniently dump their domestic waste into them. Sanitation workers who visit the area are not equipped with adequate bins, brooms and other necessary equipment. As a result, the cleaning process takes a beating, says Botta Neelima, former corporator who plans to create awareness campaign on health and hygiene involving GVMC workers across the ward.Zone II Commissioner: P.

With the prevailing drought conditions, the prices of vegetables have gone through the roof in the district.Residents here are worried over the price of tomato that has reached Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kilogram when compared to Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg last year. Broad beans, the cheapest vegetable earlier and that which usually is available in abundance, now costs Rs. 80 per kg in the market. The prices of almost all vegetables have gone up with ridge-gourd costing Rs. 80 per kg, chillies- Rs. 80; bitter gourd - Rs. 60; cauliflower and cabbage - Rs. 40 and drumstick - Rs. 100 per kg. The cultivation of vegetables has come down drastically owing to prevailing drought conditions and depleting groundwater table in the district. The vegetables cultivated in Kudurupaka, Ithrajpalli, Gopalpur, Thimmapur, Velichala, Gudem, Chenjerla and other villages are usually shifted to Karimnagar town markets. But due to the declined flow, the markets are no more the centres of activity. Tomato used to arrive here from Madanapalli in Chittoor district. But following the recent rains and floods in Chittoor, farmers lost their crop resulting in no supplies for the district. Decline in production leading to shortage of vegetables is not just the only reason for price rise. Pest attack on vegetables is another cause that has resulted in less yield this season.My weekly vegetable bill has gone up from Rs. 150 to Rs. 250 due to escalation in prices, complains Manisha, a resident of Jyothinagar."

A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest. He said that imported tomatoes should be randomly checked for infection and infected fruits destroyed. He also said that farmers should be trained to detect the symptoms of attack by tuta absoluta.Deploying pheromone traps in all stages of the crop has been found effective against leaf miner.Use of sticky traps or water-oil traps with pheromone bait; deployment of parasitoids and predators too are effective."

Acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to Rs80 a kg. Although it is much less than the record high of over Rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. There may be no respite till the winters. Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar."

Not only the tomatoes, wholesale price of onions too have plumetted to 20 to 30 paise a kg, almost negligible, in several districts including Vidisha, Neemuch and Mandsaur, where farmers cannot afford even transportation cost.Vidisha, also the parliamentary constituency of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, reported a bumper harvest of tomatoes which has resulted into low demand, leaving the farmers in tears.

Demand is greater than supply which is causing prices to rise at Jamalpur too,"" he said.Kishan Paliwal, a cook working in Satellite and Manekbaug areas said: ""Most of the people I work for have asked me to use the bare minimum of tomatoes in my cooking. People have also started adding potatoes to their vegetable preparations. For example, I was asked to add a couple of potatoes in my lady finger dish.""Shital Patel said she had started using fewer tomatoes in gravies, and the red vegetable has totally disappeared from her salad platter. She said that with prices shooting up, she was using one tomato in her gravy where she earlier used three."

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses.

Vegetables like tomato and potato are being sold at Rs 60 and Rs 20 per kg while most green vegetables are priced above Rs 40 per kg. Lack of rain has badly affected the local harvest as well as supply from other states, and is the main reason for the price rise, insiders said.""It is nearly a fortnight or more the prices of all vegetables are going over the roofs. It has become really unmanageable to give a balanced diet to children these days as pulses and vegetables have gone beyond the reach of common man,"" said Bandita Kar, a school teacher.At a time when there should be continuous rain a drought-like situation prevails at most parts of the state. ""The rainfall in the second week of June was inadequate for crops and affected cultivation. The situation is similar in other states, leading to a drop in the supply of green vegetables,"" said Sudarshan Sahu, a vegetable vendor in the Unit-I market here.Prices of most vegetables doubled in the last few weeks. Beans are being sold for Rs 100 per kg while drumsticks fetch Rs 140 for every kilo. Brinjal is selling at Rs 50 per kg while lady finger, bitter gourd and ridge gourd comes with a tag of Rs 40, spiny gourd and parval at Rs 50.For vegetables the city generally depends on nearby rural areas like Nimapada, Balianta, Pipili, Niali and so on. Vegetables also come from districts like Jajpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack, Nayagarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj and Puri districts.""Odisha is one of the largest producers of green vegetables but due to lack of proper crop management and storage facilities it has to depend on other states for 20% of its vegetable consumption,"" said an officer in the state horticulture department."

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

Similarly, the wholesale rate of lady's finger is Rs 25/kg but is selling at Rs 50/kg in retail.

Ridge gourd, bitter gourd and raddish prices are hovering around Rs 40 and Rs 10.RV Gopi, president, Vegetable Merchants' Association, said the prices of vegetables like tomato and beans were high because of excessive heat in summer which had dried up water resources, thus affecting the yield drastically.Vegetables like cabbage had become costlier, up from Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg, because it was off-season.Traders said vegetables like ridge ground, bitter gourd and raddish were unaffected by the blistering summer heat because they are grown in horticulture gardens and on a very low scale, unlike beans and tomato that are cultivated on a large scale. There's also a dip in the supply of tomatoes from various places in Karnataka and the vegetable is being sourced for Bengaluru from Maharashtra, they added.Gopi, however, said online retailers are making a killing on select vegetables that some households consider essential with profit as the only motive.Choudhury Md Idrees, secretary Russel Market Traders Association, said though Hopcoms prices are cheaper compared to other open retail markets, consumers, including large-scale buyers like restaurant owners, still prefer the latter as it meet the demands for both quality and variety."

While rain has affected the yield, the intense heat after a short spell of rain prevented tomato plants from flowering. ""The supply has shrunk due to lack of production. For a short while farmers who cultivate tomatoes will get good prices,"" commented K Devaraj , a farming community leader.

But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up.

Instead, prices of essential commodities had increased and there was no sign of the government retrieving black money. By presenting fudged statistics to the people, the BJP government tried to deceive the people. The Tamil Nadu government was no different.At the time of the 2014 Parliamentary election, the BJP promised that if it were to be voted to power it would control prices.

The price of sugar had tripled and all this led to the common man shelling more money out of his pocket.The BJP claimed that Prime Ministers foreign visits brought foreign direct investment into the country and that it led to job creation. But the reality was very different. Young people were either unemployed or underemployed. Plus the jobs that were being created were not permanent. Most of those were temporary or contractual in nature.The CPM cadre also said that the jobs in labour-intensive sectors like textile, spinning mills, leather, transport, etc. had fallen."

The method was simple research analysis to highlight key economic policies.He said, ""While the country had left behind the licence-quota-permit raj and opened up for foreign direct investment in greater number of sectors, what had come to afflict the economy was the 'exit problem'."" He was referring to how loss-making firms found it difficult to exit and citied the example of fertilizer sector. The inefficient firms were not even employment-intensive and so it was easy for them to shut down. ""There is a need to readjust and recalibrate exit,"" he pointed out.He further said he was excited about the clothing sector to bring in growth and social transformation; it was much more labour-intensive than sectors like auto and steel and had the potential to empower women by creating jobs for them. He also said it was one of the areas where shrinking share by the Chinese could be cornered by Indian firms.Subramanian said Brexit was one of the significant developments with serious political and economic consequences for both the UK and Europe, but India would not be affected by it due to its solid macroeconomics.""Brexit is a setback for liberalization. It is a landmark moment in history since World War II,"" he said. Brexit has reversed the experiment by European countries for togetherness as a collective entity.The CEA blamed under-cultivation and inadequate production for rise in prices of pulses. In the backdrop of surge in tomato price, he said fluctuation in vegetable prices was linked to market forces rather than cultivation. ""The markets should be made better to stabilize vegetable prices,"" he said.Subramanian also spoke on the need for strengthening the state's role in bridging fiscal relations between the rich and poor people and regretted low fiscal capacity of the country due to unusually low base of taxpayers. The ratio of voters to taxpayers in the country stands at 4%, but it should be 23% for a country at its level of economic and political development.As a legitimate tool to reduce gap between the rich and the poor, the state should build a mechanism under which there should be delivery of public goods for all, but the bounties for well-offs must be reduced and they should be taxed regardless of source of income, Subramanian said. Stating that the state is spending Rs 76,000 crore on the well-offs by way of various subsidies, he suggested such dole outs should be done away with.He also emphasized on spreading JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) for financial inclusion of the poor and said the government was moving in the right direction by spreading Jan Dhan and Aadhaar schemes.He said the government has three pending agendas  GST, strategic disinvestment and twin balance sheets. On inequality, he said the debate in the West might be misleading in the Indian context as the Indian economy needed education, health and employment."

However, they are yet to take up protected cultivation of crops using the greenhouse technology in a full-fledged manner in Sattupalli, Yerrupalem, Penuballi and Khammam rural mandals, sources added.In an effort to give an impetus to poly-house farming, the Horticulture Department has constructed two poly greenhouses  one each at its horticulture farms in Garimellapadu in Kothagudem mandal and Atchutapuram in Aswaraopeta mandal  exclusively for demonstration purpose.

In the wholesale market, the price is Rs. 50 per kilo. Retailers sell a kilo at Rs. 60, he said.Like tomatoes, the cost of a number of vegetables has skyrocketed.

Supply is hit due to low production due to the heat conditions.Vegetables such as brinjal, beans and avarakkai cost more as the yield is low.A kilo of brinjal (thorn variety) costs Rs. 40, while buying beans could burn a hole in the pockets of consumers. A kilo of beans is priced at Rs. 80 to 100, while avarakkai costs Rs. 60, he said.Onions offer consolation for consumers as the price continue to be normal at Rs. 10 to 15.

However, nobody is cultivating traditional crops like kodra (eleusine corocana), sariara (amaranth) and kathu (buck wheat), and the number of them growing wheat, barley, red rice and corn too are on the decline.This is because, tempted by greater profits, farmers in this region are now growing vegetables. In some cases, even apple-growers have taken to cultivating vegetables like tomato, cauliflower and cabbage. Global warming having an adverse impact on the yield of apple in region is a major reason behind farmers dumping apple for vegetables.Two decades ago, a majority of the 65,000 hectartes of agriculture land in the district was under paddy, wheat, barley, corn, pulses and other traditional crops. As fruits helped improve the returns for farmers, they started converting agriculture land into fruit orchards. Agriculture department deputy director Rajinder Singh Verma said 'kodra' and most traditional crops had vanished in Kullu.""Very few people are now into wheat, barley and corn cultivation. The graph of these crops is decreasing regularly. Farmers are getting no income from these crops and they are choosing to cultivate only cash crops which have encouraged them to go for vegetable production,"" he said, while talking to TOI."

Many claims have been made about natural ingredients that possess powerful anti-cancerous properties and do not have any side-effects. One of the more popular substances in this regard is quercetin, a naturally occurring compound in several fruits and vegetables.How it worksA team from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) explains the quercetin phenomenon. Quercetin, known to cause anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activity, reportedly induces apoptosis, a process by which cells commit suicide in a controlled manner. The compound is also said to prevent multiplication of cancerous cells by blocking the process of cell division. It can even kill the highly aggressive leukaemia cell line K562, which is resistant to most anti-cancerous drugs.Quercetin is abundantly found in commonly available food items such as tomatoes, broccoli, raw asparagus, raw red onion, red and black grapes, apple, apricot, cherry and coriander.It is an originally purified compound, which is now also commercially purified and sold. There are many compounds like quercetin, but it is one of the most common ones, said Satheesh C. Raghavan, Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, IISc.The team conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of the compound by not only looking at the cancer cell line, but also by inducing cancerous tumours in mice.What was found was that quercetin treatment significantly reduced the size of the cancerous tumour in the experimental animals. The compound also interacted with the mices DNA, which is one of the mechanisms by which it can destroy cancerous cells.Significantly, quercetin was found to have no adverse effects on the non-cancerous cells even while killing the cancerous ones, including in the experimental animals.Another studyA second study conducted on extract prepared from the medicinal plant Vernonia condensata, which is used in the treatment of cough, pneumonia, stomach ache, digestive problems, muscular pain, liver problems, snakebite and diarrhoea, also exhibited a similar cancer cell-killing effect.Though its potential as an anticancer drug is clear, Prof. Raghavan said its effect could be limited when used in isolation. It would vary from person to person, as is in the case of any regular treatment, he said, adding that it could work better in combination with other treatment."

Edible fish are grown in a tank. Their poop enriches the water with nutrients. This water is pumped into gravel beds with edible plants rooted in them. As the water flows through the gravel beds, the plants roots and the bacteria that grow on the gravel take nutrients from the water. This nourishes the plants and cleans the water. The clean water then flows back into the fish tank. To find the feasibility of raising various types of vegetables in aquaponics, studies have been conducted at Hi-Tech Research and Training Unit, (HTR-TU), Kerala Agricultural University, Vellanikkara, said P. Suseela, Associate Professor, HTR&TU.Here crops like salad cucumber, tomato, yard long bean, cabbage, cauliflower, mint, lettuce and palak have been raised successfully. It doesnt need acres of land. The space required for aquaponics is much less than a traditional garden. After the system is set up the maintenance cost is comparatively less. In this system, we will get healthy, fresh organic food and fresh fish. Water and nutrient delivery to the plants is completely automated. Water need of aquaponics is less than 10% of traditional farming and pest attack is less. Plants grow twice faster, she said."

In some places, it is retailing at Rs 160 per kg.All-time highThe price of several vegetables has reached an all-time high since January 2016. One of the reasons is a shortfall in supplies, say retailers.Even root vegetables, like beetroot and radish, which usually sell at less than Rs. 20, have crossed the Rs. 40 mark while a kilo of garlic has gone from Rs. 80 per kilo to Rs. 140.A procurement official from a leading retail chain said that supply had dipped to a meagre 35 to 40 per cent of normal. The fall has been attributed to the unusually hot weather during the last two weeks of April and the first week of May when the temperature crossed the 39 degree Celsius mark in many parts of Karnataka. This resulted in crops failure.Vegetables from other StatesWhat has actually kept the prices in check is the supply of certain veggies from other States. Every day, around 150 tonnes of tomatoes are being pumped into the Bengaluru market from Nashik in Maharashtra. Significant quantities of carrot and beans are being supplied from Tamil Nadu. However, the quality of tomatoes from Nashik is not good, owing to which prices are yet to stabilise, a senior Hopcoms official said.The market is yet to reap the benefit of the recent spell of rain.The recent spell has pulled the mercury level down and made water available, but the impact will not be felt on prices for another two weeks, said a senior Hopcoms official.G.

Last year, when a group of homeopathy students from Malaysia and Iraq were in the city at the Shaad Homoeopathic Hospital and Research Centre for their residential training, an informal visit to a village in Umrer triggered an experiment in using homeopathy in agriculture.During the visit organized by Rotary Club of South East, the students happened to compare the size and quality of Bhiwapuri chillies at Manora village near Umrer, just for fun. Then, suddenly one of the students thought aloud whether homeopathy would work on plants. This led to the experiment to check the effect of homeopathic medicines in improving yield and quality of vegetable crops. The experiment got reasonably good results in six vegetables.""I had heard and read some basic literature about Vaikunthanath Das Kaviraj from Netherlands using homeopathy for agriculture diseases. Hence, when this idea came, I decided to give it a try. Agro-homeopathy is in its infancy. But I feel that in the days of organic farming, homeopathy could improve yield and minimize costs,"" said Dr Aadil Chimthanawala, who has published the team's findings in the National Academy of Homeopathy, India (NAHI) Times.The entire Chimthanawala family; Aadil's father Dr Kasim Chimthanawala, wife Dr Fatema Chimthanawala, and mother Dr Sagira Chimthanawala, was excited with the idea. They first experimented in the laboratory at Shaad Hospital in Itwari, and then replicated it in the fields and obtained good results there too.The father-son duo, Dr Kasim and Dr Adil, both are qualified allopaths but have been practicing homeopathy for decades, are very open to any scientific criticism or trials by others. ""We wish some agriculture scientists takes up the project and validates the findings. We are not agriculturists or even scientists. We wish the department of Ayush nominates some university or scientist to further the research,"" said Dr Kasim.The two doctors have always believed in scientific treatment of patients. Hence, they studied basic medicine (MBBS degree) to understand the functioning of the human body, the anatomy and physiology. Now, they want science to take its own course in establishing their findings and hence are not making any tall claims.The experiments included use of potentized doses of silicea (silica), sulphur, magnesium pros, phosphorous, calcarea carbonicum on methi or fenugreek, tomatoes, green chilli (capsicum annum), brinjal, French beans and spinach or palak respectively as liquid sprays. The experiments resulted in not just increase in yield of vegetables, but also bigger, thicker and greener leaves in the leafy vegetables.Dr Aadil doesn't hesitate in admitting that, for reasons unknown to him, homeopathic medicines didn't work in certain crops. ""We got very bad results with potato. They didn't germinate. But there is no harm in continuing the experiment further on other crops like grains and fruits etc. We would be happy if some agriculture scientists join us and guide us. At present, we have just tried to increase the yield but can try them for controlling diseases too,"" he said.Explaining some of the homeopathic medicines used, Dr Kasim Chimthanawala said in animals or humans use of silicea helps improve assimilating capacity of any substance or elements in the body of the person. For example, in human body it helps absorb calcium better.* Homeopathic medicines were either dissolved in water or applied to the plants or used as sprays* All experiments were conducted using non-manured soil* In fenugreek or methi, plants became stunted but their roots had much better grip in soil and leaves were greener and thicker* In chilli, use of magnesium pros couldn't produce any changes and could not control the leaf curl syndrome in plants* In French beans, medicine instilled enough immunity to survive rust disease with better yield"

Owing to the annual mandatory seasonal fishing ban, non-vegetarians have to make do with chicken, beef and other meat, which has shown a 30% increase in prices.Now, this is on top of the price increase in pulses, vegetables and fruits, which has refused to stabilize yet.Even the not-so-non vegetarian eggs have boiled out of aam aadmi's hands with prices now going up to 60 from 25 a few years back.""Most of the meat that is produced in the country is being exported abroad. In such a scenario, there is little left for locals to consume. Besides the public being affected, less stock of meat/chicken has also hit our business,"" said a meat trader, Hussain Khatim. ""The government should export India's meat within limits. What is the point of rearing livestock if citizens themselves cannot consume?"" he added.TOI had earlier reported on the prices of tomatoes and chilies, which reached new heights with exorbitant rates.""Tomatoes and chilies were selling at 100 and 120 per kg respectively. Never in my 40 years of business have I seen such inflation,"" said a vegetable seller, Dayanand Amonkar..""The government brings in tonnes of vegetables form Belgaum for the state horticulture outlets. Instead, if all these vegetables are locally produced, then there won't be such fluctuating rates each season. Even Goans should return to farming instead of selling their farmlands to developmental zones."" he said.The prices of pulses have skyrocketed by 80-100% in the past five years, while that of vegetables have gone up by approximately 50%. ""Pulses rates were always stable, but since 2014, there has been a steep increase in prices. So much so that the rates have doubled over time,"" said local vendor, Vijay Kumar. ""What is alarming is that even the rates of local pulses like red chana, kulid seeds, ansalna and chavli have gone up,"" he added. Vendors at Panaji market said that lack of rain for the past two years at places where pulses are grown has affected the crop. ""As a result of less produce and more demand, the rates have significantly shot up,"" said another vendor, Nitin Mandrekar.Sources from the department of agriculture said that recent droughts in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh have resulted in poor vegetable crop. Moreover, climatic conditions like unseasonal rains, showers during Kharif season and even the recent hailstorm in Sattarta region have resulted in destruction of good crops."

Now, the 86-year-old is back in the city she was born taking the community count up by one. And, she has taken upon herself the onerous task of keeping the authentic Jewish flavours alive for her nine-member strong community. Yes, you read it right: nine.Demographers put the strength of the Jewish community in the city at less than 20, but the members are rather strict about who they call ""pure"". Those that have married ""outside"" the community are strictly not ""pure"" Jews.""I have come back to the city because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most...but I am keeping the flame alive,"" she says.Silliman also happens to be among the last keepers of the community's ancient recipes and has decided to chronicle the unique tastes for posterity.""Even the food that Jews here have today is not what we are permitted by our religion. There's so much of mix and match that most of the authentic cuisine that is over 5,000 years old and has its roots in the Middle East, is lost. I am trying to keep the tradition alive by documenting the recipes and rustling up dishes for feasts,"" says Silliman.Jewish food is special because Jews just can't eat cause Jews just can't eat anything and everything, Silliman says. Their food -kosher -has to abide by strict dietary laws which not only lay down what is forbidden but also the process of cooking, the ingredients and the kitchen specifications. Kosher, for example, does not permit meat to be mixed with milk or milk products.So, neither can you mix the two while cooking, nor can you consume milk or milk products after having meat. Flower Silliman says: ""Judaism has a great similari ty with Hinduism so far as its antiquity and dietary specifications go. It's another matter that most followers of both religions have drifted away from these guidelines... perhaps because they have often found it difficult to cope with such restrictions. I am not saying this by way of criticism, but the fact is that cuisines, and even cultures, become extinct because of such interpolation.""A traditional sit-down Jewish feast on Friday night can ideally start with beet khatta with koobah (beet soup with chicken or vegetable balls), followed by Jewish roast chicken, which is different from the European roast in the kind of marinades and spices used. ""The authentic Jewish roast will be far milder, both in flavour and sharpness, compared to the European roast,"" Silliman says.Kosher allows Jews to only have fish that have scales, and not those with shells (prawns, crabs or lobsters). ""So you have items like fish shoofta, which is minced fish skewers. Vegetable lovers have choices like vegetable mahashas, which is stuffed tomatoes and capsicum.But the magic is in the recipe for the stuffing. The authenticity of the dish is heightened when served with aloo makalla (a special potato fry), hulba (a sort of fenugreek, mint and coriander chutney) and cucum ber zalata. Another speciality is mutton or vegetable ingree -a layered meat dish baked with brinjals, tomatoes and potatoes -not unlike the Greek moussaka, but without dairy to keep within kosher limits,"" Silliman explains with the lucidity of an expert.And why not? While abroad, Silliman served as a souschef at the Plaza in Jerusalem and launched the world's only kosher Jewish restaurant, Maharaja. She taught cooking and ran masterchef shows in US and London and authored two books. ""I have come back to Kolkata because this is where the Jews have lived most safe and free, but unfortunately , this is where our numbers have dwindled the most... but I am keeping the flame alive."""

It wasn't too long ago that the Clintons and Trumps professed to be friends, with Clintons attending Trump's third marriage, Trump donating to the Clinton Foundation and playing golf with the former president, who had appointed Trump's sister as a circuit court judge. Their daughters were said to be close friends.All that is now social history, as the two White House aspirants are bidding for a piece of political history. Their supporters are now clashing angrily and violently. A skirmish in San Jose, California on Thursday outside a Trump rally resulted in a barrage of tomatoes, eggs, and heated words.Hours before that, in what was presented as a major foreign policy speech delivered in San Diego , Clinton let loose a fusillade of scornful putdowns and scorching slights of the kind seldom heard in the higher reaches of US politics, which is generally governed by an unwritten civil code of conduct, broken largely in 2017 by the tempestuous Trump. Clinton hit back forcefully.""Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different - they are dangerously incoherent. They're not even really ideas - just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies,"" she began at the top of her 30-minute speech, much of which was aimed at demolishing the maverick billionaire's obvious lack of depth and substance. She added: ""He is not just unprepared - he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.""Cautioning Americans that electing Trump to the White House would be a ""historic mistake,"" Clinton pointed to his testy, knee-jerk, off-the-cuff responses, warning that ""This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes - because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin."" Trump publicly gets snippy at anyone asking him questions pretty much about anything.""We cannot let him roll the dice with America... he believes we can treat the US economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world,"" Clinton said, adding, ""The stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels. We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table - bragging, mocking, composing nasty tweets - I'm willing to bet he's writing a few right now.""Hours later, an obviously stung Trump responded petulantly: ""After what she said about me today in her phony speech - that was a phony speech, that was a Donald Trump hit job - I will say this: Hillary Clinton has to go to jail, okay?""""She has to go to jail. Has to go to jail,"" he repeated in a speech in San Jose amid cheers from his supporters."

The Centre announced that it is looking at importing pulses from Myanmar as India stares at a huge gap between demand and domestic availability. ""If the private players are not importing enough, then we have to take the necessary steps to reduce the gap,"" food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.In 2015-16 crop year, production of pulses is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes while demand is pegged at 23.5mt. Even after imports by private firms, the country is staring at shortage of about 18 lakh tonnes.Soaring food prices, particularly pulses, vegetables and dairy products, has been the key driver of both retail and wholesale price inflation.Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Monday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 5.8% in May from previous month's 5.5% increase. The food price index jumped 7.6% in May from April's 6.4% year-on-year increase.The increase was led by a surge in price of pulses and products, which shot up 31.6% in May while sugar and confectionery prices rose 14% year-on-year.Prices of protein-rich items such as eggs, meat and fish also firmed up, exerting pressure on overall numbers.Prices of vegetables jumped 10.8% year-on-year in May .""The three steps decided at the meet will be taken immediately. Though price of pulses is comparatively little less than last year, we are taking necessary steps. States must also do their bit, put their demand to get pulses from the central buffer stock,"" Paswan said.He said the Centre is ready to provide unmilled pulses at subsidised rate to states and they must sell the processed dal at not more than Rs 120 per kilogram. In recent weeks, prices of arhar and urad have touched Rs 170 and Rs 196 per kg respectively . The food minister said that prices of no other food item was discussed at Tuesday's meeting.""Prices of tomato and other vegetable increase for a few months because of seasonal issues. But we must understand that the prices differ from place to place and that can only be addressed when we have common agriculture market enabling farmers to sell their produce according to their choice,"" Paswan said.In fact, prices of tomatoes across the country showed wide variation with 1 kg tomatoes costing between Rs 20 and Rs 80. In cities including Kota, Nasik, Gwalior, Ludhiana, Meerut and Bhopal, tomatoes were retailing between Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kg and in Surat and Thiruvananthapuram 1kg tomato cost Rs 80. In the case of potatoes, while the average price was Rs 15 and maximum Rs 35 a kg, the key kitchen item was selling at less than Rs 10 in Nashik and Indore.Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre for ""unprecedented"" inflation, saying there was ""highest-ever surge in food prices"" while the Modi dispensation was busy spending crores of public money on its second anniversary bash. Party spokesman Ajay Maken said food inflation at 7.55% in May had hit a 21-month high."

Following demand from industrial associations, the state government agreed to develop a food processing park for food processing industries on 50 hectares.Sanjiv Narang, president, Nashik Industries & Manufacturers' Association, said, ""There is huge scope for food processing industries in Nashik and the proposed park will definitely boost the industry here.

The local residents say the foul smell has intensified after the recent rain and charge that the authorities failed to put in a proper system to collect and dispose garbage being generated from the residences of Periya Chetty Street and the neighbouring streets. The daily vegetable market on the corner of the street, which is functioning in the morning and the evening, seems to be the major factor for dumping of waste in unauthorised locations. Besides vendors of tomato, brinjal, cabbage, ladies fingers, coconut and others, there are a few meat stalls in the area. Traders dump the vegetable waste in the open plot. Moreover, they indiscriminately dump rotten vegetables and fruits causing stench. There are instances of people throwing food waste in the dump. Since the food waste rots quickly, it emits unbearable stench.It is stated that there was a dustbin in the locality a few months ago. It was not known why it was removed. Besides, the public and the traders did not follow the basic sense of dumping waste in the dustbin. They used to throw the waste into the bin by standing at a distance causing spill over all around the bin.It is a menace. It is posing a big problem to the residents. We have been undergoing miserable life due to the issue for quite some time, said C. Mariappan, a resident of Periya Chetty Street.If the issue is a headache for human beings, it has become a blessing in disguise for stray cattle. At least 10 to 15 cows are roaming around the dump. Moreover, the dump space has become a convenient place for them to spend night time also. Locals demand that the Corporation authorities should study the issue to find a solution. A mechanism has to be found for enabling the local residents and traders to dump the waste in a safe manner."

Here is the complete transcript of thewith Arnab Goswami.Prime Minister Modi thank you very much for this interview. Thank you very muchMy greetings to all the peopleThis is your first one to one interview to a private news channel since you became Prime Minister. And if I am not mistaken, this is the first ever interview by a sitting Prime Minister of India to a private television news channel in the country. So I would first like to thank you and am very grateful for the opportunity.The world of the media has grown so big that everybody has to attach themselves with it.I am very grateful and our viewers will be very grateful also Mr Modi because they want to hear your views on a range of subjects. Mr Prime Minister I would like to start by taking you back to 20th May 2014. The results came on May 16th. Four days later, you gave a historic speech in the Central Hall of Parliament and you were speaking to the members of Parliament. You had said four days after the results that an era of responsibility has begun. And that you said that in 2019 before the elections, I will come back to this Parliament, I will come back to the MPs and I will give my report card. Forty percent into your tenure, how much have you achieved of your own targets?When I went for the first time as an MP to the Central Hall, and it was the first time I was seeing the Central Hall. I had not been there before. So I had then said that becoming the Prime Minister was not about the designation of the office but it was about the responsibilities and work of being a PM. I had also said that my government would be committed to the poor. I was completely new in the job. Delhi was new for me. The Delhi environment was new to me. The work of the government of India was also new for me. But despite that, in such a short time, the pace at which the country has moved forward, and it's not on one subject. You can pick up any aspect of the government's functioning, and if you make a comparison with the past governments, then you will realize that no issue has been ignored. There has been an effort to bring in something new in every area. There is an effort to bring in change in every area. One big challenge was that I was not experienced about this place, I had not even been an MP. The office was new, the questions were also new. But when I look at the second biggest challenge, we should remember those days when the country was engulfed in disappointment. The everyday news was about whether there would be any electricity production after seven days, whether coal would be supplied or not. This was the situation then. The entire system was engulfed in disappointment. The big challenge was to inject new trust into the system and create confidence among the citizens. It is very difficult to evaluate this from the outside but I have gone through it. But today I can say with a lot of satisfaction that now there is no trace of any disappointment. The intention to do something is visible. And it's not in words but in actual achievement. I had said that within a given timeframe, we will open bank accounts for the poor. For something that had not been done for 60 years, setting a timeframe for it was in itself a risk. But because of that a trust was created in the system that it was something doable. So that's the process I started for awakening the confidence. And today you can see that in every sector, the changed circumstances can be seen. While evaluating the performance of this government, never forget that you will have to make that evaluation in comparison with the 10 years of the previous government. Only then will you know where we were and where we are now. We should not be talking about what we are aiming for. For now you will have to assess the present in comparison with the immediate past and in that you will find a bright futureMr. Modi, I want to start now on the issue of foreign policy. In the area of foreign policy, you have taken great personal interest. The amount of personal interest you have shown in foreign policy, probably none of the previous Prime Ministers showed the same kind of interest. Your approach is pro active. What I find interesting about your foreign policy is that you have balanced different powers and different interests. On the one side, your relationship with US, you made sure that India enters the Missile Control Technology Regime with them. A week before that you also signed the historic Chabahar Port Agreement with Iran. So, you have balanced very diverse forces. My question to you over this is that, is it easy to do that as an Indian Prime Minister? Secondly, on the issue of the NSG, you staked a lot of personal interest, personal push, you lobbied actively. How close are we to getting the NSG seat?Firstly, about foreign policy, you need to know what has strengthened our foreign policy. For 30 years, in our country, the government was unstable. For 30 years, party with a clear mandate wasn't given the opportunity to form the government. The world measures the government of a nation on the basis of its condition in its own country, on how strong their word is in their own country. I am thankful to the people of this country, that after 30 years, they chose a government with absolute majority and this has had an impact on world politics. Countries and world leaders have changed their perspective towards India. This is the biggest benefit. Secondly, the world didn't know me. The world wants to know who the head of the state is. If someone would want to know Modi through the eyes of the media, then he would be disillusioned on which modi is the real Modi. If this happens, the country will be at a loss. Modi's personality shouldn't be a hindrance for the world to have faith in india. But for that unless I meet all those leaders and engage them them one to one, unless I speak to them frankly, they wouldn't know about india's head of state, so it was very important for me as I am not from a political family. I never had the opportunity to meet the world leaders earlier.You were an unknown entity in foreign policyMore than foreign policy it was foreign relations. Yes, I was new to it. So for me, being pro active was mandatory. Thirdly, we work as a team. Foreign ministry, Prime Minister's officer, commerce ministry, finance ministry, defense minister, everyone works as a team, not as separate pieces. The impact that is now visible, is not just because of Modi, it is because of the team. All teams work in a particular direction. That is why the impact is seen, earlier these teams were splintered. We have seen instances where the party would give a statement, the prime minister would say something else, party leaders would say something else. This disunity has had a negative impact. Thirdly, we also need to understand that earlier the world was bi polar. Foreign policy would be centered around two super powers. India was a little late in realizing that this bi polar situation was for namesake. Now the entire world, in changed circumstances, especially in 21st century, it is more interdependent and inter connected, earlier, the foreign policy was possible between governments, but today it is not possible just between governments. Government relations are important but increasing people to people contact is equally important. There's been a shift in paradigm. Because I do not have any previous baggage, because I've had a clean slate, I write everything from beginning and that has a benefit. Today we are building relations with countries across the world. The amount of respect with which I engage saudi arabia, I engage Iran with the same amount of respect. The amount of respect with which I speak to America, I speak to russia with the same amount of respect. So we need to understand this. We also need to understand that we shouldn't consider smaller countries insignificant. I abide by this principle. The small countries of the world are as important as the big nations. We had assumed that the relations with smaller nations would develop under the shadow of the bigger nations. I brought about a change in this. You must have seen that I made a forum for the pacific island nations. We have had two meetings. I went there once and they came here once. These are small countries with a population of about 10 lakh or 20 lakh. But these small island nations are most affected by global warming. When india took up the international solar mission and 122 nations joined it, the island nations benefitted the most out of it. They are 50 in number now. A group of 50 nations, feels secured with this vision of India. If we try to understand this change, then we would realize that in the world, a few days back, I was sitting with the officers of our foreign services, so as we got talking, in a very poetic way I told them that there was a time when we used to sit by the sea and count the waves, but the time has now changed, we are done counting waves, now it's time for us to steer ourselves, ride the waves and decide on our direction, destination and speedThat is apparent. You have a very aggressive foreign policy. But my second question was, you put so much effort for NSG membership. My question was, how close are we to NSG membership and were you disappointed that we did not make it at the very end because of China's opposition?Look the first thing is that India has been continuously making these efforts, no matter which government was in office. Be it the membership of the UN Security Council or the SCO membership or MTCR membership or NSG membership. Every government has made an effort. It's not that only this government is trying, it's in continuity. But it's during our tenure that we achieved SCO membership, we also got the MTCR membership. I have full faith that now we have begun a coordinated effort for the NSG membership too. The process has begun on a positive note. Everything has rules and will work accordingly and move forwardIs it the problem of mindset with China? There have been 13 engagements at various levels between the Narendra Modi government and the Chinese government. The latest engagement was when you went to Tashkent. You spent some time with the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Yet it was seen that in the case of Masood Azhar, China blocked India's UN bid to ban him. Now they have stalled India's NSG bid. Why is China repeatedly blocking us Mr Prime Minister despite your personal proactive measures and your government's outreach?The first thing is that we have an ongoing dialogue with China and it should continue to happen. In foreign policy it's not necessary to have similar views to have a conversation. Even when the views are contradictory, talks are the only way forward and problems should be resolved through dialogue. We don't have one problem with China, we have a whole lot of problems pending with China. Slowly and steadily, an effort is on to address these issues through talks and make them less cumbersome. I can say that China has been cooperating with India to search for solutions. On some issues, it's a question of principles for them. On some issues, it's a question of principles for us. On some issues they differ with us and there are issues on which we differ with them. There are some basic differences. But the most important thing is that we can speak to China eye-to-eye and put forth India's interests in the most unambiguous manner. We are a government that takes care of India's interests. We don't compromise on this. Three days ago I met the Chinese President. I told him clearly about India's interests. They are a different country, we are a different countryDo you think you will be able to change their mindset on the issue of NSG membership?See the foreign policy is not about changing mindsets. Foreign policy is about finding the common meeting points. Where do our interests converge and how much? We have to sit and talk with every country. It's our ongoing effortThis statement that you just made is also apt in the context of America where you gave a speech in the U.S Congress. By the way Mr Prime Minister it was a fantastic speechThank youThere was a lot of humour. You were laughing and cracking jokes while you delivered the speech which was very unique. They also appreciated it. Was the speech impromptu?I have a humourous side but these days humour can be a risky thingWhy do you say that?In this era of 24/7 news channels, anybody can lift a small word and make a big issue out of it. But I will tell you the truth, the reason for the absence of humour in public life is this fear. I am myself scared . Earlier when I used to make speeches, I would make it so humourous but there would never be any issuesHave you become more conscious now?I am not conscious. I am in fear, there is no humour left in public life because of this fear. Everyone is scared. I am in fear. My speeches used be humourous. I see it in Parliament, that humour is finished there too. It is a matter of concern. I will quote one proverb.Yes, go ahead.Even if you mention a proverb, they will connect it with something else and begin a conversation. The one who is saying the proverb does not know for what he is speaking.But you should not lose your sense of humour Mr Prime MinisterBut it is true that my trip to the United States of America, my speech in their Congress and the respect shown towards India created a lot of hype. Had it not been hyped so much, there would not have been so much criticism on the NSG issue. Government is being criticized not for any mishandling of the NSG issue but because we were so successful over there (in the USA)Did China become conscious of your growing friendship with US?I am talking about what's happening hereBut when you delivered that speech in context of America, you used a very interesting phrase. You said 'We have to overcome the hesitations of history'. My Hindi is not that good. Like hesitations of history. But my question to you is Mr Prime Minister, how close can we get to America because many Indians believe that America is still supporting Pakistan, giving them military assistance. How close can we get? At what point do we stop before we are seen like an American ally? What is your own world view on that?I would especially like to appeal to my country's media that we should stop looking at everything in India from the. India is an independent country. It is a country of 125 crore people. Whenever it approaches any country, it will only be concerned about its own interests. It has been our biggest shortcoming and mistake that we have been tagging ourselves with another country and trying to do things. We are an independent country, we have our own policies and future. We have to think about the future of our 125 crore people. There should be no compromise on our interests. We have relations with America in the context of these fundamental pointsHow close can we get to them?There has been warmth in our relationship. You must have seen the editorials in American newspapers after my visit to that country. One point mentioned in those editorials was that the success of Obama's foreign policy has been the warm relationship with India. This has been saidWhat you are saying Modiji is that we can be close to America but we need not be an ally or seen to be an ally?The first thing is that we no longer live in a bipolar world. The world is interconnected and interdependent. You will have to connect with everybody at the same time. Even if there are two opposing countries, they will have to be friends. Now the times have changedMr Modi, on 8th May 2014, I had the opportunity to interview you, the interview took place in Ahmedabad, I think one last phase of elections was left. We were discussing the issue of Pakistan. You have had an uncompromising approach towards Pakistan. Two days back, Lashkar E Toiba killed 8 CRPF jawans in an attack. In the 8th May interview, you put forth a very interesting phrase, you said 'Can talks be heard amidst the noise of bombs, guns and pistols?' This is how you had phrased it. Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan? Do you believe we have been too generous towards Pakistan?There are two things. One - India has always wanted friendly ties with its neighbours, there can be no debate around it. We want to live in harmony and peace. And I have said it repeatedly, that India has to fight poverty, Pakistan too has to fight poverty, why don't we come together to fight poverty? I said this before elections and during election campaigns. Also I had invited leaders of SAARC nations to my swearing in ceremony and they had attended it as well. So there has been no change in our intent, our thoughts and our current behaviour. Number two - those who have to work from the table, will work from the table and those who have to work at the border, will work at border with full strength. Each one will fulfill the responsibility entrusted to them. And our jawans are fulfilling their responsibilities. It's true that pressure on terrorists has increased, their schemes are proving unsuccessful. The intent with which they move forward are foiled and they have to face major challenges. It is because of this disappointment that such incidents are taking place and our jawans are risking their lives and protecting the country. We are very proud of our JawansWhen your foreign policy is studied, observers analyze what's happening and what's not happening. If you give me the opportunity, I want to do a bit of analyses. There was a terrific pace of engagement with Pakistan between October, November and December. On 30th November, you met Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines (of UN Climate Summit in Paris). Both of you were seated on a sofa, talking to each other. A lot of people were speculating the contents of your conversation. This was on the sidelines of Climate Summit. After that, all of a sudden within seven days there were NSA level talks and Ajit Doval spoke to Nasir Janjua in Bangkok. And again after that you went to Russia via Afghanistan, you made an unexpected visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore. It was a personal trip but it still had some level of importance. Eight days later, Pakistani terrorists attacked Pathankot. Can you tell our viewers whether Pakistan was proactively responding in the months of October, November and December? Did the Pathankot terror attack change the situation? Is it true that Pakistan was making a lot of movement in those three months?Look there are different types of forces operating in Pakistan. But the government only engages with a democratically elected system. Our effort for that engagement is continuing. But our supreme objective is peace. Our supreme objective is to protect India's interests. We keep making effort toward that objective and sometimes our efforts are successful. As far as meetings and talks are concerned, we signalled right from the day I took oath and sent invitations for the oath taking ceremony, that we seek friendly relations but without compromising on our interests. And that is why I have said that my country's soldiers have full freedom to answer back in whatever manner they have to and they will keep doing thatMr Prime Minister what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' that you would draw when it comes to Pakistan. There is some confusion surrounding this subject. I would like you to give an elaborate reply. In 2014, it was believed that if talks are being held, then they should be held between two countries and not with Hurriyat. It should be between the government of India and the government of Pakistan. The other 'Lakshman Rekha' is that you must act on 26/11. There's been no forward movement so far. The third thing is about forward movement on the Pathankot attack case. So what is the 'Lakshman Rekha' now and if Pakistan remains within those bounds, so talks can happen at the political level or at any other level?The first thing is that with Pakistan, to whom do we talk to decide about the 'Lakshman Rekha'. Will it be with the elected government or with other actors? That is why India will have to be on alert all the time. India will have to be alert every moment. There can never be any laxity in this. But there is an outcome due to my continuous efforts like my visit to Lahore and my invitation to the Pakistani Prime Minister to come to India. Now I don't have to explain to the world about India's position. The world is unanimously appreciating India's position. And the world is seeing that Pakistan is finding it difficult to respond. If we had become an obstacle, then we would have had to explain to the world that we are not that obstacle. Now we don't have to explain to the world. The world knows our intentions. Like on the issue of terrorism, the world never bought India's theory on terrorism. They would sometime dismiss it by saying that it's your law and order problem. Today the world has to accept what India has been saying about terrorism. India's dialogue on terrorism, the losses India has suffered due to terrorism, the losses suffered by humanity, the world is now acknowledging that. So I believe we have to take this process forwardMr Prime Minister I now want to move to questions on the economy. In the past two years you have started many schemes. If we look at the theme of Jan Dhan Yojna for financial inclusion, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna for crop insurance, Swach Bharat, Skill India, Make In India. If we see the theme running through these schemes, is your social agenda at the core of your personal economic philosophy, social transformation? Is the social agenda at the core of your economic philosophy as the Prime Minister?The first point is our philosophy is to reach the last man in the line. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay's philosophy forms the core of our political, economic and social ideology. And even Mahatma Gandhi used to say that what is there for the last man? So my development parameter is very simple. It is about how the poorest of the poor can benefit from development. The poor is the central focus of my economic agenda. The poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. By helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. I am not saying right or wrong but it's one of the ways. But today the country's situation is such that we should make the poor strong so that they become partners in defeating poverty. All these schemes are meant to empower the poor and change the quality of life. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna is not only about opening bank accounts for the poor. Because of this the poor are feeling that they are becoming a part of the country's economic system. The bank that he was seeing from afar, now he is able to enter that bank. This brings about a psychological transformation. Looked at in another way, did you ever imagine that 40 thousand crores could be injected into the banking system by contributions from the poor. The poor who never had bank accounts, have deposited 100 rupees, 50 rupees or 200 rupees. It means that poor man saved 100 rupees and the change began in his life. We have taken up construction of toilets. I had gone to Chhattisgarh and had the opportunity to get the blessings of one mother. An adivasi mother heard about the scheme for building toilets. She sold her four goats and built a toilet. That 90 old mother uses a walking stick and goes around the cluster of 30 or 40 houses in the tribal village and has been spreading the message to build toilets. This change is becoming the reason for the change in the quality of life. I have begun the cleanliness campaign. It's estimated an individual spends an average of 7000 rupees for treatment of a disease. The main reason for disease is filth. The poor suffer the most from the filth. If a poor man falls sick, he cannot drive his rickshaw for two days and his children go hungry. So how can we help the poor bring about change in their lives? Now there is a neo-middle class and a middle class in the country. The young have their aspirations. So another aspect of my policies you must have seen are the Start Up India, Stand Up India, Seaport activity, port activity, railways expansion, railway station upgradation. These changes directly appeal to the middle class. The middle class has its aspirations. We have to create jobs? How will job creation happen? Till I invest in the development of infrastructure, there be no job creation. You must have seen that the maximum electricity generation since Independence has occurred this year. The maximum amount of coal mined has been in this year. The maximum length of roads being constructed daily is happening in this year. The fastest loading and unloading of steamers at sea ports is happening now. All these changes are creating opportunities for employment like in Start up India, Stand Up India. For instance in Stand Up India, I have said that every bank should give an economic opportunity to one woman, one dalit or one tribal person to become entrepreneurs. This will create many job opportunities. So this is the basis of my economic philosophy.Mr Prime Minister if I could interrupt you on this. On the one hand is the people's expectations and on the other is your vision. Many programs that you have mentioned, you can't put a calendar date to it but they don't have an immediate impact. They maybe able to show results in 3, 4, 5 maybe beyond 5 years. Now there are challenges in that. Mr Prime Minister, you are aware more than anyone else that people want immediate results. Now you spoke of job creation. The first thing, as an achievement you have managed to grow the economy at 7.5 per cent when the global economic climate is very bleak. You have spoken about it as well. You have met fiscal deficit targets, FDI inflows have increased but people are saying that job opportunities are not increasing. You have spoken about infrastructure but the current rate of unemployment. Mr Prime Minister, the latest Labour Bureau figures, is it a source of concern for you as the Prime Minister?The first thing is that are 800 million people below the age of 35 in our country. We have to accept that the demand for jobs is very high. But where will they get employment? Investment will come in. It will be used in the infrastructure sector, manufacturing and services sector. Now like the initiative we have taken, we have started the Mudra Yojna. More than three crore people in the country comprise washermen, barbers, milkman, newspaper vendors, cart vendors. We have given them nearly 1.25 lakh crore rupees without any guarantee. Now why have these people taken the money? To expand their work. When he expands his work, if he is currently employing one person, now he has to employ two people. If there were two employed earlier, now there are three. Now just think, when 3 crore of these small businesses have got access to finance, they must have expanded their work. Now all this is not in the Labour Department's registration. Three crore people have expanded their work. We took another small decision. The big malls in the country run 365 days a year but the smaller shops have to close on holidays. We announced in the Budget that even a small shopkeeper can operate his shop till late night and that too on all the seven days of the week. If the malls don't have restrictions then why should the small shopkeepers have restrictions. So now if a shopkeeper operates his shop till late and on all seven days, if he earlier employed one person, now he will have to employ two people. So won't the employment increase?So is your focus on entrepreneurship?Our focus is on all aspects. Now we are saying that by 2022 we want to ensure that everyone has a house. Housing sector has the maximum potential for creating employment. Houses will be built in such huge numbers, how many people will get employment? You must have seen that last year we brought in a textile policy. Under this textile policy, there will be income tax benefits for those who create employment. The more employment one creates, the more tax benefits they will get. For the first time, employment generation and tax has been linked. These are the things that boost employment and our central focus is creating employment for the ordinary citizenMr Prime Minister, questions are also being raised on food inflation which has still not decreased. The expectation was that the food inflation would decline. The people had put their hopes on the Prime Minister that you will bring down prices. This not only has a political impact but also has a social impact. Over the past two weeks, there were reports that in some places the price of Arhar dal had touched 150 rupees and 200 rupees for other pulses. The price of tomatoes was also rising. Is this only seasonal because the food inflation is increasing at 7.5 per cent year on year. Global oil prices have fallen. Do you think this creates perception issues for your government?You can't view inflation as a perception issue. Price rise should be seen as a reality. What is available for a consumer should be seen for what it is. There should never be an attempt to view price rise as a perception issue as a means of escaping the reality of price rise. We will have to accept reality. You see the fast pace at which prices were rising under the previous government, today that speed has decelerated a lot. You can see the statistics, you will find it there. Second, the country has gone through two consecutive years of severe drought. Drought has a direct impact on the price of vegetables, food and pulses because all these things are produced from the soil. Now when there is such a big drought, it's not in anybody's hands. The second option in such a situation is imports. The Indian government has imported pulses in huge quantities. Third, it is the joint responsibility of the state and Central governments. It is not exclusively the state's responsibility. It is not exclusively the Centre's responsibility. It is the joint responsibility of both the state and Central governments. This should not be an issue of blame game that the state government did not do certain things and that the Centre did not do certain things. But it will have to be agreed that it is the joint responsibility of both. That is why the Centre has given rights to the states to make stringent laws. How much stocks to keep or not to keep are decisions which the states can take. All these rights have been given to the states. Some states have performed well, some states are trying. But the Centre and state governments are trying to work together on this. I believe that we have been successful to the extent that the speed with which prices were rising (under UPA), what would have happened if the prices were to rise at that speed. We have been successful in stopping that speedy rise of prices. But as far as pulses are concerned, production in India has been very low. Many farmers who were earlier sowing pulses have started cultivating sugar. That is also an area of concern. We gave special incentives for pulses. We have tried to set up a different MSP for pulses. We have taken steps to procure pulses from farmers with bonus. Our focus is on increasing the production of pulses. We are also focusing on building stocks of pulses by importing from abroad. An all out effort is being made and I believe that nobody doubts the sincerity of this governmentMr Prime Minister what is your view about the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan as the RBI Governor? A lot has been spoken about this. There was commentary that it may effect India's image, perception as a global economy. What's your own view of the controversy around the exit of Raghuram Rajan?When my Government was formed in May 2014, you take newspapers from May, June, July 2014 and check television debates during that period. The topic of the television debates would be - Will the new govt let Raghuram Rajan continue? Or Will the new Government oust Raghuram Rajan? And there was more or less consensus that he was appointed by the previous govt and so Modi won't let him complete his tenure and will remove him. You have seen, that he worked his entire tenure. For the time he was appointed by the previous government, he completing his entire term. So all the misconceptions have been dispelled. Secondly, according to my 2 year experience in Govt, those who are creating controversies, are being unjust to Raghuram RajanWhy so?I will tell you. Those who say...I believe Raghuram Rajan's patriotism is no less than any of ours. It will be doing injustice to him if one says that he will serve the country only if he is at a particular post. As much as I know Raghuram Rajan, whatever post he holds, wherever he is, he is someone who will continue to serve the country. He is someone who loves his country. Therefore, it's not like the nation won't get Raghuram Rajan's services, Raghuram Rajan is not that kind of a person. He is a person who loves the country. Those who speak such language are doing great injustice to him. My experience with him has been good.I appreciate the work he has done. And my good wishes will always be with himPrime Minister Modi, there's a question related to this. During your speech at the Executive you used seven words begining with letter 'S'-- 'Sevabhaav' (service), 'Santulan' (balance), 'Sanyam' (restraint), 'Samvaad' (dialogue), 'Samanvay' (coordination), 'Sakaratmak' (positivity) and 'Samvedna' (sensitivity). I will ask the question in context with Raghuram Rajan because you used these words in the speech at National Executive Meet speech on June 14 in Allahabad. You said, 'Our party leaders and party workers should use these qualities in their daily dealings and behaviour.' Prime Minister, in Raghuram Rajan's context, your Rajya Sabha MP has made many comments. Later he made critical remarks against senior bureaucrats. My question is, do you think it is right? When we talk about 'Sanyam' (restraint) and 'Santulan' (balance), is it correct?Whether it is someone from my party or not, I believe that such things are inappropriate. The nation won't benefit from such publicity stunts. One should be more responsible while conducting themselves. Anyone who believes he is bigger than the system is wrong.That's a very clear message.I have a very clear message. I have no two minds about it.And Mr Prime Minister, if I may say so, between May 8 and now, you are speaking as straight as you did before you took over as Prime Minister. I think that answer takes me to the next subject. Mr Prime Minister, the issue is that of Black Money. In a very interersting way you said, prices should not be looked at from the point of percepetion, equally, Mr Prime Minister it can be said said that an issue like Black Money should not be looked at in terms of perception, but it is perception forming. There are political debates on this. Experts say that the Black Money economy has shrunk, 10-15% economy has shrunk through land dealings and other things. You have passed the Black Money Bill, you have made taxation more transparent, you have started information sharing with other countries, you have taken steps, but Prime Minister Modi, people still expect that a Rs 25 lakh crores will be brought back and put into their bank accounts. How will you address that expectation? The hope that people have taking Black Money, how will you address it?How did the black money issue arise and how did it become such a serious issue? We have to look at the background. It is an established fact in the minds of the common man those who steal money park their money overseas. It's a common perception. Even if I look at it from the common man's perspective, I also wonder where does this money go? This issue was always stalled in the Parliament. When the matter reached the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court ordered Special Investigation Team to look into it, even then the previous government stalled it for three years, from 2011-2014. It's after this that political parties, the media and the common man started believing that there's something wrong. Then the issue of Black Money became an agenda. Even today I can say...that yes, when there is money stashed in foreign accounts, there are some norms of engagement with foreign countries on the issue. But between 2011-2014, these people were given the opportunity to launder money here and thereAnd you also said on 17 February 2015 on this issue, that the then Law Minister is only offering lip serviceThe result was that people got several chances to launder money. Secondly, after our Government was formed, the first decision taken by our Cabinet was to form a Special Investigation Team to bring back Black Money which was pending despite Supreme Court's 2011 order. This shows our sincerity. From then on, you can't imagine how stringent the laws have been made to bring back Black Money and whoever comes in its fold will know how strict the law is. Thirdly, I attended the G20 Summit. Never was Black Money issue discussed in the G20 forum. It was my first G20 summit, for the first time I met the world leaders. And for the first time in the G20 Summit, one paragraph was on unaccounted money, on black money and 20 countries said that the world should cooperateBlack. The dirty money, black money was also linked to terrorism, an environment of global census was created. We have been signing agreements one after the other with different countries that there will be real time, automatic exchange of information with India. I recently visited Switzerland and there was minimal discussion on the issue. But after I returned, a big delegation from Switzerland visited India, and they held meeting with the Indian Government and we discussed...for several years, we believed that Switzerland is the place where black money is stashed, that country is holding discussions to come to a consensus on Automatic Information Exchange and if we reach consensus it will be a great achievement. Thirdly you must've seen that Mauritius route came up in almost everything. It was said that money goes out of India and returns through the Mauritius route. This was discussed. Everyone thought that nothing can be done about the Mauritius route.But our Government held a dialogue with the Mauritius Government, made changes to the old treaty. And we successfully made a new treaty to block the money which comes through the Mauritius route and very soon it will be phased out and completed. All these decisions are taken to fight the Black Money menace. This is not a one sided fight. Secondly, the govt is working in a direction to make sure that Black Money isn't generated in India and black Money doesn't go out of India, you can see the results of all this.When the opposition raises the Rs 15 lakh issue.That is something the opposition raises during elections. Let them have some issue to talk aboutMr Prime Minister, there has been no major financial corruption or scam in your tenure in the last two years. Perception is again, what people say is because you keep a very tight control on the reins of Government but the question is there are people, who are wilful defaulters, the economic offenders who take a lot of money from the country or commit economic offences in the country, go overseas and use rules and use lawyers, and they don't come back to India. And people are asking now, is the Narendra Modi Govt determined to take these cases of wilful defaulters and economic offenders to their logical conclusion.Firstly, this question is not in the minds of people. The people of India have confidence that if there's someone who can do this, it is Narendra Modi and he will do it. Citizens of the country have full faith.Does it worry you, that people have misued the law?I take this as an opportunity and I will show them what the law is.Mr. Modi, there have been several corruption cases about the previous government, which have now come out. There is AgustaWestland, many defense scams and defense transactions are now being analyzed seriously. The cases which were quoted in the CAG reports but were ignored are now coming in the forefront. This question is important because this isn't just about financial corruption but these questions have direct implications on the national security of the country. Do you think, when they say that this is a political witch hunt by Narendra Modi Sarkar, do you think all of these cases would have been possible without political patronage?There are many things which are not visible. One can't imagine the difficulty I am experiencing in taking out things from dirt. One who is working there knows the amount of dirt that exists and how certain things have been caught in a web. There are certain powers behind it. The case about Agusta helicopters. I can't deny it and I believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced. They have perfectly practiced the art of doing wrong deeds. They are very experienced and knowledgeable. And one can also smell the fact that such a thing wouldn't have been done without a shield. Now, agencies are probing. Let's see how far the probe goes. But the investigation shouldn't go ahead while people are being targeted, neither does my government target anyone. The sin has been committed, but how much is done, How was it done, who did it, probe agencies will find out in a professional way. Whatever comes out, will be put outPrime Minister, talking about your speech in the US Congress, and the humour that you displayed. I felt some of it was impromptu. But the Americans were able to relate to what you said, I don't remember the exact words, you said, I am informed that the working of the US Congress is harmonious. And then there was a pause and people were laughing. Then you said, 'I am told' - You emphasized and said 'I am told that you are well known for your bipartisanship.' Then the applause was more. And then you said, 'You are not alone. Time and again I have witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.' You spoke about a serious topic in a interesting manner. You referred to the Upper House. There was a lot of response on that too. Your humour was really appreciated and I think it was a wonderful moment when you were speaking. But, Mr. Prime Minister, when you look back at the parliament, this question comes to many people's minds, has Prime Minister Narendra Modi being held back from achieving his own objectives because of the non-stop parliamentary logjam. How much has this affected his moving towards his own targets? If you critically analyze this situation, do you feel your government could have been more consultative or do you feel the blame is entirely with the Opposition?I look at it differently. I believe there have been a lot of problems. Whether the fault is ours or their's, I 'll leave it to the people. People will decide. But because of discussions in Parliament - we may not come to a decision, the decision could be opposing our view, nothing wrong in that. But at least there should be a discussion. The sad part is, if somebody is running away from debate or don't let discussions happen, then it is a cause of worry in a democracy. Whether the government's work is accomplished or not, I don't see it as a cause of worry. If not today, it will happen tomorrow. There are certain things which will happen at an administrative level. The big thing is, Parliament is for discussion. Parliament is to show dissent. Parliament is to give an argument for one's opposition, to present an argument when they support.To uphold this basic spirit of Parliament, is the responsibility of every person who values democracy. It is the responsibility of those present in the Parliament and those outside. It is the responsibility of those in power and those not in power. This is a matter of spirit and it should be followed. As far as the government is concerned, on every issue and at every forum, we have tried to hold discussions. I myself have met the opposition leaders and spoken to them. Key members of the government are also in touch. And you must have seen that many issues have been resolved. In the last session, we have passed 12 bills in Rajya Sabha, we passed 10 bills in the Lok Sabha. So the pace has picked up. When people say 'Opposition', it is unfair to the opposition. There are some parties in the Parliament which are not with the BJP or NDA, but are with the government on key decisions. So, to defame the Opposition by saying that all opposition parties are against us -- when some people do this, it is wrong. There is one party which has problems. And the whole world knows that party. Secondly, to say that 'When you were is Opposition, you did it this way' There is a difference between every Opposition party. 'We have run the government for 60 years and now we are in the Opposition, so we know the nitty-gritties of the government, we know the responsibilities. We can't behave in the way, a new Opposition party behaves.' A party which hasn't been in power or hasn't seen anything, could behave in this way. For example, we are in power now, and consider in 2040 we become the Opposition party. So, in 2040 we can't have the same conduct as the one we had in 2009 or 2010.Congress is a very experienced and old partyThat's why I say that, those who have been in power for so many years, shouldn't be doing this. If there is a new party in the Opposition, they have a small demand for their state or if an MP has a demand for his/her constituency and does something like this, then we can understand. Ones who have been in power for very long, shouldn't be doing such thingsPrime Minister Modi, do you think the GST bill which has been stuck for over one and half years, it is a path-breaking economic reform. It unifies the country. Recently you met Ms Jayalalithaa after she was sworn in as the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee has extended her support for GST and Congress allies at the state level are supporting the GST bill. Do you feel optimistic that GST bill will be passed in the next session of the Parliament?First we need to understand, that we look at GST only within the purview of an economic reform because of which the right information doesn't come out. Not having GST straight away means loss for the poor of Uttar Pradesh. Absence of GST straight away means loss for the poor people of Bihar. Not passing the GST would mean loss for the poor people of poor states like Bengal, Orissa and Assam. People who sit in the Rajya Sabha must understand this. GST is beneficial for the poor people of the states represented by them, because those states will economically benefit the most from GST. The money will be used for the welfare of the poor people of those states. This is why be it Mamata Banerjee, be it Nitish Kumar, be it Akhilesh Yadav or Naveen Patnaik, all these states want the GST bill to be passed at the earliest. There is just one group which has made it the issue of prestige. Now the kind of arithmetic which is working out, I hope that this decision is passed in favour of the poor. You will be surprised to what extent has the opposition reached to the level of distortion. In the previous session we introduced an act. Indian government has Rs 40,000 crore rupees from the CAMPA Fund. Rs 40,000 crore. we wanted to give that money to the states. States have to use that money for forestry, for greenery, for planting trees and plants. The bill is meant for that. Had this Rs 40,000 crore reached the states before the monsoons, it would have been used for the forests. A lot of people would have got employment, people who plant trees would have been employed. There would be plantation and due to the rains the plants would start growing within a year. But just because of obstructionism, states have been deprived of the benefit of Rs 40,000 crore. The money was meant for the forests and for the tribals. They blocked it. There was no argument on itThe reason...you had triedMade all efforts.You had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi here at the Race Course RoadWe held talks at every levelStill? The word you used 'ego issue', why has it become an ego issue? And people would want to know why is the Prime Minister unable to end this?The Prime Minister cannot answer this question. Those creating obstructions can only answer this question. But despite this, I will keep trying. I am ready to convince them in which ever way possible. If I have to convoke someone over a cup of tea at their house, I am even ready for that. I have no problem. My only aim is the welfare of the poor of my country and the poor of states like Uttar Pradesh.You spoke of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Prime Minister, elections will be held in Uttar Pradesh in 6,7,8 months. The focus of entire nation will be on it. You are the MP from Varanasi. But some comments are made by BJP, some say Sangh Parivar, some independent groups, communal colour is added to it and not just from one party but from other parties as well. Mr Prime Minister are you going to be able to keep development as the sole agenda? The main issue in the Uttar Pradesh polls should be that of development, it shouldn't get capsized, the focus shouldn't be elsewhere. Are you confident that communal agenda will not overpower development?It's my conviction, it's my commitment. You must have seen during the 2014 elections that I fought elections on the issue of development. The new generation of the country only believes in development. I believe that solution to all problems is in development. Development is also the solution to the tension that people talk about. If we provide employment to people, if we ensure there's food on their plates, if we provide them with facilities and give them education, all the tension will end. And this is why, all those who want good for the nation, I request them to compete towards development and for development. This atmosphere should be created in the country and I think such an environment is being created nowadays.So the hot heads who make extreme comments, is there a necessity to control them? So that there is no politics in the name of religionFirstly, I am of the firm belief that the nation should progress on the issue of development. And it is necessary that the country moves forward on the issue of development. I would like to tell the media not to make heroes out of those people who make such comments.But they keep making such commentsDon't make them heroes, they will stopWe don't make them heroes, we make them villains.But why do you make them so big? I see such statements by people on TV, whose faces I haven't even seen and they end up becoming spokesmen on TVSelf styled spokesmenI don't know why such people are encouragedMr Prime Minister, let's talk in 2016 of the 2017 elections. After Delhi, then Bihar, then Assam, West Bengal. After that we will talk about Punjab. Before we finish talking about Punjab, we will talk about Uttar Pradesh. Then there is the Gujarat state election. Don't you think that this country is permanently stuck in an electoral cycle? The focus constantly and I want you to reflect on this issue, the focus is on party politics, polarising issues, not on governance. We are a country, if we say, we are constantly in a political campaign mode. Is this a good thing? Should we break away from it? And what is your view on it?See this is not an issue about Narendra Modi or the Prime Minister. And also it is not an issue about a particular party or a particular Government.But before the last Parliament session, the Speaker had called all the parties for a meal. After the agenda meeting everyone was sitting to eat. I had also reached at the same time. While talking casually over food, almost people from all parties said that the central and state elections must be held together. Everyone said it. After that during the farewell function of the Rajya Sabha MPs, people from different parties were talking with each other. One of the leaders said, Modiji do anything but get us out of this cycle of electionsWas that leader from your party?No, he was not from my party. So I said that discussion should happen. What is wrong in that? Then one day I said that this was being talked about. This issue has also been discussed in a Parliamentary committee. This work has also been started by the Election Commission and I think they have also writen a letter on it. Like in the fight against black money, this issue of elections also gets connected to black money. Electoral reforms are necessary if the country has to be rid of black money. It is one of the areas for electoral reforms. I believe that the Prime Minister cannot take a decision on this and nor should he do that. Neither the government can do this. There should be a broad discussion on this and we should not run away from the debate on this continious cycle of elections. The Indian voter today is very mature. He votes in one fashion in the Lok Sabha elections, he votes in a different manner in the State Assembly elections. We have seen this. In 2014, the General Elections conincided with the Odisha Assembly elections. The same electorate gave one judgement for Odisha and another judgement for Delhi. So this country's voter is very mature and we should trust his maturity. There should be a debate on how costs can be reduced by holding simultaneous elections, how the influence of black money can be curbed, how the five years can be spent in taking the country forward. Today due to the model code of conduct, there is a loss even in those areas where the code is not applicable. When I was in Gujarat, I found that at least 80 to 90 officers were spending two to three months on election duties in other states. This could be happening in every state. So this is an area of concern and some time or the other this question will have to be thought of. I would want the Election Commission to take this debate forward. They should invite all political parties and hold discussions with everybody and whatever comes out of itCan there be a timebound resolution in this?The Election Commission will have to invite all political parties to discuss this. The process will get derailed if one party were to initiate thisAre you willing to take the lead in building that consensus?Despite being the Prime Minister, I still belong to a political party. The better thing would be for the Election Commission to initiate this. Today the Election Commission is a very prestigious institution in our country. Every political party believes in the Election Commission and it will further empower this institution and that will be betterI think it is an interesting idea of simultaneous elections. Though state parties, regional parties may feel that it will effect them badly. That the national parties like the BJP will gainOdisha is the best example. Odisha is the best example. In 2014, the BJP had no advantage in the state but the BJP won on the Lok Sabha seats. This shows the differenceMr Prime Minister how are you keeping your schedule nowadays? I mean you keep a terrifying pace. The number of meetings you hold, people say your officers find it hard to keep upIt is not so, it has been 2 years now and everyone is used to the work. I believe that it is such a big country that one must do as much work as possible. So I keep doing thatBefore I come to my last question Mr Prime Minister, one issue that I want to come to is the farmers' crisis. As you are well aware, there has been a crisis in this country, you referred to it. In that speech to your MPs, about which I asked you earlier as well, on 20th May in the Central Hall of Parliament you said that 'this government is not for myself, this government is for the poor, we must do something for them.' The farmers' crisis Mr Prime Minster is a reality. I am glad that in this interview you have not avoided the reality, you've faced it, you've talked about it. We have linked our entire future to the monsoons. How do we overcome this from becoming an annual crisis in this country?We will have to put stress on water management here. You must have seen that under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana, we have put stress on water issues. During these drought days, I met leaders from 11 states separately and sat with them for about 2-3 hours each. The country would have believed that their Prime Minister is working even if I had held a meeting with 11 of them together for around 10 minutes. But I didn't do that. I sat with leaders from different states separately to understand specific problems and what we could do for water in those states. I am happy, whichever party the state government affiliated to, all the governments focused a lot on water issues this summer. We will reap its benefits this monsoon. Using scientific methods for water accumulation and irrigation, collecting water and directing them towards the fields, everyone did that. Micro irrigation is stressed upon. Even for sugarcane farming, farmers are slowly moving towards micro irrigation which earlier happened through flood irrigation. Paddy crops for which large amount of water is used. Today, farmers have started using drip irrigation for it. If we do well in water facilities, then one of the problems is solved. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana which can cover maximum number of farmers. The farmer will have to pay only 2%, only 2%, the government will take care of the rest. The farmers will get an assurance. For instance, in Maharashtra, the monsoons are expected in the month of June, the farmers have prepared for everything but haven't started with the sowing process. Now if there are no rains till August, so practically his crops have not been damaged, because he did not sow the seeds. But the Pradhan Mantri fasal Beema Yojana even takes this into consideration and benefits the farmer. Another important aspect, once the crops are harvested, they're cut and kept in the field, assuming it has been a good year for crop growth, with 100% crop production, but it hasn't been loaded on trucks and sent to the market yet. And if it rains, even after 15 days of harvesting, if there is loss, it is covered under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Second layer of protection, minimum premium with maximum cover. After independence, for the first time, we have brought in Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana. Thirdly, first time we have brought in E-Mandi concept. Farmer in the village, can sell the crops to the best markets in the country through his mobile phone. Farmer would set the price at which the crop would be sold. Earlier, farmers used to take the produce on carts or tractors, used to go to a mandi 20-25kms away, then due to storage issues, even if they had to sell for Rs 10 less than the price, they used to sell it. Now, sitting at home the farmer would know what price to sell the crops at. Next point is about, food processing, value addition. We opened up 100% foreign direct investment in food processing. For example, if a farmer is selling tomatoes and if a company is processing tomato ketchup then my farmers would benefit from it. The companies that make aerated drinks, Coca-Cola, Pepsi etc, I requested them to add 5% natural fruit juice. In regions near Nagpur and Vidarbha where oranges are cultivated, Coca-Cola is going to add 5% of orange juice. If we add 5% natural juice to aerated water, farmers would get their market and their fruits wouldn't go waste. We should have a comprehensive all-out scheme. So much of our land has been damaged. We have brought in Soil Health Card. We have a Soil Health Abhiyan. The farmer will know the feritility of the land through it. Whether a fertilizer needs to be used or not, the farmer will understand. On an average, a farmer with 1 hectare of land will be able to save Rs 15000-20000. So we have brought in scientific methods. You would know that in our country, farmers used to be lathicharged when they would go to buy urea and they had to buy it in black. We got urea 100% neem coated. Earlier, urea used to go to chemical factories, and the government subsidies were stolen in the name of farmers. After neem coating, urea cannot be used for any other purpose except farming. Because of neem coating, there is a qualitative change which helps in healing the damaged land. Due to neem coating a piece of land that used 10 kgs of urea can now manage with 7 kgs of urea. All these initiatives are in the direction of agriculture and the results will be seen soon.Do you think that the farmers' crisis will be resolved, the question I asked, that it won't be an annual affair, the dependence on monsoons will go down?See agriculture is a state subject. The Indian government has taken initiatives, if the state government are enthusiastic to implement this, which I think they will be. As I told you I met leaders from different states and they worked a lot for water issues. If this works, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana has direct involvement of the central government, it will have great benefits.Mr Prime Minister now I have two questions for you.This has become too long.I'll club these two (questions) together. You're also enjoying it and I am glad you're speaking Mr Prime Minister because there is so much ground to cover and I think viewers would like to hear your view, sir. Actually there are three, if you allow me. They're short questions. First is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, how much is politics playing on your mind? In the sense that every Prime Minister, especially someone who is as forthright as you, looks at the next big challenge. Is 2019 anywhere in your mind?Those who have seen me in Gujarat, and those who have seen me in the last two years, those who see me without any bias, they will know that I am an apolitical Prime Minister. Apart from elections, I don't get involved into politics ever. You can call elections a necessity, a restraint or a responsibility, we have to do it. I attend many functions, go to different areas, you wouldn't have heard any political comment from me. If I go to a government function, I talk about government related topics. If I attend a Railways function I talk about railways, if water then water, if water bodies, then water bodies. My focus is on governance. Country has been at greatest loss because governments were run only for elections. Governments must not run only for elections. The government should be a bona fide attempt of meeting the demands and expectations of the common people. Elections should just be a bi-product. It is a democracy. Winning and losing is a part of it. It shouldn't be hyped. You would have seen recently I urged everyone to pay taxes before 30th September. I even said it on Mann Ki Baat yesterday. Will a person, who is only concerned with winning elections, say that post 30th September you'd face problems?This was also a warning in a way.It is a warning. It is definitely a warning. It is a warning. My first warning is to my government officers to not presume citizens as thieves. I have already given this warning. I have handled my officers first. It took me quite some time. You will be shocked to hear that I have given an early retirement to more than 30 people from Income Tax Department on integrity issues. This isn't a small issue. People who weren't transferred since 20 years, I got them transferred. So, one, my focus is on my system. Second, I also tell the country, that for the poor of the nation we would have to give out something for the poor in our country. It is my responsibility to give the people an account of every rupee. I will use it at right places. I won't let it get stolen. But if I need to give houses to the poor, we would need revenue. I don't want to increase taxes, I just want taxes to be paid honestly. There is no need to increase the taxes. The country can run without troubling the citizens. I am working towards it. That is why I have given the citizens a chance to pay the taxes till 30th September, whatever it is Rs 10,000 or Rs. 50,000. If they think they want to come into mainstream, they must and shouldn't be worried. After 30th September, the government will have to take steps. I will not worry about the polls. I will take the necessary steps. I want to work for the poor in my country.Mister Prime Minister, do some crystal ball gazing for the next three years. For the next three years, to use the cricketing analogy, how do you find your run rate so far and will you have to score at a higher run rate in the next three years to achieve your targets?See, no matte at what speed I move forward, I am never satisfied. If today I run at a speed of 100, I keep an aim of running at 200. I think that the world that was behind us, has gone ahead. We need to run a lot to match that level. So we do not need to calculate. We just need to give it all in. And I have given myself in completely. I've been successful is pulling my entire government in. I believe that the country is also committed to move forwardFinal question to you Mr Prime Minister, what motivates you the most? First of all as I said, will you be able to keep this pace? What motivates you the most and also if you can share with our viewers honestly what is your one greatest source of worry?Firstly, I don't live under the burden of worries. Problems and challenges are there, you can't deny that. But you must challenge the challenges and not let the challenges turn into worries. This is my principle. I challenge the challenges. I like to face the problems. I don't run away from them. Whatever loss I have to face for it, I face it. But I can't leave the country helpless. This responsibility must be taken and I will continue to do so. For all good and bad things, it is my responsibility. I do not regret anything. I believe, people of the country have given me the responsibility and I must fulfill it. Thirdly, when I see the poor in our country, it reminds me of the work that I have to do for them. Day before yesterday, I was in Pune, and met a Shrimaan Chandrakant ji. A retired teacher with a pension of Rs 16000, donates Rs 5000 every month for Swachh Abhiyaan. If a 70 year old retired teacher with children and family at home, without worrying about them, worries about the country, then being the Prime Minister, I should work a thousand times more than Chandrakant ji. This is my inspiration. People of this country who work day and night, they are my inspiration. I look at them and I work even harder.Prime Minister Narendra Modi it has been a privilege. I am grateful for this interview.Thank youAnd thank you on behalf of all our viewers that you spoke frankly. The program is Frankly Speaking and I am thankful to you that you were so frank.I just request you to not create controversies out of this but instead use it for the benefit of the country.Please do not think like that. Thank you very muchThanks a lot. Thank you very much."

Some have already approached MIDC to set up units there.Speaking to TOI, an official from MIDC said, ""We will soon start with the infrastructure works like road, water supply and street-lights at the proposed park adjacent to the existing Godavari Wine Park at Vichur, near Nashik. We have already floated a bid for the purpose and the tender process is expected to be completed within a month,"" adding that MIDC would spend Rs 3.5 crore for the infrastructure and will start allotting plots once the park is developed.""Some food processing industries have already submitted their proposals with their land requirement for setting up units at the proposed park. The food processing units include including processed frozen foods, mango and other fruit pulp, raising making, onion powder, biscuits, cookies, papad, pickles, tomato products, bakery and confectionery and fruit juices,"" he said.The state government had developedthe Godavari Wine Park on 133 hectares in 2001 to boost wine industry. Of the total 133 hectares, the wine park had been developed on 83 hectares, while the remaining 50 hectares is still undeveloped. Only five wineries have started operations so far. Following demand from industrial associations, the state government agreed to develop a food processing park for food processing industries on 50 hectares.Sanjiv Narang, president, Nashik Industries & Manufacturers' Association, said, ""There is huge scope for food processing industries in Nashik and the proposed park will definitely boost the industry here. This will not only fetch investment, but will also create employment at large."""

Traders blame poor supply and the holy month of Ramzan for the sudden hike in prices. Onion is the only commodity which isn't bringing tears to consumers with it being priced Rs 16 per kg.Tomatoes are priced at Rs 65 to Rs 75, beans at Rs 80 to Rs 125, lady's finger Rs 60, cabbage Rs 40 and potatoes Rs 26 to Rs 31. Merchants say excessive rain damaging crops in some parts and dry spell in other parts is the reason behind this price hike.Central Market merchant David D'Souza says: The prices of many vegetables have gone up though not many functions are happening due to excessive rains in Chikkamagaluru which has resulted in crop loss.The price of tomato which was Rs 40 per kg last month has gone up to Rs 65 to Rs 75 in the retail outlets.The price of beans varies across retail and super markets. While the wholesale rate of beans are at Rs 80, its retailing at Rs 90 to Rs 125 depending upon the place from where the beans are purchased.Hoteliers are also a worried lot. ""We don't have any other option than to accept it like we do when there is a seasonal variation,'' a hotelier averred. Homemaker Sunitha from Valencia said, ""Looking at the prices of vegetables and fruits I now buy them in small quantities. Though it means that I have to visit the stores twice or thrice a week, but it does not pinch that much when small quantities are consumed without getting wasted.Fruits have seen a significant rise in prices by at least 25%. Washington red apples retailing at Rs 150 per kg last week is now selling at Rs 200 a kg. Bananas too are pricey. The popular 'kadali' variety which was selling at Rs 60 per kg is now retailing Rs 70 to Rs 75 per kg."

Every day since 2005, she has been setting aside Rs 5 out of her earnings from selling vegetables to buy books. By now, she has an enviable collection of 900 books and thousands of newspaper supplements, all bought from her hard-earned money.""I was in Std V when I read the entire collection of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule's writings. It changed my life. I had to leave school after Std IX to look after my siblings in our 20-member joint family. But my parents, who were illiterate, encouraged me to continue reading,"" Babytai says. She was the first woman in the family who could read.In April 1993, Babytai married arts graduate Anil Gaikwad from a village in Pathardi taluka. Within a year, husband and wife had to migrate to Ahmednagar because of the severe drought. ""My husband got a job in a factory, but the salary was meagre. I started selling vegetables near the school where I had enrolled my four-year-old daughter, Ashwini. In 2005, my husband lost his job as the factory closed down and we were literally on the streets. It was then that we set up this vegetable business,"" she says.Babytai's husband used to give her Rs 10 to buy biscuits for Ashwini and son, Gaurav. ""I used to buy only one packet and spend Rs 5 on buying two newspapers. Soon, I started saving Rs 5 every day to buy books. During Diwali, I would tell my husband to buy me books instead of a new sari,"" she recalls with a smile.The first three books she bought were 'Krishnakath', an autobiography of Yashwantrao Chavan, 'Agnipankh' (the Marathi translation of Wings of Fire by A P J Abdul Kalam) and 'Aai Samjoon Ghetana' by Uttam Kamble.Soon, Babytai started telling women customers, her daughter's friends and even the farm labourers who came to shop for vegetables to read books. ""I started lending them my books. I now ensure that each book is read by at least 10 people before it comes back to me. I tell them that books can change one's life. They have taught me to never give up hope and fight against adversities. In fact, I now plan to approach drought-affected farmers with the same message. I want to tell them not to commit suicide,"" Babytai says. She has also started spreading the word about various government schemes for the poor.Another turning point came in 2012, when she read about the work of reformer Raja Ram Mohan Roy. ""That year, I invited only widows for my Sankranti 'haldi kumkum' ceremony (tradtionally, a get-together for married women) and gifted them books. There was a tremendous backlash and my vegetable shop lost almost half its customers. As a protest, I stopped putting on the toe rings that every married woman is supposed to wear. Women taunted me, but I did not give up. It took me four years to turn them around. I recently resumed wearing the toe rings when I saw that society is now accepting widow remarriages,"" she reveals.Babytai set up Krantijyoti Mahila Sanstha and Swayamsiddha Foundation in 2000 and 2015 respectively to nurture the reading habit among rural women. ""Marathi language is so rich and beautiful. Unfortunately, many of us feel ashamed to speak in Marathi. I don't understand why children are taught to address their parents as mummy and daddy instead of 'Aai' and 'Baba'. Our love for Marathi is displayed only on Marathi Language Day. We need to change this,"" she adds.Babytai is often invited to schools and colleges to give lectures on books and the habit of reading. ""I tell them I am no PhD holder, but a simple vegetable seller. I tell them how books have helped me in life. And I always gift a book to the school or college before I leave,"" she says, adding that till date she has given 200 lectures.Last month, the state government presented the first Mangesh Padgaonkar State Award for nurturing Marathi language to Babytai. ""This is the biggest honour I could have received. It carries the name of my favourite author-poet. His poem 'Bhatukalichya khelamadhali...' is my favourite and so is his compilation of essays 'Nimbonichya Zadamage',"" she signs off."
58f5cc367be9e01a17ca0cee,Waste to compost to grow veggies,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Waste-to-compost-to-grow-veggies/articleshow/51302753.cms,2016-03-08,,The Times Of India,"Pune: Her residence near Deccan Gumkhana, especially the ground floor that houses sacks full of leaf litter, discarded kitchen waste and vegetables, and dry coconut peels, may be a bit confounding to first-time visitors. Many may assume that the collection is garbage on its way out of the fourth-floor home of the Bhide family.The reality is exactly the opposite.Priya Bhide, a qualified paediatric physiotherapist, along with her chartered accountant husband Sunil and two daughters, will soon lug all of these sacks - left there by friends, neighbours and a nearby vegetable vendor - all the way up to their roof to convert the waste into compost.To many, the idea of a rooftop garden may be to enjoy the best of flowers and greens in times of leisure. For Priya, it's actually a mini garbage treatment plant where she uses biodegradable waste to make her own soil through vermiculture, using earthworms and mixing it with coco-pith, neem cake, cow dung and water. She uses this organic nutrient-rich soil to cultivate fruits and vegetables like bananas, papaya, chillies, cauliflower, tomato, brinjal, gourds, spinach, lettuce, amla, spices like turmeric and even flowers and greens, some of which the family occasionally distribute among friends and well-wishers.The Bhides have been doing this since the family shifted here in 2006. Priya said, ""I was passionate about gardening, but did not want to bring in soil from outside as that would mean disturbing the ecology of the source. So we thought of making our own soil. We now collect leaf litter typically during November to April. Kitchen waste comes not only from our house, but also from neighbours and a vegetable vendor nearby who gives us the things he may have discarded. The actual work is done by the earthworms that decompose all the waste.""Some people approached the family with the leftovers of coconuts, typically the dry brown shavings on top, which they could not dispose of naturally. After experimenting with different ways of utilizing them, the Bhides came up with a use for that as fuel for their indigenous stove (chulha). Several times a week now, the family prepares its dinner not in the kitchen, but on the rooftop, sometimes in the company of inquisitive friends who drop in for a taste of the traditional style of cooking.""It's a pleasure activity for us and a break from monotony. Peels of four coconuts are enough fuel to make 'khichadi' and 'usal' for seven people. The best part is that nothing goes waste. More than waste management, we feel this is resource management,"" Priya adds.She stresses on the importance of waste segregation. ""And composting is simple and can be done by anyone, even if it's only in four small pots at home. If the correct technique is followed, there is no chance of any foul smell or anything else going wrong as nature takes care of everything. In the end, it's a great feeling of being able to do something for society. Everyone thinks they generate too little waste. But all combined, it becomes almost 1,400 tonne of trash every day and needs a sustainable solution,"" she adds.Priya also conducts lecture demonstrations for groups interested in her rooftop garden. She adds that every person wants the city to be clean. And they can be the change through their actions and inspire the younger generation too."

Rodents thriving on the waste mounds started entering their cars and gnawing at the wires.""People would get their vehicles fixed and a few days later, the situation would be back to square one,"" said Shivakumar, a resident. It didn't take them long to realize that garbage dumped at vacant sites was at the root of the rodent menace.When everyone, from BBMP officials to corporators, failed to address the problem, residents decided to take matters into their own hands. This was the beginning of the waste management task force in Murugeshpalya. It started 10 months ago with 12 members, who took on the problem one street corner at a time. Today, about 100 residents are part of it.From monitoring dumpyards to spreading awareness on segregation, they have changed the face of the neighbourhood. Today, more than 800 houses in Murugeshpalya are segregating waste at source. A site which was earlier used to dump trash is now a community garden with flowering plants, bananas, aloe vera and tomatoes. The proceeds go to the neighbourhood. The dead soil is nourished back to life using compost from homes. Two sites have been converted into parking lots.Aravind, an architect and resident, said it was far from easy. ""We knocked on many doors. From municipal authorities to elected representatives, we approached everyone. They knew about the problem but with the Mandur landfill and Terra Firma unit being closed, they couldn't do much,"" he said. As the word spread, residents of Murugeshpalya realized their counterparts in Mandur and Mavallipura were also in the same boat. ""At first, we wanted strangers to stop dumping waste near our homes. But we realized if not Murugeshpalya, people would find other places. Segregation at source seemed the only solution,"" he said.""Only a handful of the residents were segregating waste. We couldn't wait for the government to act,"" said Prashanth, a craftsman and one of the founders of the task force. ""Garbage was coming from two sources - houses which were not segregating it and residents of areas like Marathahalli who disposed it off near our homes,"" he said.""We took on the role of watchdogs - we stopped vehicles and confronted people who were littering the locality,"" Prashanth said. Members witnessed both apathy and lack of awareness among the litterbugs. Both were tackled. ""We wanted people to take ownership of their garbage. As long as the waste was inside their house, it was theirs. The minute it was brought outside, it became a community issue. When caught dumping waste, sometime people snapped and asked me if it was my site. I said yes. They were at a loss for words,"" he added."

In rare cases, a few have come down with typhoid too.In fact, the situation is worse at the Gandhi Hospital mess above the emergency block, with the doctors claiming that it is infested with rodents.""It's the worst place to have food, but we are helpless as 70-80 duty doctors working for 24 hours at a stretch cannot bring food from home. I have an upset stomach now,"" said a senior doctor at Gandhi Hospital on condition of anonymity.The mess at the hospital neither has a fridge to store vegetables nor proper containers to store cooked food. One can see rotten tomatoes, chillies and other vegetables left to dry on pieces of paper and half-eaten food kept in dirty plastic containers without lids. Leftovers from lunch being served for dinner is also quite common. Adding to the troubles is the fact that the wash basin is situated in the common eating area itself.""Poor quality food in unhygienic conditions could lead to acute gastroenteritis, hepatitis infection, food poisoning, fever and typhoid. Though we are supposed to be served eggs, milk and fruits every day, it's never followed,"" said Dr R Raghu, general secretary of the Gandhi Hospital unit of Telangana Government Doctors' Association. He also alleged that inspectors from the food safety department have never come to test the food samples.The situation at the Osmania General Hospital is much the same. ""Two months ago, I was down with abdomen pain and fever after eating at our mess. We brought up the issue of unhygienic condition at our mess with the authorities, but to no avail ,"" said a third year postgraduate medico at OGH.Doctors also alleged that the menu card, which was prescribed by the director of medical education (DME) for duty doctors in teaching hospitals, is only on paper.""It is quite unfair that the government spends a measly Rs 82 per doctor to provide them food during duty hours. It must be hiked to Rs 150 per day so that better quality food can be served in hygienic conditions,"" said Dr G Srinivas, president, Telangana Junior Doctors' Association.However, when contacted, both OGH and Gandhi Hospital authorities denied the allegations. ""The hospital food is served to both doctors and patients only after it passes quality tests every day. However, if any individual doctor has any issues, it can be brought to our notice,"" said Dr G V S Murthy, superintenent, OGH.In the case of Gandhi Hospital, Dr S V Masood, deputy superintendent, said there was no problem. But he promised to get food samples randomly picked and tested at their microbiology department from now on."

To keep the competition alive, all major parties like AIADMK and DMK have fielded heavyweight candidates.Pennagaram is known for abject poverty and lack of employment as well as lack of educational opportunities. Though the constituency has more than 2.26 lakh people, about 50% of them migrated to other districts and states in search of employment. About 10% have shifted to neighbouring towns for higher education.This constituency had seen 14 general elections and one byelection since its formation in 1971. Of them, DMK has won 4 times while PMK, AIADMK and Congress won twice each and Gandhi Kamarajar National Congress (GKNC) and Janata Party won one time each. Vanniyars form the majority of the population here. Senguntha Mudaliar, Vaniba Chettiyar, Muslims and SC/STs are also present.Ramadoss won the 2014 Parliamentary election with a margin of 77,146 votes against his rival AIADMK candidate P S Mohan. Of the 4.68 lakh votes that Anbumani got, more than 90,000 were from Pennagaram constituency alone and he got over 34,000 more votes than the AIADMK candidate. ""Keeping this in mind, Anbumani is contesting from Pennagaram constituency as it should be a cakewalk for him,"" said a PMK functionary.Jayalalithaa, who was rattled by Anbumani's victory in 2014 election, has fielded K P Munusamy, former minister for municipal administration and rural development of Tamil Nadu. Though he is from Krishnagiri district, he rented a house in Pennagaram once he was announced as the candidate for this constituency.Former MLA P N Periannan's son P N P Inbasekaran of DMK is contesting for the second time from this constituency. Though he was defeated in 2011 election by CPI candidate N Nanjappan, this time, Inbasekaran and DMK party supporters are hoping that the anti-incumbency factor may work in his favour.The sitting MLA of the constituency N Nanjappan is also contesting with support from DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance. He is confident of repeating the 2011 results where he got 80, 028 votes while DMK candidate Inbasekaran secured only 68,485 votes. ""With the DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance, our victory is even more secure this time,"" said K Rajasekaran, a CPI cadre.Pennagaram, a backward constituency, mainly depends on agriculture. Acute water scarcity has forced many farmers to give up agriculture and migrate to other towns or Karnataka in search of employment. All contestants have promised to take steps to reduce water crisis and increase employment.Anbumani assured that he would open a government arts college, a military research centre, processing units for tomato and tamarind and SIDCO for employments. ""We really hope that he will keep his promises. Most of the villagers have decided to cast our votes in favour of Anbumani,"" said K Balamurugan, one of the villagers.K Mahaboob Basha, an autorickshaw driver said he would support PMK candidate Anbumani this time as he was dissatisfied with the work of the sitting MLA. ""Most of our MLAs have failed to fulfil their promises and this time many of the Muslims in the constituency have decided to support Anbumani,"" he said."

Located next to the hustle and bustle of corporate Connaught Place is Informal, and as the name suggests, this is the place office-goers should visit to leave behind the hurdles of work.A mid-priced alcohol menu and some delicious finger-food, this gastropub, which can seat up to 120 people, hits the right note in many ways.Informal, from the House of Imperfecto that has outlets in Hauz Khas Village and Gurgaon, opened its doors last September.Sprawled across two floors and a terrace, wood and plush leather dominate Informal's interiors.But the tough look is softened by the use of white curtains and fairy lights.Taking pride in charcoal-grilled items and wood-fired pizzas, the menu offers world cuisine ranging from a Spanish paella, a parma ham pizza, to a very 'desi' non-vegetarian kebab platter.It has also introduced a Rs. 99 menu under which selected food and drinks, including beer, are served. This menu is generally aimed at the nearby office-goers coming in for a quick lunch.To start off, we were served their signature cocktails. What an Idea! - a vodka based drink infused with red berry, thyme, grenadine and lime juice. Reminiscent of the classic cosmopolitan cocktail, but nevertheless yummy and very pretty in a deep-reddish pink. Girls, now you know what to order here!The second cocktail was the Candy Garden, also a vodka-based drink mixed with pineapple juice and peach liqueur, and topped with red wine. Undoubtedly this was one of the most pretty drinks, with the mix of sunset orange, topped with a layer of pale red. However, do not go by the name, it is nothing like candy, but very potent yet refreshing.We were served an array of dishes out of which some were definitely worth coming back for and the others were a bit of a letdown.The dishes which stole the limelight were dahi ke sholey with roasted onion sauce, pepperoni and parma ham wood-fired pizzas, charcoal grilled chicken lollipops , fish fingers with chips and tartar sauce and the non-vegetarian shahi platter.Dahi ke sholey was similar to croquettes but the yogurt filling made these deep fried goodies one of Informal's must-try dishes. It could be a little on a heavier side due to the generous amount of filling, but this paired with a glass of chilled golden beer on a hot summer evening is just the perfect way to beat the work blues. The charcoal-grilled chicken lollipos were melt in the mouth perfections. The chicken was soft, juicy and the charcoal flavour gave it a very rustic feel.People often say that wood-fired thin crust pizza are the real deal and the ones here actually proves this fact. Both the pizzas were smeared with a sauce made out of 'pelati' or peeled tomatoes which added a little sweetness. So every crunchy bite was the perfect melange of sweet and savoury.The fish fingers and the chips were fried to a golden perfection and the tartar sauce elevated the flavours. A great dish while waiting for a friend or something to just start a conversation with. The non-vegetarian shahi platter had tandoori chicken, malai tikka, chicken tikka and mutton seekh. A little too salty but the charred flavour was very tasty and the meat was again melt in the mouth category.However, the few dishes that failed to make a mark were the ham croquetas, charcoal broiled chicken wings with barbeque sauce, paella and the chicken scallops.The speciality of the ham croquetas is that it had parma ham in the filling which has been imported from Spain and is cured for 16 months but when you bite into this cheesy deep fried roll, there is absolutely no sign of the ham. On closer inspection, there were pieces of ham which were tinier than the nail on my pinky finger. Very disappointing. If it wasn't for the parma ham treasure hunt, the dish would be a tasty vegetarian starter.Chicken wings are something that one does not always go wrong with, but in this case the chicken was chewy and it was not quoted well with a nice sticky barbeque sauce.The paella could be mistaken for a sea food risotto. It had the same texture as that of the risotto, but flavours were not bad. The chicken scallops again has the charred taste, a little on the blander side. But the stir fried vegetables were a good accompaniment.For the ones with a sweet tooth, there are no desserts in the main menu, but the Rs.99 menu has brownie with ice cream.Overall, Informal has stood true to what it aims to achieve.FAQs:Where: 52, Tolstoy Lane, Janpath, New DelhiMeal for two: Rs.2,000 (with alcohol)Timings: 11.00 a.m.- 1.00 a.m.(The writer's visit was at the invitation of Informal.

Dr R S Sidhu, director of extension education has alerted the farmers against the whitefly attack on cotton. He urged them to monitor their cotton fields in order to avoid the worst consequences of the attack. He also stressed on eradicating the weeds on waste lands, roadsides, and irrigation channels/canals to avoid spread of whitefly to cotton fields."

Although Aparna Pawar and her husband Mohan had fulfilling, lucrative careers as a civil engineer and a drug analyst respectively, the distress in the village where they had spent their childhoods directed their thoughts home. Or, as Aparna says, they found their calling in life.The couple has now set up a successful horticulture farm in their native village of Madalmohi in Gevrau taluka in Beed district, and has helped around 20 distressed farmers turn their fortunes in the wake of one of the worst droughts in the region's history. They also managed to export pomegranates to Dubai this year. Their journey had begun 5 years ago.""Madalmohi is a small village, just about 19km from Gevrai taluka. This year January to May 13, 2016, as many as 9 farmers committed suicide in Gevrai, while over a dozen ended their lives last year. The taluka also recorded less than 50% average rainfall and recorded less than 50% of anewari (crop yield), which was just 37%,"" said Gevrai tehsildar, Balasaheb Pakhale.""Debt-trap, falling crop prices, deficient rainfall and lack of access to best farming practices has made the situation in the entire village grim. There was also no direct access to the market and the farm-produce had to be routed through middlemen. This forces many farmers to migrate to cities and do menial jobs just to survive,"" he said.It was this, perhaps, that hurt. ""Most of us experience a calling at some point in our lives, something like Mother Teresa had in a moving train. Yet many of us fail to respond to it. My husband and I were deeply disturbed to find the state of farmers in our village. Since Mohan owned 17-acre land at Madalmohi, we decided to organise the farmers of the village to tide over the drought and also earn a dignified earning,"" says Aparna.The first task the couple did was construct a farm pond on a two-acre land, about 38 feet deep and with a capacity of 3 crore litres so that it could store rain water. The next step was to decide the crops which could be lucrative and required less water. ""We chose horticulture farming since it requires less time to cultivate and reaped vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, drumsticks, cabbage and pepper. We also planted fruit-bearing trees like pomegranates and watermelon. The pond has been a tremendous boon. We get a good quality yield of pomegranates that we exported to Dubai since past three years,"" says Mohan.The Pawars have a motto born from experience. ""Pre-planning, water management, water audit, farm ponds, crop-patterning and drip irrigation are the ways to survive drought conditions. To improve water use efficiency, farmers should use the 'More crop per drop' farm model,"" says Aparna.The couple also trained over 35 farmers in the village to install horticulture projects in their farm. ""We trained the farmers, especially those who are small land-holders to adopt alternate cropping patterns. We advised them to avoid cultivating crops such as cotton and sugarcane which gives yield after a long time, about six months. Farmers in rain-fed areas should cultivate alternate crops three times in a year's span. Especially, vegetables and fruits which give yield in three months,""says Mohan, adding that drip irrigation is the best way to tide over water scarcity.The Samaritans have their share of testimonials. Jeevan Pawar, a farmer who had been experiencing loss since many years said after he emulated the measures, he has been getting good yield of vegetables and has also not incurred any losses. ""This year, I have a good yield of vegetables which have fetched me a decent income to survive the adverse conditions,"" he says.Another farmer Babanrao Muley said, ""Every year, I would cultivate cotton hoping to get a good yield but ended up facing losses due to deficient rainfall. But since past two years, I switched to horticulture. It has helped me get my daughter married."""

Surrounded by tall coconut trees amidst which cows and sheep roam, the open air jail at Ondipudur could easily be mistaken for a breezy farm house but for the'farm workers' clad in typical prison uniform made of coarse white cotton.In a paradox of sorts, while other prisons are teaming with inmates, the number of prisoners in this open air jail has thinned from an average 25 to just 4. One upon a time, the agricultural field was abuzz with activity.Now, the land remains dry and uncultivated for more than a year. The coconut trees are desperate for attention. ""The coconut trees used to yield 20,000 nuts per year. This has dwindled to 5000 nuts. Besides, there's hardly anyone to pick this meagre yield,"" said a prison staff.The statistics reeled out by prison authorities are mind-boggling. During its heyday, when the 30 acre jail was abuzz with agricultural activities, vegetables like tomato, ladies finger, brinjal, beetroot and spinach were cultivated.The vegetables grown here were used to cook food for inmates of the central prison. During the peak yield years, there were 100 inmates working in the open air jail, which has seen over 1,000 prisoners reformed over the last three decades.Now the jail has 943 coconut trees, 26 cows and 63 sheep. The wilted branches of coconut trees are not removed and the animals don't get the attention they used to get. ""Earlier we used to work for eight hours. But now the work extends till 11pm. We have to wash the cows, bring them fodder and clear the dung,'' says an inmate.Inmates with a clean track record and those who are about to complete their conviction with no tendency to escape are sent to the open air jail. While offering them an opportunity to reform, the farming activities also give them a chance to learn a means of livelihood, which will go a long way in helping them integrate with mainstream society after their release.An inmates will get 50 percent of his sentence remitted if he comes to the open air jail. But an alleged escape by a prisoner from another open air jail in Tamil Nadu has put curbs on inmates being sent to the Ondipudur prison.Last year, only 12 convicts were staying in the open air jail. This year, there are just four, even though the prison department has allotted 12 staff to man the jail. One convict takes care of the cows and another oversees the sheep. Coconut trees are maintained by one convict while the fourth takes care of cooking.""We have short-listed 30 inmates to be sent from the central prison to the open air jail. The decision now rests with our superiors,"" said a prison staff."

PHOTO: A. MURALITHARANCelebrating Pongal festival this year has proved to be dearer, with prices of sugarcane, vegetables, and turmeric bunches shooting up.The edible variety of sugarcane is an essential part of the festival and the demand has peaked. Apart from whole sale traders in the Gandhi Market, a large number of vendors had set up at every lane and by-lane in various parts of the city.The produce cultivated in Tirukattupalli was much sought-after among members of the public, though it is a bit dearer.R. Murugan, a vendor at Khajapet in Sangiliyandapuram, said he had invested Rs. 24,000-Rs. 21,000 towards the cane and Rs. 3,000 for expenditure for transit by carriage van from Tirukattupalli to the city to purchase 1,000 canes. Thus my investment on a single cane is Rs. 24 and I sell it for Rs. 30, he says.As compared to last years rates, the price had shot up by Rs. 10 a cane. Mr. Murugan says the rise in price was because of inclusion of sugarcane as one of the Pongal gift in the State governments package.Another dealer from Iluppur C. Vendan says he had to invest Rs. 16,000 this year against Rs. 10,000 last year to buy the sugarcane. He had brought the cane from Andakulam in Pudukottai district and has set up his sales units in four centres in the city.The sudden spurt in the price has come as a shock for the customers who make a hard bargain, he said.Stiff competitionBoth Mr. Murugan and Mr. Vendan say they face stiff competition from the new entrants. I have utilised my experience in selling eateries near a school, for marketing the sugarcane, he says.Traders say although the sale would continue for three more days, it was during the Bhogi and Pongal festival they can realise maximum sales.The prices of vegetables shot up by 20 to 30 per cent over the usual rates. Traders said that bulk and simultaneous demand for horticultural crops particularly vegetables and flowers would register an increase with the dawn of Thai month. The price per kg of carrot, tomato, potato, and beans had shot by at least Rs. 10.There was a scramble for turmeric bunches. The price which stood at Rs. 10 a bunch in the morning shot up to Rs. 20 a couple of hours later."

""These freebies were brought using your tax money, but they proclaim that it was brought from their own money,"" he said.He added that the government may have spent 3,000 on each family for the freebies, but siphoned about 45,000 through hikes in milk prices, bus fares and electricity bills.Assuring many projects and schemes for Omalur constituency, Stalin said that he will initiate steps to implement water projects on the Cauvery at Pottaneri. ""Four rail over-bridges will be constructed at four places across Omalur,"" he said.He also promised to set up a tomato juice factory in Mecheri and perfume factory at Kadaiyamapatti, widening of Omalur-Tharamanglam state highway and also to upgrade Omalur government hospital to a district hospital.Later, Stalin campaigned at Mecheri for Mettur MDMDK candidate S R Parthiban. During his speech, Stalin indirectly attacked PMK, he pointed out that DMK was the only party which announced for a separate budget for agriculture. ""Now some parties immediately started taking credit for the announcement which we made. This shows their lack of preparation,"" he said.After his campaign in Salem district, Stalin headed to Dharmapuri district on Tuesday evening. Earlier on Tuesday morning, Stalin hit the streets in Suramangalam locality and sought votes for DMK candidate C Pannerselvam.He also campaigned for Salem North Constituency candidate Panamarathupatti R Rajendran near Gandhi Stadium."

Traders at Muhana Mandi claimed that since it is no harvest season for the vegetables, there is an acute supply crunch which has contributed to the price rise of the vegetables which are almost 40% more compared to 2015.Tomatoes which were selling at Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kg in the wholesale market a fortnight ago, are now being sold at Rs 45 to Rs 50. ""Because of the higher wholesale prices, the tomatoes in Jaipur are sold at Rs 50 to Rs 70 per kg in the retail market,"" said Abdul Hameed, a wholesaler at the Muhana Mandi on Monday.Bottle gourd which was selling at Rs 10 to Rs 15 in the wholesale market is now being sold at Rs 25 to Rs 30 which goes higher when comes to the retail market. ""We are selling bottle gourd at Rs 45 to Rs 60 due to less supply and higher wholesale prices,"" said Ghanshyam Saini, a retailer at Raja Park.When contacted, Radhey Shyam Phatak, president of Rajasthan Fal Sabzi Thok Vyaapar Sangh, said, ""On Monday, the wholesale price of round gourd (tinda) was Rs 70 per kg, coriander Rs 70 to Rs 85, ladyfinger Rs 45 to Rs 50, potato Rs 15 to Rs 30, brinjal Rs 30 to Rs 40, spinach Rs 25 to Rs 30, cauliflower Rs 50 to Rs 55, capsicum Rs 30 Rs 35. The reason behind the higher price is low supply as up to November, it is not the harvest season for vegetables. The prices are going to further increase in the coming days.""Wholesalers at Muhana Mandi said that in the coming days to the rise in the vegetable prices will continue. ""Until we get fresh and new lot of vegetables, the supply will be less and prices will be higher,"" Phatak added."

Besides the desire to obtain pesticide-free vegetables, many youngsters and new house owners see the advantages of 'horticulture therapy'.Says R Krishnamoorthy , deputy director of the horticulture department: ""Gardening is one of the best ways to get out of depression, stress and anxiety by way of interaction with plants. It helps to improve concentration and self-esteem in children and enables the elderly to cope with depression. It is a medicine without prescription.""According to officials in the horticulture department, they have distributed nearly 2,500 kits to households in Trichy district.The department has launched the project under the Urban Horticulture Development Scheme (UHDS) in the district in February 2016 and began distributing the kits, officials said.Each kit comprising coco peat, compressed bricks, vegetable seeds - brinjal, ladies finger, tomato, beans and chilly - bio-fertilizers, bio-pesticides, along with pamphlets costs Rs 500, they said.The organic fertilizers include ashosphyrillam, phosphobacteria, bio-fungicides-pseudomonas and trichoderma viridi and water soluble fertilizer.""Residents from Srirangam have bought the largest number of kits. As the project was launched during the summer season, the plant growth as well as the crop yield were not as much as we expected. Normally, solar radiation is very high in Trichy district,"" said Krishnamoorthy During the coming monsoon season, plants will grow better and give better yield. To protect the plants from direct sunlight, officials are advising customers to put up a thin cover to decrease the radiation level, he said. Benedict Peter , an engineering graduate who has set up a terrace garden at his house at Woraiyur in the city, said he preferred mostly native vegetables, greens and herbs. Organic terrace gardening is not only about using organic manure and contents. ""It is about creating a small eco system in our terrace for small organisms to flourish. Only then it is a real organic garden,"" he said.""To minimise the radiation level, we can create a simple roof set-up with bamboo or ropes so that we can grow climbers in it. It is a simple way to implement solid waste management at our home,"" he said."

This has had a cascading effect on retail prices which, in case of patotatoes and onions, have shot up by anwhere between 50% and 100%.""I bought potatoes for under Rs 30 a kg on Friday. Today, the prices have gone up to Rs 50. Tomatoes and onions too have increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20. In Delhi, however, the vegetable prices continue to be stable,"" said Kavya Kohli, a resident of Sector 46.Increase in the prices of tomatoes and onions particularly has affected households.""We can opt for brinjal instead of cauliflower or beans instead of peas in case of price rise but we cannot replace essentials like tomatoes and onions. Vegetable prices generally drop with the arrival of winter,"" said Sanjeev R. Shukla, a resident of Sector 4.Vegetable prices, both wholesale and retail, soared within days of demolition of all the 175 makeshift shops in the Khandsa market on Saturday by the agricultural produce marketing committee. The space was cleared to set up an open-shed agricultural mall here.President of the Khandsa market association Inderjeet Thakran told TOI, ""While the authorities have razed the makeshift shops, they have no alternative arrangement in place to shift the wholesale vegetable market until the open-shed mall comes up. Vegetables in Gurgaon come from different parts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangalore. Wholesalers, who used to get 80 to 85 tonnes of vegetables everyday, have reduced the quantities to 20 to 22 tonnes for lack of space to store the produce. This has led to decrease in supply leading to increase in the prices.""""We have met all the senior officials and even the agricultural minister and chief minister to discuss the issue at hand. The agricultural minister has called us on October 13. We are only demanding a temporary place from where the wholesale market for time being. The income of over 10,000 families is at stake. Moreover, the common man is bearing the brunt of the government action,"" Thakran added.Agricultural experts feel the absence of the wholesale vegetable market may further increase the vegetable prices, leading to black marketing.""Retailers have already increased the veggie prices owing to decrease in supply. the government's decision to demolish the mandi could be affect the common man adversely,"" said Tarun Kumar Dhull, a city-based agricultural expert.Spread in an area of 2.5 acres, the Khandsa Market was set up in Gurgaon in 1984. Until it was demolished, the market received over 200 trucks carrying 300 tonnes of vegetables and fruits every day."

Montalbanos First Case and Other Stories is a collection of stories about Sicilys most celebrated police inspector. After millions of copies and an immensely popular television series, a bronze statue of Inspector Montalbano now faces that of the playwright Luigi Pirandello in Camilleris birthplace, the town of Porto Empedocle. Or, as the town is now popularly known, in honour of the fictional setting of the Montalbano novels: Porto Empedocle Vigata.One knows not to expect tidy endings in a Montalbano story. In the old days, detective fiction provided reassurance that in times of disorder, someone capable would come along and fix everything. Thats how it was in the golden age of the detective novel, between the wars: cosy mysteries in country houses, footprints in the flower bed, and denouements in large room with fireplaces. Very posh and Downton Abbey.Change in crime fictionSince then, times have changed, and so has the crime novel. In Salvo Montalbanos Sicily, we find an ancient Mediterranean landscape now beleaguered by corruption, trafficking, immigration issues, drugs, environmental degradation, and the mafia. The first time we see Montalbano summoned as a witness in court, the accused is a mafia scion and the public prosecutors statement sounds like a defence argument. In his first year on the job, we are told, Montalbano dived headlong into these Mafia murder cases, only to come up empty-handed. Nobody had seen anything, nobody had heard anything, nobody suspected anything, nobody imagined anything, nobody knew anyone.Yet against this background, we see Montalbano and his colleagues doggedly climbing up hillsides to talk to shepherds, visiting hospices to listen to dying statements, taking the train when the airlines are on strike, standing in line before court clerks, and generally trying to do their best in an imperfect world.G.K. Chesterton once wrote that the detective novel expresses some sense of the poetry of modern life, and that the policeman, trying to deliver justice to ordinary people, is a poetic figure in the city. In the wasteland of contemporary urban life, Montalbano finds his identity in his work. Im like a photograph, he says to his girlfriend Livia. I exist insofar as theres a negative made up of crimes, murder and acts of violence.A facet of Montalbanos character is that he reads and rereads, often obsessively. His reflective temperament makes him think of stories by Borges and quotes from Roland Barthes. In a Pirandellesque twist in one story, Montalbano finds the details of the crime too oppressive and telephones his author to say so. His name itself is a feat of inter-textuality: Camilleri named his fictional detective after the Spanish writer Manuel Vazquez Montalban, the creator of the witty private eye Pepe Carvalho.Sicilian charactersUnlike the infallible detectives of earlier crime fiction, Montalbano is all too human: beset by bad dreams, self-doubt, mood swings, an irascible temperament, a kind heart and a weakness for good food. He often lies, bends rules, and hates signing papers. At the same time, he has an unshakable sense of duty and responsibility. When he sees an old lady walking home at two in the morning, he insists on dropping her home. When an elderly small-time burglar calls him one night with information, he takes coffee for him in a thermos. In Montalbanos view, everyone deserves a fair chance. Sometimes I ask myself what proof God had to accuse Cain of murdering Abel, he tells a priest in one story. If I could, I swear Id reopen the case.Unforgettable Sicilian characters shine through Camilleris stories. In Montalbanos first case, his boss is described as unfit (for the job) because he wasnt afraid of anybody. In another, a villager wrongly accused of murder is described by the locals as a shepherd king, one who would never cut down a nettle, let alone kill a man.And then there is Montalbanos cook, the incomparable Adelina whom we rarely see except through her heavenly food. Montalbano has one eye on her wastrel sons and the other on her caponata. On New Year eve she writes a note to Montalbano, inviting him home for dinner: Botha my boys are free and I gonna meck arancini rice balls wich they lika so much. Despite his belief that the best meals are eaten alone, Montalbano decides to accept the invitation. Only one question still nagged him before he fell asleep: would both of Adelinas delinquent sons manage to stay out of gaol until tomorrow?Camilleris inventive, ironic prose, in a unique mix of Italian and Sicilian, comes to us through the elegant translations of Stephen Sartarelli, an American poet based in France. His translators notes are a pleasure in themselves. When we read that old issues of Topolino covered the floor, Sartarelli explains that Topolino is Mickey Mouse in Italian, a popular fortnightly that still exists today.Adelina will not cook pasta in Trapanese pesto sauce and Montalbano must therefore organise it for himself. Sartarelli informs us that this recipe substitutes blanched almonds for pine nuts, along with uncooked tomato; and toasted breadcrumbs sprinkled on the dish instead of cheese. Like the Montalbano novels, this sounds like a special delight.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the IASand currently based in Bengaluru.Montalbanos reflective temperament makes him think of stories by Borges and quotes from Roland BarthesUnlike the infallible detectives of earlier crime fiction, Montalbano is all too human"

This wasn't a routine celebratory excursion to celebrate a win, however. Ranieri had a surprise for his players when they landed at the pizzeria: they had to make their own pizzas.Into the kitchen they all went, where waiting chefs and staff had the necessary ingredients and utensils lined up. And so the entire Leicester squad - star strikers Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez included - dipped their hands into dough and cheese and marinara sauce and proceeded to toss their own pies in the air.Ranieri, an Italian who loves his pizza and pasta, likened football to pizza. ""The most important ingredient is team spirit and the second is they enjoy training. That is important. Also to sprinkle a little luck is important, like salt. The fans are the tomato. Without the tomato, it's no pizza,"" he said.Following that outing tossing pizzas, Leicester have had 13 'clean sheets' out of 29 games - that is, they have not conceded a goal in 13 games. It is a statistic that gives Ranieri immense pride. And now, with Leicester being crowned Premier League winners to cap one of the most memorable seasons of English football ever, the fairytale has reached its pinnacle. You don't have to be a dedicated football follower - this writer is not one such - to be swept up in Leicester's amazing run to an improbable and historic Premier League title. One that started at the end of the previous season when the Foxes scripted a great escape from relegation.In a column last month, Ranieri describes arriving at the club between seasons and looking at ""players who were considered too small or too slow for other big clubs"". He was referring to Vardy, Mahrez, N'Golo Kante, Wes Morgan and Danny Drinkwater. Looking at these players, Ranieri felt Leicester ""had a chance to survive in the Premier League"".Survive? They have dazzled the football world with their magnificent run to the title for the first time in 132 years of playing, providing English football with its biggest shock since 1992 when Ipswich won the title just 12 months after gaining promotion. Before this season, there were reports of some bookmakers marking Leicester at odds of 5000-1 to win the EPL. They have taken the form book and tossed it out the window, in the process scripting a stunning tale of success in the face of history and heavyweights with several times larger bank balances and star-studded lineups. What Leicester paid to acquire its squad's starting 11, football's richest teams often spend on one player. Remarkably, they have outperformed such giants in the league.Vardy is the third most successful goal-scorer of the competition, with 22, and has provided six assists for his team-mates. Mahrez - voted PFA Player of the Year - has 17 goals to go with 11 assists, the fourth most this season. Drinkwater has seven goals, Morgan has been a key ingredient and Kante is arguably the most valuable midfielder of the league, if not the most durable. The startling success of Vardy - Ranieri's ""fantastic horse"" who a few years ago was working in a factory and playing football by night - has included a record-breaking feat of scoring in 11 consecutive games and his work in tandem with Mahrez is unparalleled. Heck, we're talking about a player whose remarkable journey has seen him go from non-league to the international stage, with England calling for Vardy. How's that for fairytale?On top of all this is the stability that resonates from Leicester's campaign. Ranieri - the man nicknamed 'The Tinkerman' for constant shuffling at past clubs - has made just 27 changes to the starting lineup this season. Taking over from where Nigel Pearson was cut off at the end of the 2014-15 season, Ranieri immediately identified the mood within the Leicester camp and decided that he would change little. He focused on trust, and how to build it. In between his pep talks and strategizing, the Italian threw in the lure of additional days off for players who put in the hard yards. Then there was that pizza dinner after the team's first clean sheet. Such deft touches made a difference, and how.That the dream didn't fizzle is what makes Leicester's run this season even more remarkable. Indeed, one of their strongest assets is the ability to come back from draws and the odd defeat. A 4-1 win over Bury in the Capital One Cup came after a 1-1 draw with Tottenham; a draw at Bournemouth was followed by a 3-2 win over Villa, when they at one stage fell behind 0-2; when their hopes of avoiding relegation receded with a 2-5 loss to Arsenal, Leicester's reply was a 2-1 win over Norwich; a 1-1 final score against Manchester United was backed by 3-0 at Swansea. In mid-April, Leicester's biggest win of the season (4-0 over Swansea) came without Vardy, serving a suspension. Since April 14, they are 7-2-0 while outscoring opponents 15-4. Incredible, really.And yet this isn't the story of a never-say-die bunch of underachievers. Yes, finances were thinner than in most other clubs - when Mahrez was drafted into the side two years ago from French second-tier side Le Havre, it cost Leicester an approximate 400,000 and Kante was signed last summer for 5.6m - and Ranieri written off by many. Yes, this team had to rise above and put behind them off-field issues such as Vardy's racial slur at a casino and the sacking of three reserves over a racist sex tape before the season.This is about a serious bunch of football players pooling their collective skills together under the attentive and scheming gaze of a tactful Ranieri, with his 15th football team. It's about Vardy pushing himself to achieve the unthinkable, of the likes of Mahrez and Konte and Mark Albrighton being given the room to play as they wish. It's about the team owners creating an environment of camaraderie, which Ranieri was quick to encourage and build on. No team has created more chances, no combination has scored more goals than Vardy and Mahrez. This is a secure unit, put in the right space.Whatever happens to the fabric of this history-defying Leicester City squad during the months to come - several bigger clubs have targeted Kante and surely giants like United and Chelsea will bounce back hard - one thing is certain: nothing will ever top what they experienced this EPL season.

As a first step, it was decided to eliminate the use of plastic bags in the uzhavar sandhais, where the vendors used to hand over vegetables in plastic carry bags to customers. These vendors were urged to give up the use of plastic bags and were given cloth bags, which the customer could purchase for 5 each. A cloth bag can hold 4-5 kg vegetables.Almost five months hence, the use of plastic bags has come down drastically. ""It is a good thing the vendors do not keep plastic bags. I did not think they would follow this rule so seriously,"" said K Ganeshan of Chokkikulam, who has now started bringing his own bag to the market for the past three months.Saying 'no' to plastic or polythene bags has always been more a slogan than the norm in the city. The civic body occasionally conducts raids and makes seizures, but the uzhavar sandhais have been able to implement the ban on plastics without much supervision. ""The supervisor will come and take action against us, so we do not keep polythene bags any longer,'' said Rani, a vendor at the Anna Nagar uzhavar sandhai. Though no fine is specified, these vendors are threatened with cancellation of their shops' membership if they use the bags.Founder of the Centre for Environmental Services SV Pathy says this is one initiative that has yielded result. Vendors in the markets purchase plastic bags of less than 3 micron for as much as about 20 for 100 bags. Tomato vendors are frequent users of these bags, but now they too have stopped using them. He said these markets used not less than 1,000 of these bags on a daily basis. These may be less in weight, but could cause a lot of environmental damage.The uzhavar sandhais have set a good example, as segregating plastic bags from vegetables waste in the market used to be a big problem. ""It will be better if the same rule is implemented in the central market, where the use of plastic bags is much more. Also, the collector can ensure that the use of the black polythene bags in meat shops is banned,"" he saidThe collector said the response from the public and vendors in farmers' markets was encouraging and the district administration was now exploring ways to implement the plastic ban in other places in the district also."

The combination of a shallow fault and old, unreinforced masonry buildings led to widespread devastation in the earthquake that struck central Italy early Wednesday.The magnitude-6.2 quake killed at least 247 people and left hundreds more injured. Many people were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings.Like other villages and towns in the mountainous area, Amatrice, where the mayor lamented that ""half the town no longer exists,"" has stone churches and other buildings that were constructed centuries ago, when little if anything was known about earthquakes. Unless they have been reinforced in recent years, such structures are easily damaged or destroyed by shaking.""Even 100 years ago, they didn't know how to build structures to withstand earthquakes,"" said David A Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at the Open University in Milton Keynes, England.The earthquake was less powerful than many recent deadly quakes. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck Nepal in April 2015, for instance, killing 8,000 people, released roughly 250 times more energy.But the Italian quake was very shallow: According to the U.S. Geological Survey, it occurred about 6 miles below the surface.""Shallow earthquakes cause more destruction than deep earthquakes because the shallowness of the source makes the ground-shaking at the surface worse,"" Rothery said.Video from Amatrice and other towns near the quake center showed heaps of masonry rubble from buildings that had been shaken apart.Earthquakes are set off by the movement of the earth's crust, which is divided into large sections called tectonic plates. The Apennine Mountains, where the quake occurred Wednesday, are in an area where one plate, the African, is moving under another, the Eurasian.Because of the complex interaction between the plates, the basin of the Tyrrhenian Sea, off Italy's west coast, is spreading. It is this spreading, and the tension it creates in the Apennines, that led to the quake.The area of Wednesday's temblor experienced significant earthquakes in the past, including one with a magnitude of 6.3 near the town of L'Aquila in 2009 that killed at least 295 people, injured more than 1,000 and left 55,000 homeless.The two quakes had much in common, said Massimo Cocco, a geologist with the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Rome.""In terms of genesis and depth, they are rather similar,"" he added.After the 2009 quake, seven members of a national commission on risk prevention were arrested on charges of failing to adequately warn L'Aquila about the earthquake risk. They were found guilty of manslaughter in 2012 and sentenced to six years in prison, but they were cleared in 2014 by an appeals court.Cocco said that Italy had anti-seismic construction laws for new buildings, but that little has been done to reinforce existing buildings that make up a vast majority of Italian structures.""Resilience is just too low compared to the frequency and the high impact of natural phenomena determined by the seismic risk of our country,"" he said.RELATED STORIES Italy quake kills 159 as rescuers race to find survivors6.2 magnitude earthquake +BACKGROUND X Italy earthquake death toll rises, towns reduced to rubble Rescue crews using bulldozers and their bare hands raced to dig out survivors from a strong earthquake+ that reduced three central Italian towns to rubble.

As of Thursday morning, the deaths totaled at least 247, officials said.""Half the town no longer exists,"" Mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice told reporters Wednesday morning.He might have been too optimistic. By midday Amatrice, a quiet mountain town about 100 miles northeast of Rome, felt more like a ghost town.Ambulances raced along windy roads clogged with traffic and rubble as rescue teams searched for survivors. Using picks, shovels and hands, they scrabbled through the dust and debris of crumbled homes. They brought in dogs to sniff for the dead and injured beneath collapsed concrete and stone.A soft white dust was still swirling about the rubble piled waist-high in Amatrice. Stunned survivors - some with tear-streaked cheeks, others still wearing pajamas - wandered through the streets, unsure what to do.A father, holding a small child, pushed a wobbly stroller piled with plastic bags of clothing over a rocky path. A young girl sobbed into her mobile phone.""It's all gone, the bar, the house, everything,"" she said.The initial quake was comparable in intensity to one in 2009 in the central Abruzzo region that killed more than 300 people.and aftershocks were felt as far away as Bologna, Rome and Naples. Camps were set up to house hundreds of homeless, and authorities were also trying to account for an unknown number of tourists.""The number of missing people is undefined at the moment,"" Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit at Italy's Civil Protection Agency, said at a news conference in Rome.With a permanent population of about 2,000, Amatrice is a place where people know one another. Many had ties to Rome in one way or another, working there in the winter, running restaurants, bars and hotels, as food has always been part of the town's culture.""If you closed the restaurants in Rome run by Amatriciani, you'd close half the restaurants,"" said Maria Prassede Perilli, a resident who had been visiting her sister in Rome when the quake struck.Perilli said she had rushed back after her husband, Giacomo, called in the middle of the night in a frightened voice, telling her, ""There's been a terrible earthquake, you can't even imagine.""Her husband survived, she said, but his sisters and niece did not. The couple's house was crushed. ""It's flat, like a book,"" she said.For many residents who worked in Rome, August was the traditional month of rest and relaxation, enjoying Amatrice's mild climate and fresh air after months of Roman smog.""You had dinners in the piazza, long tables with lots of people, someone would bring out a guitar to sing,"" Perilli said. ""It's the mountain, it's a good place to be.""It was especially wrenching for her to bump into shocked friends and acquaintances.""They can't find Alessandra, they can't find Alessandra,"" one woman who approached said of her niece, buried under the rubble along with her mother. Perilli commiserated.""I don't want to listen to anything any more. It's all: 'Did you hear that he died, did you know that that entire family was buried; wife, husband, child.' I just can't take it,"" she said, eyes tearing. ""I feel as though I am in a dream, and I'm hoping that one moment I'll wake up.""Nearby, diggers were lifting rubble into trucks.""Will they ever be able to rebuild this?"" Perilli said. ""It seems like the end of an era.""Rescue teams representing a spectrum of police and armed forces, local civil protection agencies from around the country, as well as medical staff members worked through the day searching for survivors, but more often finding the dead.""This is positive; as soon as the earthquake struck, people came from all over to help,"" said Riza Sinani, a nurse from the nearby town of Rieti. ""That doesn't happen in every country, this outpouring of humanity and good will.""Several people in Amatrice said the town had been full of tourists who came for the coming weekend's annual Sagra dell'Amatriciana festival, which celebrates Amatrice's native pasta sauce, using cured pork cheek known as guanciale, and grated pecorino cheese. The festival has been canceled.As sympathy and offers of support poured in from around the world, Pope Francis led pilgrims at St. Peter's Square in praying for the victims, clutching a rosary in his right hand, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi went to Rieti.Renzi praised rescue workers and volunteers and vowed to rebuild  a promise particularly important for Italians still furious about the long delays in reconstruction after the 2009 quake.The area's most significant monument, the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, was unharmed, as were monuments in the city of Perugia.""We were saved by a miracle,"" said Stefania Proietti, the mayor of Assisi, where in 1997 a devastating earthquake caused casualties and extensive damage to the city, destroying frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue in the basilica.For those in Amatrice, the immediate focus was on essentials: who was alive, and who was dead, or missing.Among those awaiting information was Laura Besanzoni, who stood behind a ribbon that cordoned off the main street, the Corso Umberto. A few palazzos still stood along the street, but piles of rubble lined both sides, offering glimpses of bright blue sky.""It's like being in one of those countries at war,"" Besanzoni said, looking at the devastation. Her family's palazzo was left standing, she said, but she had no news of an aunt and two cousins.""We don't know if they are dead or alive,"" she said.Makeshift human corridors were created to bring people out. Some were alive, others were not. As one body was passed, wrapped in a plastic cover, one woman wailed: ""That looks like Manuela's hand!""A three-story convent on the edge of town was virtually destroyed by the quake, the top two floors crushing the bottom. A young nun managed to escape, but said she feared that three nuns and four retirees had been buried.A high school teacher from Rome who vacations here every August said her home on the central Corso Umberto had been severely damaged but had not collapsed. The teacher, who identified herself only by her first name, Ilde, said the quake had struck with a loud bang.The buildings across the street from her and next door were destroyed.""Only the town tower was standing,"" she said, describing scenes of panic, her neighbors screaming for help in the dark.""It was Dante's 'Inferno,' it was apocalyptic, I don't know,"" she said. When rescuers came to escort her from her home, she said, she walked on rubble at least 10-13 feet high.In one square, families waited for news while diggers began tackling a pile of bricks and stones that had once been a home. One man had lost his father. Another, an uncle.""I can't think of how many may still be in the rubble,"" said one woman whose house withstood the quake while the neighboring ones did not. Amatrice is in an area prone to earthquakes, she said, ""but we've never felt anything as violent as this.""In the nearby Marche region, the village of Arquata del Tronto and the hamlet of Pescara del Tronto, also suffered major destruction.""When I arrived at the break of day, I saw a destroyed village, screams, death,"" Bishop Giovanni D'Ercole of Ascoli Piceno, who visited Pescara del Tronto, told Vatican Radio.

This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain. K Arumugam, agriculture officer, in-charge of Chockikulam farmers' market said the unseasonal rains had resulted in poor production of vegetables grown in hill stations."

Sakthivel, a floriculturist in Sempatti, who has raised jasmine and tomato in one acre of land. To get the first yield in jasmine, I have to wait for a year. My investments will not stop till harvesting. I receive no returns in the period. Raising tomato helps me maintain my income. I start harvesting tomato from the 40th day. Harvesting will continue for 140 days. I raise two tomato crops in a year. Later, jasmine will fetch me income. Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, we can maximise income. Instead of tomato, chilli can also be grown in jasmine field. But brinjal should not be grown as it will affect flowering plants, he adds.Small onion (shallot) can also be raised on bunds of irrigation channels. No additional water is necessary. Adoption of simple technologies will also improve the quality of vegetables. After harvesting onion, cauliflower can be raised in the same field. Such cropping method will enhance the quality, colour and taste of the flower, he says.Sakthivel gets Rs. 350 per a bag containing 20 cauliflowers in Madurai wholesale market.While inspecting his farm on Wednesday, Collector T.G. Vinay said farming should be carried out scientifically, especially raising of hybrid crops as they were sensitive to climate, soil and water condition. Any deviation in cultivation pattern would affect its growth and yield. Farmers should grow as many crops as possible to make agriculture remunerative, he added.Deputy Director of Horticulture Suresh Sri Ram said saplings should be planted in all available space to generate desirable yield and income.

A joint venture by nine local farmers, the cooperative, Sanghamaitri, was launched during an Onam festival two years ago to sell their produce through its outlets without middlemen.Local varieties of vegetables are sold at rates about 20 per cent less than their market prices. About 100-150 farmers have registered with the cooperative.The farmers are assured market prices for their produce sold through us, said Vijayan T., president of the cooperative. Vegetables cultivated on 45 acres of farms in Kalliyoor and Kottukal panchayat are sold here.The major crops cultivated are brinjal, bitter gourd, cucumber, vegetable cowpea, tomato, snake gourd, melon and banana.Banana that costs Rs. 58 a kg is bought from the farmers at Rs. 57 a kg. It is sold to wholesale buyers at the same rate whereas in retail, it is sold at a profit of Rs. 3 to Rs. 4 a kg, says secretary Rejikumar, one of the farmers who took the initiative. People from households anywhere in the district who wish to sell any vegetables, from jackfruit or Rs. 25 worth chillies are welcome here.The farmers use organic pesticides such as grinded chilly of a variety called Kanthari and poultry and dairy farming in nearby areas as manure for the crops. Kerala State Horticulture Mission supports the venture by providing subsidies.The cooperative, which began with an initial investment of Rs. 25,000 by each of the nine farmers, has a turnover of over 2 lakh. The outlet at Kalliyoor has sales worth Rs 50,000 daily.Excess and untimely rains pose a great challenge. Many of them are shifting from risky vegetable cultivation to safer and more profitable banana plantations, Mr. Rejikumar says. We are planning to join hands with Project Neera launched by the Kerala State Coconut Development Board, he added.A report prepared by Kerala Agricultural College under Safe to Eat (pesticide-free) plan scheme of the Department of Agriculture for the first three months of 2016 has found that 12 items of vegetables sold through these outlets were 00% safe to eat."

The owners of small eateries and makeshift shops of 'chakhna' (food stuff consumed by tipplers along with liquor) too have reasons to feel 'blessed' for doing business in the vicinity of the liquor shops.Ramjatan took a break from serving up 'tamatar chaat' to busy guzzlers near the Naubatpur border liquor shops to speak to TOI.""Till March-end, we never returned home after clearing the total stock of food items brought on our thelas (handcart). But for the past 20 days, we have been having to arrange for extra stocks of tomatoes, potatoes and other edibles to meet growing demand,"" he said.

Manmohan Gupta, who has been running a small shop that serves snacks, soft drinks and bottled water opposite the IMFL shop at the Bharauli border, is elated at the rise in sales at his kiosk, but says: ""On the basis of the past 20 days' experience, I feel that dhandha ab ganda ho gaya hai (the trade has now turned dirty).""""People coming in from Buxar (Bihar) are demanding chilled water bottles, but stocks have been running out fast.

The vegetable, official sources said, is cultivated over a duration of 120 days, and yield could be harvested from the 50th day onwards. The hybrid variety could be maintained for even a six-month duration, department sources said.But, when the price plummets in-between, farmers let the crop to wither since they will not be able to cover even the labour costs. This results in enormous loss to them.The departments initiative to promote utilisation of cold storage in this backdrop is expected to enable farmers sustain their activities with a sense of certainty, a senior official of Horticulture Department said.Tomatoes could be stored for a maximum of one month, Chairman of Erode District Agricultural Marketing Committee Kulandaisamy added.According to the officials, sudden escalation in the cost of tomatoes during summer months is not unusual.In Erode district, the nurseries were damaged due to unseasonal rain a few months back, creating supply shortage in the current cycle due to considerable decrease in area of cultivation.The current price of Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg is likely to sustain for at least a couple of weeks in view of the occurrence of auspicious days, officials said."

It's unbeatable.""He cannot imagine Volkswagen without the sausage, which is even listed as an official VW component with the product code 199 398 500 A.""Without their curry sausage at 9:00 am, the employees would go on strike immediately,"" he says, only half joking.This delectable delicacy ""is an integral part of the corporate culture of Volkswagen,"" says Tina Berthold, curator of an exhibition dedicated to the cult sausage at the Volkswagen Museum in Wolfsburg, which is running to the end of May.Martin Cordes, director of VW's gastronomic division, says the company's Currywurst has half the fat of most rival products and is made from the finest cuts of meat, making it ""very healthy and easy on the stomach"".Since the mad cow disease crisis of the late 1990s, it no longer contains beef but only pork -- a change that some fans initially found hard to swallow, says the master butcher.The manufacturer used to slaughter its own animals on company farms but now uses pork from regional suppliers. VW also launched a vegetarian version in 2010 and a vegan Currywurst in 2015.""Whoever tastes our Currywurst falls in love with it,"" insists Lo Presti.And the numbers seem to back him up: in 2015, Volkswagen sold about 7.2 million curry sausages, twice the number sold in 2008.esp-fz/hmn/hmw/eb"

While farmers occasionally raked in the moolah, they were often let down by the cropping pattern in vogue in the district.Major marketsTirupati, Kalikiri and Madanapalle are considered the major agricultural market yards in the district. Farmers from the mandals bordering Karnataka and Anantapur prefer selling their produce at Madanapalle while those in the central areas like Chittoor and Piler go for Kalikiri market which is considered to be strong enough to tilt the price balance. The Tirupati market yard is more accessible to the farmers of the eastern mandals.A 30-kg box of tomatoes was sold for Rs.100 at Kalikiri on Friday. Pegged at Rs.250 a fortnight back, the price of the tomato box witnessed a rapid slide within a short time.Maqbool, a farmer from Kalikiri, who invested Rs. 45000 for growing tomato in his one-acre farm land burnt his fingers by losing half of his capital, leave alone getting a profit.We invested Rs. 2 lakh on our two acres only to lose everything, laments R. Ramakrishna, a dejected farmer of Kamalla village in Yerravaripalem mandal. Already reeling under losses, the farmers are in no mood to bear the labour, transportation cost and market commission and hence are either leaving the crop in the fields or dumping it on the roadside.A gambleTomato cultivation has become such a huge gamble in Chittoor district that farmers seldom feel sad about the mounting losses, but hope against hope to strike it rich in the elusive next season. Though we suffered losses this time, we are planning to go for tomato again. As the northern states witness floods and huge crop losses by November, we hope to see the prices soar and recoup the lost money, reasons Rayavaram Srinivasulu, a life insurance agent who turned into an agriculturalist of Piler.Such wild guesses and weird predictions are common for the farmers who prefer not to deviate from their age-old farming practices."

Or, as Aparna says, they found their calling in life.The couple has now set up a successful horticulture farm in Madalmohi village in Gevrau taluka, Beed district, and has helped around 20 distressed farmers turn their fortunes in the wake of one of the worst droughts in the region's history. They also managed to export pomegranates to Dubai this year.Their journey began five years ago. ""Madalmohi is a small village, just about 19km from Gevrai taluka. This year, from January to May 13, as many as nine farmers committed suicide in Gevrai, while over a dozen ended their lives last year. The taluka also recorded less than 50% average rainfall and recorded just 37% anewari (crop yield),"" said Gevrai tehsildar, Balasaheb Pakhale.""Debt trap, falling crop prices, deficient rainfall and lack of access to best farming practices has made the situation in the entire village grim. There was also no direct access to the market and the farm produce had to be routed through middlemen. This forces many farmers to migrate to cities and do menial jobs just to survive,"" he said.It was this, perhaps, that hurt. ""Most of us experience a calling at some point in our lives, something like Mother Teresa had in a moving train. Yet many of us fail to respond to it. My husband and I were deeply disturbed to find the state of farmers in our village. Since Mohan owned 17 acres of land at Madalmohi, we decided to organise the farmers of the village to tide over the drought and earn a dignified earning,"" says Aparna.The first task the couple did was construct a farm pond - about 38 feet deep and with a capacity of three crore litres - on a two-acre plot to store rain water. The next step was to decide the crops which could be lucrative and required less water. ""We chose horticulture farming since it requires less time to cultivate and reaped vegetables such as cucumber, tomatoes, drumsticks, cabbage and pepper. We also planted fruit-bearing trees like pomegranates and watermelon. The pond has been a tremendous boon. We get a good quality yield of pomegranates that we exported to Dubai for the past three years,"" says Mohan.The Pawars have a motto born from experience. ""Pre-planning, water management, water audit, farm ponds, crop-patterning and drip irrigation are the ways to survive drought conditions. To improve water use efficiency, farmers should use the 'More crop per drop' farm model,"" says Aparna.The couple also trained over 35 farmers in the village to install horticulture projects in their farm. ""We trained the farmers, especially small land-holders, to adopt alternate cropping patterns. We advised them to avoid cultivating crops like cotton and sugarcane which give yields after a long time, about six months. Farmers in rain-fed areas should cultivate alternate crops three times in a year's span. Especially, vegetables and fruits which give yield in three months,""says Mohan, adding that drip irrigation is the best way to tide over water scarcity.The Samaritans have their share of testimonials. Jeevan Pawar, a farmer who had been experiencing losses for many years has emulated the Pawars. ""This year, a good yield of vegetables fetched me a decent income to survive the adverse conditions,"" he says.Another farmer, Babanrao Muley, said, ""Every year, I would cultivate cotton hoping to get a good yield, but ended up facing losses due to deficient rainfall. But for the last two years, I switched to horticulture. It has helped me get my daughter married."""

The prediction of a good southwest monsoon has led agriculturists and farmers to believe that there will be an increase in yield in vegetables this year, which in turn will lower market prices.A bumper harvest and stable vegetable prices can be expected this year if the weather experts' predictions come true. Farmers in Thondamuthur block have begun sowing small onions, tomatoes and turmeric in the block, to use the rainfall being received by the district. ""The soil preparation activities usually begin around mid-May and sowing of these vegetables begins in the last week of May,"" said the horticulture assistant director for the block Vasanthi Gnansekar. ""However, the lack of summer rain delayed this process by around 10 days. Since the pre-monsoon rain began around 10 days ago, soil preparations began around June 1 and the seeds were sown earlier this week,"" said a senior officer in the department.According to the department data, small onions have been cultivated across 50 hectares of land and turmeric across 20 hectares of land. Land under tomato cultivation is yet to be calculated. ""Vegetable cultivation usually begins in Thondamuthur, before it spreads to Madukkarai and Karamadai,"" said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association A Kandasamy. While the district saw 1,295 hectares of small onions being cultivated in 2015-16, it saw 1,212 hectares of turmeric. ""This includes vegetable cultivation during either Thaipattam or Ravi and Aadipattam or Kharif season,"" said the officer. ""If the rain is good during the monsoon, we will match the acreage under cultivation this year and the yield will be higher if they have good water access,"" said Kandasamy.The chances of acreage going up is low, because agricultural land is not increasing, said vegetable farmer T Kadhiresan. ""While agricultural land is only getting converted into real estate, no new land is being cultivated. However, there might be a shift in the sort of vegetables getting cultivated depending on the price that September harvest yields,"" he said.Weather experts have predicted normal rainfall in the areas surrounding Coimbatore district during the monsoon. ""The rain should be moderate, not too much or less, because water inundation or dry sand will reduce the yield,"" said Kadhiresan."

Prices of most vegetables will come down now that it has started raining, said Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary of agricultural produce market committee (APMC) Vashi, Mumbai.Mr. Pahinkar said that vegetables planted in March will be harvested in mid-July and fresh plantations will be undertaken during the monsoon. He said that rain in other parts of the country will also bring down prices of staples such as green chillies, sourced from Karnataka, which are being sold for as much as Rs. 150 a kilogram in the citys retail markets.Household budgets have gone for a toss with vegetable prices going through the roof. Tomato prices have remained sky-high for over a week, between Rs. 100 and Rs. 120 per kilogramme having gone up from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45 in the beginning of this month. While there has been some relief with onion prices dropping considerably, green vegetables have become a luxury of sorts with cluster beans selling for as much as Rs. 160 and the humble okra at Rs. 80 a kilogramme.We cant stop eating these vegetables, but high prices are forcing me to cut down their consumption. I cant spend Rs. 100 to buy a kilogram of tomato, so I buy half a kilogramme or lesser, said Adagadu Ambarle, a security guard.Ramji Maharaj, who runs a mess in a hostel at Mumbai Central, said, Tomatoes are the key ingredient in most of the dishes. So I cant avoid using them. This rise in prices has disturbed my whole years budget.Traders said the rise in prices has only brought down the demand by a small 5 per cent to 10 per cent, which has ensured that prices remain high.Our sale has gone down. People are avoiding these expensive vegetables, but the demand is steady. Prices are also lowering slowly. With the monsoon picking up, prices will be normal, said wholesaler Mohammed Ali."

Veerapur in Ballari taluk, who was among the many early birds to take advantage of the scheme, was able to harvest around seven quintals of tur per acre in about six acres of land with the help of water augmented in the pond dug in mid-2015.Getting the cost of cultivation back, leave alone profit, was a major worry for me all these years when monsoon rain was the only source of water. Protecting the crop from withering due to failure of timely rain posed a bigger challenge. But after the pond was dug, protecting the crop, by watering it with the help of sprinklers operated with diesel generator sets (provided by the government under the scheme) two or three times when the standing crop is in a critical stage, not only saved the crop but also ensured a good harvest, he told The Hindu .Happy with what he could get, he has plans to take up inter-cropping during the kharif season by cultivating tur, chilli, brinjal and tomato in his land with the help of water accumulated in the pond.I have also requested the Agriculture Department to provide drip irrigation system instead of sprinklers which not only helps utilise water optimally but also enables cover more area, he said.Sharnappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the purpose of Krishi Bhagya has been served to a great extent. My appeal to farmers is to take advantage of government schemes and get a good yield, he said."

Most of them are being sold for Rs 50 a kilogram. The price of green chilly has gone up to Rs 180-200/kg, up from Rs 100 last week. Beans now come for Rs 65 a kg.Drought in neighbouring states and heatwave in several parts of Odisha has destroyed harvest and pushed up the prices of vegetables, said sellers.""If prices were to go up like this, how will one manage the family expenses?

58f627de7be9e031f13af8c3,Why veggie rates rise 400% between farm & mkt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-veggie-rates-rise-400-between-farm-mkt/articleshow/53217148.cms,2016-07-15,,The Times Of India,"Take a guess how much veggie prices get marked up as the produce moves from farm to market . In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

After all, it was the nuptials in two erstwhile royal families of India: the groom was from Mysore's Wadiyar lineage and the bride from Rajasthan's Dungarpur dynasty.Mysore, which recalls the royal era once a year during Dussehra, came to life on Monday when Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar tied the knot with Trishika Kumari Singh in a traditional ceremony at the iconic Amba Vilas Palace in Mysore.The wedding rituals  held at the 100-year-old Kalyana Mantap inside the palace after a hiatus of several decades  were officiated by a team of priests.Clad in pink angrakha and jharipeta, Yaduveer arrived at the mantap in a 1953 vintage owned by Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the only son of the last ruling Maharaja of Mysore. He was accompanied by his aunt Indrakshi Devi. Arriving at the Madanavilasa entrance of the hall, Yaduveer was given a traditional welcome at the courtyard.Trishika Kumari arrived, dressed in traditional saffron Mysore silk sari.(TOI photo: Nethra Raju)Both Yaduveer and Trishika completed the rituals that took more than an hour with shloka chanting and guidance from the priests. Around 10.24am, Yaduveer tied the 'mangalyam' to Trishika during the auspicious Savithri Muhoorta of Karkataka Lagna.The couple, after completing the ritual of 'Sapthapadi', obtained blessings from Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, the wife of the late Narasimharaja Wadiyar.The couples tied the knot at 10.22 am and performed a series of pujas and other rituals which were stretched over for four hours. (TOI photo:Nethra Raju)The Boston-educated Yaduveer (24) was adopted as the scion of the former Wadiyar dynasty in May 2015 in an elaborate ceremony, again to re-emphasise the point that it is a 'royal' tradition. Sources in the family revealed that Yaduveer was engaged to Trishika much before his adoption as the scion of the ""royal family"".Colourful headgears - in both Rajput and Mysore tradition - dotted the palace. State chief minister Siddaramaiah, cabinet colleagues, diplomats from various countries, and erstwhile royal families from across India came for the nuptials.(TOI photo)The Amba Vilas Palace is witnessing the second wedding in the erstwhile royal family since 1976. Though there have been a few weddings related to the ex-royal family members, the last wedding witnessed in the palace of was that of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar in 1976 to Pramoda Devi.No Hindu wedding in the 'royal' family is complete without the mangalasutra being tied twice. It's a ritual unique to the descendants of the former Mysuru royal family, one that Yaduveer too followed on Monday.The south Indian Hindu wedding custom of the groom offering a silver toe ring to his bride gets a tweak. Back in the royalty days, it was gold, not silver, toe ring. And that's what Yuduveer did too.Many believe that Yaduveer and his bride Trishika were courting each other. Yaduveer's father Swaroopananda Urs put the rumours to rest and said the wedding was ""arranged"". Both families matched horoscopes and only then proceeded to fix the alliance.More than 200 chefs were roped in for the vegetarian feast on Sunday. On the menu were such delicacies as kashi halwa, kheer, badam kheer, pheni laddu, tomato yennagayi, channa batura masala, bisibele bhaat, tovve, rasam, majjige huli.The wedding of Yaduveer with Trishika upholds an old Rajput-Mysuru 'royal' family connection. The Rajput alliance started in 1900 when Krishnaraja Wadiyar married his bride from royalty in Gujarat  Prataparudra Kumari. This was followed by Chamaraja Wadiyar marrying Satyaprema Kumari of Bundelkhand and now Trishika comes from Dungarpur family in Rajasthan.No wedding crashers could have made it here. Entry was strictly by invitation. Only two persons per invite were allowed.

From packaged tomato pastes and purees to tomato substitutes, many are finding novel ways to get around the rising cost of this essential kitchen ingredient.The prices at open markets and supermarkets are pretty much the same, with a difference of a few rupees. But many just skip buying the fruit at open markets, the super stores provide shoppers with other options  canned tomatoes, puree and pastes  but they too come at a price. The available pastes and purees are both locally manufactured as well as imported, but the taste is not quite the same, say many.""We try to keep the prices low, but it is still around Rs 80 a kg. Most of our regular customers buy just how much they need,"" said Vishal Salve, a seller from Vashi.Many sellers say that tomatoes rot if exposed to too much rain. ""With sales being at an all-time low, we sometimes buy less than five kilos to get through the day,"" said Ramesh Salve, another vendor.Unlike onions and garlic, the tomato is a flavourful ingredient. While some communities omit the rest for religious reasons, there is no discrimination against the tomato.Sangeeta Kulkarni, a home maker from Vashi suggested using roasted red bell peppers as an option to this costly ingredient. ""Mangoes and pineapples are also good choices since they have the sweet and sour flavour,"" she suggested.But, according to her, Indian grown tomatoes have an unusual flavor, which cannot be replicated by the commercially available pastes. ""Ketchup would also work, but it has many preservatives,"" she added.Nerul resident Nirmala Kashikar makes do with a jar of pasta sauce. ""The sauces, both Indian and foreign, have herbs and spices, so it does add some nice flavour to the dish. You can buy the chunky variety if your dish calls for diced tomatoes instead of puree,"" she said."

N. Narasiah of Kallem village in this mandal reaped rich harvest growing vegetables through drip irrigation method after having vexed huge losses in cotton cultivation.I have been growing vegetables since the past five years. Last season, I got a profit of Rs. 2 lakh from tomatoes, he told The Hindu during his recent visit to his fields.Having tasted small success with drip irrigation and growing vegetables, he has now taken up cultivation on his 12-acre land. He grows tomatoes, brinjal, bitter gourd, and tobacco, among others.According to him, paddy and cotton crops required more water, and due to seasonal failure, he could not reap good harvests. The ground water was very low and he had to dig three borewells, which now yield water for about two to three hours a day. He alternately draws water to wet his fields. Things are little better as we now have power supply. In the past, electricity was a problem too, Mr. Narasaiah said.In addition to low rainfall, extreme heat wave dealt a blow to farmers who opted for paddy and cotton crops in these rocky mandals. The crops withered away and along with it the hopes of farmers.Mr. Narasaiah advised fellow farmers to utilise every drop of water using drip irrigation and growing short-term crops like vegetables. Vegetables give regular and steady income for about three to four months. If we grow two or three varieties, we can see some money, Mr. Narasaiah explained.According to him, through drip irrigation, he could save water and increase productivity by about 50 per cent. Digging up farm ponds and trenches across the field would also help retain water when it rained, he said.We now have support of the government under the MNREGA scheme to dig farm ponds. There is no need for farmer to invest money, he said."

Hybrid seedlings were introduced to Goa during 2011-12 to encourage local farmers to grow tomatoes and chillies. While the experiment was successful in certain areas, the initiative by the state's horticulture department helped in dispelling the wrong notion from the minds of farmers that tomatoes and chillies don't grow in Goa.Tomatoes grown through polyhouse cultivation and in some open areas in the state resulted in a produce of 927 kg that was procured in the financial year 2015-16.Resultantly, the horticulture department is now looking at introducing more vegetables to enhance the cultivation of the state.Besides the chilli variety called UG66009 planted last monsoon, which yielded a very good crop; the department will be distributing seeds of chilli varieties, Sai Priya and S78, among farmers this season.Goa's requirement of chillies is eight tonnes per day. Currently, approximately six tonnes of green chillies are being produced by the state, per day. Notably, 253 tonnes of green chilli was procured in the financial year 2015-16.""We're trying to diversify by convincing farmers to go for dry chillies, chilli flakes and chilli powder,"" said horticulture department, managing director, Larry Baretto.Additionally, the cucumber variety called Radhika, cluster bean variety called hybrid milan, bottle gourd variety called hybrid wardhan, and lady finger variety called Jai Kissan 62 are being planted.""The new varieties will most likely be grown in the Rabi season after rice/paddy crops have been harvested from the fields,"" said department of agriculture, managing director, Ulhas Pai Kakode.Introducing a new crop variety to the state is rife with challenges. For the department, testing the crop's quality, shelf life, prospect of damage while transportation from field to market, and consumer's acceptance of the new variety is a Herculean task.""We have to test the crop in our fields under various climatic conditions for one or two seasons. Only then can we gauge its feasibility and thus recommend it to our farmers."" added Baretto."

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall. Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon.

""Already , dal is selling for Rs 120-180 per kg, vegetables for Rs 100-200 and dry condiments have come to cost the earth. Now the APMC has decided to go on strike and halt supplies completely .

Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly .

""We might shrink the rupee margin, but the increase in volume covers the cost which makes it a win-win situation,"" he added.However, the models might vary from one player to another.

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route.

Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

It's also looking at the possibility of leasing land in Mozambique to grow pulses.The consumer affairs ministry has asked states to ""resort to all possible means"" to ensure pulses aren't sold beyond 120 a kg while the shipping ministry has been directed to keep strict vigil on pulses landing at ports to prevent hoarding. The government is ready to provide more funds to ensure procurement.The decisions came after Wednesday's meeting convened by finance minister Arun Jaitley to deal with the surging prices of some vegetables and food items.""The government has approved import of 3 lakh tonnes green lentil, 2 lakh tonnes yellow peas, 1 lakh tonne red lentil and 20,000 tonnes each of arhar and urad,"" consumer affairs secretary Hem Pandey said.Two teams will soon visit Myanmar and Mozambique, he said, to finalise long-term supply contracts. The African country is keen to enter into long-term contracts with India.""We can even lease land in Mozambique to grow pulses,"" Pandey said.But a quick relief from the soaring tomato prices is unlikely, supplies of which have suffered because of drought in some southern states.Tomato prices are likely to remain high for two-and-half months till August.Price trends in the past four years show that rates shoot up in two phases - June to August and October to November - every year.Latest government figures peg the country's tomato production at 18.28 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) against last year's 16.38 million tonnes. But crop damage has impacted supply and the government may have to revise the estimate.States have been told to keep vigil on veggie prices and ensure improved supplies amid reports of tomatoes selling at 80 a kg in certain parts of the country.""Increase in vegetable prices, including tomato, is seasonal and area-specific. Still, we've asked states to take steps to ensure traders aren't inflating prices artificially. Every stakeholder must ensure there's no wastage during transportation and handling,"" said Pandey. Pandey also said the government does not want to increase procurement of pulses from the domestic market beyond 1.5 lakh tonnes to ensure market stability.""I have asked the Maharashtra food secretary to explore the option of selling pulses at subsidised rates in Mumbai as is being done in Delhi and we will provide them pulses at subsidised rates. We will release the pulses available with us in the next four months,"" the secretary said.The Centre has about 48,000 tonnes of pulses in stock and imports of another 20,000 tonnes are in the pipeline.The government is pulling out all stops to ease the pain of spiralling prices of pulses and has included FM radio channels to spread awareness."

The prices of other green vegetables have also increased. Satyendra Prasad, a vegetable vendor at Lalpur market, said, ""Heavy rain has damaged crops and vegetables have started rotting, thus reducing the total produce. The wedding season has also started, which will inevitably lead to an increase in the demand for vegetables. The supply shortage, coupled with a demand hike, has led to a price rise.""The price of capsicum, which was sold for anywhere between Rs 30 and Rs 40 has increased to Rs 120 per kg in the past few weeks. Similarly, tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 20 per kg has gone up to Rs 50 per kg.The price of lady's finger has increased from Rs 15 to Rs 25 per kg, while the price of pointed gourd (parval) has shot up from Rs 14 to Rs 25 per kg.Coriander, which was sold for Rs 30 a week ago, now costs Rs 160 per kg.Another vendor, Madan Kumar, said the price hike has altered the buying habits of the middle class, with residents choosing to skip buying vegetables.""With prices soaring, residents who would normally buy a kilogram of a particular vegetable are now buying only half a kg. Meanwhile, daily wage earners who earn between Rs 150 and Rs 200 a day are not buying vegetables at all,"" said Kumar.Sharmila Devi, a housewife, said the price hike has affected her monthly budget. ""Instead of buying one kg of potatoes like I normally do, I settle for 250 gms. I would rather purchase gram, soybean and other cost-effective alternatives that will not affect my budget."""

Inflation in retail dal prices remains stubbornly high, climbing to 32% in May 2016 from 7.94% in September 2014, even as the price rise of items such as oils, eggs and veggies ranges in the 5% to 7% band.Meat and fish rates too are creeping up -inflation moving from 6.94% in September 2015 to around 8% now. This rise along with the surge in price of oils, eggs and vegetables -the last affected by seasonal surges (tomatoes moved from -10.21% in March to 9.50% in May) -is creating inflationary pressures.Though food inflation is well below the levels when NDA assumed office, it's begun eating into household budgets and threatening to give the government a political headache.The need to manage pulse rates has seen the government offer large jumps in minimum support prices, hike imports, create a contingency fund and use mobile delivery vans.Food prices not only affect the poor but also the middle class. And, this can affect the government's ratings when the BJP has reasons to feel satisfied at having completed two years in office and tasted recent electoral successes. High food inflation was seen to have hurt the UPA along with corruption cases -areas of vulnerability the Modi campaign zeroed in on in 2014.Initiatives in irrigation, a national farm market and a shift from MSP-driven policies will take time to show impact. The Centre needs to be wary about public impatience over its inability to smoothen price fluctuations.Expectation of a robust monsoon has wiped off some worries. But the impact of two consecutive patchy rainfall years must be dealt with when both retail inflation and wholesale price inflation data point to build up of pressure points on food items.Aware that spiralling prices may hurt economic recovery, measures to ease pressure on pulses include negotiations being initiated on long-term contracts to improve supplies.Interestingly, the inflation rate of cereals has hardly changed, indicating the effect of massive buffer stocks and the rising demand for pulses, fruits, meat, milk and eggs while per capita consumption of wheat and rice is declining. ""The government should cut import duty , remove stockholding, build buffer stock through imports and resume futures trading in pulses,"" said Ashok Gulati, Infosys chair professor at ICRIER.The RBI has already paused its rate cutting cycle, will watch the government's supply management as well as progress of the monsoon before it moves on interest rates.Economists say they expect prices to remain firm in June and July with added pressure coming from the hike in service tax rate and the increase in fuel prices.But things may reverse as the skies open up.""CPI inflation is expected to print in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% in June-July , with food prices likely to remain firm during those months,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA.""Moreover, the rise in service tax rate and retail prices of petrol and diesel would add some upward pressure to CPI inflation.""August 2016 onward, food inflation is likely to soften, Nair said. ""Moreover, data on the distribution of rainfall and pace of sowing may dampen food inflation, particularly if higher MSPs can boost acreage of high-inflation items such as pulses.Lower temperatures may douse the prices of perishables and non-vegetarian protein items,"" she added."

institute's bid to end pangs in hunger belt",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/Cityinstitutes-bid-to-end-pangs-in-hunger-belt/articleshow/53144725.cms,2016-07-11,,The Times Of India,"Amlasole (West Midnapur): You smell hunger in the air of Amlasole. Death, like what happened in 2004 when five people of the Sabar tribe died of starvation, might not be a frequent occurrence. But the humans you see around are shadows of death - ill-fed and ill-clad.But, there is a In the midst of this frozen picture of horror, you cannot miss a glimmer of hope. A tank here, a pit there and a clutch of green in between. The Maoists have stopped visiting the Sabars and Mundas, the two main tribal inhabitants here. Instead, a new band of workers has started visiting them. These people talk to them about food and water and try to teach them ways of earning a livelihood. Some have decided to trust these babus and are gradually hobbling their way to a semblance of life.Amlasole is one of the villages that the scientists of Bose Institute have adopted as an experiment to turn them green. There are at least 20 tribal villages in the Binpur II block of the Jhargram sub division, including Kakrajhor and Bhulabheda , that have been selected for this project which is being sponsored by the department of science and technology (DST) under the aegis of the ministry of the same name. Some tribal villages in Purulia, Bankura and Birbhum have also been included in the project.The idea came from a study conducted by the Bose Institute experts that said even Amlasole, which is considered to be one of the most arid places in the state, gets about 1500 mm rainfall on an average, but this water is mostly lost because of the porous nature of the soil. If the families living here are able to ""capture"" this water, the age-old problem of lack of water for cultivation leading to droughts can be addressed. The study had also pointed that tribals should not only grow paddy but also other crops have to be weaned out of the habit of growing only paddy and should be trained to grow crops that need very little water for sustenance.Impressed with it, DST has sanctioned Rs 8 crore to Bose Institute, with which they are turning these villages green. The formula is simple. A 20 feet by 20 feet tank, that is eight feet deep, has been dug to collect rainwater for each family that's willing to let the scientists use its land. The base of the tank has been covered with thick polythene sheets so that the rainwater collected here is not absorbed underground. ""Each such tank is about to hold 90,000 litres water - enough for year-long cultivation. Instead of paddy, we are training them to grow crops like pulses, millets and corn and vegetables like different types of gourd, - striped, ridged, bitter and bottle, chillies, tomatoes and onions. But it is in growing fruits that we have made a breakthrough really,"" said Samir Sikdar as he showed the acres of orchards that have come up in the past one and a half years in different patches of Amlasole. Sikdar, a bio-scientist and the registrar of the Bose Institute.There are healthy guava, mango, mausambi plants all ready to flower in the next season. A simple formula again has been used to make this possible. An earthen pot with a small pinhole is sunk into the ground next to the plant. Eight litres of water are poured into it. The water seeps in gradually and keeps the ground wet for the plant for a whole week! ""We have to do this for one more year. When the plants are two years old, they will sustain themselves,"" Sikdar explained.There are many villagers who have been trained to prepare vermicompost and do bee keeping. ""I have already started selling my earthworms at 50 paise each and I have sold at least 4000,"" said Jagadish Munda , an Amlasole villager who has started eating twice a day now.His father has been growing vegetables and selling them in the local haat these days.""We used to eat mushrooms that grow in the forest and fall ill most of the time, but now with the help of this water storage tank, we are growing vegetables that are selling well. Seeing us many others are now asking the babus to help,"" said Lakshmikanta Sabar The work is not easy especially because the tribals are extremely wary about changing their cultivation patterns or lifestyle. ""We are trying hard to break the pattern...it will take time but we have made a beginning,"" Sikdar said.BOXSize of tank specified : 20 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet (deep)It can hold 90,000 litres of rain waterThis water is enough to cultivate a one bigha plot for the entire yearHowever paddy cannot be cultivated in this method because it needs a lot of waterThe two scheduled tribes in West Midnapur who are being helped are Sabar and MundaVegetables and fruits are grownTribals are being trained to make vermicompostMany are also into bee keeping."

Prices of other vegetables too saw a significant jump in last one week.With festivals round the corner and heavy rains in Himachal Pradesh, mandis in the city are facing shortage of supply of fresh vegetables, which has led to a sudden spurt in prices. Barring few, most vegetables have crossed Rs 50 per kg mark.The most pinching among them are tomatoes. In wholesale, it was sold at Rs 55 per kg while in retail it reached up to Rs 80 per kg in some parts of the city.Traders claim that stock is limited as supply from Rajasthan and Nashik has dried up. They warned that it may even cross three digit figure in coming days.""Arrival of tomatoes from Jaipur is over. At present, it is coming from Bangalore which is supplying to almost all the states.Unless fresh stock from Nashik comes, the prices will only increase and may even reach to Rs 100 per kg,"" said Radheyshyam Phatak, president of the Rajasthan Fal Sabzi Aloo Thok Vyaapar Sangh.Other vegetables too are burning a hole in the pockets of common man. Bottle gourd (lauki) in wholesale is sold at Rs 25 per kg but in retail it was rallying at Rs 50 per kg. Capsicum too has reached Rs 70 in wholesale and Rs 85-90 per kg in retail.Apart from inflation being one of the reasons, wholesalers claimed that retailers are intentionally keeping prices inflated.""No doubt rates have increased in the past few days but the vegetables are reaching to the consumers at double the price,"" said Ram Babu Gupta, a trader in Muhana Mandi.Difference in wholesale and retail prices indicates discrepancies. Like cauliflower, whose wholesale prices are Rs 50 per kg, is being sold at Rs 75 per kg in retail with hawkers making cut of Rs 25 on each kg.Similarly, beans is rallying at Rs 60 per kg in wholesale but hawkers are charging Rs 80 per kg from consumers."
