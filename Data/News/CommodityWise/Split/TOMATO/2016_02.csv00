Another 41 nursing students were treated as out patients. Nursing students who take up duties at OGH and turn up for academics from 11 am to 3 pm simultaneously -- blamed the unhygienic food being served by a private contractor at the hostel mess for their sickness.""The students fell ill soon after they consumed tomato rice and onion curry, served at our hostel mess on Friday,"" complained a nursing student, on condition of anonymity, while blaming a private mess contractor for the incident. In fact, unsafe water is being suspected for the food contamination as several students pointed out how that the overhead tank used for storing water for cooking purposes, was not cleaned even once in the last one year.""With the Rs 12,00 per month they collect from us, they not just serve us unhygienic food but also use cheaply available vegetables in the market like onions, ivy gourd (dondakaya), potatoes and lady fingers for making curries,"" said another student.The students expressed fear that other students too may show symptoms of food poisoning as a total of 179 nursing students had consumed the same food served at the hostel. When contacted, Dr Mohd Rafi, resident medical officer (RMO), Osmania General Hospital, said that condition of all the admitted nursing students are stable.""There appears to be bacterial contamination in the food that the students consumed at their hostel mess.

File PhotoThe price of tomato, which had shot through the roof barely two months ago, has plummeted now. Tomato is not being sold for Rs. 4 a kg in the retail market.The price crash has been attributed to a glut in the production. Tomato has been grown in large quantities in and around Mysuru, leading to a fall in the price, president of the Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS), Mysuru, Bore Gowda told The Hindu .Tomato was being sold at around Rs. 70 a kg during May and early June.Extension leader and assistant professor at the College of Horticulture in Mysuru Harish B.S. attributed the good harvest of tomato to two reasons  delayed monsoon which helped farmers reap a large quantity of disease-free crop and use of advanced horticulture technologies such as mulching, drip irrigation and fertigation (injection of chemicals in the irrigation system).He attributed the fluctuation in the price of tomato to erratic supply. The lack of proper planning often leads to such a situation. The crop has to be planned to meet the needs of the market, he said.The price of tomato had shot up sharply because of extremely poor output during the summer days. A large number of farmers cultivating it in a big way has resulted in the glut.Earlier, farmers used to grow tomato only in small plots of land. But now, we have farmers growing tomato in 50- and 100- acre plots in different parts of Mysuru district. Cultivation of tomato is not restricted to rain-fed areas. It is being grown even in irrigated areas also, said Mr. Harish.He pointed out that there was a need for the Horticulture Department to plan cultivation of a particular crop.Retail price of tomatoRs. 65 to Rs. 70 a kg in May and early JuneRs. 4 a kg in August"

Vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed around two weeks ago, have now declined.Chillies and tomatoes, which were selling for as much as Rs 200 per kg and Rs 120 per kg, respectively in the retail market, now cost around Rs 80 per kg and Rs 50 per kg, respectively. Onion prices, too, have dropped from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 15 per kg in Nashik's retail market.Arun Kale, secretary of the Nashik Agrucultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), told TOI, ""The supply of vegetables had been affected in Nashik APMC due to the strike by traders and incessant rain around 12 days ago. The supply was already poor due to drought. This, overall, had led to high vegetable prices. But supply has regularised because of the rain and because the strike has been called off by traders, leading to a drop in prices.""He said the vegetable auction process has normalised in the APMC, with farmers bringing their produce for auction regularly. The supply is likely to improve further after a month, given the good monsoon till now, Kale added.Laxman Gade, a farmer, reiterated that vegetable arrivals would increase in around one-and-a-half month's time.""After the rains, vegetable supply has increased to some extent. I sold 25 crates of tomatoes for Rs 600 each (20 kg a crate). Moreover, I also did not have to pay commission to the agent. Earlier, I had to pay 6% commission,"" Gade said.Poor supply had caused retail tomato prices to double from Rs 40 per kg in May to Rs 80 per kg in June. The price of the kitchen staple had touched an all-time high of Rs 120 per kg on July 12, following incessant rain and the traders' strike. But it is now selling for around Rs 50 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, chilli prices have also dropped after improved supply.The onion was the only vegetable whose price had remained unaffected in June. It was selling at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market. But this had also doubled to Rs 20 per kg on July 12. The price has now declined by 25% to Rs 15 per kg.Homemaker Shweta Salunke said, ""Vegetable prices have dropped as compared to the prices a few days ago. Our budget had taken a severe toll due to costly vegetables, but the prices seem to be coming under control now. Farmers must sell their produce directly to consumers so that vegetables remain affordable."""

Secondly, it's the state governments which have to get their act together since crackdown on hoarders and fixing stock limits fall under their purview. Third, the measures come mostly as knee-jerk reactions and are not pursued once prices become normal .For example, soon after the NDA government assumed office in 2014, onion prices touched Rs 100 a kg and tomato prices soared. The government planned to create its own storage and had even held talks with scientists for improving the shelf-life of vegetables. The agriculture ministry even mulled the need to go for rotational crops across the country to ensure minimum supply of key kitchen items throughout the year, but in vain.""What we need is a policy and a robust mechanism rather than getting desperate every time prices go up,"" said an official. He said the government should devise a system to keep people informed about availability of items. ""What can be done to increase tomato supply when production is hit because of adverse weather? You can't import them. We must have a good communication strategy.""On Friday, urad was selling at Rs 196/kg and arhar at Rs 166. The maximum prices of tomato and potato was Rs 80 and Rs 35/kg, respectively."

The price of lady's finger varied between 29 and 44 while native tomato was priced between 14 and 22.These prices are even higher than those quoted at the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Retail Market on Friday. At the retail store, high quality brinjal and lady's finger were priced at 30 while the native tomato cost only 10 per kg.Uzhavar Sandhai was started in 1999 by the state government to promote direct contact between farmers and consumers. Though it was called off between 2001 and 2006, it was revived in 2006 and has been continuing since. The prices are fixed by the Tamil Nadu State Agricultural Marketing Board, based on the day's wholesale and retail prices. The aim of the initiative is to ensure fresh vegetables and fruits are sold to the public at a reasonable price daily.Customers who regularly shop for vegetables and fruits at the farmers'markets say that it has not been the case for many months now. ""We regularly visit the Uzhavar Sandhai at Vadavalli to buy vegetables, but when we go to Pazhamudhir Nilayam to buy certain fruits, we notice that the prices are hardly 2 more per kilo there,"" says S Saritha, a domestic maid in Kurumbapalayam. ""In fact, if you visit Anna Market in the morning, vegetables are often the same price as Uzhavar Sandhai and often even cheaper,"" she says.The agriculture officers posted at the farmers' markets however deny that their prices could be as high as retail prices. ""We usually take the previous night's prices from Thyagi Kumaran Market, the morning prices from Anna Market and Thondamuthur Market and retail prices from Saibaba Colony,"" said an administrative officer at R S Puram Uzhavar Sandhai, who refused to be named.""We take an average and fix the price 20% higher than the wholesale price and 20% lower than the retail price. If the farmers insist, we increase the prices by 2 to 3 above the fixed price. But it cannot be more than the prices in retail supermarkets,"" he insists.Consumer activists say that a 20% mark up gives farmers an undue advantage. ""The bus fare for farmers and their vegetables is free. They have no rentals or commission to pay for the stalls. Thus, they basically have no expenses. If they are bypassing traders, their prices should at least match wholesale prices,"" says secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Voice, N Logu.""The men selling vegetables and fruits there are not farmers but traders or people who make use of their identity cards, claiming to be their employees or relatives,"" says G A Wahab, secretary of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Traders Association. ""They claim to be selling better quality vegetables at a higher price. This is not true. They sell surplus and trader rejected vegetables and fruits at a higher price,"" he added.Farmers however say their profit margins are not high. ""We usually get 5 more per kg when we sell directly at the Sandhai. Sometimes, we procure the vegetables from neighbouring farms and sell them at these markets. My onions are priced 5 lower than the retail price,"" said D Pandiavel, a farmer.Saravanan, another farmer in Vadavalli market: Our land and cultivation practices were seen by the horticulture officer in our block who gave us the ID cards. It was also seen by the village administrative officer who verified the ID card. It also mentions the specific vegetables we grow. We do admit that we sometimes buy a few vegetables from Ooty farmers and sell them here. But we are farmers."

On Thursday, as hungry consumers walked into certain stores of the world's largest burger chain here, they were surprised to find their burgers and wraps bereft of the familiar vegetable.A notice displayed at the out lets by Connaught Plaza Restaurants, which operates McDonald's stores in northern and eastern regions of the country, explained that the company was unable to add tomatoes in various products due to temporary unavailability. Unpredictable conditions have impacted the tomato crop, its quality and supply, the notice said.In the past few months, tomato prices in the country have spiked. The latest wholesale price inflation data showed vegetable prices jumped 17% year-on-year in June. Retail prices also revealed a similar stubborn trend. On Thursday, online grocer BigBasket listed the price of tomatoes as Rs 69 per kg on its website.However, senior executives at McDonald's India said the move to curtail the use of tomatoes in its offerings was not the result of high prices but poor quality . ""We are working towards resolving this issue,"" said a spokesperson for McDonald's India (North & East).Executives at several McDonald's outlets in the capital that TOI spoke to said the company was currently not using any substitute for tomato. ""We are making do with lettuce and onions. We are waiting for supplies to resume,"" said an executive at a McDonald's outlet in central Delhi.Interestingly, Westlife Development that operates McDonald's outlets in West and South India, is facing no such issues with the quality of tomatoes.Supply has not been hit either."

Though it's all in jest, Rakesh knows it's their way of winking at the dark cloud that settled over their family in June last year. A medical test revealed that their obedient son - who had pursued mechanical engineering to join the family's steel manufacturing business - didn't quite see the world the same way they did. ""We had all only heard of night blindness,"" says Rakesh, who was diagnosed with colour blindness. ""It was as if the world blacked out for me,"" says the engineer, who realised he won't be able to gauge the differences in metal at various stages of steel processing and would have to kiss goodbye to his dream.A resident of a small city in North India, Rakesh is now sitting in a family-run medical centre in Chembur where hope has drawn him. Though there is no known cure for colour blindness, he wants to believe in the clinic's claim of reversing fate within months. Here, in a test that asked Rakesh to pick up two matching crayons and draw parallel lines with them, there is a green line next to a red one. Previously, a doctor he approached had compared the retina to a TV with three antennae - red, blue and green. ""If one of them doesn't work, it could damage how you see all shades,"" the doctor had told Rakesh who suffered from red-green colour blindness, the most common variant. He often tries hard to recall if he ever painted skin blue or mixed colours wrong in art class but only ends up confused. Someone up there had messed with his antennae but, to him, the transmission always felt normal.Globally, nature is known to fiddle with the colour palettes of one out of every 12 men and one of 200 women. While describing this genetic condition, doctors are wary of using the word 'blindness' and prefer 'deficiency'. ""It's not that patients cannot see colour at all,"" says opthalmologist Kavindra Rajoria. ""Due to deficient photo-receptors, they are not able to see certain hues and tell the difference between them."" Among the visuals explaining what the world looks like to patients, a local clinic uses a Tom and Jerry screen grab in which both cat and mouse look jaundiced. ""It's like tone-deafness,"" says a colour-blind musician in the international short 'No Such Thing As Color'. ""Colour is an artefact of perceptions. Who's to say what you are seeing is really the colour you say it is?"" he rationalises.Philosophy, however, is a poor comforter for patients in India, who grapple with a bleak future. It isn't until later in life, when they appear for medical tests for government jobs that most Indian men realise they have a problem and many have to abandon dreams of joining the army, navy, aviation or jobs involving chemicals or colours. For 26-year-old Sarvesh, who grew up in Jabalpur and now lives in Mumbai, the verdict came in 2005 when he couldn't pass the medical test for aviation in India. ""Before that, I had been flying in Australia on a pilot's license,"" says the well-built pilot, who was forced to look for new career options on moving back to his home country. ""I don't know why India sees it as an impediment for pilots. There have been no accidents in Australia and in fact, during World War II, colourblind people were used in spy planes as they could see contours better,"" says Sarvesh, who usually boasts a thick skin but recalls not being able to laugh off deliberately-posed questions like: ""Can you get that blue bag for us?""While coping with the invisible condition, desperation takes over. ""Many break down,"" says opthalmologist K K Goyal, recalling a phone call from Kerala at two in the night. ""I am going to commit suicide,"" said a despondent man who had spent nearly Rs 30 lakh on aviation training before the diagnosis clipped his wings. Goyal has also met patients from small villages who have sold their lands for the sake of education.Problems could range from everyday situations such as not being able to see the queen on a carrom board to not being able to read traffic lights. Besides an aspiring cricketer who complained that he could not see the ball, Goyal has also come across an exporter of green tomatoes in Gujarat whose business suffered because of his deficiency. ""If there happened to be a red tomato in a vehicle full of green ones, his eyes would see the entire cart of tomatoes as red,"" says Goyal.Many prefer hiding the deficiency from the world like stutterers, some fear it hurting marriage prospects and others hate the questions. ""People's usual reaction,"" says 28-yearold Pradeep, ""is to point at things like walls and bedsheets and ask what colour they are."" For this Delhi-based power system consultant, the diagnosis in 2009 brought with it genuine confusion. Today, he has learnt to be smarter. Pradeep, who drives from Noida to Sector 15 daily for work, has memorised the order of the traffic signal and knows that the arrow denotes green and the circle, red."" Someone told him that wearing glasses of the colour that poses a problem would help but he has yet to try it.In retrospect, Rakesh, clinging to hope at a Mumbai clinic says he would have studied chartered accountancy if he had discovered his problem earlier. The treatment promised is costing him Rs 2 lakh. ""It's a small price for not ending up as a watchman outside my dream firm,"" says Rakesh, as he awaits the green signal.(Names have been changed to protect identity)"
58f55f9e7be9e01a17c98819,Tomato prices soar as climate change hits crop,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/Tomato-prices-soar-as-climate-change-hits-crop/articleshow/52409684.cms,2016-05-24,"Chennai/Madurai/Trichy: The wholesale price of tomatoes in the state has gone up by Rs 10 after the recent assembly election. It now costs Rs 30-35 at the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai. This is due to a shortage as the yield has been low.Tomatoes are sourced from Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border and the central and southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Since the yield is low, some tomato consignments are being diverted to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where there is a shortage. So the prices have increased in Tamil Nadu. Retail prices in different parts of Chennai varied from Rs 60 to 90 on Monday. In Madurai, tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kg in May last year now costs as much as Rs 70.Experts are blaming climate change for the price rise. Tomato crops in thousands of acres were lost due to high afternoon temperature that prevailed in the months of February and March, says project officer of the Center of Excellence for Vegetables K Srinivasan. ""Tomato is a temperature-sensitive plant. The flowers open up and pollination takes place during the Feb- March season when the afternoon temperature is around 35 degree Celsius. But this year, temperature had soared to above 40 degree Celsius in many places, affecting the crop,"" he told TOI.Such a change in temperature has not been witnessed in the past five decades, he says. ""The stigma of the plant has to be supple to aid pollination, but this year, most of the plants developed rigid stigmas, which affected the flowering process,"" he added.In the southern region tomato is cultivated in about 8,000 acres in Dindigul district, mainly in Palani, Reddiarchathiram and Oddanchathiram blocks. However, the area under cultivation was reduced to less than half because the plants were not able to survive the heat, farmers said. One such farmer, K Sundaramoorthy from Dindigul, lost his entire crop due to the prevailing temperature and lack of rain.In Madurai, another vegetable that has become costly is the green chilli, which is selling at Rs 90 in the retail market and Rs 70 in the wholesale market. ""This is due to the high temperatures, which has affected the flowering of crops,"" says K Vivekanandan a farmer from Theni. The supply to the market had come down from 10 truck loads last week to just two to three loads now.Farmers say that the price of the tomatoes will come down only after the monsoon sets in, in June. ""The prices are going to keep skyrocketing because there is no production of tomatoes throughout Tamil Nadu at present to meet the market expectations,"" added Thiagarajan.In Trichy, the areas around Vaiyampatti near Manapparai account for a considerable production of tomatoes. According to horticulture department officials, around 50 hectares in Vaiyampatti are involved in tomato production during March, April and May."

In the last six days, the average wholesale tomato prices have declined by 10% as the supply and demand gap further widened. Good quality tomatoes are being sold at Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market, while the poor quality ones are available in the range of Rs 60-70 per kg.Speaking to TOI, secretary of the Nashik APMC Arun Kale said, ""The supply has declined by almost 60% in the past one month. This is the reason the average wholesale tomato prices have shot up. The monsoon has delayed causing crop shortage until the monsoon arrives.""The average wholesale prices of tomato at the Nashik APMC was recorded at Rs 4,417 per quintal on Saturday. The minimum and maximum prices were recorded at Rs 3,000 and Rs 6,250 per quintal, respectively. Around 550 quintals of tomatoes were auctioned at Nashik APMC on Saturday.Gaju Salve, a vegetable vendor, said, ""There is an acute shortage of tomatoes. I brought tomatoes at Rs 1,250 per crate (20 kg a crate).""Sangita Pagar, a housewife, said, ""Vegetable prices have increased a lot in the past couple of months. Earlier, I would spend around Rs 300 per week for vegetables. Now I am spending Rs 450-500 instead. The government needs to take strict measures to bring inflation under control. There may be some relief in prices if farmers' produce is provided directly to consumers, eliminating the middlemen.""On the other hand, onions have become the cheapest vegetable in the market. Good quality onions are available at Rs 10 per kg in the retail market, while poor quality ones are being sold for Rs 7-8 per kg.The average wholesale onion prices at the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) have settled at Rs 800 per quintal. The wholesale prices declined by almost 60% in the past five-six months due to rise in supply.Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year.GRAPHICS- 1"

Price of cluster beans (gawar phali) soared to Rs 100 per kg that was earlier available at Rs 60 per kg. Prices of cauliflower, brinjal, bottle gourd, green chilli, capsicum and other vegetables have also gone up in the recent past.Green vegetables such as spinach, methi and coriander have been witnessing a 100% hike in the prices. Retailers and wholesalers attribute the hike to a decreased supply of vegetables and said that the inflationary trend would continue.""Prices of okra, spinach, coriander and green chilli will certainly go up in the following days. The quantity of these vegetables arriving in the Jadhavwadi wholsale market has been reducing every few days which is ultimately pushing up the prices,"" Ganesh Thorat a retailer based in Aurangpura market told TOI on Sunday.Other retailers believe that prices of beans, tomato and cauliflower would also rise during monsoon season when supply from adjoining villages and neighbouring states would get affected. ""Most of the farmers are now busy in sowing activities and they are not left with much stock at this point of time,"" said Sudhir Sonone, one of the wholesalers.Sonone said the quantity of vegetables arriving in the city has been reduced by about 40-45% in last 15 days days. ""There is a huge demand for vegetables but we are unable to provide it to the retailers,"" he said.Sonone said that rise in prices during the monsoon was quite normal but deficit rainfall in the last season and the drought-like condition in 2016 have severely affected the agricultural produces.

A scene Gandhi Market in Tiruchi. Photo: M. MoorthyThe price of tomato, which is essential for cooking in each and every household, has hit a high at Rs.70 per kg in Tiruchi.While the wholesale traders quote Rs.50 a kg at the Gandhi Market on Monday, it was sold between Rs.60 to 70 in the retail shops. The second and third quality tomato was sold at Rs.60 and Rs.50 respectively.A month ago, the prices of tomato were ruling between Rs.4 to Rs.6.However, tomato has now become a highly valuable commodity in the perishable vegetable category.While traders attribute it to the dwindling area of tomato cultivation due to unfavourable climate, they said that arrival from local areas has almost stopped during the last three to four weeks. Similarly, there is no arrival from Dindigul, Theni, Pollachi, Oddanchathiram, Kallupatty and Vaiyampatty, which are known for country tomato in the State.S. Muruganantham, a wholesale trader at Gandhi Market, said that the market had been receiving tomato only from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana. Since too many traders from Tamil Nadu brought tomato, the prices had gone up in the primary market itself.He said one box (25kg) of tomato was sold between Rs.1100 and Rs.1200 in the whole sale market in Tiruchi. It was sold for just Rs.100 a month ago.Mr. Muruganantham added that the prices would continue to rule high for the next few weeks. It might come down in July."

This may affect nearly Rs 3 crore business of Gujarat farmers and vegetable traders every day.Ahmedabad General Commission Agent Association general secretary, Ahmed Patel said that daily Gujarat used to send 50 trucks having 10 tonnes of vegetables mainly tomatoes and chilli to Pakistan from Wagah border but stopped it for the past two days considering the tension between the two countries.""Since 1997, this is for the first time that Gujarat traders have decided to stop supply of essential veggies to Pakistan. We will not supply the vegetables to Pakistan until the relations between the two countries get normalized,"" Patel said.The association plays the role of agent between farmers and dealers to fix the deal and to supply the vegetables to its destination point. Without the nod of the association, majority deals of sending vegetables like tomato, chilli, lemon and ivy gourd from North and Central Gujarat cannot be struck.Patel added that the vegetable vendors have to bear a loss of Rs 3 crore every day, but the national interest is above the personal interest. ""However, we will continue to send the vegetables to Bangladesh, Gulf countries, Canada and South Africa,"" he said.Many farmers of Kadi taluka in Mehsana district, which is considered as the hub of tomato production in Gujarat, have also individually decided not to send the vegetable to Pakistan.Dashrath Patel, sarpanch of Yashvantpura village of Kadi taluka, said that many farmers of the village have opposed selling vegetables to traders exporting tomatoes to Pakistan in national interest. ""Though the supply is not much at that time but farmers from our village will not sell vegetables to traders coming from Delhi and Punjab who export to Pakistan directly from Gujarat during the peak season which sets in from November,"" Patel said.Mansukh Patel, a tomato trader from Govindpara village of Kadi who had exported three tonnes tomatoes to Pakistan last year, said couple of farmers have decided not to send vegetables to Pakistan.Vinod Patel, president of Kadi Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), said that farmers themselves have decided not to send essential vegetables to Pakistan after the tension started escalating between India and the neighbouring country.Harjivan Patel, tomato trader of Khanderpura village, said that the farmers from his village will not send vegetable to Pakistan even if they do not get good prices, in national interest."

A surprise food-safety drive by a Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) health department team on Thursday found street food stalls in and around bigger puja pandals selling adulterated stuff.The surprise drive by eight groups was planned to check samples of fast food being sold along Bidhan Sarani (from Hedua to Hatibagan).The civic food inspectors found biryani in majority of roadside stalls unfit for consumption. The colour that the food vendors are mixing in biryani makes the popular dish adulterated, preliminary tests have confirmed, said Atin Ghosh , mayor-in-council member overseeing the KMC health department.""Our team of inspectors collected samples from the roadside stalls and found them to have colour that is not permitted under the specific food safety guidelines,"" Ghosh said. ""The inspectors will again visit those stalls on Friday to check whether the owners are adhering to rules and preparing the right kind of biryani,"" added a KMC health department official.Besides the roadside stalls, samples of biryani were also collected from some well-known restaurants in the Hatibagan area. ""We will visit some of these restaurants again on Friday and hand over food safety guidelines to the owners,"" Ghosh said. ""We had to destroy bottles of tomato sauce as those were found to be highly adulterated. We have asked the roadside stalls to stop using these sauces or else we will close down these stalls,"" Ghosh added. The KMC health team is scheduled to visit stalls in south Kolkata on Sashthi and Saptami."

With the prevailing drought conditions, the prices of vegetables have gone through the roof in the district.Residents here are worried over the price of tomato that has reached Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kilogram when compared to Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg last year. Broad beans, the cheapest vegetable earlier and that which usually is available in abundance, now costs Rs. 80 per kg in the market. The prices of almost all vegetables have gone up with ridge-gourd costing Rs. 80 per kg, chillies- Rs. 80; bitter gourd - Rs. 60; cauliflower and cabbage - Rs. 40 and drumstick - Rs. 100 per kg. The cultivation of vegetables has come down drastically owing to prevailing drought conditions and depleting groundwater table in the district. The vegetables cultivated in Kudurupaka, Ithrajpalli, Gopalpur, Thimmapur, Velichala, Gudem, Chenjerla and other villages are usually shifted to Karimnagar town markets. But due to the declined flow, the markets are no more the centres of activity. Tomato used to arrive here from Madanapalli in Chittoor district. But following the recent rains and floods in Chittoor, farmers lost their crop resulting in no supplies for the district. Decline in production leading to shortage of vegetables is not just the only reason for price rise. Pest attack on vegetables is another cause that has resulted in less yield this season.My weekly vegetable bill has gone up from Rs. 150 to Rs. 250 due to escalation in prices, complains Manisha, a resident of Jyothinagar."

A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest. He said that imported tomatoes should be randomly checked for infection and infected fruits destroyed. He also said that farmers should be trained to detect the symptoms of attack by tuta absoluta.Deploying pheromone traps in all stages of the crop has been found effective against leaf miner.Use of sticky traps or water-oil traps with pheromone bait; deployment of parasitoids and predators too are effective."
