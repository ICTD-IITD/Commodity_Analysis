Acute shortage in supply due to dry spells across the country has led to the rates of tomatoes boil to Rs80 a kg. Although it is much less than the record high of over Rs120/kg during 2014, traders predict further increase in the days to come. There may be no respite till the winters. Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers. The Chomu variety has a yellowish tinge and a sour taste. Due to the interior quality, it is available at Rs60 a kg, but traders do not rule out another increase.Abdul Sattar of M/s A Jabbar and Co at Cotton Market says that in the last summer, the wholesale rates of tomato were within Rs25 a kg. This year, it has nearly doubled. Though the local supply dries up in summer, it is compensated by that from Karnataka and Sangamner. However, this, year even these two sources could not meet the demand due to the drought. Finally, local traders have discovered a source in Rajasthan.Suresh Javade, also a dealer at Cotton Market, said 5-6 kg has to be sorted out due to inferior quality from a crate of 25kg which makes the tomato prices in the retail market almost double.""The situation will continue until October when the local supply of tomatoes will begin. Now, even traders in the South are depending on Nagpur to route the Chomu variety for meeting the demand there,"" said Manubhai, a trader now camping at Jaipur.It has been the same for chillies also. The wholesale rates have gone up to Rs40 a kg, though it was double over a week ago. Again, the local supplies were reduced to a negligible level. Finallym the commodity is now being sourced from Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which has helped in easing the rates, said Sattar."

Not only the tomatoes, wholesale price of onions too have plumetted to 20 to 30 paise a kg, almost negligible, in several districts including Vidisha, Neemuch and Mandsaur, where farmers cannot afford even transportation cost.Vidisha, also the parliamentary constituency of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, reported a bumper harvest of tomatoes which has resulted into low demand, leaving the farmers in tears. Farmers say they cannot distribute their crop free of cost as they have no other source of income. ""We were asked to use modern techniques at a cost of Rs 10 to Rs 15 lakh a year to get good harvest. Now, we have no means to recover the money we spent on the crop as tomato price have crashed to Rs 2 a kg in the wholesale market,"" said Jaideep Singh, a small time farmer in Vidisha.Farmers like Kamal Singh, Bablu and Karan Singh also cry over poor cost of their hard earned harvest. ""Shivraj Singh being a chief minister can afford to distribute free tomatoes to slums in Vidisha. We don't have money even for transporting them,"" said Kamal Singh.""Almost 5,000 farmers in the entire district are facing this problem while, Prime Minister Modi launched the National Agriculture Market on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar'', Vidisha district panchayat member Kailash Raghuvanshi told TOI.He said farmers are in a poor condition and cannot get money in return as so many of them have not availed crop insurance policy due to administrative hassles. ""CM had sowed tomatoes in a 10 acre area. Initially he sold 15 quintals at a high price but the moment price crashed, he asked for free distribution in slum areas,"" said Raghuvanshi. The cost of sowing tomatoes in one bigha (2.5 acres) is estimated to Rs 40,000. As district recorded a bumper crop, one bigha received 17,500 kgs of tomatoes. But at a rate of Rs 2 a kg or less, the farmers are not getting even Rs 35,000 from a bigha."

The buyers too lovingly select each piece and judge it for its colour , juice and taste, as it will enhance the flavours of gravies and salads. But with the price of tomato shooting up to Rs80 per kg, nearly double of what it was selling for just a month back, the average housewife is either giving it a miss or picking up just a quarter of a kilo. As bank employee Laxmi Sreedhran puts it, ""Maybe I don't know how to prepare curries without it.""Frowning at the off colour and blemished tomatoes available currently and also costing a bomb, businessman Rajeev Sharma, who shops for vegetables for his family, says, ""Our monthly budget are forever being ruined by the prices of either tomatoes, coriander and onions. I am optimistic and hope rates will plunge soon.""Tomatoes are high in demand in the kitchens for the distinct sweet and sour flavour that they add to Indian style cooking. ""Tomato puree offers a good option,"" says boutique owner Abha Shrivastav. ""But I have noticed that the moment prices of tomato escalate, the tomato puree tetra packs just disappear from shelves,"" she complains.Not aware of the high price at which tomato is selling, Dr Vandana Kate says, ""Our consumption of veggies is not very high and I spend Rs400 per week on them. Even if the prices are high, I will not curtail consumption as tomatoes are a must in salads and in the curries and sabzi that we eat.""The prices do have an impact on others. ""Ours is a joint family and food is prepared for 16 people in our kitchen. At this price, we can't use it liberally,"" says Meenakshi Sarda, a homemaker. But for Neetu Patni, who too lives in a joint family, the usage dips a wee bit and the pricey veggie is juggled around. ""We can't avoid tomatoes in salads so we avoid items like soup or making those dishes which require it in large quantity,"" she says, and adds that people are now used to these price swings. ""The vendor says that its due to poor rains so we are just waiting for prices to dip again.""Though families may adjust, those in food business bear the brunt of such sudden spike in prices. ""We have curtailed the use and include dishes which do not require much use of tomatoes, like lady finger or pumpkin. We are also substituting it with raw mango to get that sour taste,"" says Sachin Deshpande, who runs a tiffin business. But for Tarwindar Singh, who runs a restaurant at Sadar, there are no compromises to be made. ""People enjoy the taste of our different dishes so we can't change that by curtailing the use of tomato. So, we bear the cost and sustain in the hope that prices will fall sooner than later,"" he says."

The prices of several vegetables like tomato and lady fingers are about to touch Rs 50 a kilo in the wholesale market, while they will retail for between Rs 80 and Rs 100.""This year, because of the heatwaves, vegetable production has been hit and this has resulted in the increased prices. Supply of the vegetable is already low and hence prices are rising steadily,"" said Deepak Patel of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC). Patel said that this year, due to the excessive heat, there flowering was affected and this has led to a shortage in vegetables supply of about 20% to 25%.He said that prices are likely to stabilize after the arrival of fresh vegetables once the monsoon sets in.Nareshbhai Baghwani, a vegetable trader in Panchvati said: ""The rise in price was extremely sudden. Only last evening I was selling tomatoes for Rs 60 a kg. When I went to buy a fresh stock this morning, they had jacked up the price to Rs 70 per kg, compelling me to raise prices as well.I suppose the reason for the increase is that most crops have failed due the heat. I have to discard almost 3 or 4 kg of every 10 kg because of quality problems.""Laccharam Jagaji, a vegetable trader in Vastrapur says, ""We sell at very close to wholesale prices, which are 60/kg. Raising prices will only drive our customers away, so we aren't raising them unnecessarily. We get our produce from Jamalpur. Demand is greater than supply which is causing prices to rise at Jamalpur too,"" he said.Kishan Paliwal, a cook working in Satellite and Manekbaug areas said: ""Most of the people I work for have asked me to use the bare minimum of tomatoes in my cooking. People have also started adding potatoes to their vegetable preparations. For example, I was asked to add a couple of potatoes in my lady finger dish.""Shital Patel said she had started using fewer tomatoes in gravies, and the red vegetable has totally disappeared from her salad platter. She said that with prices shooting up, she was using one tomato in her gravy where she earlier used three."

Vegetables like tomato and potato are being sold at Rs 60 and Rs 20 per kg while most green vegetables are priced above Rs 40 per kg. Lack of rain has badly affected the local harvest as well as supply from other states, and is the main reason for the price rise, insiders said.""It is nearly a fortnight or more the prices of all vegetables are going over the roofs. It has become really unmanageable to give a balanced diet to children these days as pulses and vegetables have gone beyond the reach of common man,"" said Bandita Kar, a school teacher.At a time when there should be continuous rain a drought-like situation prevails at most parts of the state. ""The rainfall in the second week of June was inadequate for crops and affected cultivation. The situation is similar in other states, leading to a drop in the supply of green vegetables,"" said Sudarshan Sahu, a vegetable vendor in the Unit-I market here.Prices of most vegetables doubled in the last few weeks. Beans are being sold for Rs 100 per kg while drumsticks fetch Rs 140 for every kilo. Brinjal is selling at Rs 50 per kg while lady finger, bitter gourd and ridge gourd comes with a tag of Rs 40, spiny gourd and parval at Rs 50.For vegetables the city generally depends on nearby rural areas like Nimapada, Balianta, Pipili, Niali and so on. Vegetables also come from districts like Jajpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack, Nayagarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj and Puri districts.""Odisha is one of the largest producers of green vegetables but due to lack of proper crop management and storage facilities it has to depend on other states for 20% of its vegetable consumption,"" said an officer in the state horticulture department."

It's not just India. At the global level, 66 per cent of calories consumed are derived from foreign origin foods on an average as was 71 per cent of production.Onions and wheat have their origins in West Asia, potatoes and tomatoes came from South America, while mustard seeds came from the Mediterranean.

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

Ridge gourd, bitter gourd and raddish prices are hovering around Rs 40 and Rs 10.RV Gopi, president, Vegetable Merchants' Association, said the prices of vegetables like tomato and beans were high because of excessive heat in summer which had dried up water resources, thus affecting the yield drastically.Vegetables like cabbage had become costlier, up from Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg, because it was off-season.Traders said vegetables like ridge ground, bitter gourd and raddish were unaffected by the blistering summer heat because they are grown in horticulture gardens and on a very low scale, unlike beans and tomato that are cultivated on a large scale. There's also a dip in the supply of tomatoes from various places in Karnataka and the vegetable is being sourced for Bengaluru from Maharashtra, they added.Gopi, however, said online retailers are making a killing on select vegetables that some households consider essential with profit as the only motive.Choudhury Md Idrees, secretary Russel Market Traders Association, said though Hopcoms prices are cheaper compared to other open retail markets, consumers, including large-scale buyers like restaurant owners, still prefer the latter as it meet the demands for both quality and variety."

Instead, prices of essential commodities had increased and there was no sign of the government retrieving black money. By presenting fudged statistics to the people, the BJP government tried to deceive the people. The Tamil Nadu government was no different.At the time of the 2014 Parliamentary election, the BJP promised that if it were to be voted to power it would control prices.

Tur dal that sold at Rs. 70 a kg two years ago was now priced at Rs. 240 a kg, a kg of tomato had touched Rs. 100 now and in the last three months vegetable prices had increased 120 per cent. The price of sugar had tripled and all this led to the common man shelling more money out of his pocket.The BJP claimed that Prime Ministers foreign visits brought foreign direct investment into the country and that it led to job creation. But the reality was very different. Young people were either unemployed or underemployed. Plus the jobs that were being created were not permanent. Most of those were temporary or contractual in nature.The CPM cadre also said that the jobs in labour-intensive sectors like textile, spinning mills, leather, transport, etc. had fallen."

File PhotoIt is the marriage season, with exciting fare in feasts to look forward to.Despite elaborate arrangements, some families find their best-laid plans washed away by unexpected rise in prices of vegetables.Vegetarian feasts include beans and carrots. But with the prices of beans skyrocketing these past several weeks, chefs have had to replace it.Radha Varadarajan of Arr Vee Caterers says that when he catered for a wedding recently, beans was included despite the steep price.But if the client is flexible, then they replace it with yard-long beans or broad beans.Of course, we will make sure to provide the best of taste, he says, adding such a steep increase in price was witnessed last in 2012.But one of the highest I have seen in my 30-year career was in 1994 when one kg cost Rs.180. Yet, we served beans since the client was very particular, he says.Though caterers can replace plantains with potatoes, tomatoes and onions are a staple, says M.

Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop.The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

The method was simple research analysis to highlight key economic policies.He said, ""While the country had left behind the licence-quota-permit raj and opened up for foreign direct investment in greater number of sectors, what had come to afflict the economy was the 'exit problem'."" He was referring to how loss-making firms found it difficult to exit and citied the example of fertilizer sector. The inefficient firms were not even employment-intensive and so it was easy for them to shut down. ""There is a need to readjust and recalibrate exit,"" he pointed out.He further said he was excited about the clothing sector to bring in growth and social transformation; it was much more labour-intensive than sectors like auto and steel and had the potential to empower women by creating jobs for them. He also said it was one of the areas where shrinking share by the Chinese could be cornered by Indian firms.Subramanian said Brexit was one of the significant developments with serious political and economic consequences for both the UK and Europe, but India would not be affected by it due to its solid macroeconomics.""Brexit is a setback for liberalization. It is a landmark moment in history since World War II,"" he said. Brexit has reversed the experiment by European countries for togetherness as a collective entity.The CEA blamed under-cultivation and inadequate production for rise in prices of pulses. In the backdrop of surge in tomato price, he said fluctuation in vegetable prices was linked to market forces rather than cultivation. ""The markets should be made better to stabilize vegetable prices,"" he said.Subramanian also spoke on the need for strengthening the state's role in bridging fiscal relations between the rich and poor people and regretted low fiscal capacity of the country due to unusually low base of taxpayers. The ratio of voters to taxpayers in the country stands at 4%, but it should be 23% for a country at its level of economic and political development.As a legitimate tool to reduce gap between the rich and the poor, the state should build a mechanism under which there should be delivery of public goods for all, but the bounties for well-offs must be reduced and they should be taxed regardless of source of income, Subramanian said. Stating that the state is spending Rs 76,000 crore on the well-offs by way of various subsidies, he suggested such dole outs should be done away with.He also emphasized on spreading JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) for financial inclusion of the poor and said the government was moving in the right direction by spreading Jan Dhan and Aadhaar schemes.He said the government has three pending agendas  GST, strategic disinvestment and twin balance sheets. On inequality, he said the debate in the West might be misleading in the Indian context as the Indian economy needed education, health and employment."

But with the prices of beans skyrocketing these past several weeks, chefs have had to replace it.Radha Varadarajan of Arr Vee Caterers says that when he catered for a wedding recently, beans was included despite the steep price. But if the client is flexible, then they replace it with yard-long beans or broad beans. Of course, we will make sure to provide the best of taste, he says, adding such a steep increase in price was witnessed last in 2012.But one of the highest I have seen in my 30-year career was in 1994 when one kg cost Rs.180. Yet, we served beans since the client was very particular, he says.Though caterers can replace plantains with potatoes, tomatoes and onions are a staple, says M. Krishna Rao, who runs Sree Durga Caterers. We cannot do without tomatoes and onions for rasam and sambar. But more than often than not, we do not pass on the price rise on the clients final bill, he adds.A. Selvaraj, general secretary of Chennai Koyambedu Periyar Market Tomato Merchants Association, says beans sold at Rs.80-100 per kg at Koyambedu wholesale market on Friday. Staple vegetables such as onion (Rs.15-20) and potatoes (Rs. 20) were cheaper than shallots (Rs.40) and tomatoes (Rs.60).The price of beans has been steadily climbing because supply to the Koyambedu wholesale market has fallen drastically. Usually, we get around 10 to 15 lorry-loads everyday, but it has fallen to four-five loads, Mr. Selvaraj says.The seasonal rain in Karnataka and the belts along Hosur that account for the bulk of beans production has damaged the crop. The price of beans may not fall till May-end and after that it will hover around Rs.60, he says.As for tomatoes, he says prices will stabilise in the coming weeks when production picks up in Maharashtra and, within a couple of months, in Theni, Udumalpet and Dindigul."

For instance, beans is being sold at Rs. 100 per kg in the wholesale market, but growers will get only Rs. 50. Middlemen are making a huge profit taking advantage of lower supply of vegetables due to drought, said K. Srinivas, a farmer from Kolar."
