In the past few days, we have seen a number of elephant raids, causing huge loss to the farmers,"" said S Ravikumar, 38, a farmer from Eruttadipalayam. He lost nearly 200 banana plants and one-and-a-half acres of tomato in the raid.Meanwhile, forest officials visited the spot and assessed the damage caused to the crop in the elephant raid.

This has resulted in retailers treading a cautious path by avoiding excess buying fearing losses as consumers tend to think twice before spending. Few weeks back, only tomatoes witnessed a steep hike in prices, but now, other vegetables, especially those grown in hill stations, have seen a surge in pricing.At present, locally-grown vegetables have come as the only consolation for residents as prices have not changed much. However, they are also set to increase due to the muhurtham days that are lined up in the next couple of months. ""Many vegetables are off the shelves due to price rise. I am left with no option but to purchase whatever is available since I cannot go to markets regularly,"" said Malathi Ranganathan, a homemaker from Anupanadi.Local vegetables such as bottle gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, snake gourd, ridge gourd and banana are sold at normal price. But vegetables such as beans, butter beans, beetroot, green peas, turnip and cabbage have increased manifold in the last couple of weeks. While the price of beans has touched Rs 80 per kg, butter beans and green peas are being sold at Rs 130 and Rs 120 per kg respectively. The price of tomato still hovers at around Rs 80 a kg.However, there is not much difference in the prices of onion, carrot and potato either. While onions are continued to be sold at Rs 15 a kg, carrot and potato are sold at Rs 30 a kg.Traders blame the increase in price to the decreasing supply. They say that vegetable prices would only go up and there will not be any respite in the days to come. ""Reduction in prices can be expected only after a couple of months since there are many muhurtham days until and the demand increases during that time,"" said P Thiagarajan, a vegetable trader in Mattuthavani central market.People from agriculture department attribute the price rise to lower production of vegetables due to untimely rain. K Arumugam, agriculture officer, in-charge of Chockikulam farmers' market said the unseasonal rains had resulted in poor production of vegetables grown in hill stations."

Sakthivel, a floriculturist in Sempatti, who has raised jasmine and tomato in one acre of land. To get the first yield in jasmine, I have to wait for a year. My investments will not stop till harvesting. I receive no returns in the period. Raising tomato helps me maintain my income. I start harvesting tomato from the 40th day. Harvesting will continue for 140 days. I raise two tomato crops in a year. Later, jasmine will fetch me income. Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, we can maximise income. Instead of tomato, chilli can also be grown in jasmine field. But brinjal should not be grown as it will affect flowering plants, he adds.Small onion (shallot) can also be raised on bunds of irrigation channels. No additional water is necessary. Adoption of simple technologies will also improve the quality of vegetables. After harvesting onion, cauliflower can be raised in the same field. Such cropping method will enhance the quality, colour and taste of the flower, he says.Sakthivel gets Rs. 350 per a bag containing 20 cauliflowers in Madurai wholesale market.While inspecting his farm on Wednesday, Collector T.G. Vinay said farming should be carried out scientifically, especially raising of hybrid crops as they were sensitive to climate, soil and water condition. Any deviation in cultivation pattern would affect its growth and yield. Farmers should grow as many crops as possible to make agriculture remunerative, he added.Deputy Director of Horticulture Suresh Sri Ram said saplings should be planted in all available space to generate desirable yield and income. Acute care was necessary while raising hybrid crops, he added.Now, it is important to grow additional crops as labour and input costs are same. With no extra expenditure, farmers can maximise income"

Supply is low and hence prices are soaring. Production in Maharashtra was low because of scanty rain in 2015 which has led to the shortage.""He said that tomato supply in the market was around 40% lower the usual.Agriculture Produce Market Committee officials said high quality tomato produce was cornered by hotels and the top grade cost Rs 80 in the Jamalpur market. Jayshree Patel, a vegetable vendor in South Bopal said prices were rising every day and she was hence forced to raise prices. ""One month ago, I used to sell 15 kg of tomatoes a day. Today, consumption is down drastically."" She said she on Monday she had sold only five kg of tomatoes.Similarly, Ratna Marwadi, a vendor in Satellite said people are buying less tomatoes because of the high prices. He said that all vegetables were getting more expensive, but especially tomatoes. He said he was selling tomatoes at Rs 100 a kg.Lalita Patel said: ""In Saurashtra, people cannot survive without the tomato preparation, but with the rise in prices, we have stopped making it. Now we make it about once a week. We are a family of ten and will need a kilo each time.""Rachana Shah, a resident of Anandnagar, says: ""I'm having a party for children at my place. The cook asked for eight kilos of tomatoes, but I decided to buy only five kg. I asked the cook to manage with less."" She said that even she has started using less tomatoes in her gravy.

The vegetable, official sources said, is cultivated over a duration of 120 days, and yield could be harvested from the 50th day onwards. The hybrid variety could be maintained for even a six-month duration, department sources said.But, when the price plummets in-between, farmers let the crop to wither since they will not be able to cover even the labour costs. This results in enormous loss to them.The departments initiative to promote utilisation of cold storage in this backdrop is expected to enable farmers sustain their activities with a sense of certainty, a senior official of Horticulture Department said.Tomatoes could be stored for a maximum of one month, Chairman of Erode District Agricultural Marketing Committee Kulandaisamy added.According to the officials, sudden escalation in the cost of tomatoes during summer months is not unusual.In Erode district, the nurseries were damaged due to unseasonal rain a few months back, creating supply shortage in the current cycle due to considerable decrease in area of cultivation.The current price of Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg is likely to sustain for at least a couple of weeks in view of the occurrence of auspicious days, officials said."

He maintained that it was for the first time in the country that a State had initiated a massive effort to use technology for protection of crops.He told the farmers that Group I and IAS officers would be drafted at the mandal and constituency levels to monitor the rain gun exercises. Mr. Naidu blamed the Congress party for the dismal scenario on the agriculture front during the last one decade.

There was a fall in the arrival from the regular farms in Rayakottai, Soolagiri, Hosur and Sudanur in Krishnagiri district.

We used to cultivate crops such as bitter gourd, snake gourd, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, green chilli, onion, leafy vegetables, fruits, and a variety of flowers in Undavalli, Penumaka, Chandarlapadu, Kanchikacherla, Uddandarayunipalem, Neerukonda, Thullur, and other areas on the Krishna riverbed.

It's unbeatable.""He cannot imagine Volkswagen without the sausage, which is even listed as an official VW component with the product code 199 398 500 A.""Without their curry sausage at 9:00 am, the employees would go on strike immediately,"" he says, only half joking.This delectable delicacy ""is an integral part of the corporate culture of Volkswagen,"" says Tina Berthold, curator of an exhibition dedicated to the cult sausage at the Volkswagen Museum in Wolfsburg, which is running to the end of May.Martin Cordes, director of VW's gastronomic division, says the company's Currywurst has half the fat of most rival products and is made from the finest cuts of meat, making it ""very healthy and easy on the stomach"".Since the mad cow disease crisis of the late 1990s, it no longer contains beef but only pork -- a change that some fans initially found hard to swallow, says the master butcher.The manufacturer used to slaughter its own animals on company farms but now uses pork from regional suppliers. VW also launched a vegetarian version in 2010 and a vegan Currywurst in 2015.""Whoever tastes our Currywurst falls in love with it,"" insists Lo Presti.And the numbers seem to back him up: in 2015, Volkswagen sold about 7.2 million curry sausages, twice the number sold in 2008.esp-fz/hmn/hmw/eb"

While farmers occasionally raked in the moolah, they were often let down by the cropping pattern in vogue in the district.Major marketsTirupati, Kalikiri and Madanapalle are considered the major agricultural market yards in the district. Farmers from the mandals bordering Karnataka and Anantapur prefer selling their produce at Madanapalle while those in the central areas like Chittoor and Piler go for Kalikiri market which is considered to be strong enough to tilt the price balance. The Tirupati market yard is more accessible to the farmers of the eastern mandals.A 30-kg box of tomatoes was sold for Rs.100 at Kalikiri on Friday. Pegged at Rs.250 a fortnight back, the price of the tomato box witnessed a rapid slide within a short time.Maqbool, a farmer from Kalikiri, who invested Rs. 45000 for growing tomato in his one-acre farm land burnt his fingers by losing half of his capital, leave alone getting a profit.We invested Rs. 2 lakh on our two acres only to lose everything, laments R. Ramakrishna, a dejected farmer of Kamalla village in Yerravaripalem mandal. Already reeling under losses, the farmers are in no mood to bear the labour, transportation cost and market commission and hence are either leaving the crop in the fields or dumping it on the roadside.A gambleTomato cultivation has become such a huge gamble in Chittoor district that farmers seldom feel sad about the mounting losses, but hope against hope to strike it rich in the elusive next season. Though we suffered losses this time, we are planning to go for tomato again. As the northern states witness floods and huge crop losses by November, we hope to see the prices soar and recoup the lost money, reasons Rayavaram Srinivasulu, a life insurance agent who turned into an agriculturalist of Piler.Such wild guesses and weird predictions are common for the farmers who prefer not to deviate from their age-old farming practices."

The prediction of a good southwest monsoon has led agriculturists and farmers to believe that there will be an increase in yield in vegetables this year, which in turn will lower market prices.A bumper harvest and stable vegetable prices can be expected this year if the weather experts' predictions come true. Farmers in Thondamuthur block have begun sowing small onions, tomatoes and turmeric in the block, to use the rainfall being received by the district. ""The soil preparation activities usually begin around mid-May and sowing of these vegetables begins in the last week of May,"" said the horticulture assistant director for the block Vasanthi Gnansekar. ""However, the lack of summer rain delayed this process by around 10 days. Since the pre-monsoon rain began around 10 days ago, soil preparations began around June 1 and the seeds were sown earlier this week,"" said a senior officer in the department.According to the department data, small onions have been cultivated across 50 hectares of land and turmeric across 20 hectares of land. Land under tomato cultivation is yet to be calculated. ""Vegetable cultivation usually begins in Thondamuthur, before it spreads to Madukkarai and Karamadai,"" said president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association A Kandasamy. While the district saw 1,295 hectares of small onions being cultivated in 2015-16, it saw 1,212 hectares of turmeric. ""This includes vegetable cultivation during either Thaipattam or Ravi and Aadipattam or Kharif season,"" said the officer. ""If the rain is good during the monsoon, we will match the acreage under cultivation this year and the yield will be higher if they have good water access,"" said Kandasamy.The chances of acreage going up is low, because agricultural land is not increasing, said vegetable farmer T Kadhiresan. ""While agricultural land is only getting converted into real estate, no new land is being cultivated. However, there might be a shift in the sort of vegetables getting cultivated depending on the price that September harvest yields,"" he said.Weather experts have predicted normal rainfall in the areas surrounding Coimbatore district during the monsoon. ""The rain should be moderate, not too much or less, because water inundation or dry sand will reduce the yield,"" said Kadhiresan."

This rise in prices has disturbed my whole years budget.Traders said the rise in prices has only brought down the demand by a small 5 per cent to 10 per cent, which has ensured that prices remain high.Our sale has gone down. People are avoiding these expensive vegetables, but the demand is steady. Prices are also lowering slowly. With the monsoon picking up, prices will be normal, said wholesaler Mohammed Ali."

Veerapur in Ballari taluk, who was among the many early birds to take advantage of the scheme, was able to harvest around seven quintals of tur per acre in about six acres of land with the help of water augmented in the pond dug in mid-2015.Getting the cost of cultivation back, leave alone profit, was a major worry for me all these years when monsoon rain was the only source of water. Protecting the crop from withering due to failure of timely rain posed a bigger challenge. But after the pond was dug, protecting the crop, by watering it with the help of sprinklers operated with diesel generator sets (provided by the government under the scheme) two or three times when the standing crop is in a critical stage, not only saved the crop but also ensured a good harvest, he told The Hindu .Happy with what he could get, he has plans to take up inter-cropping during the kharif season by cultivating tur, chilli, brinjal and tomato in his land with the help of water accumulated in the pond.I have also requested the Agriculture Department to provide drip irrigation system instead of sprinklers which not only helps utilise water optimally but also enables cover more area, he said.Sharnappa Mudgal, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the purpose of Krishi Bhagya has been served to a great extent. My appeal to farmers is to take advantage of government schemes and get a good yield, he said."

The modern technique is soon gaining prominence. The roses were grown in a farm area measuring 600 sqm.Horticulture department chairman Dr K K Jha and BAU research director Dr D K Singh Dron said the university soon plans to operate a commercial counter from where horticulture farm produce would be sold directly to customers or traders. ""We sold horticulture produce worth Rs15 lakh last year. We are trying to start a commercial counter soon,""Jha said.Over 50,000 mango saplings are being prepared on the university campus on demand of the National Horticulture Mission. These mango plants would be developed into various high-yielding varieties like Amrapali, Langra, Dudhia, Bambaia and Mallika as per the demands of farmers. ""We are aware of the mango variants that grow well in Jharkhand,"" Jha said.BAU has been successful in introducing varieties of capsicum, tomato and early season peas, giving small traders the opportunity to earn more. ""Initially, we sold produce in the local market, but due to bumper production last year, vegetables were sold at roadside markets near CMPDI, from where one of the largest chair marketing companies offered us to sell our produce to them,"" Jha said adding that the experience encouraged them to make the produce available on the BAU campus.Dron said the facility will be housed in the current infrastructure. ""Though we sell vegetables to costumers and some of the traders, in the case of flowers, most of the produce is picked up from the university campus directly,"" Dron said, adding that flowers like jarbera and rose gives ten times the normal production under the polyhouse farming method."

58f627de7be9e031f13af8c3,Why veggie rates rise 400% between farm & mkt,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Why-veggie-rates-rise-400-between-farm-mkt/articleshow/53217148.cms,2016-07-15,"Take a guess how much veggie prices get marked up as the produce moves from farm to market . In the 250-km-odd distance that the crop moves from villages near Nashik to your local sabziwala in Mumbai, the cost of one kg of onion goes up by close to 400% yes, from Rs 4/kg which a Lasalgaon farmer earns to Rs 18-20/kg which a consumer pays. That's the extent of commissions extracted by middlemen in the food chain.And it's not just the onion trade that sees such artificial inflation. Potato, tomato, green chilly, okra, you name it and pretty much everything in the market goes through a 50-100% increase in prices as it changes hands from one intermediary to the next (see graphic). The irony is that the farmer is the one who gets the lowest prices.So when the Devendra Fadnavis government decided on June 28 to allow growers to sell their produce straight to retail chains and other direct sellers, that's the rent-seeking system that it tried to dismantle. In one fell swoop, it did away with the monopoly of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Companies (APMCs) in every district which manage the marketyards where auctions are held by wholesalers and commissions earned on every transaction.Direct marketer Mahesh Shelke who runs Krushjeevan Agro, an enterprise in which farmers themselves are investors, says, ""Direct marketing companies and farmer producer organizations like ours have gained immense responsibility with the revised rules. More retailers will approach us to source vegetables in order to avoid paying commission to APMC . We know exactly which grower has how many hectares of farmland, what he grows and the quality and quantity of produce. Farmers will get a better price while retailers and consumers will not be burdened by commission either.""The agro economy still works in a way that leaves farmers at the mercy of local agents who decide which crops to grow and when. In the absence of cold chains and storage facilities, growers have to coordinate with them at harvest time. Demand and supply determine farmgate prices; in case of a bumper crop, the farmer has to strike a deal with the agent before he harvests the produce. Since he usually lacks storage space and as the crop is often highly perishable, like say tomato or okra, the agent fixes a suitable price and day on which the crop is picked and transported to the market. For his efforts he ends up earning an approximately 30-100% commission.The agent next strikes a deal with a local trader or ends up hoarding in the event of a dip in prices. In case of vegetables with a longer shelf life, say onion, potato or green chilly, margins tend to be smaller because risk of loss is lower. However, if it is a more perishable commodity such as tomato or okra, the intermediary has less elbow room to negotiate. But if he has control over supplies of a particular produce or stocks from a particular region, he can demand a higher price.Eventually, a deal is made and the goods reach the APMC where wholesalers earn a commission by arranging an auction for the trader. Retailers pick up the produce and wholesalers earn a fixed fee ranging from 6.5% for potato and onion to 8% for other vegetables and 10% for fruits. Now it is this stage of the food chain that the government has specifically sought to do away with.Henceforth, farmers or their agents or even the traders can sell directly to any agency or seller that they want to without paying commissions. But in case a retailer wishes to use the APMC to buy goods, he would have to pay the commission instead. Now this may in turn get passed on to consumers. Wholesalers and retailers have called a meeting with traders on Saturday to discuss the matter.Subhash Deshmukh, minister for cooperation and marketing said to TOI, ""There is some confusion over payment of tax (commission) but it is between the traders and retailers and not at the government level. That they have to sort out. If need be the government will intervene."""

Fruit prices, on the other hand, stayed high as merely 25 truckloads arrived compared with around 300 on regular days.As many as 270 trucks of onions and potatoes arrived on Thursday. This saw retail prices of onions fall to Rs 18-22 from Rs 20-25 on Wednesday and potatoes to Rs 24-30 from Rs 30-35. Market experts say prices will return to normal with additional supplies on Friday.Sanjay Pansare, a leading fruit trader in the APMC , said, ""Unlike vegetables, fruits could not reach the market today as producers learned late on Wednesday that the strike had been called off. As most fruits come from other states, they will reach the market by Friday. We had only 25 truckloads sent by local growers.""Prices of tomato fell to Rs 60-80 in the retail market against Rs 80-100 during the strike. Green chilli stayed high, though, at Rs 160-200 due to less-than-expected supplies.Meanwhile, retailers who had bought vegetables at high prices during the stir, failed to get them sold. ""We incurred losses from leftover stock,"" said Sachin Gavas, a vendor.As the vegetable market reopened for the day's transaction in APMC, Vashi, on Thursday, a day after the indefinite strike was called off, retailers voiced opposition to the idea of paying commission to wholesalers. This delayed the auctioning process for over an hour. Later, the intervention of APMC officials resolved the issue.To break the deadlock, it was decided that though farmers have been exempted from shelling out commission, retailers were also given relief from commission for the day. ""Why we should pay commission on purchase,"" protested a Bhiwandi-based retailer Anish Shaikh.Rajaram Dhondkar, deputy secretary of APMC, Mumbai, who was present when the crisis erupted toldthat, ""From today farmers have been exempted from paying commission to the traders for selling their produce. At same time retailers were given exemption too from new commission to be paid to the traders for the day. From Friday onwards retailers will have to pay commission on the lines of the onion-potato market where all retailers adhered to the rules."

It hasn't helped that the government's efforts to build stocks of dals, has been either absent or ineffective.Arhar dal now costs as much as Rs 170/kg. Urad dal is selling for as high as Rs 196/kg. Tomatoes are going for Rs 100 a kg. And potato prices are up to almost Rs 20/kg.Dal production has been hit due to last year's drought, almost doubling its prices. Higher-than-expected heat has destroyed some tomato crop, which may have constricted its supply, pushing And a blight that swept across potato fields in Bengal, has hit the tuber's supply.The situation is so bad that vegetable price inflation rose 2.21 percent to 12.94%. That then badly hit the Wholesale Price Index, pushing it to 0.79% in May, its highest level in 19 months. And with no change in the already high inflation in the price of dals - at 35.56 percent - food inflation on the whole spiked to 7.88% in May from 4.23% a month earlier.The government's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of dals - or pulses - for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said. He added that rabi crop procurement is still going on, he added.India imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.In the last two years, arhar dal prices have doubled and the cost of urad has increased by around 120%. Even the price of chana dal, which is produced in large quantities and is usually unaffected by inflation, has risen 85% in this period, in Delhi.The case of the two staple vegetables - potatoes and tomatoes - is slightly different. Both are shorter duration crops. But both have seen prices surge.Tomatoes are ripe for harvesting 60-70 days after transplanting while potatoes take 75-120 days to mature. The tomatoes that are coming to the market now were planted around March. While there were some unusually high temperatures in that period, the crop destruction was not staggering.Winter rain in the larger producing states was not unduly distressing, either. In any case, tomato farming isn't completely dependent on rain. So the agriculture ministry's second advanced estimates for horticultural crops pegged the tomato crop for 2015-16 at 18.2 million metric tonne, up from the previous year's 16.4 million metric tonne.And still, tomato prices have gone through the roof. Although the government says that prices are not so high, data published by the department of consumer affairs and the National Horticulture Board show that in most cities, prices have increased by 100-200% between April and June this year. A comparison of prices between June 2014 and June 2016 shows that in most cities, tomato prices have increased phenomenally.The potato economy is different from the tomato one, in that it's not based just on supply and demand. A portion of each year's harvest of potatoes goes into cold storages across the country and comes out for the market later Potato production was estimated to dip this year to about 46 million tonnes from the previous year's 48 million tonnes. The blight in Bengal destroyed some potato crop, pushing its price up.(Edited by Shailaja Neelakantan)"

After all, it was the nuptials in two erstwhile royal families of India: the groom was from Mysore's Wadiyar lineage and the bride from Rajasthan's Dungarpur dynasty.Mysore, which recalls the royal era once a year during Dussehra, came to life on Monday when Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar tied the knot with Trishika Kumari Singh in a traditional ceremony at the iconic Amba Vilas Palace in Mysore.The wedding rituals  held at the 100-year-old Kalyana Mantap inside the palace after a hiatus of several decades  were officiated by a team of priests.Clad in pink angrakha and jharipeta, Yaduveer arrived at the mantap in a 1953 vintage owned by Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, the only son of the last ruling Maharaja of Mysore. He was accompanied by his aunt Indrakshi Devi. Arriving at the Madanavilasa entrance of the hall, Yaduveer was given a traditional welcome at the courtyard.Trishika Kumari arrived, dressed in traditional saffron Mysore silk sari.(TOI photo: Nethra Raju)Both Yaduveer and Trishika completed the rituals that took more than an hour with shloka chanting and guidance from the priests. Around 10.24am, Yaduveer tied the 'mangalyam' to Trishika during the auspicious Savithri Muhoorta of Karkataka Lagna.The couple, after completing the ritual of 'Sapthapadi', obtained blessings from Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, the wife of the late Narasimharaja Wadiyar.The couples tied the knot at 10.22 am and performed a series of pujas and other rituals which were stretched over for four hours. (TOI photo:Nethra Raju)The Boston-educated Yaduveer (24) was adopted as the scion of the former Wadiyar dynasty in May 2015 in an elaborate ceremony, again to re-emphasise the point that it is a 'royal' tradition. Sources in the family revealed that Yaduveer was engaged to Trishika much before his adoption as the scion of the ""royal family"".Colourful headgears - in both Rajput and Mysore tradition - dotted the palace. State chief minister Siddaramaiah, cabinet colleagues, diplomats from various countries, and erstwhile royal families from across India came for the nuptials.(TOI photo)The Amba Vilas Palace is witnessing the second wedding in the erstwhile royal family since 1976. Though there have been a few weddings related to the ex-royal family members, the last wedding witnessed in the palace of was that of Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar in 1976 to Pramoda Devi.No Hindu wedding in the 'royal' family is complete without the mangalasutra being tied twice. It's a ritual unique to the descendants of the former Mysuru royal family, one that Yaduveer too followed on Monday.The south Indian Hindu wedding custom of the groom offering a silver toe ring to his bride gets a tweak. Back in the royalty days, it was gold, not silver, toe ring. And that's what Yuduveer did too.Many believe that Yaduveer and his bride Trishika were courting each other. Yaduveer's father Swaroopananda Urs put the rumours to rest and said the wedding was ""arranged"". Both families matched horoscopes and only then proceeded to fix the alliance.More than 200 chefs were roped in for the vegetarian feast on Sunday. On the menu were such delicacies as kashi halwa, kheer, badam kheer, pheni laddu, tomato yennagayi, channa batura masala, bisibele bhaat, tovve, rasam, majjige huli.The wedding of Yaduveer with Trishika upholds an old Rajput-Mysuru 'royal' family connection. The Rajput alliance started in 1900 when Krishnaraja Wadiyar married his bride from royalty in Gujarat  Prataparudra Kumari. This was followed by Chamaraja Wadiyar marrying Satyaprema Kumari of Bundelkhand and now Trishika comes from Dungarpur family in Rajasthan.No wedding crashers could have made it here. Entry was strictly by invitation. Only two persons per invite were allowed. The whole of the Mysuru city was decked up for the wedding  the palace especially was a sight to behold.Mysuru police commissioner B Dayanand and deputy commissioner of police HT Shekar supervised the bandobast. Three ACPs, six inspectors, 40 sub-inspectors and assistant subinspectors were on duty. Apart from them, 300 police personnel were deployed to beef up security since a huge number of VIPs were expected to turn up.Representatives from the erstwhile royalties of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur and Rajkot came for the wedding."

But many just skip buying the fruit at open markets, the super stores provide shoppers with other options  canned tomatoes, puree and pastes  but they too come at a price.

""With sales being at an all-time low, we sometimes buy less than five kilos to get through the day,"" said Ramesh Salve, another vendor.Unlike onions and garlic, the tomato is a flavourful ingredient. While some communities omit the rest for religious reasons, there is no discrimination against the tomato.Sangeeta Kulkarni, a home maker from Vashi suggested using roasted red bell peppers as an option to this costly ingredient. ""Mangoes and pineapples are also good choices since they have the sweet and sour flavour,"" she suggested.But, according to her, Indian grown tomatoes have an unusual flavor, which cannot be replicated by the commercially available pastes.

Traders, brokers and workers have declared yet another indefinite strike, this time to protest against the government's decision to allow farmers to sell in the open market.Of the 600 truckloads of regular vegetable supply, only 100 arrived at the APMC on Monday . The shortage pushed wholesale prices to an all-time high, hitting the retail market hard. Some traders blamed heavy rain in Nashik for the shortfall. Others like Vashi trader Narendra Shelke claimed, ""Fearing losses due to the upcoming strike, farmers from Pune, Nashik, Satara, Sangli and Solapur stopped supplies to the APMC on Monday . Hardly 50 truckloads of outstation supplies and an equal number from across Maharashtra could reach the Vashi market, which pushed prices through the roof.""It is not clear what farmers will do with this pending stock of fresh vegetables, especially since it spoils easily during the monsoon. Logic dictates that they would despatch the produce quickly before the bandh begins and cut their losses.Consumers are furious that middlemen should continue their strike plan despite the dire situation. ""Already , dal is selling for Rs 120-180 per kg, vegetables for Rs 100-200 and dry condiments have come to cost the earth. Now the APMC has decided to go on strike and halt supplies completely . The government or courts should either outlaw this bandh or ensure alternative arrangements for supply ,"" said Andheri resident Neerja Kajale. Borivli businessman Ujjwal Joshi said, ""The APMC's arm-twisting tactics have exposed that it is only concerned about its own members' welfare. It is a good thing that the government has at least made a beginning in demolishing its monopoly . Farmers will soon learn how to manage transportation and supply logistics.""Across Mumbai, cauliflow er, green chillies, garlic and capsicum are being sold for up to Rs 200 per kg.

Our deparment was told to procure more pulses for buffer stock,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said.This year's target is to procure 1.5 lakh tonnes of pulses for buffer stock creation and so far, 1.15 lakh tonnes have been purchased during the kharif and rabi seasons, while the rabi procurement is still going on, he added.To boost domestic supply, Paswan said, ""The finance minister also said that imports via public and private agencies should be strengthened to meet the deficit.""The government has decided to send a team immediately to pulses-growing nations like Myanmar and Africa to explore government-to-government imports, the food minister said.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as chief economic adviser, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also envinced interest to supply lentils to India.Besides pulses,, sugar and wheat was also discussed at the meeting.Tomato prices have more than doubled to rule as high as Rs 100 per kg due to crop damage. Potato prices have also been on the rise.Paswan informed in the meeting that the price rise in tomato was a ""seasonal"" factor and the commodity cannot be stored due to short shelf-life unlike wheat and rice.He also informed that his ministry is keeping a close watch on prices of pulses, sugar, wheat, tomato and other essential food items.The country had imported 5.5 million tonnes of pulses last year. The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year. It is also importing pulses through state-owned trading agencies like MMTC. So far, 38,500 tonnes of lentils have been contracted for import.The wholesale price inflation data released on Tuesday showed vegetable prices rising sharply to 12.94 per cent. Pulses inflation has remained in double digits since January 2015 and stood at 35.56 per cent in May.The meeting also discussed ways to better procurement, and increase in sowing area, taking action against hoarders, and improve transparency in functioning of private importers.The meeting, which was also attended by secretaries to the department of economic affairs and revenue as well as Chief Economic Advisor, was informed that Kendriya Bhandar, Safal and other government agencies were selling the staple tur and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg from their outlets.The government has already released 10,000 tonnes of pulses from buffer stock to deal with the situation.The government's twin strategy comprises boosting supply through its newly-created buffer stock and imports.Already, India has submitted a draft agreement for import of tur from Myanmar on government-to-government route. Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution. However, not many states have shown interest.""The Centre is offering to state governments the un-milled tur and urad from the buffer stock at Rs 66 per kg for retail distribution at not more than Rs 120 in order to provide relief to consumers."

It's also looking at the possibility of leasing land in Mozambique to grow pulses.The consumer affairs ministry has asked states to ""resort to all possible means"" to ensure pulses aren't sold beyond 120 a kg while the shipping ministry has been directed to keep strict vigil on pulses landing at ports to prevent hoarding. The government is ready to provide more funds to ensure procurement.The decisions came after Wednesday's meeting convened by finance minister Arun Jaitley to deal with the surging prices of some vegetables and food items.""The government has approved import of 3 lakh tonnes green lentil, 2 lakh tonnes yellow peas, 1 lakh tonne red lentil and 20,000 tonnes each of arhar and urad,"" consumer affairs secretary Hem Pandey said.Two teams will soon visit Myanmar and Mozambique, he said, to finalise long-term supply contracts. The African country is keen to enter into long-term contracts with India.""We can even lease land in Mozambique to grow pulses,"" Pandey said.But a quick relief from the soaring tomato prices is unlikely, supplies of which have suffered because of drought in some southern states.Tomato prices are likely to remain high for two-and-half months till August.Price trends in the past four years show that rates shoot up in two phases - June to August and October to November - every year.Latest government figures peg the country's tomato production at 18.28 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) against last year's 16.38 million tonnes. But crop damage has impacted supply and the government may have to revise the estimate.States have been told to keep vigil on veggie prices and ensure improved supplies amid reports of tomatoes selling at 80 a kg in certain parts of the country.""Increase in vegetable prices, including tomato, is seasonal and area-specific. Still, we've asked states to take steps to ensure traders aren't inflating prices artificially. Every stakeholder must ensure there's no wastage during transportation and handling,"" said Pandey. Pandey also said the government does not want to increase procurement of pulses from the domestic market beyond 1.5 lakh tonnes to ensure market stability.""I have asked the Maharashtra food secretary to explore the option of selling pulses at subsidised rates in Mumbai as is being done in Delhi and we will provide them pulses at subsidised rates. We will release the pulses available with us in the next four months,"" the secretary said.The Centre has about 48,000 tonnes of pulses in stock and imports of another 20,000 tonnes are in the pipeline.The government is pulling out all stops to ease the pain of spiralling prices of pulses and has included FM radio channels to spread awareness."

Prices of other vegetables too saw a significant jump in last one week.With festivals round the corner and heavy rains in Himachal Pradesh, mandis in the city are facing shortage of supply of fresh vegetables, which has led to a sudden spurt in prices. Barring few, most vegetables have crossed Rs 50 per kg mark.The most pinching among them are tomatoes. In wholesale, it was sold at Rs 55 per kg while in retail it reached up to Rs 80 per kg in some parts of the city.Traders claim that stock is limited as supply from Rajasthan and Nashik has dried up. They warned that it may even cross three digit figure in coming days.""Arrival of tomatoes from Jaipur is over. At present, it is coming from Bangalore which is supplying to almost all the states.Unless fresh stock from Nashik comes, the prices will only increase and may even reach to Rs 100 per kg,"" said Radheyshyam Phatak, president of the Rajasthan Fal Sabzi Aloo Thok Vyaapar Sangh.Other vegetables too are burning a hole in the pockets of common man. Bottle gourd (lauki) in wholesale is sold at Rs 25 per kg but in retail it was rallying at Rs 50 per kg. Capsicum too has reached Rs 70 in wholesale and Rs 85-90 per kg in retail.Apart from inflation being one of the reasons, wholesalers claimed that retailers are intentionally keeping prices inflated.""No doubt rates have increased in the past few days but the vegetables are reaching to the consumers at double the price,"" said Ram Babu Gupta, a trader in Muhana Mandi.Difference in wholesale and retail prices indicates discrepancies.
