Ambient lighting, costumed serving staff and floor-level seating (complete with canopies draped in shimmering curtains) aim to make the visitor forget Tiruchi for a brief while.Moroccan cuisine has been shaped by all its interactions with other countries over the centuries, chef Rajprasad Radhakrishnan said. You will find dishes here with a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine.Theres also an influence of Moroccos colonial heritage, with a small selection of French recipes.The buffet starts off with a salad table that has some staples of Middle Eastern cuisine  steamed couscous (semolina granules made from durum wheat) with finely-chopped fresh vegetables, tabbouleh (cracked wheat mixed with finely chopped ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, and parsley) and Hummous dips made with chickpeas and black beans.Fatayer (mini minced mutton pies) have been given a vegetarian twist with a potato and peas filling, and Manakish, small pita flatbreads topped with zatar spice mix of cumin, oregano and olive oil, and sambouseh add to the variety of the bread counter.Grilled meats feature prominently in the Moroccan palate because of the nomadic lifestyle of its people. We have tried to include the commonly barbecued meats in our festival, with a live station that will serve customers the cuts of their choice. We marinate the lamb for at least one and half days before we grill it, said Mr. Raj. The whole lamb being barbecued at one end of the pool makes a dramatic visual statement at the festival. Small charcoal braziers are placed at customers tables to barbecue chicken, quail and kababs.Tagine, the slow-cooked stew of meat and vegetables that is distinguished by its earthenware dish topped with a conical lid, is available at the festival too.The golden glow of saffron tints everything from rice dishes to gravies and desserts in the festival. At the rice counter, Moroccan versions of biryani and pulao are available. Spaghetti tossed with cheesy white sauce brings a French touch to the table.Date halwa and roz bil haleeb (rice and milk pudding) are among the treats that mingle with some Indian offerings at the dessert table.The buffet dinner is priced at Rs. 600 plus taxes for adults, and Rs. 400 plus taxes for children."

A sum of Rs. 14.13 lakh has been allocated for adopting modern methods of farming in 471ha of the 6,082ha of land in the district.Horticulture Deputy Director P.N.V. Lakshminarayana said that the objective of the scheme was to increase production and quality of vegetables in small landholdings which have water sources.Each farmer will get Rs. 3,000 per hectare as subsidy and it is limited to 2 hectares of land.However, a farmer is entitled to the subsidy amount only if he purchased the seeds on his own and raised the crop.In order to increase production and quality of tomatoes by 20 to 30 per cent, the department, on an experimental basis, is adopting trellis system in 53ha at a cost of Rs. 9.94 lakh."

Traders and experts blamed poor supply of almost all kitchen essentials for the surge and have ruled out a price correction any time soon because of rain-related problems of supply and spoilage. The supply of vegetables continues to be about half of the usual arrival, said Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section at the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee.""The monsoon has arrived, but that has so far not translated into a sizeable stock reaching the city. So far, the drought-affected crop is being harvested and received. Crop sown now will be better, but that will reach the city only after a month or so. Green leafy vegetables, though, could see a price correction faster. Thankfully, the rain is good so far. So, there is a hope for a good harvest,"" he said.In the retail market, vegetables like tomato, ginger, green chillies and even beans, capsicum, cauliflower and ladyfinger continue to command high rates. Good quality tomato is still selling for almost Rs 80 per kg in most areas. Beans, too, have not registered a price correction and are being sold for almost Rs 70 per kg, while vegetables like cauliflower and ladyfinger are selling at more than Rs 50 per kg. Green leafy vegetables are being sold at premium rates as well. While a standard bunch of coriander is commanding Rs 25, fenugreek is going for Rs 20 a bunch.The rates are unlikely to fall any time soon, Rajendra Sahu, a vegetable retailer, estimated.Customers don't have a choice but to buy the vegetables, even at high rates. ""The only change is that people are cutting down their purchases,"" Sahu said.Asha Patel, a tiffin provider from NIBM Road, is hoping prices fall soon. ""Before buying vegetables, I have to think if it will upset my monthly budget. Actually, I have stopped buying tomatoes as I just can't afford them any more. The government doesn't seem at all concerned about things that affect the common man,"" he said."

Vinay.Talking to press persons at Paraipatti village near Sempatti on Wednesday, he said traditional varieties would be protected as it could be used by farmers again and again and stocked for their future use. Farmers would be roped in to raise these varieties in their field to produce seeds of these varieties and preserve them, he added.With limited water sources and shortage of labour, poly house has become the ideal option for horticulturists to get better yield and profit in a small area of land. Poly house helped farmers overcome shortage of water and labour.These progressive farmers not only adopted latest technologies but also used hybrid seeds to get better yield on small area. Farmers have been raising cucumber, tomato and other vegetables in poly houses, he pointed out.Vertical farming method under weather-controlled atmosphere helped them harvest large quantity of cucumber. They have been earning decent income in 140 days."

Even as I grumbled to my friend who had suggested the morning expedition, I found myself heading to Nariman Point two Sundays ago for the Sant Shiromani Shri Savta Mali Athavda Bazar, Vidhan Bhavans farmer-direct market. The weekly market that has been set up across the State by the Maharashtra State Agriculture Produce Marketing Board.Of course, I was armed with cloth bags and plenty of change. Since mid-August this year, every week, the lot between the Vidhan Bhavan and Inox theatre is transformed into a bustling bazaar of more than 30 stalls with farmers selling a staggering range of local and seasonal produce.We joined the throng of people shopping for their weekly veggies, and marveled at the glistening tomatoes, fat sitaphals, fresh cluster beans, and pumpkins the size of Ravanas head, that jostled for space with mounds of lettuce, stacks of asparagus, and luscious-looking purple cabbage.Apart from the usual suspects, there was some wonderful indigenous produce. We found some early green mogri (as the Gujaratis call it), which I had last eaten in Delhi. Winter vegetables, these radish pods are spicy: the purple ones add a nice bite to raitas while the green ones are cooked into a vegetable, usually with brinjals. Though, these are just as delicious when eaten alone.The market also sold fresh kidney beans in their pods, khatta sorrel leaves, and colocasia leaves for patras and stir-fries. We also found wild chikoos and guavas that when sliced open revealed a soft pink flesh. Flowers such as marigolds and asters were also available.I went back to the Sahyadri Farmers Producer Co. Ltd. stall multiple times for their glorious pesticide-free black raisins, plump and sweet. My friends kept texting me that they also wanted a packet, and so I would return to the stall to buy yet another kilo, while sampling more of the raisins. The same stall promises chemical-free bananas as well, and are considering home delivery in the future. Another farmer who stocked garlic showed us how to plant the pod to grow it.The haul from the market was a reassuring one, given that just the other day, my friends and I were bemoaning the lack of good produce available in our bazaars. The prices at the Sant Shiromani Shri Savta Mali Athavda Bazar are more than reasonable, and for those tired of the usual apples and bananas, theres much diversity in the produce available. This is a definitely affirmative step by the government in enabling fair trade, by cutting out the middle men, and letting people buy directly from the farmers.Dont forget to carry your own cloth bag though.Bijal Vachharajani writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out BengaluruThe Farmers Market is held every Sunday in the parking lot of the Vidhan Bhavan, Nariman Point, from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.The market enables fair trade by cutting out middle men and letting people buy directly from farmers"

These items were available at a price band of Rs 120 to Rs 150 per kg depending on the quality of the commodity.Likewise, Jagdish Prasad, who has been in the retail vegetable business for over two decades said the trend will continue for the next two months. ""Short supply of vegetables to the market and limited stock with retailers has led to the spurt,"" Prasad said.Another shopkeeper, Kailash, said quite a few varieties of vegetables that are supplied from the surrounding districts and adjoining West Bengal are available at modest prices. ""Commodities such as potato, pumpkin, bottle gourd, that are supplied from surrounding districts, are available at reasonable prices,"" Kailash said.The consumers, however, are complaining. ""We have no option but to buy cheaper vegetables. We are adding more and more potato dishes to our meals,"" 55-year-old NML employee, SK Deo, a Sidhgora resident, said.Mamata Pathak, a Kadma resident, thought vegetable vendors have a role to play in the price rise. ""I suspect the vegetable traders deliberately increae prices, keeping in mind the preference and growing demand for vegetarian food during Shravan,"" she said."

Pressure was also building up within the retailers' community with many members, especially women, complaining about loss of business and livelihood.The retailers have been demanding elimination of agents' commission. Representatives of the retailers' associations and Agriculture Produce Market Committe (APMC) attended the meeting with the minister.The retailers' representatives claimed after the meeting that the government had assured them that it would study the feasibility and take a decision by August 21.Till the retailers made the welcome announcement of calling off their strike, citizens suffered because of vegetable shortage, high prices and poor quality. Most markets in the city were closed for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday. A few retail outlets open sold four-day-old stocks.Several tiffin providers in the city were mulling over suspending their services till Wednesday evening because of vegetables' short supply. ""I was lucky enough to know about the strike a day in advance. So, I stocked up vegetables for a few days. But now my stock is also running out and I might have to stop providing my services for a while till the strike is called off,"" said Asha Patel, a tiffin service provider in the NIBM Road area, an hour before the strike was called off.Consumers were left frustrated for the fourth day running. Smita Joshi a resident of Rasta Peth, lamented, ""It looks like nobody is bothered about how this affects the budget of middle-class people like ours. Exorbitant prices are being extorted from us because of this strike.""Restaurants had to procure vegetables from far-off places and could not function normally with the prices so high. Jaykant Vaidya, the owner of Annapurna Thali in Kothrud, said, ""Tomatoes, onions and potatoes  the three most essential vegetables  have become very expensive. I am forced to use them less and use substitutes like sauce instead of tomatoes. I have been going to the Pirangut market to get vegetables after the strike started.""A daily market has been operating in Baner despite the strike of vegetable retailers started.The market has around 60 stalls manned by representatives of farmers. Lahu Balwadkar, an organizer of the Shree Sawmi Samarth Athawade Bazaar, said, ""We started this exactly a year ago with the idea of connecting the farmers directly to the consumers. Around 2,000 farmers are working with us. This helps in providing vegetables at a cheaper rate to consumers. At the same time, farmers' profit margin also increases. All the vegetables are sold at a rate of Rs5-Rs10 less than the retail market.""Baner resident Anurag Bharadwaj termed the initiative ""very good""."

Manuel Jayaraj said 14 different types of associations, which were functioning at the Central Market (now not in existence), near Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, came together under a single umbrella and got registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975.It did not stop there. The association purchased 15.25 acres of land near Paravai and, with the assistance of Union Bank of India, big, medium and small merchants set up shops to deal with vegetables at wholesale prices. We procured in big numbers from hundreds of farmers and sold them, in turn, to merchants from different districts. Many wholesale merchants from as far as Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam too procure vegetables from our market regularly, Mr. Manuel Jayaraj added. Though not all the merchants, who were selling produce at the old market near Meenakshi Temple came here, a majority among them, say 75 per cent, have come.There are close to 650 shops/outlets, measuring in different sizes such as 1,000 square feet., 500 square feet., 200 square feet and 100 square feet are operated from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m since July 2009 at the Paravai market, as it is popularly known.Rajapandi, a supervisor of a wholesale merchant, said they mainly procured tomato, carrot and beans from farmers in the nearby region in bulk and sold them to buyers in Thiruvananthapuram. We despatch close to three tonnes in goods vehicles every alternate day. The payment is either credited in our bank account or we send our collection agent, he noted.Road to be laidThe market was solely established by the promoters, who could not get any assistance from the government or the local bodies in any form. Thus, the funds to be spent on infrastructure was huge and burdensome for the members. As the truck movement inside the market was heavy, roads had to be laid. Some of the executive committee members appealed to the government to help them in laying roads and disposal of vegetable waste, which too, they did on their own.Apart from the shopkeepers, hundreds of loadmen, workers and merchants visited the market throughout the night, association treasurer A. Arumugam said.Traffic reliefIn the last nine years, vehicle movement around Meenakshi Temple had fallen with the shifting of the vegetable market to Paravai, a police officer said. Even today, we experience traffic jam in Vakkil New Street, Yanaikal, East Masi Street and Simakkal in the early hours, but the shifting of 14 vegetable vendors associations to Paravai from Meenakshi Temple was a great relief from the traffic point of view. Imagine, if they too existed in the same place, it would have been highly impossible to move around the temple, a senior traffic police officer said."

But, growing up in Midnapore, he didn't have a daak naam (nickname), that most endearing of Bengali traditions. Doesn't matter. His fans have given him one. To them, he is Bangali Babu.In the labyrinth that is Itwari , street-style sandwiches are synonymous with Bangali Babu. From 4pm to 11.30pm, his modified rickshaw, and the knot of customers around it, further constrict the already clogged Dharaskar Galli . On offer are five-six varieties of sandwich , some of which have decidedly curious names. (more on this later). He even serves a veggie pizza topped with crispy vermicelli and fresh herbs. Okay, okay, with 'sev' and coriander leaves.""I started 15 years ago. My circumstances weren't very good then. Now this has turned things around,"" he says, turning sandwiches around on the hot tawa.A typical sandwich gets a slathering of butter, green chutney, tomato sauce and cheese spread before the filling and sev is added to it. The 'garam' version is then toasted with more butter on the tawa. Once ready, it is buried under a blizzard of grated cheese, sprinkled with coriander leaves and grated carrot and served on newspaper squares.His pizza-making process - Bangali Babu calls it 'technology' - is equally interesting. To 'bake' the pizza without an oven, he places a perforated steel disc on the prepared base and places the whole thing upside down on the hot tawa for a few minutes until the cheese has melted.Students, local residents and businessmen are his biggest chunk of customers. He also takes pride in the fact that he gets some high-profile guests, including union minister Nitin Gadkari (who is something of a patron saint for popular eatery owners in the city).Bangali Babu might revel in the attention today, but it wasn't always like this. Thirty-one years ago, but in what seems like another life, he completed a course in first aid from Midnapore. In 1987, came to Nagpur to escape poverty and 'do something on my own'. ""I assisted a gynaecologist for a few years. But since I was always interested in cooking, I started working as an assistant cook in a restaurant,"" he remembers, adding that his financial condition still remained precarious.""I decided on sandwiches since this was something that I could manage on my own,"" he says. ""The Bombay sandwich is a common recipe, but the rest, I developed on my own. I keep thinking about new flavour combinations all the time,"" he says. He tests out the new recipes on 8-10 regular customers and only after getting feedback does he add it to the menu.So, which sandwiches has he created? ""Tichkule,"" he says, cryptically. Relishing the quizzical look this elicits, he goes on: ""There was this character called Sachin Tichkule, played by Akshay Kumar, in the movie 'Khatta Meetha'. This sandwich is also khatta meetha (tangy) and fills you with energy. Hence the name,"" he explains.Another of his creations is 'moov'. Quizzical look, check. The explanation? ""That is because, like the relaxing cream, this sandwich also relaxes you and comforts you,"" he adds.For someone who didn't have a nickname of his own, Tapas Chakraborty aka Bangali Babu has come a long way. Even his sandwiches have daak naam now.(This occasional column looks at some of the old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved. Do you know of any?

Two months ago, following a price hike, vegetables were sold for a fortune at the markets. Now, shopkeepers in town are of the view that the prices will shoot up again for Onam.Tomato is one such item whose prices escalated and fell in a space of two months. Data available with the economics and statistics department showed that tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 32/kg last Onam, was priced at Rs 48 in May. However, this week it sold for half the price, around Rs 18-20.But, making Erissery is going to be more or less expensive as the price of pumpkin is rising steadily. Pumpkin - which was sold for Rs 18/kg last year - was priced at Rs 20/kg last May and is sold for Rs 22 in local markets.If you love 'Vendakka pachadi', do not wait for Onam. The price of lady's finger, which touched Rs 48 this year (last year, it was Rs 31), is now being sold for Rs 20/kg. 'Cabbage thoran' will burn a hole in your pocket this Onam. Though the price of cabbage has fallen by Rs 3/kg compared to the price a couple of months ago (Rs 30), it is still higher than last year's figure of Rs 23.The prices of one of the most expensive item - bitter gourd - dropped recently. The vegetable, essential for kichadi and the crunchy fried delicacy, was sold at Rs 52/kg this May, while the price was Rs 38 last year. The current price is Rs 30/kg.It would be a safe bet to choose out-of-the-box dishes this season and go for dishes like 'Vazhuthananga theeyal' as the price of brinjal has fallen. The veggie now available for Rs25/kg was sold at Rs 32 a couple of months ago.Vegetable dealers said this fall and spike is quite normal. They claimed that cooperative societies and other government entities, running special stalls to control price is inadvertently increasing the price.""Temporary retail outlets at regional levels are run by those who have no market experience. When they purchase items in bulk without knowing the exact requirement or pricing, there will be a shortage. The artificial price hike is usually blamed on wholesalers, but shortage can happen this way too. This results in a temporary hike during festivals,"" said K Shaji, a vegetable dealer who has been running a stall at Broadway market for 30 years.Consumerfed MD Mehaboob M rubbished the claim that 'involvement of government entities contributed to the sudden hike in price. ""Consumerfed stocks product by calling tenders. Our aim is to rein in the hike in price. It is to be noted that production has increased this season. If weather favours the farmer, a good harvest is sure. Then, you too get a price cut,"" he said."

And then there are those pizzas, which combine never-thought-of concepts with taste. We bring to you eight such pizzas, which you will marvel at, even before you take a bite!Pizzas boasting of typically Indian toppings, like paneer tikkas and kebabs, are nothing new.

Currently, gastropubs and watering holes seem to be on a back-to-the-basics-at-home mode, with the most popular Indian pedestrian food, chaat, making its way into their kitchens. Food watchers and chefs believe that this trend is only going to grow bigger and is something that would work well with Indians who are also returning to their roots.Restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani says that going desi was inevitable. ""A bhel puri can work as both an appetizer and a salad. Come to think of it, it is fresh, nothing is cooked, has bold flavours and, without potato, it makes for a healthy snack. Given our palates, it makes for a good accompaniment with alcohol or, as a meal by itself. The industry has fast caught on to serving more chaats on the menu, though we have taken it a bit too far as well, with ingredients such as liquid nitrogen being infused in them, for instance. But given the way the people are headed, why not go desi with our food? It does work, after all,"" points out Riyaaz.F&B consultant Aslam Gafoor says that fusion food, especially chaats, is going to stay. ""While we can trace the first instances of this trend making an appearance to a couple of years ago, it has permeated to our city recently, with many quirky stand-alone restaurants having them on the menu. It is a case of chefs and restaurateurs wanting to give back to consumers what India has to offer. From humble chaats such as jhal muri or bhel puri and puchkas or golgappas, to the Mumbai favourite vada and kheema pav, there is a lot of Indian street food making its way into these kitchens. And they are served in interesting fusion avatars, which make them all the more exciting to the people frequenting these hotspots, as opposed to the same old bruschettas and other European dishes that have been on the menus for a while,"" he adds.Actor-turned-restaurateur Likhit Shetty adds that it was this experimental feeling that got him and his partner to introduce some fusion chaats to their menu. ""I am a Mangalurean and I love chicken sukka. My partner loves chaats, especially pani puri. When planning our menu, we decided to try something new and different, which was when we got to adding Chicken Sukka Golgappa to our menu. Also, we have a Chicken Bhel. We were unsure how people would react to it, but people's response shows that they are game for more such experiments. The cosmopolitan crowd in the city likes the mixed flavours and techniques,"" says Likhit.The fact that chaats are familiar to Indian diners, who do not have the time to go to small chaat restaurants in bylanes, is also why they are a big hit. ""The past couple of years have seen the idea of small plates become popular with people who dine out. Chaats are a perfect sync with the concept of small plates as they offer a reasonable amount and can be shared by 2-3 people. This is another reason the trend has picked up, and has given chefs the chance to plate them innovatively, adding some creativity with the cutlery,"" reasons Aslam And there are some gastropubs that add a bit of drama too, which includes live mixing of chaats at tables. Chef Sombir Chaudary says, ""Instead of serving a soggy version of jhal muri, guests are awestruck when they are served improvized versions live at tables, with spice, onions and tomatoes based on their tastes. Meat versions like chicken and prawn are popular. Mixing cuisines also helps  for example, a papdi-chaat version of nachos, which is a favourite pub snack. I think this trend will stay for a while in Bengaluru, because people seem to like everything to have a twist and are always game for something new."""

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N.

The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already written to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology.Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Mr Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.If the Government of India approves GM crops such as GM mustard which is an important crop for States like Bihar, the State will not be able to escape the consequences of the technology as we are also the leading producer of honey in India and honey production depends on mustard crop, he said.He urged the Prime Minister to see that no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, which can harm the interest of farmers and the people of India at large.The interested parties are trying to push in an unproven technology. The States must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on the farmers, he said.The government of India should mandatorily consult and seek no objection from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop, Mr Kumar urged Mr Modi.He also sought the Prime Ministers intervention to see that the attempt to commercially release genetically modified mustard variety in the country should not proceed any further without prior consultation and consent of the state government. - PTI"

Forty crops, including the upland paddy of Jyothi rice, are cultivated here.The vegetables sown here includes potato, cabbage, tomato, beetroot, carrot, onion, beans and green chilly. Some vegetable will always be ripe for harvesting at the farm round the academic year.When the initiative was launched, the school authorities were not sure whether they would be able to grow all the vegetables available in the market. But now, almost all varieties are grown here, making it a model farm. Both hybrid and traditional crops are grows here, says Siby K. George, convenor of the farm club. The farm is fully organic; pest-control and the application of manure is minimum.A lot of effort, from the children as well as elders, has gone into the farm, which is on a slope.

Most of us, these days, for lack of time, or due to sheer laziness, find it easier to pick up vadam packets from the stores. But remember the excitement of a summer holiday morning  when we were young  when paati was all set to lay out the vadams on the terrace to dry, and all the kids were given the task of keeping the squirrels and crows at bay? Recall tasting the semi-cooked vadams, and waiting impatiently for them to be fried the next day? These days, with most women working, and compact apartments being the preferred residences of many, the art of making vadams is hardly a much-awaited summer activity anymore. Plus, with the appalam and vadam industry getting commercialised, today's generation doesn't mind picking up a packet of vadams or appalams off the shelf. But then, it is not a lost art, for bucking the trend are those Chennaiites who still follow the tradition of making these eats at home.Television anchor and actress Ramya Subramanian, and her mother Vasanthi never miss a chance to prepare vadams when the sun is shining bright. Vasanthi, who makes vadams every year, says, ""Making appalams and vadams was once restricted to women in agraharams, especially among widows, who used to make a living out of this. Later, it became a hobby for women during summer. I grew up in Mannargudi and saw our grandmothers preparing it by observing madi. The daughters-in-law later picked up by watching them. I was interested in cooking even as I was a child, and started helping my mother when I was as young as 10 or 12. I learnt how to make vadams from her, and till today, I ensure I prepare different varieties every summer."" Her daughter Ramya has the fondest memories of helping her with the process. ""The maavu itself is very tasty - there have been times when my father and I have half-emptied the maavu. Despite her warning us that eating too much of it would hurt our stomachs, we love having spoonfuls. My other duty is to go to the terrace with a long wooden stick and keep the crows from eating what's laid out to dry,"" laughs Ramya.What started off as an individual interest turned into a small-scale business for Narayanan. ""I am from Kerala. Even though no one at my house makes appalams, I got a bit curious about how this was made, when I was a child. I used to see my neighbours doing it and picked it up from them. Later, I moved to Chennai and began experimenting with appalams, until I finally learnt the trick. Even though I began making it for my house, my tasty appalams were demanding to be sold,"" says Narayanan, who has been making appalams for the last 30 years.The problem with buying it outside is the quality, he says. ""They add a lot of sunambu (slaked lime). So, it becomes less tasty and don't last long, which is why, making them at home is a lot better. However, I must say that unlike vadams, making appalams is quite difficult. But once you know the technique, it is relatively easy,"" he says.K Jayalakshmi's shares a similar story. A government employee, she began making vadams as a hobby, and soon turned it into her business, post retirement. ""I have been making vadams since I was young. But I was not able to do it frequently since I was working. But once I retired, I took it up pretty seriously. I make javvarisi, tomato, onion, murukku, and ela vadams. I also do ulundhu and arisi appalams. Apart from this, I make a variety of vathals and mor molaga. It was through word of mouth that I began making it for outsiders. At 70, I am not as active as before, but my son and his friend take care of it these days,"" she says.Homemaker Uma Rajendran, who has been making vadams at home, says that there is a lot of difference between homemade vadams and the ones purchased at stores. ""I have been making them for the last 30 years. When you do it by yourself, the quantity is more and you ensure the salt and amount of spice is added accurately. If you pick it from the shop, it will hardly last for two months. They get spoilt quickly because they don't dry it sproperly. When we make it at home, we dry it at least for four or five days and I store them until next summer. But yes, it is indeed a tedious process, especially since you have to stand near the stove all the time to check the consistency. But then, this used to be a fun activity for all of us when we were growing up,"" says Uma.Vasanthi also points out that today's generation doesn't have any interest in making these at home. ""The appalam and vadam industry has become commercialised. They don't want to make it at home and simply buy them off the shop. They have become lazy and think that it is a difficult process. They don't make an attempt to learn. The reason why these are made during summer is that when we have dal-based recipes during winter, these accompaniments help digest the food better. Also, today all the women go out to work and live in compact apartments. There isn't much time or space for them to dry them,"" says Vasanthi.While the current generation might be enjoying this process, the next generation might not even see mothers making vadams at home, says Ramya. ""Even though they are served just as an accompaniment to a meal, I like how our mothers take time to prepare this with love and affection. I am happy to be a part of this generation, where I have seen her making these, and learning from her. But I don't think the next generation will be able to see all this."""

V. S. Nagireddy has said.Addressing a press conference at the partys district office here on Friday said Mr. Nagireddy said that several factors that included lack of money to buy inputs, reduction in availability of water and last but not the least lack of remunerative prices for their produce were pushing farmers into a severe crisis, he said. He wondered why Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was advising bankers not to give gold loans to farmers. He asked in what capacity the Chief Minister was making such recommendations to banks. Nothing short of a parliamentary Act could prevent bankers from giving gold loans to farmers, he said. The Principal Secretary was on the other hand contradicting the Chief Minister by telling the bankers that farmers were resorting to suicide because the banks were not giving them loans.The Chief Minister was ordering law enforcement officers to invoke the PD Act to curb trivial crime, but was not suggesting the same for persons involved in sale of adulterated agricultural inputs even though they were affecting several lives.Mr. Nagireddy said that onion crop had been raised in 30,000 hectares in the State, but farmers were being forced to dump it on the road side because there were not getting remunerative price. The situation was the same with tomato farmers. While 50 per cent of the mandals in the State were experiencing drought, the State government had not even written a letter to the Centre appraising it of the pathetic situation. Spurious seed was another factor that was affecting the farmers."

Judge Sanjay Patil sentenced Jitendra Dedhia (48), owner of a grocery shop in Parel, who had ordered the hit after his wife refused to divorce him.Dedhia had an affair with the sister-in-law of his wife, Beena, and wanted to marry her. Also, sentenced to life were the attackers -Nazim Khan and Hasruddin Malik.The trio was found guilty of the murder last Wednesday after which the court had posted the case for Mondayfor the sentencing. Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian sought the life sentence for the accused on the ground that, in keeping with the Supreme Court's guidelines, the case did not fall in the `rarest of rare' category to warrant the death sentence.The victim's sister-inlaw, who had also been made an accused in the case initially, was discharged by the Bombay high court a few years ago. A third accused, Rajnikant Wagh, a vegetable vendor who had introduced the killers to Jitendra, was acquitted by the court.The case initially garnered huge sympathy for Jitendra as he had made the crime appear like a chainsnatching incident that ended in the murder of his wife.However, a month later, the city crime branch of the city police cracked the case and found that Jitendra had promised the co-accused Rs1 lakh for carrying out the attack. He had paid Rs 29,000 to the accused which was reco vered from them.Acting on a tip-off, on December 17, 2009, the crime branch arrested Khan, a taxi driver who lived in Antop Hill. The police said that during interrogation, he revealed the name of Malik, a tomato vendor who allegedly told the cops about the conspiracy . This was the fourth attempt made by the men, the police had said.On October 4, 2009, all the accused met at Lalbaug where the conspiracy was hatched. On October 27, 2009, Jitendra prodded Beena to go on their usual morning walk. Around 5.30am, the couple was attacked by two bikers, Malik and Khan. The police later alleged that while Malik was riding, Khan stabbed Beena on the neck.They also alleged that Jitendra then ordered Nazim to finish his job properly, since, if she survived, the truth would be out. Nazim then returned and stabbed Beena twice in the stomach."

Both also seem trend driven and of the moment.Kitchen Garden, the new urban caf from the folks behind Suzette, translates healthy eating into an expansive salad bar and a menu that uses 90 per cent organic produce to prepare salads, smoothies and sandwiches.212 All Good, a new clean eating restaurant at Phoenix Mills, takes a different tack. Here you can get a cocktail, a snack or a meal made of ingredients sourced locally. There are also substitutes for everything from cola to ketchup.The motivationJeremie Sabaggh, one of the three partners behind the Kitchen Garden, says, We wanted to do something like a Subway, but with good ingredients. Romil Ratra, Group Director, Bellona Hospitality, says the impetus for 212 All Good was people realising there are huge benefits in eating the right stuff without compromising the meal experience. Without saying, I cant eat this. Fried is not bad. Cheese is not bad. It is like, alcohol is not bad. How do we make it better so that theres less guilt at the end of everything?The original idea for 212 All Good came from Deepti Dadlani, who heads marketing at Bellona. She says, Theres this whole other conversation where you can say what you eat is how you feel, and what you are.The scale of the undertaking cant be experienced in a single dish, though the Andaman Island Tuna Poke Bowl gives you a fair idea of the complexities involved: from sourcing and transporting fish from the Andamans to substituting traditional rice for red rice, to serving it with lightly fermented carrots. Seven months of intensive research have gone into formulating recipes for everything from soda to bread.The same can be said of the devotion put into sourcing the produce at Kitchen Garden. The crockery has been brought from Vietnam the bread is as a crusty sourdough is airy and moist (the breads are organic). The kitchen turns out only 20 loaves a day, though that is set to expand. Also on the menu is ciabatta bread, though not the flaky croissants that are available at Suzette. This is in keeping with the healthy focus of Kitchen Garden, where even the bread is made from three ingredients: wheat and rye flour, salt and water.Sabaggh says, I started attending bread classes in France in 2012, working on baguettes and everything like croissants for Suzette. And then I did some internships in Paris. This led to a second internship in Paris with a baker who is totally crazy guy, very passionate and working only with sourdough. Its this tutelage that has led to the sourdough that is served at the restaurant.Ratra and Sabaggh are committed to the quality of their product. Sabaggh says, With Kitchen Garden, the idea is to do something more urban, maybe a bit more young. More international, less French. Where we can do something like soba noodles, that we are doing here, or ciabatta breads or twisted hummus or have some edamame, or veggies, which were not exactly, fitting our Suzette concept.That said, there are some things from Suzette that theyre carrying over. The reason why we kept the by Suzette [label] is that we want people to know that this is the same way of making things, always from scratch, using organic products, never using shortcuts to make food, no artificial flavours, no ready-made stuff. We dont have ready-made stuff, I dont like that.Good for your gutThe focus of the food at 212 All Good is that it should be good for your gut. The team has worked on fermentation of vegetables as well as things like kefir, a fermented milk drink made with yeast. Tacos, all-day breakfast, salads are available for a dining experience that is similar to the one you would have at any of the malls other eateries, but with ingredients that are free from preservatives.Both restaurants work with suppliers to bring farm fresh ingredients to their customers. At Kitchen Garden, cherry tomatoes to cheeses are supplied from a farm in Gujarat. The vegetables, grains and meats are brought from farmers in Maharashtra and close by. If it is not possible to get quality ingredients locally, for example Haas avocados, Parmesan cheese, its imported.At 212 All Good, everything is sourced locally, be it cheese, fish or vegetables. Salmon was dropped from the menu as it could not be sourced from the country. Behind the bar, tetrapacks of juice have been banished in favour of freshly squeezed juices and even bitters are being made in-house.If this signals anything, it is that city consumers are looking to eat out, but not at the expense of their health. Sabaggh sums it up, What we discovered also from clients in Mumbai is that people really know what they want, and they like to experiment.Both restaurants offer something for everyone: catering to diets that range from vegan to keto to gluten free. And perhaps more innovatively, to those that arent on a diet; rather just choosing to watch what they eat.The author is a freelance writerTo make a reservation at Kitchen Garden, Bandra West; Call 26459775212 All Good opens on October 17 at High Street Phoenix; Call 62216020/ 8655012212"

The scheme is being seen as a boon for farmers in the arid region, who depend almost exclusively on scanty rainfall for cultivation during the rabi season.While the first stage of the scheme covered an area of 11,000 hectares, the project's second stage will bring a further 24,000 hectares of agricultural land under its ambit, making it the world's largest single drip irrigation project.Highlighting the advantages of the Rs 768-crore scheme, water resources minister MB Patil said, ""Around 15,000 small and marginal farmers in 30 villages of the taluk will benefit from the scheme.""Test run in September: A joint venture of Netafim India Private Limited and Jain Irrigation, it is being run on a build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) model.

58f6741ba3d24b0b70c2b9ee,Keep up the fair exchange,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Keep-up-the-fair-exchange/article15477879.ece,2016-10-10,,The Hindu,"Amid tensions between the two countries, it has been suggested that India should impose a trade embargo on Pakistan by suspending its most-favoured nation (MFN) commitment towards Pakistan in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The MFN provision, given in Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 1994, puts every WTO member (including India) under an obligation to extend any benefit (say, lowering tariff rates) accorded to one member (say, the U.S.) to all other WTO members (including Pakistan). This core non-discrimination principle is the cornerstone of the world trading system. Arguing for India suspending its MFN commitment towards Pakistan would mean India restricting imports from Pakistan without restricting imports of like goods from other countries, or/and India restricting exports to Pakistan without restricting the export of like goods to other countries. This can be achieved by imposing trade quotas, higher tariffs, taxes, or even totally banning some or all traded products. But is this economically and legally feasible?Economic and legal feasibilityAlthough bilateral trade between India and Pakistan has increased from $345 million in 2003-04 to $2.61 billion in 2015-16, it is abysmal compared to Indias total merchandise trade of $641 billion in 2015-16 and Pakistans total trade of around $75 billion, which includes exports worth $28.3 billion. Indias exports to Pakistan amount to $2.1 billion whereas imports from Pakistan are just $441 million, resulting in a trade surplus of $1.7 billion in favour of India. Given these numbers, assuming India were to suspend MFN status by stopping all imports from Pakistan, it would only result in a very marginal decline of Pakistans total exports and that too assuming that Pakistan is unable to find alternative markets. Even prohibiting all Indian exports to Pakistan, such as textiles, chemicals and agricultural products, will also not have any noticeable impact on Pakistan because Pakistan can always source these goods from other countries. On the contrary, restricting Indias exports, which have contracted considerably in the last 18 months, might hurt India more than Pakistan.Would India be able to justify its MFN violation if Pakistan were to challenge this in the WTOs dispute settlement body (DSB)? First, India cannot justify this on the pretext that Pakistan does not honour MFN obligations towards India. The correct recourse to Pakistans action is to mount a legal challenge in the WTO and not indulge in tit-for-tat.However, India can justify its MFN violation if it is able to make a case under any of the GATT exceptions such as the national security exception, most important in the current scenario. In the pre-WTO era, the U.S. in 1985 relied on this exception to defend its MFN violation when it imposed a trade embargo on Nicaragua to oppose the Sandinista government. However, given the weak and diplomacy-based method of resolving trade disputes then, the U.S. defence was never judicially tested. In the post-WTO era, in 1996, when the European Communities (EC) challenged the Helms-Burton Act of the U.S., enacted to strengthen the American embargo on Cuba, the U.S. again justified it as a national security exception. Even here, before the adjudicatory process could start, the U.S. and the EC reached a settlement.Article XXI (b) of GATT provides the most important national security exception. It states that nothing in GATT shall be construed to prevent any country from taking any action that it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests. Three questions are pertinent. First, do the words it considers necessary give full authority to India to enact any measure it likes without any scrutiny by WTOs DSB? Although Article XXI (b) gives a country very wide discretion to unilaterally decide its national security measures, a certain degree of judicial review is still possible. Thus, at a minimum, India will have to provide a reasonable explanation to the DSB as to why restricting export of cotton and tomatoes to Pakistan or/and restricting imports of dates, light oil and portland cement (these commodities constitute almost 50 per cent of Indias imports from Pakistan) is necessary to protect Indias essential security interests.Second, is Article XXI (b) a general national security exception? No. This exception can be invoked only if the measure adopted relates to fissionable material, to traffic in arms or other related material, or is taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations (EIR). India will most likely try to make a case in the EIR category. Even here, though India will enjoy a wide discretion to define EIR, this cannot be unilaterally determined to ensure that Article XXI is not used for political or punitive purpose.Third, does the current situation fall under an EIR? This is difficult to answer. Notwithstanding recent escalations, both countries continue to have diplomatic relations, cultural and social ties have not been snapped, transport links continue to exist. Also, both countries have seen far worse days in the past and yet trade and economic ties deepened.Pushing for deeper trade tiesTherefore, given the negligible economic impact and potential legal problems, suspending MFN to impose trade sanctions on Pakistan will only escalate tensions without much benefit. Instead of weakening trade ties, India and Pakistan should pay heed to this famous claim that when goods dont cross borders, soldiers will. Free trade connects countries, and thus incentivises peace. Empirically, it has been shown that higher levels of free trade reduce military conflicts. India and Pakistan should boost free trade amongst themselves, Pakistan should honour its MFN commitment to India in the WTO, and India should use the SAARC platform to push for deeper trade ties.Prabhash Ranjan is an Assistant Professor of Law, South Asian University. Views are personal.If India were to suspend MFN status by stopping all imports from Pakistan, it would only result in a marginal decline of Pakistans total exports"

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all-India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham secretary general D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives."

Cut to 2014 when it bagged the geographical indication (GI) tag giving its growers here the sole right to use the words 'Nagpur Orange'. Little has changed after that. Though not as worse as the cotton grower who is often pushed to suicide, the orange farmer is also not spared by the vagaries of nature and uncertain market. Last year, a glut led to rates crashing to Rs4 to5 a kg.If the Alphonso mango grown in Konkan region and grapes of Nashik have an established export market, the Nagpur Santra remains their poor cousin.The orange crop grows twice a year. The fruit available from September to December is Ambiya which has a slightly sour taste. It is followed by the sweeter Mrig crop in January. Normally, farmers go for either of the two varieties. In the last 10 years, large-scale orange cultivation has begun in Rajasthan too, giving Nagpur Orange some competition.The demand for setting up a major processing centre in Vidarbha is an old one. Two years ago, a facility by Citrus India Private Limited started at Nanded in Marathwada region where orange growing is a recent affair. Now, as Patanjali Ayurved plans to make juice out of the oranges grown in Nagpur district and other regions of Vidarbha, there is much hope for the farmers, even though earlier players have failed to successfully market the same product.The first organized attempt was made in the 1960s when farmers came together to form the Nagpur Orange Growers' Association (NOGA) with its plant at Motibagh in north Nagpur. NOGA ran into losses and the government took over it in 1972, bringing it under the Maharashtra Agro-Based Industries Development Corporation (MAIDC).NOGA, with its new plant in Hingna, was once known for its bottles of orange squash and juice. Now, tomato ketchup is its mainstay product. NOGA's line of juices, which are sold in cans, are out of the shelves in shops and are now sold only to institutional buyers like hotels and government agencies. Squash has a small retail market with 50,000 bottles made in a year. There are 3-4 smaller units which hardly have any influence.Sources say NOGA could not compete with juices in tetra packs which took over the market. Cans became old fashioned and NOGA did not have enough funds to invest in a tetra pack unit. The golden days of NOGA ended more than a decade ago. A plant started in Katol in 1998 is also shut.The Nagpur orange has a peculiar feature of leaving a bitter taste in the juice. Limonin in the fibre and seeds brings about this taste. In a commercial unit, the seeds and fibre cannot be removed, or consequently, the bitterness reduced. At least NOGA couldn't and thus lost out to competition. ""The squash which is sweetened with chemicals sells more,"" a source said.""These days, de-bittering units are available, again a major investment,"" said the source. Industry experts say limonin is present in other citrus fruits too and the problem has been addressed long back.The National Citrus Research Centre (NRCC), which has its experimental farms off Amravati Road, was set up in 1985 after a major pest attack in the early 1980s. Now upgraded to a central institute, some say here that it has not come up with a counter to the bitter taste so far. Though a seedless variety has been developed, it is expected to be available for commercial cultivation only after a couple of years.""De-bittering facility is easily available in the market so it should not be a constraint anymore. Like Nanded, a plant can also be set up in Nagpur,"" says Manoj Jawanjal, the director of Mahaorange , a state government marketing agency, and also an orange grower.At present, the majority of units making juices import the fruit contents. Imports are cheaper due to low customs duty. ""In order to protect the local growers, government should impose a higher tax on imports,"" he said.""The orange lobby has not been as strong as grape growers of western Maharashtra. A market for pomegranate and grapes was created by the growers there. Initially, the growers also paid for the losses incurred by traders who exported their produce. Now, there is an established market for these fruits. Those in Western Maharashtra had a political backing. It can happen for oranges too but there has to be support from the government,"" said Jawanjal.""Mahaorange recently exported oranges to Sri Lanka but there is s a long way to go. For getting the advantage of GI tag, an export market has to be established first. At present, the local farmers do not have much awareness about GI and its advantages,"" he said.""It's not juices alone, even orange peel and seeds can get a good price for the farmers,"" says Amitabh Pawde, an engineer-turned-farmer in the orange belt of Narkhed, over 60 km from Nagpur.""The peel can be used for making high-end cosmetics. Orange peel oil is a costly product and, once dried, talcum powder too can be made from it. At present, the raw materials are imported. There are small units which do not make any difference. Any major player in personal care segment, buying the raw material from Vidarbha, can change the dynamics of orange growing here,"" said Pawde.Pawde cited a recent research which says limonin, the bittering element in oranges, can cure kidney stones too.Even as bigger plans may still take some time, farmers say even their day-to-day problems have not been addressed entirely. ""A large number of farmers are close to forest areas and Nilgai (blue bulls) are a major pest destroying the orange trees which are short in height. Subsidy for drip irrigation is also is not available,' says Sanjay Dhote from Katol."

This season, farmers in Bodi, Melasokkanathapuram, Silamalai, Markandeyankottai and Kundalnayakkampatti cultivated the crop expecting high returns. Most of the farmers had grown the variety that gives yield in 90 days. As the climatic conditions were also conducive, they got a good yield.Tomatoes cultivated in the region are sold in the markets in Trichy, Dindigul and Oddanchathiram apart from Madurai. However, this time, it looks like the traders are not keen on them.At present, a box of 15 kilograms of tomatoes, which have not been segregated based on the quality, is selling for 30, while the slightly higher quality boxes selling at a price between 40 to 50. But, the farmers say that the traders are getting a better deal, because they are selling the tomatoes in a prices ranging from 5 to 8 based on the size and skin. In Madurai, the better quality tomatoes are sold for 10 in the farmers markets, while retailers hiked it to 12.Farmers say that the traders make good money even when there is a good yield, because they do not even bother to come to purchase the tomatoes from the farm. The farmers are forced to take them to the markets as the produce cannot be maintained for long.A Sekar, a farmer, says that they spend about 6,000 for cultivating tomatoes on one acre. ""A ten-gram packet of tomato seeds cost 400. The maintenance per acre comes to about 30,000, including pesticides and weeding. We make some profit only if a box sells for about 60. But now, we suffer about 1,500 loss per acre. Loss or profit, we have to pay the people to pick the fruits, which would otherwise start rotting as the rainy season is setting in. Thus, once again, tomato farmers in the region are suffering in spite of a good yield,"" he told TOI."

Today, she has 17, and is in talks with 10 more.""At first, I collected the trash myself in my car,"" Danelon said with a laugh as she turned over dirt with a shovel in the leafy courtyard of her house in Sao Paulo.""But now we've grown, and today we recycle 30 to 40 tons of organic waste per month.""- Gardens in the sky -Her partners include French restaurant Le Bilboquet, in the chic downtown neighborhood of Jardins.With Danelon's help, the restaurant now has cherry tomatoes, lemons and lavender plants growing on its rooftop, a stone's throw from the skyscrapers of the Brazilian economic capital's financial district.Its French chef, 34-year-old Julien Mercier, signed up for Danelon's program six months ago.""What we grow here isn't enough to supply the whole restaurant. But the important thing is to understand that we're part of a process. These things are growing here, and we can also boast that we recycle a ton and a half of organic waste every month,"" he told AFP as he inspected his vegetables and herbs.The waste is composted at a facility about 50 kilometers (30 miles) outside the city, where it is mixed with earth and allowed to biodegrade over the course of months.It is a ""traditional composting technique,"" without enzymes or earthworms to accelerate the process, said Danelon. But with a little patience, all that waste turns into rich, nutrient-packed compost.- Seeing things differently -The average 50-table restaurant pays 900 reals ($275) a month for the composting and gardening service -- about the same as the municipal waste collection fee.""We have to look squarely at our own waste, value it and know that it can be reused,"" said Danelon.She offers starter kits for people looking to make their own compost at home. More and more people are contacting her to ask about setting up communal gardens on the roofs of their apartment buildings, she said.At Mesa III, a deli in a working-class neighborhood, customers are greeted by basil, sage and rosemary plants ever since the Guandu Institute trained the staff.""If we as a society realize how much trash we're producing, we'll see it's just atrocious,"" said owner Ana Soares, 63.Her restaurant has installed a recycling system for glass and switched to cardboard take-out containers to cut down on plastic.""That's why we joined this beautiful project,"" she said. ""We have to learn to look at things in a new way.""nr/jhb/sst"

We've had enough of those, really . Newage eateries are using a host of exciting ingredients from across the world and far-flung corners of our country  from Bulgur wheat to kokum, unagi to chorizo and more -to rustle up lip-smacking delicacies that will leave you surprised, excited and craving for more! Check these out...SRIRACHA, FROM ASIABUFFALO WINGSBODEGA CANTINA Y BARSriracha, a spicy sauce, is definitely one of the biggest food trends in India this year. Sriracha is highly flavoured, and is used extensively in Thai cuisine. For Bodega Cantina's Buffalo wings, they home-make the Sriracha. ""Our Sriracha is inspired by the original and made with different kinds of chilii and vinegars and then fermented for a long time,"" says owner Urvika Kanoi.LAVASH, FROM WEST ASIALAVASH CRACKERSCRAVE FOODWORKSLavash is a kind of flatbread that is widely consumed through the entire region. Though it is commonly believed to be Armenian in origin, food experts also claim that it has Iranian roots.The lavash crackers at Crave Foodworks are a relatively newer take on the soft flatbread, that's crispy and spicy, and can be had with or without dips or sauces. In this restaurant, it is served with classic hummus or labneh.GUNKAN AND NORI, FROM JAPANIKURA GUNKAN MAKIFUJIGunkan maki is a more complex kind of sushi, commonly known as battleship or warship sushi. Ikura, which is salmon roe or the fully ripe egg mass of the fish -just like caviar -is one of the more uncommon soft toppings used to make this sushi. Another uncommon ingredient used is the nori -a Japanese edible seaweed which comes in sheets. If you are all for gastronomic adventures, this one should be on top of your must-check-out list.KOKUM, FROM THE WESTERN GHATSKOKUM RITASPICE KRAFTIf you are a fan of the ubiquitous margarita, but also have a taste for the indigenous, Chef and owner Sambit Banick will recommend to you the Kokum Rita.""To the classic cocktail, we had a very interesting twist -that of the kokum fruit. I get my kokum saar, which is the extract of the Indian fruit from Khamkaar in Mumbai, a very old and well-known shop that stocks all kinds of pickles and spices. It is authentic and we use to it serve our indigenous take on the Margarita,"" says chef Sambit.BULGUR WHEAT, FROM WEST ASIATABBOULEHCALCUTTA STORIESBulgur wheat originated in Bulgaria and is a broken wheat rich in fibre. Bulgur is a common ingredient in Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Syrian, Israeli, Jordanian, Palestinian, Lebanese, Turkish, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean dishes. For Tabbouleh, which is essentially a salad, the wheat is steamed and tossed with three-coloured bell peppers, cucumbers and black and green olives. Now that's what you call a bowl of freshness.CHIA SEEDS, FROM MESOAMERICASUGARFREE FIG AND DATE KULFICAFE PRANAHChia seeds come from a flowering plant of the mint family, which is native to Mexico and Guatemala. Rich in B vitamins, omega 3 fatty acids and loads of other healthy stuff, these seeds are traditionally used in drinks and sherbets. At Cafe Pranah, they use it in the sugarfree fig and date kulfi. ""It is a body coolant and adds a beautiful textural contrast to the richness of the kulfi,"" informs Rahul Arora, chef and owner of the cafe.QUINOA, FROM LATIN AMERICAQUINOA SALADHAKUNA MATATAGradually, but steadily, Kolkata is waking up to the quinoa phenomenon. A gluten free, organically grown seed, it is used in food in the capacity of a grain. The history of this seed goes back to the Inca empire, when it was known as the mother of all food, given its nutrient-rich status. At Hakuna Matata, the quinoa salad also has rocket leaves, grilled veggies, tomato, cucumber and pomegranate yoghurt dressing.PS: Nasa scientists are reportedly looking at quinoa as a plant to be grown in space.DUXELLE FROM FRANCE & MIRIN FROM JAPANSTIR FRIED SCALLIONS WITH MUSHROOM DUXELLE, SPICY MIRIN REDUCTIONSPICE KRAFTAt Spice Kraft, chef and owner Sambit Banick makes it a point to mix and marry cuisines. For their stir-fried scallions and mushroom duxelle, with spicy mirin reduction, the marriage is between classic French duxelles and a spicy Asian sauce. For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.WILD RED RICE, FROM NORTHEAST INDIAWILD RED RICESANTA'S FANTASEAA tribal dish, the wild red rice is big in the northeast food scene. It's unpolished, unlike the white rice we commonly use. ""The unpolished dhenki-chhaat chaal is full of nutrients. It might not look very shiny, but it is much better for our health,"" says Kaushik Ghosh, owner of Santa's Fantasea. In this restaurant, it is served with a gravy that is made from traditional northeastern herbs and the superhot bhut jolokia, or raja mirchi, as it is known in Nagaland.CHORIZO, FROM SPAINCHICKPEA CHORIZOBODEGA CANTINA Y BARA Spanish pork sausage, chorizo is increasingly becoming one of the staples at new-age restaurants in Kolkata. It is spicy, made from coarsely ground pork and seasoned with chili and paprika. It is widely used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. ""Chorizos are centuries old, but it is relatively new on India's palette. We buy it from a Spanish couple in Bangalore, who make the chorizos themselves, to preserve the authentici ty. The spicy pork goes wonderfully with the flavours of chickpea, and present it as tapas,"" shares Urvika Kanoi, head chef and owner of Bodega Cantina Y Bar.CHIMICHURRI, FROM ARGENTINACHIMICHURRI PRAWNSSMOKE HOUSE DELIThis is an Argentinian sauce, which is used as a dip with fried fish or grills. In Smoke House Deli, they make it from scratch, which is their take on the original chimichurri, and use it as a marinade for prawns.""The prawns are marinated in this sauce for 30 minutes, before being grilled and baked,"" said head chef Fatik Mir. Apart from infusing the prawns with a burst of flavours, the vibrant green chimichurri contrasts with the slight pinkish shade of the prawns.UNAGI, FROM JAPANUNAGI NIGIRIFUJISorry to burst your bubble, but Unagi is not the total state of concentration that Ross of FRIENDS claimed to have mastered. It is actually a freshwater eel that is a very common component of Japanese seafood. If that makes you squeamish, remember that Fuji uses this fish with wasabi, gari, rice and sushi vinegar to make a nigiri, which is also another form of sushi. Not take a look at the plate, doesn't this look like art on a plate?RIBOTIDE, FOOD ADDITIVENACHOS WITH CHEESE SAUCECREAM CENTREThe controversy surrounding MSG, a flavour enhancer widely used in southeast Asian cuisine, came as a huge blow to Chinese restaurants and food manufacturers. But then, as they say, when one door closes, another opens up. So now there are powder flavor enhancers in the market, known as Ribotides. These can be used in a way similar to MSG and are considered safe. It is a Japanese derivative and is used in the cheese sauce of Cream Centre, which is served with their nachos. Though the nachos cheese and mozzarella cheese here are both customized with secret ingredients, at least we know that they use a highly expensive flavour enhancer, which accounts for their huge fan following!COUSCOUS, FROM NORTH AFRICAVEGETABLE TAGINE WITH COUSCOUSTHE FACTORY OUTLETCouscous has been a part of Kolkata's menu for quite some time now. However, with the trend moving from traditional grains such as wheat and rice to uncommon ones such as quinoa and buckwheat, couscous is also getting its share of limelight. A traditional North African dish, it is made of moulds of semolina and flour. A dish in itself, more and more restaurants are deconstructing it to suit Indian palettes. It can be served with broth, veggies or meat. Sometimes it's had just by itself -a bowl of comfort food. For the veg tagine with couscous at The Factory outlet, they serve the steamed dish with preserved veggies."

58f68b2e7be9e031f13b6fd9,Donald Trump's diet: He'll have fries with that,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Donald-Trumps-diet-Hell-have-fries-with-that/articleshow/53611093.cms,2016-08-09,,The Times Of India,"NEW YORK: President Barack Obama is so disciplined that his wife has teased that he eats precisely seven lightly salted almonds each night.George W Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.But Donald Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation's fast food president.""A 'fish delight,' sometimes, right?"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town-hall-style meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald's. ""The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It's great stuff.""Trump's presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent.And so is his diet.In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn't have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House.But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Trump has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation  devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal), feasting on a McDonald's burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican presidential nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters).He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (""It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,"" his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See's Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol.But his highbrow, lowbrow image  of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seat belt buckles  is also a carefully crafted one.If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting ""a splash"" more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Trump's diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them.""There's nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,"" said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. ""It is the peculiarity of the brand that he's able to be on his multimillion-dollar jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC  and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal.""Or, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the Trump campaign, put it, ""It goes with his authenticity.""""I don't think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye's biscuits and fried chicken,"" she said.Last April, Clinton did, indeed, visit a Chipotle near Toledo, Ohio, stopping into the chain restaurant unrecognized, in black sunglasses, and ordering a chicken burrito bowl.And President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation's first fast food commander in chief, famous for ending his jogs at McDonald's. (Bill Clinton now adheres to a largely vegan diet.)Still, Trump seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely.While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life  Mitt Romney's 2012 press corps coined the term ""slunch"" to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the ""second lunch""  Trump's reliance on high-calorie fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness.Though he often orders from the Trump Grill when working out of Trump Tower in Manhattan, he eats fast food several times a week while on the road because ""it's quick,"" as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger King on his Boeing 757-200.Trump has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. ""We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table,"" he said.A man always prone to distraction and uninterested in small details, he has never approached food as anything other than a problem to be solved, quickly, as Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, an occasional dining partner, once told The Washington Examiner.As the two men ate at Jean-Georges in Manhattan in 2002, Trump ordered briskly and imperiously from the head chef and owner, Christie recalled. ""Jean-Georges, remember the appetizer you made for me last week when I was here?"" Trump asked the owner. ""We'll take two of those. And remember that main course you made, the special thing you made for me? We'll take two of those, too.""Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled. Trump looked at him and said, ""Don't worry, you'll love it.""But Trump, who frets about germs, also loves fast food because of the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene.""One bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald's,"" Trump told Cooper of CNN. ""I like cleanliness, and I think you're better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food's coming from.""Still, he added, ""I think the food's good.""Trump's dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism  the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan's glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the borough's haute cuisine.He once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a pizza restaurant in Times Square  and then proceeded to cut his slice with a plastic knife and fork.The Republican nominee's dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches  but also where to find the nearest drive-through.""There's never any real planning for food,"" said one. ""It's always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald's."""

Her victory in the women's singles event semi-final match against world No 5 Nozomi Okuhara of Japan on Thursday was savoured by countless people who sat glued to their TV screens and are now cheering for the ace shuttler to beat world number 1 Carolina Marin.But behind's successful run and turnaround from a mild-mannered shuttler to a hungry-for-win, roaring player is her coach and former badminton player Pullela Gopichand. He was earlier the coach of another Olympian Saina Nehwal who won a bronze medal at the London Olympics in 2012 but after the end of their partnership, Gopichand has focussed his energies on scouting for other players who can raise India's flag globally. And he catches them young.Gopichand is a tough taskmaster who always keeps pushing his pupils to achieve great heights.

However, for many from the community, who have made Pune their homes for several years, Durga Puja is no different. During the five days of Durga Puja, pockets of Pune shine like Kolkata, with as much grandeur as the City of Joy, giving Puneites a glimpse of what it feels like to be in Kolkata during Durga Puja. Greasy rolls and mishti to gorge on, pushpanjali and endless adda, the community lets people soak in as much Bengali-ness as they want in these five days. And ahead of the festivities, here's a look at the oldest Durga Puja pandals of the city that kick-started the celebrations in town.The Pune Kali Bari Durga Puja, as it is known now, began in 1939. Seventy-seven years ago, there weren't as many Bengalis in town, as there are now, but enough to start the first puja of Pune. Anup Dutta , from the Pune Kali Bari Durga Puja association, shared, ""In the 1930s, there were a lot of Bengali doctors and armed forces personnels who stayed in the Khadki cantonment area. They were mainly employed under the government and as it was difficult to go back to Bengal every year during that time, they began celebrating Durga Puja in a small school in Khadki.""Not all from the community could attend the festivities in Khadki back then. So, it was decided, that the Durga Puja will be held in the city area (the present Pune Municipal Corporation which was a barren land then) every alternate year. ""This is how the other oldest puja of the city, Congress Bhavan, came to existence,"" Dutta added. The celebration at these venues, every alternate year, continued till the 1960s, when Bangiya Sanskriti Sansad (erstwhile Congress Bhavan) branched out to have their own Durga Puja, without losing its essence. Bireshwar Mitra, president of BSS, said, ""As I get to know from my predecessors, the Durga Puja, that began with few people, gained popularity in no time. Gradually, more people settled at various parts of the city and branched out with their own Durga Puja celebrations at several corners."" With over 30 Durga Puja pandals in the city, a majority of them owe their allegiance to Pune Kali Bari and Congress Bhavan Durga Pujas.With carrying forward the legacy of puja celebrations, generations have also passed on their secrets when it comes to making the bhog for goddess Durga. The simple plate of khichudi, sabzi, kheer and tomato chutney, a quintessential Bengali's must-have during Durga Puja, has been passed on for generations in Pune, miles away from Bengal. ""Until very recently bhog was cooked with woodfire. But, with popularity, we switched to cooking gas. Like it was decades ago, the bhog comprises of khichudi, labra, payesh and chutney. We offer pulao to the goddess on Saptami, which is also served to devotees on this day,"" shared Dutta. Incidentally, the cook hasn't changed in Pune Kali Bari, for over a few decades now. It is no different in Congress Bhavan. ""As a tradition there are two types of bhog that are prepared. One is special for the goddess, which is made by the ladies of the association and offered to Durga. Later the part of this bhog is added to the bhog prepared as a prasad to devotees,"" said Madhumita Ghosh , a member of BSS.(With inputs from Anup.Satphale@timesgroup.com)"

One can just insert Rs.10 note and choose a code number for the specific seed and collect the seed packet dropped into a box. A salient feature of the facility is that one can even get minimum quantity of seeds required as people are forced to buy at least half a kg of seeds - over and above their requirement, according to Dean P. Pandiyarajan.The university has introduced the vending machine for supply of quality seeds produced by it in major towns and cities in the State. The first machine was commissioned on its campus in Coimbatore. The machine has a capacity to stock 1,800 packets of seeds and the university, to start with, has stocked 460 packets.The seeds dispensed by the machine included tomato (PKM); tomato hybrid (CO3); brinjal (CO2); Amaranthus; Bindi hybrid (OBhH1); cluster beans (PNB); chillies hybrid (CO1); and bitter gourd (CO1).The machine will update details of sale of seeds to the Seed Centre unit of the university. In case of demand for a particular seed, the machine would immediately alert the TNAU authorities through an SMS. Also, in case of any attempt to damage it, the machine would alert the police and TNAU authorities.The machine has a video screen through which farmers and members of the public are informed about latest research and development activities of the university. The service will facilitate residents in urban areas to buy quality seeds throughout the year, he said. The machine is refrigerated and maintained at 4 degrees Centigrade to preserve the seeds.Minister for Agriculture R. Duraikannu inaugurated the machine during his recent visit to the institute."

Each model has stood the rigours of previous competitions at the zonal level. As one walks along the aisles set up behind the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum (VITM), it becomes obvious that the models reflect the issues that afflict their districts.Take for instance, the low-cost farming techniques showcased by Shravani P., a Standard X student of Chinmaya Vidyalaya in Kolar district where a persistent drought has turned the lives of many farmers upside down. Displaying multiple systems, including plants in artificial foam floating on water and a bubblephonics system to induce air bubbles into the water, she says productivity can be doubled and water consumption reduced.

""All three are out of danger and will be treated for another couple of days,"" doctors told police.After shifting their family members to the hospital, Rekha and Hemalatha went to the police station and filed cases. Rekha, in her complaint, accused Suhas of misbehaving with her minor daughter and police booked Suhas under IPC section 354 (outraging modesty of woman). Hemalatha accused Shivaram of threatening her and he was booked under IPC 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 337 (causing hurt by endangering act).According to police sources, Hemalatha and Rekha had earlier approached police seeking their intervention. ""Since it was a civil matter, we had directed them to advocates. After a few sittings, Rekha and Hemalatha had agreed to settle matter and the final talks were scheduled to Saturday. But everything went wrong on Friday night,"" sources said."

Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) have answered this and other zero-gravity gardening conundrums by growing the first flower in space.The orange zinnia looks like a daisy and has a reputation for being one of the easiest flowers to grow on Earth. In space, though, it was a challenge getting it to sprout.The flowers seemed doomed in December after four plants developed mould. But at the weekend, U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly, who has been taking care of them, tweeted a photo of a solitary blooming zinnia with the Earth in the distance behind it, with the hashtag #SpaceFlower and the words: Yes, there are other life forms in space!The flower is part of a wider attempt to grow food in orbit, using Nasas plant growth system Veggie, which was delivered to the ISS in April 2014. The Veggie team has already enjoyed a successful lettuce harvest and plan to have tomatoes too by 2017. Ultimately, the hope is to make possible a sustainable food supplement for a future manned mission to Mars.But space gardening is plagued with problems, including high radiation levels and temperature extremes. Fortunately, with the ISS in a low orbit, the Earths magnetic field shields plants from the worst radiation effects. Inside the station, the atmosphere can be tightly controlled.Experimentation onIts a relatively nice environment, with heat and humidity control, says professor Dhiren Kataria, who builds space instruments at University College Londons Mullard Space Science Laboratory, and is working on a new project to study the survival of seeds in space in collaboration with the seed bank at Kew Gardens.Its quite significant that we can do this now, says Prof. Kataria. If we can grow flowers, it helps in terms of the pollination process. And if you want a sustainable environment, you need cross-pollination. Plus, of course, nothing brightens up a space station like a nice bunch of flowers.   Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2016"

A rich symphony of flavour, texture and spice, this repast will leave your table looking like a 'sufachat maidan'!Weddings or family celebrations; this sweet is specially prepared on auspicious occasions. Traditionally served with sweet curd (or mithoo dahi), the roasted vermicelli and dry fruits conjure up some magic in the presence of pure ghee. We particularly love the version available at Rustom Restaurant, MG Road, where it will feature as part of a larger New Year menu.Crisp outside and succulent within, the dish epitomises Parsis' love for all things eggy and meaty. Marinated in the goodness of chillies, garlic and garam masala, the tenderly-spiced chicken, balanced out by its lacy egg coating, is a story to experience with all your senses. Most Parsi joints serve this deep-fried delicacy, but we recommend sampling it at The Food Gallery, Lullanagar.A favourite at navjotes, fresh pomfret is smeared in rich green chutney and wrapped in banana leaves. The little parcels that are steamed to perfection are a poetic confluence of flavours. You must try this one at Dorabjees & Sons in Camp, where they bake the fish before steaming it to retain the firmness outside and succulence within.Hailing from the Persian scullery, this rich onion-tomato gravy of juicy prawns is a patent preparation especially during weddings. Served with maura dal chawal, most Parsis will have fond memories of their mamaijis preparing this comforting meal from a recipe passed down in the family. Relish it at King's, East Street.Ah, the much loved wedding custard! Milk, sugar and eggs, enhanced with hints of cardamom and nutmeg, come together for a perfect tribute to the newly-weds. Baked, don't confuse this with the steamed caramel custard. Oh, the joy of cutting through and tasting the firm top layer, down to the rich and creamy bit!"

After 10 days of prayers for muktad, Zoroastrians around the world are celebrating Parsi New Year with much gaiety and joie de vivre. Mumbai, which has a sizeable population of this vivacious community, will witness hordes of Parsis visit one of the many agiaries that dot South Mumbai  from the sea-swept Seth Jeejeebhoy Dadabhoy Agiary at Colaba to the grandiose Wadiaji Atash Behram at Princess Street and the Behram Baug agiary in Jogeshwari.Mumbai has 47 fire temples in all and you will see the Parsis dressed in their Navroze finery, thronging the sandalwood shops outside these fire temples, greeting and merrily wishing each other Navroze Mubarak . The day begins by waking up early, bathing, wearing new clothes and faithfully making a trip to the agiary to seek Ahura Mazda 's blessings. Entrances to homes are decorated with colourful chalk (rangoli), incense sticks are burned in the house, doorways are bedecked with fresh, colourful flowers and sprinkled with rose water.For Parsis, celebrating New Year is about eating scrumptious food and spending time with loved ones. The festivities kick off with a hearty breakfast that comprises Parsi Sev (sweet vermicelli) or Rava, which is sprinkled with almonds, raisins and rose petals, sweet curd, Parsi Poro or the Akuri.Lunch is a more elaborate affair with Sali Boti and Dhan Dal Patia with rice. The patia can be pomfret fillets or prawns, in tomato gravy. Some families prefer to have Mutton Dhansak  the Parsi rice and masala dal speciality along with spiced meat kebabs and kachumber. Beer, of course, is a must! Jalebi, Sutarfeni and Kulfi help finish off the meal.While the recent Akshay Kumar release is wooing the genteel community with its portrayal of controversial KM Nanavati case, there are a number of Parsi naataks and musicals that are also vying for attention.

Cold crops such as guavas are now being sold for Rs 40 per kg at the Koyambedu wholesale market.The prices had been dropping for the past few days at the Koyambedu market. Traders said that with Diwali round the corner, people were buying vegetables in large quantities.Added to this, the increase in yield too has contributed to the drop in prices.The prices are bound to fluctuate depending on the sales. Koyambedu Vegetable Market Association advisor V R Soundararajan said, ""The delta regions are suffering from drought due to shor tage of Cauvery water and farmers have stopped cultivating long term crops like paddy and turmeric. They are now looking at cultivating short term crops such as tomato, onions and other vegetables. With the rich yield, the prices could drop further.''Chennai gets its share of tomatoes, beans, carrots, cabbages and cauliflower from Karnataka, while a large quantity of coconut, lime and raw banana and other veggies makes its way to Bengaluru from Chennai.

In Goa, too, rice, in all its forms is a much-loved carb. While most people will swear by a good fish thali as the perfect lunch-time indulgence, rice in its other forms, is just as popular as a breakfast cereal or a tea time snack or even a post- meal sweet indulgence.Be it savoury or sweet preparations, beaten rice (fov) and puffed rice (chirmulleo) are a staple of most Goan kitchens. Pradnya Keni Naik lists out a host of traditional delicacies she makes using beaten rice. ""The all-time favourite undoubtedly is the godd fov made using beaten rice and jaggery. That apart, some of the other popular fov delicacies are batat fov, dudantle fov and rosantle fov,"" she says.The main difference between dudantle fov and rosantle fov is that while the former is made using milk, coconut milk forms the base for the latter. ""Also, in the coconut milk-based preparation, a turmeric leaf is used as a flavouring,"" Naik says.The key point to remember while making either of these two, Naik says, is to keep a little of the milk aside. ""The beaten rice is like a sponge and soaks up all the liquid. Hence, just before serving it up, the dish needs to be topped up using the liquid that is kept aside,"" she says.""Yet another popular savoury snack made using beaten rice is the tikhat fov,"" says foodie Neelam Dutta. Calling it one of her favourites, Dutta says that while most people these days make the dish using store bought beaten rice, using the traditional fullayle fov or rice that is puffed up using hot sand gives the dish an altogether different dimension. The other ingredients that constitute this dish are fine chopped green chillies, spice powders such as pepper, fenugreek, ginger and red chilly and dal or nuts for garnish.Puffed rice laddoos are one of the old favourites that homemaker Urvija Bhatkuly prepares. ""The dish comprises just two ingredients  the puffed rice and melted sugarcane jaggery. It is both, a tasty as well as healthy indulgence. Also, during the festival of Diwali, on the day of Laxmi puja, puffed rice with a dash of jaggery is served as Prasad,"" she says. Bhatkuly also combines puffed rice with jaggery (for sweetness) and tomato (for a dash of sourness) and serves it to her family as a breakfast dish."

Keshava, who grows tomato in 30 guntas of land, has earned about Rs. 3 lakh in the last couple of weeks thanks to a sudden surge in the price of tomatoes.Five months ago, tomato growers in Salagame hobli of Hassan, were forced to sell tomato at as low as Rs. 20 per bag of 15 kg. Many growers threw tomatoes on the road and distributed it to the public free of cost. Things have changed now. We have never got this kind of price in the past for tomato, Keshava said. He has spent about Rs. 50,000 to grow tomato. He has so far sold 1,000 bags this season alone. The highest price he got was Rs. 700 per bag.Tomato is sold at anywhere between Rs. 60 and 80 per kg in cities like Bengaluru. Merchants, who purchase the produce from farmers in small towns, take it to big cities.We carry our produce to the market in Hassan once in two days. It is true that we may get a better price if we carry them to Bengaluru. But, it is difficult to travel to Bengaluru, said Somashekhar, a tomato grower.One of the reasons for this sudden surge in the price is scanty rainfall in many tomato growing areas. Many growers in Halebid hobli of Hassan suffered loss as there was no sufficient yield due to deficient rainfall.Only those farmers with private borewells could get a decent yield. With good care and sufficient water, a farmer can produce up to 2,000 bags (each of 15 kg) in one season.We would be happy even if we get up to Rs. 150 per bag. But, we dont get it all the time. The retail sellers get better margin than us. In this season, we have sold tomato for Rs. 300 to Rs. 700 per bag. Whatever we earn, we spend it back on the field and try to improve its productivity, Somashekhar said.The growers find it difficult to protect the crop from diseases during the rainy season.We can get a good crop only if we apply medicines regularly. We spend a lot on medicines, besides the labour, said Puttaraju, who has grown tomato in 10 guntas of land."

There was an immediate impact in the number of people requesting entry visas to travel to Spain, the director of the London office of Turespana, Enrique Ruiz de Lera, who led the agency's talks with the producers of the movie, told AFP.The year after its release, 60,444 Indians visited Spain, nearly double the 2011 figure, according to the industry and tourism ministry. Last year 85,000 Indians visited Spain.The movie that did itLonely Planet in 2013 launched a guide to Spain aimed specifically at the Indian market and travel agencies still advertise tours to the locations featured in the Zindagi movie.Indias ambassador to Spain, Vikram Misri, said the film was single-handedly responsible for making Spain a household name in India and increasing tourism from India.Turespana suggested locations for filming but gave no direct financial aid to cover the cost of making the movie, Ruiz de Lera said.Instead it helped secure permits to film at key sites and negotiate deals on hotel rooms and transportation for the crew to lower production costs.We helped a lot with contacts so filming in Spain was easy, Ruiz de Lera said.In return the producers of the film agreed to include a short advertisement before the start of the movie promoting Spain by award-winning Spanish director Julio Medem.Spain and India signed a film coproduction agreement the year after Zindagi was released.Turespana regularly takes part in film location fairs in India to pitch the tax breaks and other incentives available to movie producers who shoot in Spain.Since Zindagi , another five or six Indian films have been shot in Spain although none was as popular at the box office.

In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

A kilo of tomato at Bowenpally market was around Rs. 25 a kilo while Rythu Bazars also sold without hike on Friday. Additionally, quantity of arrivals at these markets belies production shortage which retail and farm sources claim.Gajanand, a wholeseller at Monda Market, attributed increased price to stock shortage as production was hit by pre-monsoon rains in Kurnool and producing regions in Telangana including those in Karimnagar.We are now getting our stock from Nasik and Bengaluru. The price last week was Rs. 35 per kilo, he said.Price of green chilli too has shot up in retail stores but larger markets are continuing to sell stock at half the price. While Gajanand said the price of green chilli was Rs. 70 a kilo, an employee at a retail store in Sainikpuri informed the price was hovering at Rs. 130. Shrivatsa Ganeriwal, a techie-turned-farmer, blamed the harsh March heat for a poor tomato harvest in June. It takes tomato seeds 90 to 120 days to reach harvest. A poor yield now implies inappropriate conditions at the time of sowing, combined with erratic rains in May. On my farm, we had to clear the last produce without selling it and plant afresh as the crop yield was very poor, he said."

Regular visitors to these vans include daily wage earners and office-goers. On any given day, the customers are able to choose a variety and have a sumptuous meal at an affordable price.The minimum we charge is Rs. 20 a plate. We serve a wide range of food items - tomato rice, curd rice, vada. We have it all, says Saraswathi, who is part of a self-help group that prepares and sells food out of mobile vans. The food is prepared at home, loaded in large containers, and taken to different locations.The sales used to be high when the concept of selling food out of vans started in the city. But now-a-days we are facing stiff competition. Nevertheless, we usually have an agreement among ourselves not to sell the same item, says the driver of a food van near GKNM Hospital. Another problem that the owners of these vans face is packets that remain unsold.They also say that sales are usually low during the summer months compared to the rest of the year. We get about 70 customers a day. The group members invested the initial funds. After that, they received financial support from the government. Now, it is a profitable venture, says Saraswathi.There are about 2,000 such vans in the city and many of them are run by women self-help groups. They need to get a licence for this from several departments. In any given location, only one mobile unit functions within one km radius.A. Mujibur Rahman and G. Shakila Begum, a couple from Edayarpalayam, sell food packets near Nehru Stadium. The concept of selling food packets in a mobile van started in the city a decade ago. It is becoming popular now as customers get a wide variety at prices lower than that of hotels, says Ms. Begum. Since food is prepared and served by a group or a family and there is a continuous demand, it is a profitable venture, she says.Like hotels, we do not need tables, chairs and fans. That is the reason why the price is lesser by Rs.5 to Rs.10 compared to hotels and we will not function on Sundays, she adds.Some serve non-vegetarian dishes too. At the beginning, we would cook meat around three kg. But customers order biryani more than any other variety, and now we cook 10 kg of meat every day.Some vans donate the remaining food to non-government organisations for distribution to the needy.(With inputs fromS.

Vegetables and spices are stored in steel utensils covered with plastic sheets to preserve their taste and flavour. Hands are washed with liquid soap. At the counter outside, two servers ladle vegetables or meat in a thick, oil-free gravy onto plates, while the fresh, hot chapattis pile up on dishes behind them. In the eating area, four men with gloves on wheel trolleys down the aisles between tables, clearing leftovers.If the description evokes a swanky eatery, think again; this is the Mumbai Polices new canteen in the recently inaugurated new headquarters building of the Mumbai Police that is currently breaking stereotypes.Mumbai Commissioner of Police D.D. Padsalgikar says, The idea was to provide healthy food for personnel working on the headquarters compound and nearby establishments, and any personnel posted on duty nearby or visiting the compound. A large number of our personnel suffer due to unhealthy food, and many of them dont have a lot of options. We are starting with this canteen and are planning to implement the same model in other police canteens.Senior Police Inspector Dilip Shinde, under whose supervision the canteen operates, adds, We have hundreds of police personnel coming in every day for breakfast, lunch and snacks in the evening , and the food is a runaway hit. With minor changes to our methods, we have ensured tasty yet healthy food.The canteen is managed by a 10-strong team of police personnel who oversee procurement and preparation, hygiene and day-to-day work. Instead of using readymade flour, we buy wheat in bulk and get it ground at flour mills near the headquarters. Vegetables and meat for the day are personally selected and bought every morning, instead of contracting a supplier and leaving quality to them, Head Constable Sanjay Patil said.The kitchen staff comprise relatives of policemen and contract workers from the catering industry, all trained by Rajendra Mahadik, a sous chef with the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Colaba.Mr. Mahadik says, The first thing I did was to take the canteen staff to our hotels kitchen to show them our methods. For the next six days, I taught them how to cut down on the two chief ingredients that lead to health problems if taken in excess: oil and salt. I taught the cooks little tricks like adding lesser amounts of salt to plain rice, as it is going to be consumed with dal or gravy.The staff are also instructed to clean the exhaust grills regularly to avoid fires due to a build-up of oil residue, and using different amounts of ingredients like onion, tomatoes and coconut for the same dishes to lend a different taste to the gravy. Wives of the police top brass, including those of Mr. Padsalgikar and Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti, visited the canteen and instructed the staff on the importance of hygienic and healthy food.The evening menu included samosas and onion pakoras. We dropped the samosas and replaced them with grilled vegetable sandwiches. The canteen makes it so well that a lot of us, including myself, order them regularly in the evening, Mr Bharti said.The response has been tremendous, especially during lunch among policemen, particularly constables. I have been conscious of the hygiene of the place I am eating in, and the new canteen ensures cleanliness, said Constable Shashikant Gangawane, posted at the headquarters."

However, these crops are unlikely to be recommended for release anytime soon, officials told The Hindu .As part of an ongoing case on GM crops in India, a Supreme Court Technical Expert Committee has already recommended a ban on HT crops.A coalition of activists, opposed to GM crops, proffered evidence to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) on Monday to show that GM mustard being tested was not superior in yield to existing mustard varieties.Weve heard them out and a sub-committee will look into the concernsbut these are not HT crops, said a GEAC official privy to the discussions. One of the genes is a marker used to differentiate hybrids from non-hybrids. It wont require more or less chemicals than existing mustard varieties, the official said.Beyond GEACs scopeAnother official, who also did not want to be identified, said issues of yield were beyond the scope of the GEAC. There are already other committees [within the agriculture system governance mechanism] tasked with looking at whether their yields are superior or they are fit for commercial release. So far, no fresh tests appear to be needed, the official said. The GEAC is an expert body of the Environment Ministry tasked with assessing if GM crops risk. While the body must approve every application to test GM crops, the most contentious crop on its table now is a type of mustard that contains three genes sourced from soil bacterium.It has had a tumultuous history with activists claiming that it would be a gateway to other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in fields. The GM mustard has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at the Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology."

A total crop area of around 45 acres was covered in which lights were put up at intervals of 60 metres each on bamboo poles at a height of about 8 feet. The lights were placed at the eye level of elephants so that they can see them from a long distance.Elephants did come to the field where paddy followed by cauliflowers, brinjals, tomatoes, potatoes, pumpkins, and bananas were grown. The big mammals kept waiting at a distance from lights, but did not invade the crop field.Similarly, lights were put up during the mango season from April to June 2016 at an orchard spread over 12 acres at Ganjara village near Hindol Forest Range and 20-acre orchard at Patusahi Kateni village in Dhenkanal district.I used to incur huge loss when a big elephant herd used to enter my orchards and damage mango trees. But this year, the lighting system helped keep elephants at bay, said Jugal Kishore Nayak, orchard owner at Patusahi Kateni.The light system has been designed based on our field experience with elephants and their habits. We knew that the elephants will be scared of flashing lights instead of fixed and powerful lights. We developed this design using low power LED bulbs used as strobes and decorative lights, said Biswajit Mohanty, Project Director, WPSI (Wildlife Protection Society of India), who devised the system.We are delighted with the preliminary results but still believe that repeat trials are necessary before we can advise farmers to adopt them, said Mr. Mohanty.He maintained, we will develop a prototype self-contained unit including an in-built solar charger which should be low cost, maintenance free and easily set up with minimum technical support. This should be popularised among affected farmers so that they can sleep peacefully instead of chasing elephants all night.In one worst kind of man-elephant conflicts, Odisha has lost more than 700 elephants and 700 people since 2004. During the same period, elephants trampled ready-to-harvest crops over 90,000 acres of land. The experiment assumes significance as elephants have now started coming out of forest round the year instead of during harvest season in the past."

Rajendran, Deputy Director, Horticulture, said they proposed to cultivate high density mango on 100 hectares, hybrid papaya, introduced for the first time in the district, on 70 hectares and high density guava on 20 hectares. The fruit cultivation would be taken up in S. Pudur, Singampunari, Sivaganga, Kallal and Tirupattur areas.The department, which organised block-level melas in the first week of this month, had selected about 700 farmers, he said adding these farmers were taught canopy management of high density crops in the seminar.The fruit saplings were ready at State Horticulture Farms at Devakottai and Nemam near Kundrakudi and the cultivation would begin in September ahead of northeast monsoon, he said.Mr. Rajendran said the department would organise a workshop on hi-tech horticulture at Kalayarkoil on August 18 to train farmers on cultivation using poly houses, shade nets, plastic mulching (to suppress weeds), anti-bird nets and protected cultivation practices of all crops.He said the department also proposed to cultivate hybrid vegetables, especially tomato, brinjal and green chillies on 120 hectares.The department had readied about 40 lakh seedlings and the farmers would be given an insight into the scheme at a seminar to be held at S Pudur on August 24.The department also proposed to cultivate cashew on about 100 hectares in Sakkottai, Devakottai and Kallal areas this year, he added."

A group of scientists explained the procedure to be adopted to check the wilt.R. Gnanamalar, Professor and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, said brinjal, cultivated on 600 hectares in the district, was prone to bacterial wilt attack. The problem was more pronounced in Vallakulam Kothakottai village near Tiruvarangulam. She said continuous raising of brinjal, without crop rotation technique, often resulted in the problem. She advised farmers to adhere to crop rotation technique by planting cereals such as sorghum or pearl millet (kambu). Maize and cotton could also be raised.R. Manimekalai, Programne Coordinator, said water-logging was another problem leading to the bacterial wilt. She said the bacteria also infected chillies, ginger, radish and tomato crops.A demonstration was conducted in which scientists explained the symptoms of wilt and steps to control them. S.

Babu. The field day was organised by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), whose researchers have developed the hybrid.Arka Rakshak is being sought after by farmers in different States and a few foreign countries owing to its high-yielding potential, wherein farmers have collected 19 kg a plant. Another attraction is its resistance to diseases such as leaf curl virus, bacterial wilt and early blight, which helps reduce cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards cost of fungicides and pesticides, according to scientists. The third advantage is long shelf-life which makes it ideal for long distance transportation.G.

Now, there is no such facility, says B. Narasimhulu, a trader from Sattupalli.Petty vendors worst-hitPetty vendors are the worst-hit.

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMThe soaring mercury levels have made vegetables dearer.Most housewives across the city, who are braving the summer heat in their kitchens, have been forced to contend with the rising price of vegetables. The price of beans has almost doubled in the last one month, while tomatoes, green chilli, capsicum, cabbage, and coriander leaves too have become expensive, according to sources in HOPCOMS (Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society) in Mysuru.Worse, housewives find the shelf life of vegetables annoyingly short. Many vegetables become dry and tasteless within 24 hours, particularly if they are not refrigerated.Mysuru HOPCOMS president Bore Gowda told The Hindu that the increase in prices and shorter shelf life were a summer phenomenon. Poor rainfall leads to a slump in production.President of the Devaraja Market Vegetable Vendors Association, Dinesh, said there had been a dip in the volume of vegetables arriving in the market, while demand has increased. Most people, including non-vegetarians, preferred vegetarian dishes during summer, he said.Mr. Gowda, however, hoped the prices would come down after the rains."

Today, the Noida boy doesnt want to come down. No, not from the treesfrom the roof of the world. At 23, Arjun has climbed four 8000 metre peaks, a world record, and is now eager to complete the grand slam by scaling 14 such peaks. People often ask me, dont you feel lonely there, I say, I feel at home. My soul takes me there. Here the society has been given to me. Mountaineers get to pick their own social group and then they work towards a common goal, says Arjun, who has just returned from Nepal after climbing Mt. Makalu, the fifth highest mountain in the world.In fact, Arjun says, one of discussions that mountaineers often indulge in is how the society looks at them. People often say why we go through this kind of suffering. I say people in cities lead a physically comfortable life but mentally their lives are stressed. In the mountains, we are physically uncomfortable but there is complete peace of mind. Physical stress will pass but memories will stay forever. We humans dont have the capacity of unlearning experiences. We can pretend but they stay somewhere.Profound words from a boy who refuses to read books because they carry someone elses experiences. It is another matter that he has penned his own experience of scaling the Mount Everest in On Top of the World: My Everest Adventure. Like a character of a page turner, he wants to live a life where every few months he is on the edge, where he doesnt know what lies at the next turn. Like every explorer, I want to be at the outermost rim of the society from where I want to reach where nobody has been there before. Most virgin peaks are in India and if you can climb them, you can name them, gushes Arjun, now sounding more like his age.We meet at Made In India, the fine dining restaurant of Noidas Radisson Blu and one is eager to know what does he eat up there. With watermelon juice in hand, Arjun recounts, the process starts with drinking lots of water to get acclimatised to the low oxygen levels. White ice has lot of air content, so as soon as we reach the base camp we look for blue ice to satiate our thirst. One is expected to drink at least five litres of water a day. Arjun also carries specialised stoves which run on butane gas to heat pre-cooked food and water. The problem is the water has to be boiled and over a period of time it takes away the ability to taste from taste buds. To resuscitate them, Arjun carries his mothers lehsun ka tikhat (garlic chutney), which is super spicy. It has lot of zing. Then I carry namkeen and nutcrackers which are very popular among my fellow climbers from Austria, Spain and China. In return Arjun gets lots of chocolates, which are gold in higher altitude region. Europeans offer exquisite cheese, speck and salami and the Chinese come up with octopus meat and dried fish.Here the chef comes up with non vegetarian kabab platter to spice up our conversation. Arjun starts with galauti and soon polishes off tilasmi mahi tikka as well before telling us how, at times, one has to go back to primitive ways of food collection as well. During the descent from Makalu, when we started from the base camp the weather suddenly deteriorated and the helicopter could not reach us for three days. During this period we had to capture lambs from the wild and consumed fresh mutton to keep going.The real challenge, though, begins once they leave the base camp for the peak. The supply of fresh food dries up and they have to rely on ready-made noodles, dry fruits and chocolates. Here training comes to the rescue as from 10000 to 12000 calories in a day the food consumption comes down to 3000-4000 calories. There is extreme weight loss. The altitude is so severe that you dont like eating. We carry dry fruits and lots of chocolates  things that give instant energy because body needs carbohydrates. In his expeditions, Arjun, trained at Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, has lost 9 to 18 kilos in two months. That is why in my resting period I just eat and sleep, he chuckles.To counter the effect of weight loss on climbing ability, Arjun gains a lot of weight before going for the expedition. It is to ensure that there is no muscle loss. In the training you have to develop muscles and over that the right amount of fat. I gain fat towards the end of the training so that it doesnt stay on the body for long. However, the weight gain should not be at the cost of endurance levels. Thats why all along we try to simulate the environment that my body is going to face at 25-26000 feet. However, in the same vein, Arjun adds that physical exercise can take you only up to a point and after that mind takes over. You cant train for every challenge. After a point you have to leave it for the mind. It does wonders. It defines us as human beings. During the Nepal earthquake, I was on the way to Mt. Makalu and I had only 12 cashew nuts left. I had to convince myself that I have to survive on one nut a day.For him, says Arjun, who also gives motivational talk in corporate houses, a mountain is like a living entity, whom one should not challenge without proper preparation. Has he given them a gender as well? Oh yes! The kind of mood swings they have, they have to be female. Most mountaineers would agree with me. Thats why in Hindu and Buddhist mythology they have been named after goddesses.On the lighter side, Arjun, now digging into jhinga kali mirch, says he often gets fed up with the watery Nepali dal and undercooked vegetables. So the moment I reach home, I ask my mother to prepare karhi chawal and aloo ka parantha. He is adept at cooking as well. I can survive. I am good at curries, something my fellow climbers love to try. Because only Indian curry has tomato puree and ginger paste. But sometimes, it gets too spicy for my Chinese and Spanish friends and they have to often rush to the makeshift loo.After a months break, Arjun will return to training. He is aiming at K2 but before that he wants to climb Kanchenjunga and Annapurna. It is not about the height alone. Climbing a mountain is like solving a puzzle. Over the years, the riddle of Mount Everest has almost been solved. No Indian has climbed K2 yet. In terms of terrain it offers a different kind of challenge. Its base camp is almost 1000 metre lower than of Mount Everests. So you need to have better stamina. Annapurna has a higher fatality rate. There is a gully where avalanches get triggered very easily.Very much like the kulfi on our plate. As I also get to break some ice literally, Pahari, as Arjuns friends call him, has the last word for young climbers. It is not an expensive sport, to begin with. I have done 6000 metre backpack climbs within 10-12000 rupees. Also it is the only sport for which the government has created a separate category. So give it due respect. Dont fake the results and dont depend on sherpas to push you up. It creates a bad name for Indian mountaineering community. In my second attempt at Makalu, I had to return when I was just 60-70 metres away from the peak. I wore a 3D spot detector, so that everybody would know my position. I returned and climbed it on the fourth attempt. In our society, a mountaineers word has lot of respect and we have to live up to it."

Since 2013, scientists have been experimenting with outdoor cultivation at two sites with areas of approximately 550 and 420 square metres in Chongqing, where scientists simulated desert landform conditions.The scientists said the plants survived the heavy rain and high temperatures, the typical climate conditions in Chongqing. The crops, including rice, corn and potatoes, flourished in the converted soil.  PTI"

58f76824a3d24b0b70c3487e,Super sesame,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/super-sesame/article8118802.ece,2016-01-18,,The Hindu,"In Mumbai, sesame comes into its own in til laddoos and chikkis, offered during Sankranti with the words  til gud ghya, god god bola  (eat sweet and speak sweet). But going beyond these popular sweets and the culinary versatility of sesame will thrill the cook in you. Sesame indicum , the cultivated type, which originated in India, continues to be an ingredient of significance today.A wonderful ingredient, sesame is extremely versatile, lending itself to both sweet and savoury dishes. Sprinkle it whole on salads, or knead into chapati dough. Make spice mixes to fortify the flavour and health of your meals. One sprinkle Im hooked to is gomasio, a condiment from Japan, in which toasted sesame is ground coarsely with salt. I just combine coarse sea salt and toasted sesame in a bottle and keep it within reach. Its perfect with anything from a simple bowl of brown rice to salads, noodles, steamed vegetables, even khichdi. Another favourite is the Middle Eastern zaatar (a mix of herbs and spices), a condiment popularly combined with olive oil and smeared on flat bread. Zaatar is also used to flavour meat and vegetables dishes, on labneh (a thick hung yogurt cheese) or fried eggs as a garnish. I toast sesame with dried thyme and salt and grind with amchur instead of the sumac that is traditionally used but not easily found in India. It works perfectly on naans, kulchas, and in raitas. I also like to sprinkle it on chunks of paneer or chicken and grill them.Grinding toasted sesame opens up many more options. Although south India is best known for its use of sesame, I discovered, after I married into a Garhwali family, that the cuisine of Uttarakhand uses a lot of ground sesame in its winter dishes. Crushed sesame adds a nutty accent to lobia khichdi. The piquant khatte aloo is made of potatoes tossed in yogurt, toasted sesame and chillies. And then there is addictive til ki chutney in which toasted sesame is ground with toasted cumin, ginger, green chillies, and the juice of the bada nimbu (large wild lemons that come into season in the winter). Another lovely dish is the earthy pinni ka saag that is made from pinni or compressed seed cakes left over from the oil extraction process of sesame. With the oil removed, these become extremely high in protein and dietary fibre. Grind sesame until it gives forth oil and you get tahini or sesame butter, a staple ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. Stir it into soups, or dips, or add honey to make a quick spread for toast or dip for fruit. I am endlessly confounded that we have been pressing sesame for oil for millennia but never thought of toasting the seed prior to extracting its oil, something that the rest of Asia has savoured for centuries. Toasted sesame oil is the most magical ingredient. The roasting process intensifies the inherent flavour of sesame and is used more as a condiment or flavouring oil. It quickly grows into being indispensible: drizzle over fried eggs, add to vinaigrettes for a delicious variation, swirl a few drops into soups it pairs well with any flavour but is especially good with Asian, tomato and clear soups.And we already know sesames nutty flavours work wonderfully in sweet dishes; our laddoos and chikkis are testimony to this. But sesame is also popular in sweets around the world. In the Middle East you will find sesame halva; which, unlike Indian halvas, come in large dry blocks from which portions are sliced off. They literally melt into a nutty, sweet toffee and glide down your throat. Addictive! In Asian cuisine, a favourite dessert is the sweet black sesame soup of Cantonese cuisine. Asian supermarkets worldwide usually carry instant mix packets but I have made it at home by boiling crushed black sesame or toasted unhusked sesame with water, sweetened with honey or jaggery. It is a great dessert for children.We should be eating a lot more of this super food, not just saving it for festive occasions.If you hate milk like I do, sesame offers a great substitute with three times the calcium content of milk. Plus, one tablespoon of sesame contains 52 calories, 88 mg calcium, 1.3 mg iron and 32 mg magnesium. Why look to the west for health-boosting foods when we are so fortunate in our own home-grown bounty?(The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That )"
58f76b65a3d24b0b70c34a2c,On an organic quest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/on-an-organic-quest/article8635129.ece,2016-05-23,,The Hindu,"Theres an annoying self-satisfied swagger about hipster organic stores; the ones with artfully-lit, Instagram-ready baskets of fastidiously rustic fruit. Exotic vegetables flaunting back-stories more romantic than anything you could ever find on Tinder. Boasting of lovingly hand-pounded, responsibly made, locally-grown, ethically produced, vegan, wild honey-laced breakfast cereals that taste like diligently toasted sand.Lets not even get started on their star customers, swathed in overpriced ethnic handloom, diamonds and self-congratulatory smugness. They dexterously manage to post virtuous Facebook updates about changing the world, one organic carrot at a time, even as they fill their baskets with home-grown quinoa, designer ghee and gently wilting broccoli.Indias burgeoning organic food market, slated to grow by 30 per cent every year, offers wide variety today: ranging from the stolidly indigenous to wildly exotic. With bohemian chic farmers markets springing up in every big city, and swish neighbourhood stores advertising responsibly-grown produce, it has never been easier to eat clean and simultaneously assuage our conscience. After all, if its good for us, it must be good for the planet, right? As for that hefty price tag? Well, clever marketing has us convinced that good food cannot possibly be cheap. Granted, most people who are going organic now are doing it with genuinely good intentions. However, in a trend-obsessed world, it is easy to get overwhelmed.If you truly want to change the way you eat, what should you be looking for? Choitresh Kumar Ganguly of the Timbaktu Collective seems like the ideal person to ask. The collective, which works in over 150 villages in drought-prone Anantapur, has taken unproductive land and, using organic farming, transformed it into fields of flourishing millets over the last 25 years.Ganguly begins by emphasising how important it is to eat food that is indigenous. Millets, for example. Foxtail barnyard millets grow in high-lying marshes as well as low-lying deserts. They are climate-resilient and can survive on very low rainfall. Since these are local species, theyre also rarely attacked by pests.As for that organic quinoa, carefully imported and grown in India? Its all bull, he snorts. Thats the tragedy of us Indians. We dont give importance to what we already have.Remember that any imported seed needs protection, since it is not naturally immune to the local environment and pests. Over a few thousand years, they become resilient, like our chillies, potatoes and tomatoes. But in the meantime, it may destroy a lot of our vegetation by activating pests, or affecting our pollination system.So how do you define organic? The primary meaning, to me, is when all the inputs are produced by the farmer himself or herself. From seed to fertilizer to pesticide everything.After all, natural is an easy term to manipulate: bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides are technically natural too. When the farmer controls the entire process, using dung from village cattle, neem cakes and local earthworms, its a simpler, cleaner, and more straightforward process. It also means that the farmer has full control. Sovereignty is what is important here.Your next step? Cut out the middleman. As a consumer, you should know who is producing your food. Most of the people selling organic food are aggregators; they have little or no contact with the actual farmers. Conventional certification is not always reliable. We have been fighting against third-party certification. All kinds of scams can happen and it is very expensive.Instead, they use a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) where groups of farmers guarantee each others produce. (The Government of India has recently introduced PGS as well.) So look for PGS on produce that you buy.Even better, get to know your farmer. Its increasingly easy these days, as more urban city slickers are swapping their laptops for shovels.Like 51-year-old S. Madhusudhan, who gave up a high-powered corporate career to start a farm six years ago in Bengaluru, after he collapsed in his office. That was my wake-up call, he says, discussing how he taught himself organic farming. My best teachers were Google, Wikipedia and YouTube. Over the past six years, he has tended about 200 acres at Back2Basics, lavishing his land with equal amounts of care and gobar (cow dung) slurry. We use about 24,000 litres of gobar slurry per acre. We use oil seed cakes made with neem, honge and sesame. We used a bore, and struck water at 550 feet. Today, after rainwater harvesting, its risen to 50 feet. I truly believe that the land returns what you give to it. Economically, he says, there is no reason for organic food to be more expensive. I sell a coconut at Rs. 19. The market price is Rs. 30. How do I do it? I just cut out the middleman.His farm has been so successful that he recently launched a service supplying customers with freshly-harvested produce.

The bunny was born of South African apartheid, a time when blacks and whites werent allowed to dine together. It took the enterprising wiles of an Indian businessman in Durban to invent the bunny chow, a cheap, nourishing take-away dish for poor black customers.

Nestled within each plump, meticulously-braided crescent of pizza dough is a mound of mozzarella and tomatoes; the whole thing is then baked until the crust turns pale gold in colour. The beauty of the calzone is that almost anything can be used as filling  cold cuts, anchovies, capers, eggs, whatever you like.

Today, of course, hot dog stands are everywhere  at baseball games, at amusement parks, on busy streets, serving juicy pork sausage spiked with garlic and slick with mustard, ketchup and pickle relish, all resting on a cushion of bread. Thats the classic, but wherever you go in North America, youll find different takes: dogs with coleslaw, dogs with chilli sauce, dogs with avocados and refried beans (surprisingly good), even dogs with fries and cheese i.e. a poutine dog if you will. In Mumbai, you get hot dogs everywhere and most come with a sweet relish and caramelised onions such as at Versovas Jam Jar Diner.

Poutines kind of a hot mess (the word literally means mess, a gadbad or ghotala ), a nest of slightly thick-cut fries drenched in an avalanche of warm, brown gravy and cheese curds, and naturally, the best way to eat it is to throw away your fork and knife and plunge your fingers into the scrum.

But it was much later, in the 1940s, that entrepreneurs discovered that the tortilla, when folded over and fried, lasted longer and tasted better. And thus was born the taco of today  a fellowship of wheat or corn flour shell with a heap of charred meat or seafood, smothered in salsa and topped with finely-chopped onion, cilantro and tomatoes.

The reason: prices have hit the roof with a reduction in their arrival into the market.Tomato is a most-used vegetable, like onions, and its skyrocketing prices had made it unaffordable.Drought and extreme heat are stated to be the reasons for fall in production triggering the price rise.Tomato is priced at Rs. 35 a kilo in the wholesale market while it is sold at Rs. 50-60 in the retail market. The hybrid variety costs Rs. 10 more.Some wholesale vegetable merchants said the prices will go further as the supply has been declining.Even the quality of the produce that is arriving to the markets is poor.Villages in a 30-km radius of Mysuru, T Narsipur, parts of Nanjangud, Gundlupet, and Nagamangala are among the prominent tomato-growing areas.Eshwar, a wholesale vegetable trader said, There is a wide gap in the demand and supply and this triggered price rise. Drought and blazing summer heat are to be blamed for the drop in production.Mahadevaswamy, another vegetable dealer, said tomato prices are unlikely to stabilise for the next two months. The prices are on the higher side since over a month.Santosh, who runs a mobile vegetable business, said consumers are bearing the brunt of the price rise. The quantum of purchase had been cut down by the consumers to deal with the price rise.As tomato has minimal shelf life, the retailers are averse to procure the veggie in large quantity over its high price.We dont want to lose and therefore procure tomato in small quantity until the prices stabilise, said a representative of a grocery shop, which also sells vegetables and fruits.Due to the high prices, its use in the kitchen had been cut down and tamarind paste, a substitute to tomato, is being used."

Photo: By Arrangementhe farmers of Akkamapally, who hardly used to make ends meet a decade ago cultivating dry crops, have now transformed their village into an horticulture hub of Telangana State.Thanks to construction of Akkamapally Balancing Reservoir (AKBR) at their village and a good thought by farmer Dereddy Krishna Reddy, considered the father of horticulture cultivation at Akkamapally, the face of the entire village was changed.Ivy gourd is being cultivated in over 80 per cent of the land (400 acres) from where they export vegetables to even Andhra Pradesh markets apart from various parts of Telangana.The farmers have been earning about Rs. 20,000 income a month on each acre of Ivy Guard cultivation. Krishna Reddy, who introduced ivy gourd, is now earning about Rs. 1.5 lakh a month by cultivating the crop on his 10 acres of land.In 2014, the farmers of the village formed Akkamapally Horticulture Growers Society (AHGS) to discuss and deliberate about new crops and market strategies to be adopted to sell their produce at a best price.A team from the village visited the Indian Institute of Species Research, Calicut in 2014 and started cultivating ginger from then on.Speaking to The Hindu , a farmer, Bashapaka Pavan Kumar, said the leaders from Andhra Pradesh had said that Telangana State would face shortage of vegetables once the State was divided. But we have made Telangana proud since we regularly export ivy gourd to Macherla, Narasaraopet and Guntur vegetable markets apart from Hyderabad, Warangal, Khammam, Kalwakurthy, Shaadnagar and Nalgonda, he said.The farmers of Akkamapally rotate crop. According to a rough estimate, the turnover only from ivy gourd cultivation in the village is about Rs. 25 crore in a year.The farmers also cultivate a variety of other horticulture crops such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, chilli, tomato, ginger, drumstick and others. Since the village is located between Guntur and Hyderabad, 100 km away from both the places, the farmers take their produce to markets in either of the places only after enquiring about the market price which avoids any involvement of middlemen.Drawing inspiration from Akkamapally, farmers from neighbouring villages  Medaram, Gudipally, Vaddipatla, G. Bheemanapally, Yellapuram and Polkapally  have also started cultivating various horticulture crops. The village has plenty of water since the construction of AKBR, and the groundwater table has also increased considerably.The AGHS has urged the State government to construct a vegetable market near their village to help them sell their produce apart from building a cold storage to help them store the vegetables, when there is fall in price.Assistant Director, Horticulture, G. Yugandhar and MPDO K. Narasimhulu suggest the farmers from other places in the district to visit Akkamapally village to learn how cultivation can be made profitable."

We see a carnivore ripping apart a rabbit, which we then realise is our protagonist narrating the story. Its a part of a modern-day play and the only animal-killing-animal that happens is on the stage, the only blood being spilled is tomato ketchup. The animal kingdom has left behind its dark, primitive days far behind. The tone of Zootopia is set, unexpected and snappy.The film doesnt take much time to make it clear that everything in it is meant to mirror the society created by humans. This nascent world is peaceful on the surface. But beneath, forces such as fear and prejudices are at play.Our protagonist Judy Hopp is an optimistic, idealistic Disney character (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to make the world a better place. She creates history by overcoming all odds and societal pressures to becoming the first bunny cop. A naive, righteous village girl leaves her native land to go join the police force in the city  the shiny, model city of Zootopia that, amidst its glass and mirror architecture, has districts that maintain controlled natural habitats.An important action sequence, for example, takes place in the Rainforest district. Hopp befriends a fox (Nick Wilde, a rogue character with a heart of gold, voiced by Jason Bateman), who isnt as straight as we think when we first meet him. And then there are battles at the workplace that she faces as a rabbit, especially from her immediate boss Chief Bogo (a buffalo, voiced by Idris Elba) and we read it as a message for sexism.Most of the times, it is fun to see our world through these anthropomorphic characters. Directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush and the writers never allow the material to get too sentimental or saccharine. It is simple, despite the familiar tropes at play, moves briskly and has a progressive intention.The humour, of course, is essential in this kind of a movie. There are the Godfather , Breaking Bad references, there is Zoogle, there are anti-Fox pepper sprays, a sultry pop star Gazelle (rhymes with Adele but voiced by Shakira) and there is also an overtly catholic skunk mafia boss who is served by intimidating polar bears.But the standout set-piece is that the Department of Motor Vehicles is run by sloths. Stepping inside that office means slowing of time. Its a riot when Jude, who has a few hours left to save his job by solving a criminal case, helplessly tries to extract information from an officer. The subtle ironical connection between sloths and superfast cars is later revealed in an expository fashion.In retrospect, questions pop up about the world of Zootopia . Is the entire Zootopia vegetarian? Have they given up on eating fellow animals for the sake of harmony? The only things they are shown eating are carrots and blueberries. The references to the past are at a very broad level  the only thing we are told repeatedly is that predators have sobered over 1,000 years of evolution, that foxes are shifty, and that there is an underpinning tension between the furries and the savage predators.But there is little iceberg beneath these tips, little fictionalised history to this animal world. Humans are never acknowledged. It is a big suspension of disbelief. Neither is this a science fiction film, nor does it have the bite of a satire. Thats the reason Zootopia doesnt go to the wild blue yonder. But we never ask questions while watching it as it is a fun ride.SANKHAYAN GHOSH"

The demand-supply dynamics has been causing misery to the cultivators for a month now.The price has been fluctuating between Rs. 10 and Rs. 5. According to tomato traders, several farmers have left the tomato crop on their fields to wither or let cattle graze on the produce due to the unremunerative price.A daily wage of Rs. 400 has to be paid to a farm worker and the transport costs in addition would otherwise cause heavier loss to the cultivators, a trader said.Horticulture Department officials say the price fluctuation for perishables was not unusual.In the case of tomato, the average cost of cultivation is Rs. 25,000 an acre, and the productivity ranges from 10 tonnes to 12 tonnes an acre. Farmers could evade loss if the price of tomato is in the range of Rs. 10 per kg, but below that level, the loss is bound to be heavy, official sources said.Since the price is Rs. 5 at the retail point, the field rate would not exceed Rs. 3 a kg, thereby pushing the cultivators to distress situation of letting cattle graze on the field rather than spend on harvesting, the sources said, adding that there is no solution in sight since even if the scope processing tomato is explored, the culture of consuming packaged tomato is not prevalent."

Authorities, however, at the time of supply of seed advised farmers not to grow one single vegetable as excessive yield would not fetch them profitable price. They suggested the farmers to plant three to four varieties of vegetables, but to no avail. Deputy Director (Horticulture) N. Sunanda told The Hindu that tomato cultivation increased by 15 per cent in the district this time resulting in more yield. Naturally, the price would come down with more supply. Similar is the case with the onion, she said."

File Photosfter the curtain call of Sherlock Holmes and the Adventures of the Speckled Band at Akshara Theatre on Sunday, director and theatre co-founder Gopal Sharman came onto the stage and informed the audience that the theatre needed financial help or it would have to be shut down.The venue, a hub for theatre lovers for the past 44 years, has received a notice informing that the theatres lights will go off if the pending electricity bill of Rs.3 lakh is not paid off by March 15.Mr. Sharman asked for help and struck an emotional chord with the audience.A young member of the audience suggested that the theatre start a crowd-funding campaign online. BitGiving, a platform that helps raise funds and had most recently raised Rs.60 lakh to prevent Friendicoes from shutting down, has started a campaign on the behalf of Akshara.The goal is to raise Rs.5 lakh in 30 days to keep the lights on, and enjoy many more plays, shows and home-made tomato soup that the theatre is know to serve after the performances.Speaking about the theatres s situation, co-founder Jalabala Vaidya, whose solo performance of The Ramayana had helped raise funds to build the theatre, said at first the group used to tour abroad and within the country, which brought in money to keep the space running. However, lately the costs began to gallop so fast that they could not keep up.It has been a hard struggle as we are a family-run theatre group that does not have access to government funds.Ms. Vaidya feels that performing arts have managed to keep the identity of Indian people and society alive, and if it was not for the arts, the individuality and uniqueness of our culture would not have survived for so many years. She hopes the government will step forward to encourage the performing arts and keep them alive.The theatre has been home to many young theatre groups and college students. Some have even discovered their love for acting during summer workshops organised at the venue.Theatre actor and director Karam Vir Lamba said: For years, Akshara remained a very small group of affordable performance venues in Delhi. It is a welcome refuge for aspiring artists and creative minds that have needed a space to experiment and share their work. Most importantly, the owners of the establishment have always run it with a genuine love and passion for the arts.Speaking about its current situation, he feels that its closing, should it come to pass, will not only be tragic, but further evidence that the flickering flame of culture in this city, which is in desperate need of love and nurturing, is steadily dying.Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right now, the actor added.Tanima Dey, who was visiting the venue for an event on Friday, said upon learning that the theatre may be forced to shut down: It is such an active space, an oasis in the heart of the city. I am sure those passionate about the arts will not let the lights fade out. I am looking forward to many more lively evenings discussing a performance over some tomato soup.The crowd-funding campaign can be found at www.bitgiving.com/aksharatheatre .Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right nowKaram Vir LambaActorSince 1972, we ran Akshara with the money we earned from performances across the world.
