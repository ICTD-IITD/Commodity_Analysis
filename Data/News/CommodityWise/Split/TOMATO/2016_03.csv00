Traders and experts blamed poor supply of almost all kitchen essentials for the surge and have ruled out a price correction any time soon because of rain-related problems of supply and spoilage. The supply of vegetables continues to be about half of the usual arrival, said Anna Gule, in charge of the fruits and vegetables sub-section at the city's Agriculture Produce Market Committee.""The monsoon has arrived, but that has so far not translated into a sizeable stock reaching the city. So far, the drought-affected crop is being harvested and received. Crop sown now will be better, but that will reach the city only after a month or so. Green leafy vegetables, though, could see a price correction faster. Thankfully, the rain is good so far. So, there is a hope for a good harvest,"" he said.In the retail market, vegetables like tomato, ginger, green chillies and even beans, capsicum, cauliflower and ladyfinger continue to command high rates. Good quality tomato is still selling for almost Rs 80 per kg in most areas. Beans, too, have not registered a price correction and are being sold for almost Rs 70 per kg, while vegetables like cauliflower and ladyfinger are selling at more than Rs 50 per kg. Green leafy vegetables are being sold at premium rates as well. While a standard bunch of coriander is commanding Rs 25, fenugreek is going for Rs 20 a bunch.The rates are unlikely to fall any time soon, Rajendra Sahu, a vegetable retailer, estimated.Customers don't have a choice but to buy the vegetables, even at high rates. ""The only change is that people are cutting down their purchases,"" Sahu said.Asha Patel, a tiffin provider from NIBM Road, is hoping prices fall soon. ""Before buying vegetables, I have to think if it will upset my monthly budget. Actually, I have stopped buying tomatoes as I just can't afford them any more. The government doesn't seem at all concerned about things that affect the common man,"" he said."

Vinay.Talking to press persons at Paraipatti village near Sempatti on Wednesday, he said traditional varieties would be protected as it could be used by farmers again and again and stocked for their future use. Farmers would be roped in to raise these varieties in their field to produce seeds of these varieties and preserve them, he added.With limited water sources and shortage of labour, poly house has become the ideal option for horticulturists to get better yield and profit in a small area of land. Poly house helped farmers overcome shortage of water and labour.These progressive farmers not only adopted latest technologies but also used hybrid seeds to get better yield on small area. Farmers have been raising cucumber, tomato and other vegetables in poly houses, he pointed out.Vertical farming method under weather-controlled atmosphere helped them harvest large quantity of cucumber. They have been earning decent income in 140 days."

These items were available at a price band of Rs 120 to Rs 150 per kg depending on the quality of the commodity.Likewise, Jagdish Prasad, who has been in the retail vegetable business for over two decades said the trend will continue for the next two months. ""Short supply of vegetables to the market and limited stock with retailers has led to the spurt,"" Prasad said.Another shopkeeper, Kailash, said quite a few varieties of vegetables that are supplied from the surrounding districts and adjoining West Bengal are available at modest prices. ""Commodities such as potato, pumpkin, bottle gourd, that are supplied from surrounding districts, are available at reasonable prices,"" Kailash said.The consumers, however, are complaining. ""We have no option but to buy cheaper vegetables. We are adding more and more potato dishes to our meals,"" 55-year-old NML employee, SK Deo, a Sidhgora resident, said.Mamata Pathak, a Kadma resident, thought vegetable vendors have a role to play in the price rise.

But, growing up in Midnapore, he didn't have a daak naam (nickname), that most endearing of Bengali traditions. Doesn't matter. His fans have given him one. To them, he is Bangali Babu.In the labyrinth that is Itwari , street-style sandwiches are synonymous with Bangali Babu. From 4pm to 11.30pm, his modified rickshaw, and the knot of customers around it, further constrict the already clogged Dharaskar Galli . On offer are five-six varieties of sandwich , some of which have decidedly curious names. (more on this later). He even serves a veggie pizza topped with crispy vermicelli and fresh herbs. Okay, okay, with 'sev' and coriander leaves.""I started 15 years ago. My circumstances weren't very good then. Now this has turned things around,"" he says, turning sandwiches around on the hot tawa.A typical sandwich gets a slathering of butter, green chutney, tomato sauce and cheese spread before the filling and sev is added to it. The 'garam' version is then toasted with more butter on the tawa. Once ready, it is buried under a blizzard of grated cheese, sprinkled with coriander leaves and grated carrot and served on newspaper squares.His pizza-making process - Bangali Babu calls it 'technology' - is equally interesting. To 'bake' the pizza without an oven, he places a perforated steel disc on the prepared base and places the whole thing upside down on the hot tawa for a few minutes until the cheese has melted.Students, local residents and businessmen are his biggest chunk of customers. He also takes pride in the fact that he gets some high-profile guests, including union minister Nitin Gadkari (who is something of a patron saint for popular eatery owners in the city).Bangali Babu might revel in the attention today, but it wasn't always like this. Thirty-one years ago, but in what seems like another life, he completed a course in first aid from Midnapore. In 1987, came to Nagpur to escape poverty and 'do something on my own'. ""I assisted a gynaecologist for a few years. But since I was always interested in cooking, I started working as an assistant cook in a restaurant,"" he remembers, adding that his financial condition still remained precarious.""I decided on sandwiches since this was something that I could manage on my own,"" he says. ""The Bombay sandwich is a common recipe, but the rest, I developed on my own. I keep thinking about new flavour combinations all the time,"" he says. He tests out the new recipes on 8-10 regular customers and only after getting feedback does he add it to the menu.So, which sandwiches has he created? ""Tichkule,"" he says, cryptically. Relishing the quizzical look this elicits, he goes on: ""There was this character called Sachin Tichkule, played by Akshay Kumar, in the movie 'Khatta Meetha'. This sandwich is also khatta meetha (tangy) and fills you with energy. Hence the name,"" he explains.Another of his creations is 'moov'. Quizzical look, check. The explanation? ""That is because, like the relaxing cream, this sandwich also relaxes you and comforts you,"" he adds.For someone who didn't have a nickname of his own, Tapas Chakraborty aka Bangali Babu has come a long way. Even his sandwiches have daak naam now.(This occasional column looks at some of the old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved. Do you know of any?

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato cultivator in Kolar."

The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already written to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology.Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Mr Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.If the Government of India approves GM crops such as GM mustard which is an important crop for States like Bihar, the State will not be able to escape the consequences of the technology as we are also the leading producer of honey in India and honey production depends on mustard crop, he said.He urged the Prime Minister to see that no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, which can harm the interest of farmers and the people of India at large.The interested parties are trying to push in an unproven technology. The States must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on the farmers, he said.The government of India should mandatorily consult and seek no objection from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop, Mr Kumar urged Mr Modi.He also sought the Prime Ministers intervention to see that the attempt to commercially release genetically modified mustard variety in the country should not proceed any further without prior consultation and consent of the state government. - PTI"

There is a lack of cash flow in small businesses, which has reduced the income.

V. S.

He wondered why Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was advising bankers not to give gold loans to farmers. He asked in what capacity the Chief Minister was making such recommendations to banks. Nothing short of a parliamentary Act could prevent bankers from giving gold loans to farmers, he said. The Principal Secretary was on the other hand contradicting the Chief Minister by telling the bankers that farmers were resorting to suicide because the banks were not giving them loans.The Chief Minister was ordering law enforcement officers to invoke the PD Act to curb trivial crime, but was not suggesting the same for persons involved in sale of adulterated agricultural inputs even though they were affecting several lives.Mr. Nagireddy said that onion crop had been raised in 30,000 hectares in the State, but farmers were being forced to dump it on the road side because there were not getting remunerative price. The situation was the same with tomato farmers. While 50 per cent of the mandals in the State were experiencing drought, the State government had not even written a letter to the Centre appraising it of the pathetic situation. Spurious seed was another factor that was affecting the farmers."

Judge Sanjay Patil sentenced Jitendra Dedhia (48), owner of a grocery shop in Parel, who had ordered the hit after his wife refused to divorce him.Dedhia had an affair with the sister-in-law of his wife, Beena, and wanted to marry her. Also, sentenced to life were the attackers -Nazim Khan and Hasruddin Malik.The trio was found guilty of the murder last Wednesday after which the court had posted the case for Mondayfor the sentencing. Special public prosecutor Rohini Salian sought the life sentence for the accused on the ground that, in keeping with the Supreme Court's guidelines, the case did not fall in the `rarest of rare' category to warrant the death sentence.The victim's sister-inlaw, who had also been made an accused in the case initially, was discharged by the Bombay high court a few years ago. A third accused, Rajnikant Wagh, a vegetable vendor who had introduced the killers to Jitendra, was acquitted by the court.The case initially garnered huge sympathy for Jitendra as he had made the crime appear like a chainsnatching incident that ended in the murder of his wife.However, a month later, the city crime branch of the city police cracked the case and found that Jitendra had promised the co-accused Rs1 lakh for carrying out the attack. He had paid Rs 29,000 to the accused which was reco vered from them.Acting on a tip-off, on December 17, 2009, the crime branch arrested Khan, a taxi driver who lived in Antop Hill. The police said that during interrogation, he revealed the name of Malik, a tomato vendor who allegedly told the cops about the conspiracy . This was the fourth attempt made by the men, the police had said.On October 4, 2009, all the accused met at Lalbaug where the conspiracy was hatched. On October 27, 2009, Jitendra prodded Beena to go on their usual morning walk. Around 5.30am, the couple was attacked by two bikers, Malik and Khan. The police later alleged that while Malik was riding, Khan stabbed Beena on the neck.They also alleged that Jitendra then ordered Nazim to finish his job properly, since, if she survived, the truth would be out. Nazim then returned and stabbed Beena twice in the stomach."
