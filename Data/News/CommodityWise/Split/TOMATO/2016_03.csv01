The scheme is being seen as a boon for farmers in the arid region, who depend almost exclusively on scanty rainfall for cultivation during the rabi season.While the first stage of the scheme covered an area of 11,000 hectares, the project's second stage will bring a further 24,000 hectares of agricultural land under its ambit, making it the world's largest single drip irrigation project.Highlighting the advantages of the Rs 768-crore scheme, water resources minister MB Patil said, ""Around 15,000 small and marginal farmers in 30 villages of the taluk will benefit from the scheme.""Test run in September: A joint venture of Netafim India Private Limited and Jain Irrigation, it is being run on a build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) model. The project is all set for a test run in September. The companies have deployed 400 people on the ground to ensure the project's success.The two companies, tasked with the project's implementation, will oversee the project for five years before it is transferred to Krishna Bhagya Jala Nigam Limited (KBJNL). It will hand over the day-to-day affairs to the 35 water users' associations (WUA) active in the region.Managing director of KBJNL, Anjum Parvez said the scheme will revolutionize agriculture in Hungund taluk. ""Its implementation will help farmers, who traditionally cultivate maize and jowar, reap a bumper yield during both kharif and rabi seasons. Experts at KBJNL believe the drip irrigation scheme can help double food production in the coming years"" he said.The agriculture department will educate farmers in the region to cultivate 15 crops during the two agricultural seasons and consequently, boost their profits.""We are asking farmers to grow crops such as cucumber, tomato, melons and tomato during rabi season, and set aside crops like baby corn, Bengal gram, soya bean, sesame, etc for the kharif season,"" Parvez said.The WUAs will later charge farmers Rs 1,330 per acre for maintenance of the drip lines and other ancillary equipment."

It termed the trend as ""most worrying"" because it was visible during the peak season of production.""There is a huge gap between retail and wholesale price of vegetables. On an all-India average basis, retailers are selling at more than 52.7 per cent of wholesale prices,"" Assocham secretary general D S Rawat said.At the retail level, potato prices went up by about 100 per cent during April-July period this year over the same period of 2015, cabbage (49.3 per cent), chilly (47.8 per cent), garlic (37 per cent), cauliflower (33.9 per cent), tomato local (26 per cent), tomato hybrid (25.6 per cent), potato fresh (25 per cent), okra (22.3 per cent), and brinjal round (20.8 per cent).The report further said, ""It indicates a worrying situation where market arrivals of vegetables have recorded contraction despite being a peak season for production.""As for the gap between the wholesale and retail prices, it is as much as over 75 per cent in some cases like brinjal (round) and over 62 per cent for tomato (desi or local).Lack of basic infrastructure puts further strain on the arrivals of vegetables which result in more wastage of vegetables during peak time of production and because of their perishable nature producers have to sell immediately.In general, producers do not gain when prices increase, the report pointed out. It outlined the need of building cold storage facilities in production centres, suggesting the government should improve infrastructure facilities by encouraging PPP initiatives."
58f67d9d7be9e031f13b5ca9,The bitter story of Nagpur Orange,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/The-bitter-story-of-Nagpur-Orange/articleshow/54271608.cms,2016-09-11,"""Greatest ornament of the garden is a description of orange tree called Cintra (santra) or Coolang. Its fruit is very juicy and of exquisite flavour. There is a floating notion that it was introduced by the Portuguese. Some however, believe that the great superiority of the orange is owing to a system of grafting and budding in which local gardeners of Nagpore are pre-eminently skilful,"" wrote Englishman Major Henry Bevan following his visit to Nagpur in 1818.Brought here by the Bhonsalas -- the erstwhile rulers of the region -- from the North-East in the 19th century, oranges made Nagpur famous. Cut to 2014 when it bagged the geographical indication (GI) tag giving its growers here the sole right to use the words 'Nagpur Orange'. Little has changed after that. Though not as worse as the cotton grower who is often pushed to suicide, the orange farmer is also not spared by the vagaries of nature and uncertain market. Last year, a glut led to rates crashing to Rs4 to5 a kg.If the Alphonso mango grown in Konkan region and grapes of Nashik have an established export market, the Nagpur Santra remains their poor cousin.The orange crop grows twice a year. The fruit available from September to December is Ambiya which has a slightly sour taste. It is followed by the sweeter Mrig crop in January. Normally, farmers go for either of the two varieties. In the last 10 years, large-scale orange cultivation has begun in Rajasthan too, giving Nagpur Orange some competition.The demand for setting up a major processing centre in Vidarbha is an old one. Two years ago, a facility by Citrus India Private Limited started at Nanded in Marathwada region where orange growing is a recent affair. Now, as Patanjali Ayurved plans to make juice out of the oranges grown in Nagpur district and other regions of Vidarbha, there is much hope for the farmers, even though earlier players have failed to successfully market the same product.The first organized attempt was made in the 1960s when farmers came together to form the Nagpur Orange Growers' Association (NOGA) with its plant at Motibagh in north Nagpur. NOGA ran into losses and the government took over it in 1972, bringing it under the Maharashtra Agro-Based Industries Development Corporation (MAIDC).NOGA, with its new plant in Hingna, was once known for its bottles of orange squash and juice. Now, tomato ketchup is its mainstay product. NOGA's line of juices, which are sold in cans, are out of the shelves in shops and are now sold only to institutional buyers like hotels and government agencies. Squash has a small retail market with 50,000 bottles made in a year. There are 3-4 smaller units which hardly have any influence.Sources say NOGA could not compete with juices in tetra packs which took over the market. Cans became old fashioned and NOGA did not have enough funds to invest in a tetra pack unit. The golden days of NOGA ended more than a decade ago. A plant started in Katol in 1998 is also shut.The Nagpur orange has a peculiar feature of leaving a bitter taste in the juice. Limonin in the fibre and seeds brings about this taste. In a commercial unit, the seeds and fibre cannot be removed, or consequently, the bitterness reduced. At least NOGA couldn't and thus lost out to competition. ""The squash which is sweetened with chemicals sells more,"" a source said.""These days, de-bittering units are available, again a major investment,"" said the source. Industry experts say limonin is present in other citrus fruits too and the problem has been addressed long back.The National Citrus Research Centre (NRCC), which has its experimental farms off Amravati Road, was set up in 1985 after a major pest attack in the early 1980s. Now upgraded to a central institute, some say here that it has not come up with a counter to the bitter taste so far. Though a seedless variety has been developed, it is expected to be available for commercial cultivation only after a couple of years.""De-bittering facility is easily available in the market so it should not be a constraint anymore. Like Nanded, a plant can also be set up in Nagpur,"" says Manoj Jawanjal, the director of Mahaorange , a state government marketing agency, and also an orange grower.At present, the majority of units making juices import the fruit contents. Imports are cheaper due to low customs duty. ""In order to protect the local growers, government should impose a higher tax on imports,"" he said.""The orange lobby has not been as strong as grape growers of western Maharashtra. A market for pomegranate and grapes was created by the growers there. Initially, the growers also paid for the losses incurred by traders who exported their produce. Now, there is an established market for these fruits. Those in Western Maharashtra had a political backing. It can happen for oranges too but there has to be support from the government,"" said Jawanjal.""Mahaorange recently exported oranges to Sri Lanka but there is s a long way to go. For getting the advantage of GI tag, an export market has to be established first. At present, the local farmers do not have much awareness about GI and its advantages,"" he said.""It's not juices alone, even orange peel and seeds can get a good price for the farmers,"" says Amitabh Pawde, an engineer-turned-farmer in the orange belt of Narkhed, over 60 km from Nagpur.""The peel can be used for making high-end cosmetics. Orange peel oil is a costly product and, once dried, talcum powder too can be made from it. At present, the raw materials are imported. There are small units which do not make any difference. Any major player in personal care segment, buying the raw material from Vidarbha, can change the dynamics of orange growing here,"" said Pawde.Pawde cited a recent research which says limonin, the bittering element in oranges, can cure kidney stones too.Even as bigger plans may still take some time, farmers say even their day-to-day problems have not been addressed entirely. ""A large number of farmers are close to forest areas and Nilgai (blue bulls) are a major pest destroying the orange trees which are short in height. Subsidy for drip irrigation is also is not available,' says Sanjay Dhote from Katol."

This season, farmers in Bodi, Melasokkanathapuram, Silamalai, Markandeyankottai and Kundalnayakkampatti cultivated the crop expecting high returns. Most of the farmers had grown the variety that gives yield in 90 days. As the climatic conditions were also conducive, they got a good yield.Tomatoes cultivated in the region are sold in the markets in Trichy, Dindigul and Oddanchathiram apart from Madurai. However, this time, it looks like the traders are not keen on them.At present, a box of 15 kilograms of tomatoes, which have not been segregated based on the quality, is selling for 30, while the slightly higher quality boxes selling at a price between 40 to 50. But, the farmers say that the traders are getting a better deal, because they are selling the tomatoes in a prices ranging from 5 to 8 based on the size and skin. In Madurai, the better quality tomatoes are sold for 10 in the farmers markets, while retailers hiked it to 12.Farmers say that the traders make good money even when there is a good yield, because they do not even bother to come to purchase the tomatoes from the farm. The farmers are forced to take them to the markets as the produce cannot be maintained for long.A Sekar, a farmer, says that they spend about 6,000 for cultivating tomatoes on one acre. ""A ten-gram packet of tomato seeds cost 400. The maintenance per acre comes to about 30,000, including pesticides and weeding. We make some profit only if a box sells for about 60. But now, we suffer about 1,500 loss per acre. Loss or profit, we have to pay the people to pick the fruits, which would otherwise start rotting as the rainy season is setting in. Thus, once again, tomato farmers in the region are suffering in spite of a good yield,"" he told TOI."

However, for many from the community, who have made Pune their homes for several years, Durga Puja is no different. During the five days of Durga Puja, pockets of Pune shine like Kolkata, with as much grandeur as the City of Joy, giving Puneites a glimpse of what it feels like to be in Kolkata during Durga Puja. Greasy rolls and mishti to gorge on, pushpanjali and endless adda, the community lets people soak in as much Bengali-ness as they want in these five days. And ahead of the festivities, here's a look at the oldest Durga Puja pandals of the city that kick-started the celebrations in town.The Pune Kali Bari Durga Puja, as it is known now, began in 1939. Seventy-seven years ago, there weren't as many Bengalis in town, as there are now, but enough to start the first puja of Pune. Anup Dutta , from the Pune Kali Bari Durga Puja association, shared, ""In the 1930s, there were a lot of Bengali doctors and armed forces personnels who stayed in the Khadki cantonment area. They were mainly employed under the government and as it was difficult to go back to Bengal every year during that time, they began celebrating Durga Puja in a small school in Khadki.""Not all from the community could attend the festivities in Khadki back then. So, it was decided, that the Durga Puja will be held in the city area (the present Pune Municipal Corporation which was a barren land then) every alternate year. ""This is how the other oldest puja of the city, Congress Bhavan, came to existence,"" Dutta added. The celebration at these venues, every alternate year, continued till the 1960s, when Bangiya Sanskriti Sansad (erstwhile Congress Bhavan) branched out to have their own Durga Puja, without losing its essence. Bireshwar Mitra, president of BSS, said, ""As I get to know from my predecessors, the Durga Puja, that began with few people, gained popularity in no time. Gradually, more people settled at various parts of the city and branched out with their own Durga Puja celebrations at several corners."" With over 30 Durga Puja pandals in the city, a majority of them owe their allegiance to Pune Kali Bari and Congress Bhavan Durga Pujas.With carrying forward the legacy of puja celebrations, generations have also passed on their secrets when it comes to making the bhog for goddess Durga. The simple plate of khichudi, sabzi, kheer and tomato chutney, a quintessential Bengali's must-have during Durga Puja, has been passed on for generations in Pune, miles away from Bengal. ""Until very recently bhog was cooked with woodfire. But, with popularity, we switched to cooking gas. Like it was decades ago, the bhog comprises of khichudi, labra, payesh and chutney. We offer pulao to the goddess on Saptami, which is also served to devotees on this day,"" shared Dutta. Incidentally, the cook hasn't changed in Pune Kali Bari, for over a few decades now. It is no different in Congress Bhavan. ""As a tradition there are two types of bhog that are prepared. One is special for the goddess, which is made by the ladies of the association and offered to Durga. Later the part of this bhog is added to the bhog prepared as a prasad to devotees,"" said Madhumita Ghosh , a member of BSS.(With inputs from Anup.Satphale@timesgroup.com)"

One can just insert Rs.10 note and choose a code number for the specific seed and collect the seed packet dropped into a box. A salient feature of the facility is that one can even get minimum quantity of seeds required as people are forced to buy at least half a kg of seeds - over and above their requirement, according to Dean P. Pandiyarajan.The university has introduced the vending machine for supply of quality seeds produced by it in major towns and cities in the State. The first machine was commissioned on its campus in Coimbatore. The machine has a capacity to stock 1,800 packets of seeds and the university, to start with, has stocked 460 packets.The seeds dispensed by the machine included tomato (PKM); tomato hybrid (CO3); brinjal (CO2); Amaranthus; Bindi hybrid (OBhH1); cluster beans (PNB); chillies hybrid (CO1); and bitter gourd (CO1).The machine will update details of sale of seeds to the Seed Centre unit of the university. In case of demand for a particular seed, the machine would immediately alert the TNAU authorities through an SMS. Also, in case of any attempt to damage it, the machine would alert the police and TNAU authorities.The machine has a video screen through which farmers and members of the public are informed about latest research and development activities of the university. The service will facilitate residents in urban areas to buy quality seeds throughout the year, he said. The machine is refrigerated and maintained at 4 degrees Centigrade to preserve the seeds.Minister for Agriculture R. Duraikannu inaugurated the machine during his recent visit to the institute."
