While Shivaram was the building owner, the PG unit was run by Suhas 's mother Hemalatha.Shivaram's wife Rekha and Hemalatha had been good friends but they had a strained relationship after Hemalatha started the PG in the Shivaram's building. Rents were allegedly not paid on time and Shivaram was upset that the building's condition had begun to deteriorate due to poor maintenance, family sources said.On Friday night, Shivaram was arguing with Suhas over three months rent due from Suhas and his mother. As the argument continued, Siddaraju backed Suhas and tempers soared.In a fit of anger, Shivaram lifted the 10-litre utensil which had boiling sambar and threw the liquid on Suhas and Siddaraju. In the melee, the sambar fell on Shivaram too.All three were rushed to the burns ward of Victoria Hospital where doctors treating them said Shivaram sustained 13% burns, Suhas 14% and Siddaraju 8%. ""All three are out of danger and will be treated for another couple of days,"" doctors told police.After shifting their family members to the hospital, Rekha and Hemalatha went to the police station and filed cases. Rekha, in her complaint, accused Suhas of misbehaving with her minor daughter and police booked Suhas under IPC section 354 (outraging modesty of woman). Hemalatha accused Shivaram of threatening her and he was booked under IPC 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter) and 337 (causing hurt by endangering act).According to police sources, Hemalatha and Rekha had earlier approached police seeking their intervention. ""Since it was a civil matter, we had directed them to advocates. After a few sittings, Rekha and Hemalatha had agreed to settle matter and the final talks were scheduled to Saturday. But everything went wrong on Friday night,"" sources said."

After 10 days of prayers for muktad, Zoroastrians around the world are celebrating Parsi New Year with much gaiety and joie de vivre. Mumbai, which has a sizeable population of this vivacious community, will witness hordes of Parsis visit one of the many agiaries that dot South Mumbai  from the sea-swept Seth Jeejeebhoy Dadabhoy Agiary at Colaba to the grandiose Wadiaji Atash Behram at Princess Street and the Behram Baug agiary in Jogeshwari.Mumbai has 47 fire temples in all and you will see the Parsis dressed in their Navroze finery, thronging the sandalwood shops outside these fire temples, greeting and merrily wishing each other Navroze Mubarak . The day begins by waking up early, bathing, wearing new clothes and faithfully making a trip to the agiary to seek Ahura Mazda 's blessings. Entrances to homes are decorated with colourful chalk (rangoli), incense sticks are burned in the house, doorways are bedecked with fresh, colourful flowers and sprinkled with rose water.For Parsis, celebrating New Year is about eating scrumptious food and spending time with loved ones. The festivities kick off with a hearty breakfast that comprises Parsi Sev (sweet vermicelli) or Rava, which is sprinkled with almonds, raisins and rose petals, sweet curd, Parsi Poro or the Akuri.Lunch is a more elaborate affair with Sali Boti and Dhan Dal Patia with rice. The patia can be pomfret fillets or prawns, in tomato gravy. Some families prefer to have Mutton Dhansak  the Parsi rice and masala dal speciality along with spiced meat kebabs and kachumber. Beer, of course, is a must! Jalebi, Sutarfeni and Kulfi help finish off the meal.While the recent Akshay Kumar release is wooing the genteel community with its portrayal of controversial KM Nanavati case, there are a number of Parsi naataks and musicals that are also vying for attention. Go ahead, take your pick. And Navroze Mubarak, once again!"

In Goa, too, rice, in all its forms is a much-loved carb. While most people will swear by a good fish thali as the perfect lunch-time indulgence, rice in its other forms, is just as popular as a breakfast cereal or a tea time snack or even a post- meal sweet indulgence.Be it savoury or sweet preparations, beaten rice (fov) and puffed rice (chirmulleo) are a staple of most Goan kitchens. Pradnya Keni Naik lists out a host of traditional delicacies she makes using beaten rice. ""The all-time favourite undoubtedly is the godd fov made using beaten rice and jaggery. That apart, some of the other popular fov delicacies are batat fov, dudantle fov and rosantle fov,"" she says.The main difference between dudantle fov and rosantle fov is that while the former is made using milk, coconut milk forms the base for the latter. ""Also, in the coconut milk-based preparation, a turmeric leaf is used as a flavouring,"" Naik says.The key point to remember while making either of these two, Naik says, is to keep a little of the milk aside. ""The beaten rice is like a sponge and soaks up all the liquid. Hence, just before serving it up, the dish needs to be topped up using the liquid that is kept aside,"" she says.""Yet another popular savoury snack made using beaten rice is the tikhat fov,"" says foodie Neelam Dutta. Calling it one of her favourites, Dutta says that while most people these days make the dish using store bought beaten rice, using the traditional fullayle fov or rice that is puffed up using hot sand gives the dish an altogether different dimension. The other ingredients that constitute this dish are fine chopped green chillies, spice powders such as pepper, fenugreek, ginger and red chilly and dal or nuts for garnish.Puffed rice laddoos are one of the old favourites that homemaker Urvija Bhatkuly prepares. ""The dish comprises just two ingredients  the puffed rice and melted sugarcane jaggery. It is both, a tasty as well as healthy indulgence. Also, during the festival of Diwali, on the day of Laxmi puja, puffed rice with a dash of jaggery is served as Prasad,"" she says. Bhatkuly also combines puffed rice with jaggery (for sweetness) and tomato (for a dash of sourness) and serves it to her family as a breakfast dish."

Keshava, who grows tomato in 30 guntas of land, has earned about Rs. 3 lakh in the last couple of weeks thanks to a sudden surge in the price of tomatoes.Five months ago, tomato growers in Salagame hobli of Hassan, were forced to sell tomato at as low as Rs. 20 per bag of 15 kg. Many growers threw tomatoes on the road and distributed it to the public free of cost. Things have changed now. We have never got this kind of price in the past for tomato, Keshava said. He has spent about Rs. 50,000 to grow tomato. He has so far sold 1,000 bags this season alone. The highest price he got was Rs. 700 per bag.Tomato is sold at anywhere between Rs. 60 and 80 per kg in cities like Bengaluru. Merchants, who purchase the produce from farmers in small towns, take it to big cities.We carry our produce to the market in Hassan once in two days. It is true that we may get a better price if we carry them to Bengaluru. But, it is difficult to travel to Bengaluru, said Somashekhar, a tomato grower.One of the reasons for this sudden surge in the price is scanty rainfall in many tomato growing areas. Many growers in Halebid hobli of Hassan suffered loss as there was no sufficient yield due to deficient rainfall.Only those farmers with private borewells could get a decent yield. With good care and sufficient water, a farmer can produce up to 2,000 bags (each of 15 kg) in one season.We would be happy even if we get up to Rs. 150 per bag. But, we dont get it all the time. The retail sellers get better margin than us. In this season, we have sold tomato for Rs. 300 to Rs. 700 per bag. Whatever we earn, we spend it back on the field and try to improve its productivity, Somashekhar said.The growers find it difficult to protect the crop from diseases during the rainy season.We can get a good crop only if we apply medicines regularly. We spend a lot on medicines, besides the labour, said Puttaraju, who has grown tomato in 10 guntas of land."

Photo: S. Siva SaravananIts tomatoes, and not onions, that are bringing tears at households now. In the last few weeks, tomato prices have shot up multi-fold and purchases have dropped.In Coimbatore, the wholesale price of 1 kg of tomatoes on Tuesday was Rs. 60 and the retail price went up to Rs. 80 a kg. In Tirupur and Salem, the retail price was about Rs. 70 a kg.In Coimbatore, the arrivals are mainly from Nasik. Prices are changing almost every day. The wholesale rate was Rs. 1,400 for a 22 kg box two days ago and it is Rs. 1,500 a box on Tuesday.It is the end of summer and farmers normally reduce agriculture activities now as they wait for the monsoon to set in, said M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants' Association.Thally, Denkanikottai, Bettamugilalam, and Rayakottai are some of the major tomato cultivating areas. The price of tomatoes in Hosur market, which draws tomato growers from within a 40 km radius was Rs. 58 a kg on Tuesday.There has been a fall in the production in these areas due to extreme heat this summer, say the farmers.On an ordinary day, Hosur market receives 10,000 to 15,000 boxes of tomatoes of 25 kg each. On Tuesday, the supplies had fallen to as low as 4,000 boxes. Each box costs Rs. 1,450 kg.A sack of cauliflower that has only 16 flowers is Rs. 800, says a farmer.Thally and Denkanikottai that do not experience extreme summer conditions too experienced high temperature this year affecting the produce.Mr. Rajendran says that Coimbatore used to get 20 loads of tomatoes a day and it has come down to six loads now.The supply from nearby places has fallen sharply.If the prices of other vegetables shoot up, consumers go for alternatives. But, they cannot replace tomatoes and chilli with something else.Hence, retail buyers tend to reduce the quantity or frequency of purchase.Even institutional buyers are reducing use of tomatoes, say sources.In Tirupur, prices of almost all the vegetables, except brinjal, had seen an upward trend.In Salem, even while the price of other vegetables remained stable in both, the Uzhavar Santhais and open markets, the price of tomato has soared in the last two days, thanks to the drop in arrivals. The price of tomato which remained at Rs. 45 a kg in the uzhavar santhais on Sunday, rose to Rs. 62 on Tuesday.Market sources said that the local tomato season had come to an end.The uzhavar santhais and the open markets were getting tomatoes from Rayakottai and other parts in Krishnagiri district, and also from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.With the fall in the arrival from Andhra Pradesh, the markets have to totally depend on the tomatoes from Krishnagiri district for the last few days and the drop in arrivals is one of the reasons for the prices going up.The price of beans continue to remain high at Rs. 76 to Rs. 86 a kg in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 100 in the open markets in Salem. This is mainly due to the drop in the arrival of vegetables from Bengaluru.The price of brinjal remained at Rs. 10 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 20 in open markets on Tuesday, potato Rs. 26 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in open markets, small onion Rs. 45 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 50 in open markets; chilli Rs. 45 to Rs. 50 in santhais and Rs. 60 in open markets.The prices of almost all the vegetables are expected to drop in 10 days when the monsoon sets in, Mr. Rajendran said.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem; M.

Producers attribute the rise to harsh heat during March, April and frequent pre-monsoon showers in May.Tomato price has shot to Rs. 65 a kilo in retail stores and vegetable outlets across the city while sellers at larger markets like Secunderabads Monda Market are selling the fruit at Rs. 50 a kilo.This sudden increase in price of an essential commodity at the end of summer is unexpected. There is a large variability in price across the city, said Suchitra Manik, a Sainikpuri resident who shops for her groceries at local supermarkets chains.Surprisingly, price listed by government at wholesale and retail markets has remained unchanged. A kilo of tomato at Bowenpally market was around Rs. 25 a kilo while Rythu Bazars also sold without hike on Friday. Additionally, quantity of arrivals at these markets belies production shortage which retail and farm sources claim.Gajanand, a wholeseller at Monda Market, attributed increased price to stock shortage as production was hit by pre-monsoon rains in Kurnool and producing regions in Telangana including those in Karimnagar.We are now getting our stock from Nasik and Bengaluru. The price last week was Rs. 35 per kilo, he said.Price of green chilli too has shot up in retail stores but larger markets are continuing to sell stock at half the price. While Gajanand said the price of green chilli was Rs. 70 a kilo, an employee at a retail store in Sainikpuri informed the price was hovering at Rs. 130. Shrivatsa Ganeriwal, a techie-turned-farmer, blamed the harsh March heat for a poor tomato harvest in June. It takes tomato seeds 90 to 120 days to reach harvest. A poor yield now implies inappropriate conditions at the time of sowing, combined with erratic rains in May. On my farm, we had to clear the last produce without selling it and plant afresh as the crop yield was very poor, he said."

Regular visitors to these vans include daily wage earners and office-goers. On any given day, the customers are able to choose a variety and have a sumptuous meal at an affordable price.The minimum we charge is Rs. 20 a plate. We serve a wide range of food items - tomato rice, curd rice, vada. We have it all, says Saraswathi, who is part of a self-help group that prepares and sells food out of mobile vans. The food is prepared at home, loaded in large containers, and taken to different locations.The sales used to be high when the concept of selling food out of vans started in the city. But now-a-days we are facing stiff competition. Nevertheless, we usually have an agreement among ourselves not to sell the same item, says the driver of a food van near GKNM Hospital. Another problem that the owners of these vans face is packets that remain unsold.They also say that sales are usually low during the summer months compared to the rest of the year. We get about 70 customers a day. The group members invested the initial funds. After that, they received financial support from the government. Now, it is a profitable venture, says Saraswathi.There are about 2,000 such vans in the city and many of them are run by women self-help groups. They need to get a licence for this from several departments. In any given location, only one mobile unit functions within one km radius.A. Mujibur Rahman and G. Shakila Begum, a couple from Edayarpalayam, sell food packets near Nehru Stadium. The concept of selling food packets in a mobile van started in the city a decade ago. It is becoming popular now as customers get a wide variety at prices lower than that of hotels, says Ms. Begum. Since food is prepared and served by a group or a family and there is a continuous demand, it is a profitable venture, she says.Like hotels, we do not need tables, chairs and fans. That is the reason why the price is lesser by Rs.5 to Rs.10 compared to hotels and we will not function on Sundays, she adds.Some serve non-vegetarian dishes too. At the beginning, we would cook meat around three kg. But customers order biryani more than any other variety, and now we cook 10 kg of meat every day.Some vans donate the remaining food to non-government organisations for distribution to the needy.(With inputs fromS.

A group of scientists explained the procedure to be adopted to check the wilt.R. Gnanamalar, Professor and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, said brinjal, cultivated on 600 hectares in the district, was prone to bacterial wilt attack. The problem was more pronounced in Vallakulam Kothakottai village near Tiruvarangulam. She said continuous raising of brinjal, without crop rotation technique, often resulted in the problem. She advised farmers to adhere to crop rotation technique by planting cereals such as sorghum or pearl millet (kambu). Maize and cotton could also be raised.R. Manimekalai, Programne Coordinator, said water-logging was another problem leading to the bacterial wilt. She said the bacteria also infected chillies, ginger, radish and tomato crops.A demonstration was conducted in which scientists explained the symptoms of wilt and steps to control them. S. Mathiyazhagan, Assistant Professor of Plant Pathology, advised farmers to clear the infected plant from the fields.

Babu. The field day was organised by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), whose researchers have developed the hybrid.Arka Rakshak is being sought after by farmers in different States and a few foreign countries owing to its high-yielding potential, wherein farmers have collected 19 kg a plant. Another attraction is its resistance to diseases such as leaf curl virus, bacterial wilt and early blight, which helps reduce cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards cost of fungicides and pesticides, according to scientists. The third advantage is long shelf-life which makes it ideal for long distance transportation.G. Alagumalai, Assistant director of Horticulture and Tamil Nadu State Horticulture Officers Association president, and co-ordinator of the field visit of officials from Tamil Nadu, told The Hindu that officials would study various aspects of Arka Rakshak to know if it would suit the climatic conditions of Tamil Nadu. Another official from Tamil Nadu said they would prefer taking up its cultivation on small tracts of land in different parts of the State on an experimental basis.However, the officials team was concerned over taste preferences as Arka Rakshak is said to be a tad bit sweet, while culinary preparations in Tamil Nadu favour sour tomatoes.A.T. Sadashiva, principal scientist and Head of the Division of Vegetable Crops of IIHR, who led the team that developed Arka Rakshak, explained various aspects of the crop to the Tamil Nadu team."

When asked how much a kilo of tomatoes costs, the other person had to reply Rs. 150, which verified the antecedents of the person, according to the sleuths.Investigators left fumblingA senior CID official said that Shivakumaraiah not using mobile phones and not keeping his associates in the know of the complete picture left the investigators fumbling for leads. Many of his associates arrested earlier knew little of the larger picture of the racket. Their knowledge was restricted to their role and little else, the official said.The only chink in his armour was the women with whom he had affairs with and with whom he stayed in touch even when he was on the run, according to CID sources. Sources said that Shivakumaraiah also used the mobile phones of these women to run his network and managed to stay below the radar. However, one of the women who was under surveillance ever since he went underground, led the police to him, sources said.On the run since March 21Shivakumaraiah, who was on the run since March 21 when the II pre-university chemistry question paper leakage became public and a re-exam was ordered, successfully leaked the March 31 chemistry re-exam paper too and was trying to leak the CET papers.Shivakumaraiah was holed up in Malur for over 20 days and was hiding in an under-construction building at Garvebavipalya, here, for over a week now, CID sleuths said. He was heavily drunk and unconscious when the sleuths raided the building and arrested him, sources said."
