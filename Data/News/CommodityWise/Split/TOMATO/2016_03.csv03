K. Stalin said here on Tuesday that his party was not in favour of freebies and free schemes that have no utility value.The AIADMK planned to announce more freebies in its election manifesto. The DMK manifesto lays no importance to freebies and free projects that will not be of use to the public, he said at a road-side election meeting in support of S. Ammasi, party candidate of Omalur constituency in Omalur town near here.The freebies of table fans, mixers, and grinders distributed by the AIADMK regime were of very sub-standard quality and have been rendered useless within a short period. The Jayalalithaa regime only indulged in such gimmicks instead of concentrating on development works. It is usual for the parties to release one common manifesto. This time, the DMK wanted to solve the problems confronting every section through a unique way of bringing out separate manifestos for Assembly constituencies and revenue districts.Referring to Omalur constituency, Mr. Stalin said the DMK has planned to fill about 20 lakes in Omalur block with the surplus water of Mettur Dam through the major Pottaneri lake in Mecheri area, which will immensely help in accelerating farm activities. The manifesto also envisaged scent manufacturing unit at Kaadayampatti, tomato juice manufacturing unit at Mecheri, widening of roads and solving the acute drinking water problem.Later, Mr. Stalin addressed a meeting in Mecheri town in support of S. R. Parthiban, the Makkal DMDK candidate of Mettur constituency."

It is not the case any more, says M. Venkateswara Rao, a farmer.Realty boomAfter the government announced the construction of the capital on the banks of the Krishna in Guntur district, many realtors purchased fertile lands, bringing down the cultivation of vegetables.Production hitMany vegetable traders from Telangana districts used to come to Krishna and Guntur districts and place orders in advance. But the recent developments in Andhra Pradesh have brought down production, and there is no supply of vegetables, says Bandi Yadaiah, a farmer from Kothagudem in Khammam district. Green chilli is being sold at Rs. 40 per kg, tomato at Rs. 60, brinjal at Rs. 50, ladys finger at Rs. 60, onion at Rs. 20, cabbage at Rs. 40, ridge gourd at Rs. 50, bitter gourd at Rs. 80, beans at Rs. 100, and gherkin at Rs. 40, he says.Earlier, vegetables used to be supplied through lorries and vans to Sattupalli, Wyra, Kothagudem, Tallada, Palvancha, Suryaraopet, Bhadrachalam, Manuguru, and other mandals of Telangana. Now, there is no such facility, says B. Narasimhulu, a trader from Sattupalli.Petty vendors worst-hitPetty vendors are the worst-hit.

58f723b8a3d24b0b70c325b1,Up above the world so highâ€¦,http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/Up-above-the-world-so-high%E2%80%A6/article14395260.ece,2016-06-22,"As a kid, when Arjun Vajpai would play hide and seek he would invariably climb up the trees to conceal himself from his friends. Today, the Noida boy doesnt want to come down. No, not from the treesfrom the roof of the world. At 23, Arjun has climbed four 8000 metre peaks, a world record, and is now eager to complete the grand slam by scaling 14 such peaks. People often ask me, dont you feel lonely there, I say, I feel at home. My soul takes me there. Here the society has been given to me. Mountaineers get to pick their own social group and then they work towards a common goal, says Arjun, who has just returned from Nepal after climbing Mt. Makalu, the fifth highest mountain in the world.In fact, Arjun says, one of discussions that mountaineers often indulge in is how the society looks at them. People often say why we go through this kind of suffering. I say people in cities lead a physically comfortable life but mentally their lives are stressed. In the mountains, we are physically uncomfortable but there is complete peace of mind. Physical stress will pass but memories will stay forever. We humans dont have the capacity of unlearning experiences. We can pretend but they stay somewhere.Profound words from a boy who refuses to read books because they carry someone elses experiences. It is another matter that he has penned his own experience of scaling the Mount Everest in On Top of the World: My Everest Adventure. Like a character of a page turner, he wants to live a life where every few months he is on the edge, where he doesnt know what lies at the next turn. Like every explorer, I want to be at the outermost rim of the society from where I want to reach where nobody has been there before. Most virgin peaks are in India and if you can climb them, you can name them, gushes Arjun, now sounding more like his age.We meet at Made In India, the fine dining restaurant of Noidas Radisson Blu and one is eager to know what does he eat up there. With watermelon juice in hand, Arjun recounts, the process starts with drinking lots of water to get acclimatised to the low oxygen levels. White ice has lot of air content, so as soon as we reach the base camp we look for blue ice to satiate our thirst. One is expected to drink at least five litres of water a day. Arjun also carries specialised stoves which run on butane gas to heat pre-cooked food and water. The problem is the water has to be boiled and over a period of time it takes away the ability to taste from taste buds. To resuscitate them, Arjun carries his mothers lehsun ka tikhat (garlic chutney), which is super spicy. It has lot of zing. Then I carry namkeen and nutcrackers which are very popular among my fellow climbers from Austria, Spain and China. In return Arjun gets lots of chocolates, which are gold in higher altitude region. Europeans offer exquisite cheese, speck and salami and the Chinese come up with octopus meat and dried fish.Here the chef comes up with non vegetarian kabab platter to spice up our conversation. Arjun starts with galauti and soon polishes off tilasmi mahi tikka as well before telling us how, at times, one has to go back to primitive ways of food collection as well. During the descent from Makalu, when we started from the base camp the weather suddenly deteriorated and the helicopter could not reach us for three days. During this period we had to capture lambs from the wild and consumed fresh mutton to keep going.The real challenge, though, begins once they leave the base camp for the peak. The supply of fresh food dries up and they have to rely on ready-made noodles, dry fruits and chocolates. Here training comes to the rescue as from 10000 to 12000 calories in a day the food consumption comes down to 3000-4000 calories. There is extreme weight loss. The altitude is so severe that you dont like eating. We carry dry fruits and lots of chocolates  things that give instant energy because body needs carbohydrates. In his expeditions, Arjun, trained at Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, has lost 9 to 18 kilos in two months. That is why in my resting period I just eat and sleep, he chuckles.To counter the effect of weight loss on climbing ability, Arjun gains a lot of weight before going for the expedition. It is to ensure that there is no muscle loss. In the training you have to develop muscles and over that the right amount of fat. I gain fat towards the end of the training so that it doesnt stay on the body for long. However, the weight gain should not be at the cost of endurance levels. Thats why all along we try to simulate the environment that my body is going to face at 25-26000 feet. However, in the same vein, Arjun adds that physical exercise can take you only up to a point and after that mind takes over. You cant train for every challenge. After a point you have to leave it for the mind. It does wonders. It defines us as human beings. During the Nepal earthquake, I was on the way to Mt. Makalu and I had only 12 cashew nuts left. I had to convince myself that I have to survive on one nut a day.For him, says Arjun, who also gives motivational talk in corporate houses, a mountain is like a living entity, whom one should not challenge without proper preparation. Has he given them a gender as well? Oh yes! The kind of mood swings they have, they have to be female. Most mountaineers would agree with me. Thats why in Hindu and Buddhist mythology they have been named after goddesses.On the lighter side, Arjun, now digging into jhinga kali mirch, says he often gets fed up with the watery Nepali dal and undercooked vegetables. So the moment I reach home, I ask my mother to prepare karhi chawal and aloo ka parantha. He is adept at cooking as well. I can survive. I am good at curries, something my fellow climbers love to try. Because only Indian curry has tomato puree and ginger paste. But sometimes, it gets too spicy for my Chinese and Spanish friends and they have to often rush to the makeshift loo.After a months break, Arjun will return to training. He is aiming at K2 but before that he wants to climb Kanchenjunga and Annapurna. It is not about the height alone. Climbing a mountain is like solving a puzzle. Over the years, the riddle of Mount Everest has almost been solved. No Indian has climbed K2 yet. In terms of terrain it offers a different kind of challenge. Its base camp is almost 1000 metre lower than of Mount Everests. So you need to have better stamina. Annapurna has a higher fatality rate. There is a gully where avalanches get triggered very easily.Very much like the kulfi on our plate. As I also get to break some ice literally, Pahari, as Arjuns friends call him, has the last word for young climbers. It is not an expensive sport, to begin with. I have done 6000 metre backpack climbs within 10-12000 rupees. Also it is the only sport for which the government has created a separate category. So give it due respect. Dont fake the results and dont depend on sherpas to push you up. It creates a bad name for Indian mountaineering community. In my second attempt at Makalu, I had to return when I was just 60-70 metres away from the peak. I wore a 3D spot detector, so that everybody would know my position. I returned and climbed it on the fourth attempt. In our society, a mountaineers word has lot of respect and we have to live up to it."

The harvest of vegetables on one-acre in the backyard of the station began two days ago. Sales have already touched Rs.25,000, said Pathanapuram Agriculture Officer A.J. Sunil.The land had been lying idle, overgrown with shrubbery and wild trees. The initiative to convert it into a vegetable farm was taken by Mr. Sunil, who discussed the proposal with local MLA K.B. Ganesh Kumar, senior officers of the Agriculture Department and the police. The District Superintendent of Police (Kollam Rural) gave his nod for the project, and soon a farm came up on the station premises.The Agriculture Department sanctioned Rs.90,000 for the project. Workers were employed under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to take it forward.Irrigation facilityA drip and sprinkler irrigation system was installed and the entire farm area was fenced. A perennial well in the compound came as a blessing. Seeds were procured from the Kerala Agricultural University and departmental farms. Cauliflower, cabbage, bitter gourd, amaranthus, ladies finger, cucumber, cowpea, tomato and brinjal were grown.Mr. Sunil said the cultivation was purely organic.He said the cauliflower crop had become a hit. Within the next couple of days, the entire harvest would be sold. The land will then be prepared for another round of crops meant for Onam, he added."

The prices of few vegetables have doubled in the retail market.Retail traders at the Gandhi Market say that the severe heat waves have an adverse effect on the growth of horticultural crops.The price of tomato has shot up from Rs.10 to Rs.30.

58f76824a3d24b0b70c3487e,Super sesame,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/super-sesame/article8118802.ece,2016-01-18,"In Mumbai, sesame comes into its own in til laddoos and chikkis, offered during Sankranti with the words  til gud ghya, god god bola  (eat sweet and speak sweet). But going beyond these popular sweets and the culinary versatility of sesame will thrill the cook in you. Sesame indicum , the cultivated type, which originated in India, continues to be an ingredient of significance today.A wonderful ingredient, sesame is extremely versatile, lending itself to both sweet and savoury dishes. Sprinkle it whole on salads, or knead into chapati dough. Make spice mixes to fortify the flavour and health of your meals. One sprinkle Im hooked to is gomasio, a condiment from Japan, in which toasted sesame is ground coarsely with salt. I just combine coarse sea salt and toasted sesame in a bottle and keep it within reach. Its perfect with anything from a simple bowl of brown rice to salads, noodles, steamed vegetables, even khichdi. Another favourite is the Middle Eastern zaatar (a mix of herbs and spices), a condiment popularly combined with olive oil and smeared on flat bread. Zaatar is also used to flavour meat and vegetables dishes, on labneh (a thick hung yogurt cheese) or fried eggs as a garnish. I toast sesame with dried thyme and salt and grind with amchur instead of the sumac that is traditionally used but not easily found in India. It works perfectly on naans, kulchas, and in raitas. I also like to sprinkle it on chunks of paneer or chicken and grill them.Grinding toasted sesame opens up many more options. Although south India is best known for its use of sesame, I discovered, after I married into a Garhwali family, that the cuisine of Uttarakhand uses a lot of ground sesame in its winter dishes. Crushed sesame adds a nutty accent to lobia khichdi. The piquant khatte aloo is made of potatoes tossed in yogurt, toasted sesame and chillies. And then there is addictive til ki chutney in which toasted sesame is ground with toasted cumin, ginger, green chillies, and the juice of the bada nimbu (large wild lemons that come into season in the winter). Another lovely dish is the earthy pinni ka saag that is made from pinni or compressed seed cakes left over from the oil extraction process of sesame. With the oil removed, these become extremely high in protein and dietary fibre. Grind sesame until it gives forth oil and you get tahini or sesame butter, a staple ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. Stir it into soups, or dips, or add honey to make a quick spread for toast or dip for fruit. I am endlessly confounded that we have been pressing sesame for oil for millennia but never thought of toasting the seed prior to extracting its oil, something that the rest of Asia has savoured for centuries. Toasted sesame oil is the most magical ingredient. The roasting process intensifies the inherent flavour of sesame and is used more as a condiment or flavouring oil. It quickly grows into being indispensible: drizzle over fried eggs, add to vinaigrettes for a delicious variation, swirl a few drops into soups it pairs well with any flavour but is especially good with Asian, tomato and clear soups.And we already know sesames nutty flavours work wonderfully in sweet dishes; our laddoos and chikkis are testimony to this. But sesame is also popular in sweets around the world. In the Middle East you will find sesame halva; which, unlike Indian halvas, come in large dry blocks from which portions are sliced off. They literally melt into a nutty, sweet toffee and glide down your throat. Addictive! In Asian cuisine, a favourite dessert is the sweet black sesame soup of Cantonese cuisine. Asian supermarkets worldwide usually carry instant mix packets but I have made it at home by boiling crushed black sesame or toasted unhusked sesame with water, sweetened with honey or jaggery. It is a great dessert for children.We should be eating a lot more of this super food, not just saving it for festive occasions.If you hate milk like I do, sesame offers a great substitute with three times the calcium content of milk. Plus, one tablespoon of sesame contains 52 calories, 88 mg calcium, 1.3 mg iron and 32 mg magnesium. Why look to the west for health-boosting foods when we are so fortunate in our own home-grown bounty?(The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That )"

Today, of course, hot dog stands are everywhere  at baseball games, at amusement parks, on busy streets, serving juicy pork sausage spiked with garlic and slick with mustard, ketchup and pickle relish, all resting on a cushion of bread. Thats the classic, but wherever you go in North America, youll find different takes: dogs with coleslaw, dogs with chilli sauce, dogs with avocados and refried beans (surprisingly good), even dogs with fries and cheese i.e. a poutine dog if you will.

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMIts tomatoes, not onions that are making people cry over the past couple of weeks. The reason: prices have hit the roof with a reduction in their arrival into the market.Tomato is a most-used vegetable, like onions, and its skyrocketing prices had made it unaffordable.Drought and extreme heat are stated to be the reasons for fall in production triggering the price rise.Tomato is priced at Rs. 35 a kilo in the wholesale market while it is sold at Rs. 50-60 in the retail market. The hybrid variety costs Rs. 10 more.Some wholesale vegetable merchants said the prices will go further as the supply has been declining.Even the quality of the produce that is arriving to the markets is poor.Villages in a 30-km radius of Mysuru, T Narsipur, parts of Nanjangud, Gundlupet, and Nagamangala are among the prominent tomato-growing areas.Eshwar, a wholesale vegetable trader said, There is a wide gap in the demand and supply and this triggered price rise. Drought and blazing summer heat are to be blamed for the drop in production.Mahadevaswamy, another vegetable dealer, said tomato prices are unlikely to stabilise for the next two months. The prices are on the higher side since over a month.Santosh, who runs a mobile vegetable business, said consumers are bearing the brunt of the price rise. The quantum of purchase had been cut down by the consumers to deal with the price rise.As tomato has minimal shelf life, the retailers are averse to procure the veggie in large quantity over its high price.We dont want to lose and therefore procure tomato in small quantity until the prices stabilise, said a representative of a grocery shop, which also sells vegetables and fruits.Due to the high prices, its use in the kitchen had been cut down and tamarind paste, a substitute to tomato, is being used."

We see a carnivore ripping apart a rabbit, which we then realise is our protagonist narrating the story. Its a part of a modern-day play and the only animal-killing-animal that happens is on the stage, the only blood being spilled is tomato ketchup. The animal kingdom has left behind its dark, primitive days far behind. The tone of Zootopia is set, unexpected and snappy.The film doesnt take much time to make it clear that everything in it is meant to mirror the society created by humans. This nascent world is peaceful on the surface. But beneath, forces such as fear and prejudices are at play.Our protagonist Judy Hopp is an optimistic, idealistic Disney character (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to make the world a better place. She creates history by overcoming all odds and societal pressures to becoming the first bunny cop. A naive, righteous village girl leaves her native land to go join the police force in the city  the shiny, model city of Zootopia that, amidst its glass and mirror architecture, has districts that maintain controlled natural habitats.An important action sequence, for example, takes place in the Rainforest district. Hopp befriends a fox (Nick Wilde, a rogue character with a heart of gold, voiced by Jason Bateman), who isnt as straight as we think when we first meet him. And then there are battles at the workplace that she faces as a rabbit, especially from her immediate boss Chief Bogo (a buffalo, voiced by Idris Elba) and we read it as a message for sexism.Most of the times, it is fun to see our world through these anthropomorphic characters. Directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush and the writers never allow the material to get too sentimental or saccharine. It is simple, despite the familiar tropes at play, moves briskly and has a progressive intention.The humour, of course, is essential in this kind of a movie. There are the Godfather , Breaking Bad references, there is Zoogle, there are anti-Fox pepper sprays, a sultry pop star Gazelle (rhymes with Adele but voiced by Shakira) and there is also an overtly catholic skunk mafia boss who is served by intimidating polar bears.But the standout set-piece is that the Department of Motor Vehicles is run by sloths. Stepping inside that office means slowing of time. Its a riot when Jude, who has a few hours left to save his job by solving a criminal case, helplessly tries to extract information from an officer. The subtle ironical connection between sloths and superfast cars is later revealed in an expository fashion.In retrospect, questions pop up about the world of Zootopia . Is the entire Zootopia vegetarian? Have they given up on eating fellow animals for the sake of harmony? The only things they are shown eating are carrots and blueberries. The references to the past are at a very broad level  the only thing we are told repeatedly is that predators have sobered over 1,000 years of evolution, that foxes are shifty, and that there is an underpinning tension between the furries and the savage predators.But there is little iceberg beneath these tips, little fictionalised history to this animal world. Humans are never acknowledged. It is a big suspension of disbelief. Neither is this a science fiction film, nor does it have the bite of a satire. Thats the reason Zootopia doesnt go to the wild blue yonder. But we never ask questions while watching it as it is a fun ride.SANKHAYAN GHOSH"

The demand-supply dynamics has been causing misery to the cultivators for a month now.The price has been fluctuating between Rs. 10 and Rs. 5. According to tomato traders, several farmers have left the tomato crop on their fields to wither or let cattle graze on the produce due to the unremunerative price.A daily wage of Rs. 400 has to be paid to a farm worker and the transport costs in addition would otherwise cause heavier loss to the cultivators, a trader said.Horticulture Department officials say the price fluctuation for perishables was not unusual.In the case of tomato, the average cost of cultivation is Rs. 25,000 an acre, and the productivity ranges from 10 tonnes to 12 tonnes an acre. Farmers could evade loss if the price of tomato is in the range of Rs. 10 per kg, but below that level, the loss is bound to be heavy, official sources said.Since the price is Rs. 5 at the retail point, the field rate would not exceed Rs. 3 a kg, thereby pushing the cultivators to distress situation of letting cattle graze on the field rather than spend on harvesting, the sources said, adding that there is no solution in sight since even if the scope processing tomato is explored, the culture of consuming packaged tomato is not prevalent."

In the current season farmers planted tomato crop in an extent of 5,500 hectares which is more than 1,000 hectares compared to the corresponding period last year. However the price per kg of this highly perishable crop in the market is less than one rupee. We are leaving the crop on the field as the price is all time low and even the harvest costs and transportation charges cannot be recovered by selling the vegetable in the market. We have to give at the rate of Rs.300 per day per head for coolies to pluck it. Traders are not willing to pay even Rs.20 for one crate (containing 25 kg), deplored K. Raja Reddy, a farmer at Borgam (K) village in Makloor mandal. The crop is grown in 20 out of total of 36 mandals in the district.Scanty rainfallWith the scanty rainfall all over farmers choose to cultivate vegetables under borewells and with the help of drip irrigation. Besides, Horticulture department sanctioned a maximum of Rs.6,000 subsidy per hectare for cultivating tomato which also in a way acted as an incentive to go for it in a big way. Authorities, however, at the time of supply of seed advised farmers not to grow one single vegetable as excessive yield would not fetch them profitable price. They suggested the farmers to plant three to four varieties of vegetables, but to no avail. Deputy Director (Horticulture) N. Sunanda told The Hindu that tomato cultivation increased by 15 per cent in the district this time resulting in more yield. Naturally, the price would come down with more supply. Similar is the case with the onion, she said."

On the right, Ajoka Theatre artists from Lahore during the staging of the play Kaun Hai Yeh Gustakh. File Photosfter the curtain call of Sherlock Holmes and the Adventures of the Speckled Band at Akshara Theatre on Sunday, director and theatre co-founder Gopal Sharman came onto the stage and informed the audience that the theatre needed financial help or it would have to be shut down.The venue, a hub for theatre lovers for the past 44 years, has received a notice informing that the theatres lights will go off if the pending electricity bill of Rs.3 lakh is not paid off by March 15.Mr. Sharman asked for help and struck an emotional chord with the audience.A young member of the audience suggested that the theatre start a crowd-funding campaign online. BitGiving, a platform that helps raise funds and had most recently raised Rs.60 lakh to prevent Friendicoes from shutting down, has started a campaign on the behalf of Akshara.The goal is to raise Rs.5 lakh in 30 days to keep the lights on, and enjoy many more plays, shows and home-made tomato soup that the theatre is know to serve after the performances.Speaking about the theatres s situation, co-founder Jalabala Vaidya, whose solo performance of The Ramayana had helped raise funds to build the theatre, said at first the group used to tour abroad and within the country, which brought in money to keep the space running. However, lately the costs began to gallop so fast that they could not keep up.It has been a hard struggle as we are a family-run theatre group that does not have access to government funds.Ms. Vaidya feels that performing arts have managed to keep the identity of Indian people and society alive, and if it was not for the arts, the individuality and uniqueness of our culture would not have survived for so many years. She hopes the government will step forward to encourage the performing arts and keep them alive.The theatre has been home to many young theatre groups and college students. Some have even discovered their love for acting during summer workshops organised at the venue.Theatre actor and director Karam Vir Lamba said: For years, Akshara remained a very small group of affordable performance venues in Delhi. It is a welcome refuge for aspiring artists and creative minds that have needed a space to experiment and share their work. Most importantly, the owners of the establishment have always run it with a genuine love and passion for the arts.Speaking about its current situation, he feels that its closing, should it come to pass, will not only be tragic, but further evidence that the flickering flame of culture in this city, which is in desperate need of love and nurturing, is steadily dying.Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right now, the actor added.Tanima Dey, who was visiting the venue for an event on Friday, said upon learning that the theatre may be forced to shut down: It is such an active space, an oasis in the heart of the city. I am sure those passionate about the arts will not let the lights fade out. I am looking forward to many more lively evenings discussing a performance over some tomato soup.The crowd-funding campaign can be found at www.bitgiving.com/aksharatheatre .Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right nowKaram Vir LambaActorSince 1972, we ran Akshara with the money we earned from performances across the world.
