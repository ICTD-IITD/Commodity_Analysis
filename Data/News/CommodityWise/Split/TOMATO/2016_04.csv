BitGiving, a platform that helps raise funds and had most recently raised Rs.60 lakh to prevent Friendicoes from shutting down, has started a campaign on the behalf of Akshara.The goal is to raise Rs.5 lakh in 30 days to keep the lights on, and enjoy many more plays, shows and home-made tomato soup that the theatre is know to serve after the performances.Speaking about the theatres s situation, co-founder Jalabala Vaidya, whose solo performance of The Ramayana had helped raise funds to build the theatre, said at first the group used to tour abroad and within the country, which brought in money to keep the space running. However, lately the costs began to gallop so fast that they could not keep up.It has been a hard struggle as we are a family-run theatre group that does not have access to government funds.Ms. Vaidya feels that performing arts have managed to keep the identity of Indian people and society alive, and if it was not for the arts, the individuality and uniqueness of our culture would not have survived for so many years. She hopes the government will step forward to encourage the performing arts and keep them alive.The theatre has been home to many young theatre groups and college students. Some have even discovered their love for acting during summer workshops organised at the venue.Theatre actor and director Karam Vir Lamba said: For years, Akshara remained a very small group of affordable performance venues in Delhi. It is a welcome refuge for aspiring artists and creative minds that have needed a space to experiment and share their work. Most importantly, the owners of the establishment have always run it with a genuine love and passion for the arts.Speaking about its current situation, he feels that its closing, should it come to pass, will not only be tragic, but further evidence that the flickering flame of culture in this city, which is in desperate need of love and nurturing, is steadily dying.Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right now, the actor added.Tanima Dey, who was visiting the venue for an event on Friday, said upon learning that the theatre may be forced to shut down: It is such an active space, an oasis in the heart of the city. I am sure those passionate about the arts will not let the lights fade out. I am looking forward to many more lively evenings discussing a performance over some tomato soup.The crowd-funding campaign can be found at www.bitgiving.com/aksharatheatre .Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right nowKaram Vir LambaActorSince 1972, we ran Akshara with the money we earned from performances across the world. We couldn't keep up with the costs once we stopped touringJalabala VaidyaCo-founderDRAMA-ramaAkshara Theatre opened to a houseful of Lady Shri Ram College girls on March 11, 1972The Ramayana, written by Gopal Sharman, is the only Indian play to date to have appeared on Broadway in February 1975. The New York Times called it Indias Gift to BroadwayAkshara played even during the Emergency, and has been famous for its political satire series during every national electionOld timers remember that the house used to be so packed that if the doors were opened midway people would fall out!The theatre has till March 15 to pay up the pending bill of Rs.3 lakh or power supply will be disconnected"

For the first time, the food for the officials is being taken care of by the Akshaya Patra Kitchens of the Hare Krishna Foundation. A total of 22,000 kilogramme of rice, 5,000 kg of dal, and 3,500 kg of tomato and potato curries will be prepared and transported to the polling booths across Greater Hyderabad region for the staff involved in the election duty.However, on Monday, officials at City College in the old city protested citing poor facilities at the polling centre. In Rajendranagar too, polling staff raised slogans against the Presiding Officer for lack of drinking water facility and delayed supply of meals. There were many diabetics among the staff who came to perform the election duty. We were told during the training camp that the food will be supplied at 11 a.m. but we did not get it till 2 p.m., said one of the protesting election workers.The GHMC officials said that adequate arrangements have been already made and any complaints in this regard will be take care of.Right from drinking water to two meals, we have taken care of the basic facilities. Even toilets are there in most booths. If there are any polling stations with no toilets, then we have instructed the officials to talk to one of the house owners in the neighbourhood to let the officials use the toilets, said Surender Mohan, Additional Commissioner, GHMC."

Koyambedu wholesale market, Chennais hub of perishable goods, gets nearly 550 loads of vegetables from neighbouring States daily.R. Jamuna, a resident of Nolambur, said: I am adding more green and seasonal vegetables to the menu. Until a few weeks ago, many vegetables, such as broad beans and carrots, were priced at over Rs.70 a kg.While retail traders in smaller markets are glad that more customers are visiting their shops, wholesalers in Koyambedu note that sales have not picked up much as other neighbouring places like Tiruttani get produce from local areas. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the prices have dropped by 10 per cent this winter compared to last year because of sufficient water in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Many retailers from other places such as Tindivanam, Sulurpet, Arakkonam, Puducherry and Chengalpet usually source vegetables from Koyambedu. They do not frequent market now as they get produce from local areas for the past few days, he said.Retailers like P. Sundarraj of MKB Nagar say there has been an increase in the number of customers by at least 40 per cent ever since the cost dropped a week ago. Many people are buying vegetables like carrots, beans, peas and broad beans as they are much cheaper now, he said. The prices may remain stable till March. Several vegetables such as cabbage, radish, onion and tomato are priced within Rs. 30 a kg after many months. Drumstick is perhaps among the few costly vegetables, sold for Rs.80 per kg."

However, the farmers have started using the light trap method to control insects. Many of cereal crops such as sorghum, rice and maize and vegetable crops such as tomato and brinjal attract insects and pests. Horticultural crops and pulse crops also attract insects.Agricultural officials and researchers say that one light trap was enough for controlling most of the insects that might attack the crop. It can be used from the stage of planting to harvest. As per the method, the traps should be placed at a centre of field for three hours between 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., as insects are active mainly during this period.J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur, told The Hindu that light trap was a vital tool to trap both the sexes of insects. It could reduce the carryover pest population substantially. Many farmers in Karur district had started placing light traps to kill insects.P. Baskar, a farmer at Thammanaickenpatti, said that he had raised bitter guard, onion, brinjal and a few other horticultural crops in his field. He had brought his field under the light trap system. He could say that his field was almost insect-free thanks to the light trap.He said he had bought the light for Rs.1500. It was a cheap and effective method to control insects."

The inmates of jails across Telangana will not only access these recipes at `wet canteens that are coming up within the confines but are treated to a variety of items even in breakfast nowadays.Breakfast spreadThe routine 100 gms of khichdi rice which was the only item at breakfast everyday for decades has gone and now the prisoners relish chapatti, tomato bath, upma, puri, pulihora and pongal by rotation during the week. They also get boiled eggs and banana. But, senior jail officials, said the menu is served within the sanctioned budget of 600 gms of rice, 100 gms of dal, 250 gms of vegetables and 30 gms of oil per head per day.To adjust the cost, the jail authorities have restricted the free supply of 175 gms of mutton to one Sunday against two in the past. They are getting 175 gms of chicken for three Sundays. More ingredients like coriander, curry leaves, garlic and chatni were also added to the items in breakfast to make the food tasty.CouponsFor lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before. The same is served in packets of 600 gms for under trial prisoners and 700 gms for convicts the next day. While the under trial prisoners are issued coupons to an upper limit of Rs 3,000 per month, the limit for convicts is only Rs 1,500 a month because the money had to be spent out of the wages earned by them in works assigned while serving sentence.The convicts have to necessarily send 50 per cent of wages to their dependents. In the case of under trial prisoners, the limit is higher as they will be spending from their personal cash that they brought at the time of admission or when their relatives gave them during mulaqat.Small gestureThe Deputy Inspector General of prisons A. Narasimha said the changes in menu were brought about as part of jail reforms in a bid to remove the vengeance among the inmates on having landed behind the bars.He said it was a small gesture to make them at home as their freedom and liberty was already curtailed. The facility was already provided in Tihar jail.For lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before"

Its a part of a modern-day play and the only animal-killing-animal that happens is on the stage, the only blood being spilled is tomato ketchup. The animal kingdom has left behind its dark, primitive days far behind 1,000 years of evolution. The tone of Zootopia is set, unexpected and snappy.The film doesnt take much time to make it clear that everything in it is meant to mirror the society created by humans. This nascent world is peaceful on the surface. But beneath it, forces such as fear and prejudices are at play.Our protagonist Judy Hopp is an optimistic, idealistic Disney character (Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to make the world a better place.

Have they given up on eating fellow animals for the sake of harmony? The only things they are shown eating are carrots and blueberries. The references to the past are at a very broad level: the only thing we are told repeatedly is that predators have sobered over 1,000 years of evolution, that foxes are shifty, cunning and never to be trusted and that there is an underpinning tension between the furries and savage predators.But there is little iceberg beneath these tips, little fictionalised history to this animal world. Humans are never acknowledged here. Its a big suspension of disbelief here and we accept the artifice. Neither is this a science fiction film, nor does it have the bite of a satire.

But, much of the leaves bought for garnishing in households across the State last year could have been contaminated with dangerous levels of pesticide residue.The annual report (2015) of the Pesticide Residue Research and Analytical Laboratory on production and marketing of safe-to-eat vegetables, fruits and food products reveals high levels of pesticide residue in curry, mint and coriander leaves, ie., above the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) prescribed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Vegetable cowpea and yellow capsicum were also found to be carrying abnormally high levels of pesticide residue.Of the 58 varieties of vegetables that were collected for testing from sales outlets in Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Malappuram and Kasaragod districts from January to December 2015, only five were found to have pesticide residue exceeding the prescribed limit. As many as 44 vegetable varieties were certified pesticide-free and safe to eat, while nine varieties, including bitter gourd, big chilli, green capsicum, tomato, baji chilli, parsley, green chilli and sambar mix, carried pesticide traces below the permissible MRL.Some pesticides detected in the heavily contaminated samples include chlorpyrifos, ethion, cypermethrin, profenophos, dimethoate, bifenthrin, lambda cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, phorate and malathion. Profenophos is a neurotoxic pesticide, which is banned in Kerala and restricted to tea and cotton in other States, while the others are possible carcinogens.According to Thomas Biju Mathew, principal investigator of the project, a systematic analysis of samples and its publication through the media could have gone a long way in ensuring pesticide safety.

On an average, transactions involving 150-200 tonnes take place every day during lean season. About 15 tonnes are wasted during loading and unloading.At the same time, farmers dump huge quantities of tomatoes on the roadside when there is a glut.

Among other efforts, it plans to revive karunkanni, a cotton variety getting extinct. It will convert cotton into value-added products, including naturally-dyed yarn, and sell it to other khadi units for cloth production. It has roped in traditional farmers in Athoor and Reddiyarchathiram blocks in Dindigul district to raise this variety. Similar efforts are on to revive 23 traditional cotton varieties throughout the country.These points were highlighted at a workshop on Revival of desi cotton and contemporary khadi held at Gandhigram near here on Monday. Trust secretary K. Siva Kumar said that the proposed facility would procure the entire produce from farmers and add value to it. The main aim was to end farmers marketing problem. This short staple yarn was best suited for producing bandage cloth and bed sheets.The natural dying unit would use cotton to make naturally-dyed yarn to tap emerging markets. Seeds would be supplied to farmers and the unit would act as a full-fledged model centre for organic cotton and value addition. It would also facilitate formation of a federation of desi cotton producers in the State, he added.Ananthoo of TULA Organic Clothing said that 97 per cent of cotton produced in the country before Independence was of traditional variety. The British, who tried to kill native varieties, and introduce foreign varieties could convert just three per cent of farmers. But, after Independence, Indian scientists had successfully killed traditional varieties and converted 97 per cent per cent of farmers into hybrid cultivation. Now, khadi units were using foreign cotton. Production and input costs for traditional varieties were very less when compared to those from Egypt and the US, he added.Other varietiesKrishna Prasad of Sahaja Samrudha, a peoples movement in Karnataka, said that 23 traditional varieties, especially Bengal Desi, Pundur, Kaala cotton, Wagadh, Karunganni, Jayadhar and Pandrapura, were being raised in the country for the past 1,000 years. Efforts were under way to revive these varieties. All Indian varieties had been grown as inter-crop to channa, coriander, chillies, pulses, tomato and onion, he said.Traditional cotton grower Visvasam of Vellode said that 500 acres of karunkanni variety had been raised in Reddiyarchatram and Athoor blocks. Owing to lack of marketing facilities, many farmers had shifted to other crops. These farmers would be encouraged to grow this variety. Besides Dindigul, Karunkanni was grown in Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam only, he added."

Photo: AFPChampion ram King of Oils shows no visible signs of stress before his semi-final fight at the National Stadium in Lagos.The amber eyes of the snow-white ram barely register the raucous crowd 50 metres away but his outward tranquillity belies a tenacity deep within.Three and a half years ago, Dayo Folami bought King of Oils for less than 50,000 naira (Rs. 16,714). Yet today the 39-year-old businessman says the ram is priceless.Ive won a lot of money with the power he has, Folami, wearing a white T-shirt and dark jeans, told AFP at Sundays event. He doesnt give up.What motivates King of Oils to dominate in the ring is a mystery, said Folami. There is no winning secret of rams, you can never force them to fight.It is exactly that innate will to battle that distinguishes ram fighting from other animal sports, Folami said. With eight weight categories and referees, the Ram Lovers Association of Nigeria (RLAM) is working to bring ram fighting into the mainstream by enforcing a strict set of rules to ensure ram safety and fair play.We brought in rules and regulations of different weight categories, just like in boxing, RLAM member Basheer Bash Agusto said. People expect to see fairness.Agusto, the 68-year-old owner of champion ram Little Tiger  who competes in H, the lightest category  said the rams are just like any other athlete.Once identified as a fighter you make sure hes not lacking, Agusto explained, recommending to give him vitamins and clean between the hooves.Agusto, his silver hair in a short mohawk and a thin gold chain necklace, said ram fighting is an escape from daily life in Nigeria, where poverty is endemic despite massive oil wealth. They can't go to the polo club or golf club, never mind the boat club, so here they have an outlet to look forward to.Intimidating namesHundreds of people gathered under a blazing sun to watch the rams fight on a sandy pitch, fenced off with orange and blue rope.Vendors sold popcorn and suya  a salty, spicy grilled meat served with red onions and tomatoes  while contortionists in striped outfits of mustard yellow and lime green performed in front of VIPs sitting in the shade under white tents.Some rams are named after historic warriors (Attila the Hun, Spartacus), while others after devastating diseases (Ebola, Malaria).The Nigerian ram fighting rules state that at the start of a tournament rams are allowed to hit 30 blows before the referee calls a tie. By the finals, rams can headbutt up to 100 times.But sometimes the fight never takes place at all, with unwilling rams high-tailing it to the safety of their owners amid laughs and jeers from the crowd.At stake is a plethora of official prizes ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. More lucrative, however, is the gambling on the sidelines where men bet tens of thousands of naira on rams. After football, this is what brings people together, said ram judging assistant Segun Odulate. If you come here you wont think anything more, youll concentrate on the rams and youll be happy.  AFP"

The sheer diversity on the five-acre farm is mindboggling: carrots, shorgum , broccoli, cabbage, sunflower, pomegranate, wood apples, paddy and millets. Apart from rock salt, we outsource nothing, she adds with pride.A former airhostess and corporate affairs specialist, Sangita started Annadana Soil and Seed Savers in 2001. It is a self-sustaining organic farm in Vidyaranyapura and, probably, the only one within the city, which preserves traditional or 'naati' seeds. Called 'Bheej Behen' for her efforts to preserve traditional varieties of crops, she has spearheaded a movement to empower farmers. Today, 20 farmers and five experts grow 95 varieties of crops and, thanks to proper planning, reap the harvests of three seasons each year. The seed bank has over 200 varieties of traditional vegetable seeds, from black tomatoes to multi-coloured corn, preserved at a cooler temperature.Traditional seeds are those that stand the test of time, says Sangita. Initially, seeds were brought in from all over the world to start the seed bank. Every season, the seeds are tested for performance and yield. The good ones are saved for the next cycle, ensuring that only robust varieties survive. Each year, we donate 35,000 packets of seeds to farmers in distress across the country, she adds.Growing traditional seeds empowers farmers because they need not be dependent on seed companies.Raji, a farmer and a budding photographer, takes pictures of us with an old DSLR camera while we taste the farm-fresh produce. Everything on the plate has a fantastic flavour and tastes fresh. ""You won't find such delicious tomatoes in any store,"" says Sangita.She talks about the Kalam gopis referred to in the Rig Vedas, whom she calls the original seed guardians. They took charge of the land and saved seeds for the next sowing cycle, she says. Perhaps, this explains why most of the farmers in her land are women. The farmers plan and conduct every operation, from collecting the seeds to packing and labelling them. The group also conducts farm trails and internship programmes to add to their revenue. In a time when farmers are facing an agricultural crisis, the self-sustaining environment at Annadana is something policy makers and officials can learn a lesson or two from.How they workPheromone trap: a chemical resembling sex pheromone is kept inside a trap.

The seeds were brought from State Seed Farm in Palakkad. Assistant Director of Agriculture S.Sheela, Managing Director of Malabar Hospitals P.A.Lalitha and former Mayor C.J.Robin were present for the harvesting.The differently abled people at the Balikasadanam are also engaged in manufacturing phenol, soap and various handicrafts."

Organic farming exponent and managing trustee of Yasoram ARS Vadhyar said that the project was coming to fruition after an eight-year-long struggle.He said the farming as envisaged by the project was possible even in a household with very little land. Its far less expensive at Rs.535 per household, of which Rs.505 will be borne by the corporation, from its plan fund. Each family is required to spend only Rs.30. While our workers will dig ditches to plant banana and yam alternately, with ginger, tomato, green chilly, spinach, okra and the like in between, all that the consumers should do is to ensure that the daily domestic waste is used as manure, Mr. Vadhyar said. The project, conceived by the Yasoram trust, had received the go-ahead from the district planning committee sometime ago. The seeds and saplings planted are sourced through the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK). The dual advantage of the project is that besides promoting organic, pesticide-free farming, it also ensures effective utilisation and disposal of household waste.Mr. Vadhyar, who has done some pioneering work in spreading organic farming around the city, said there were several easy methods available to get rid of pests including the use of organic solutions like neem oil while ground nut cakes and neem cakes could be used as manure. The plan, he said, was to ensure that people gradually move away from consuming pesticide-ridden vegetables and fruits. Its a culture that we need to foster. Theres no labour on the part of the consumer under this project, except that he/she must make sure to deposit food and other organic waste at this mini veggie farm, he said."

The deceased was identified as Purushottam Dehuri who hailed from Janardanpur village under Sadar Block. According to sources, Dehuri consumed poison on Tuesday night and was admitted to the district headquarters hospital at Keonjhar town. He breathed his last in the morning. The deceased had taken loans amounting to Rs.40,000 from different sources, and had cultivated tomato in two acres of land. But the crop was damaged due to scanty rainfall.Of the three other cases, two were reported from Balangir and Bargarh districts in western Odisha where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally a few weeks ago, and one from Dhenkanal.The State government, however, has not admitted a single such death of farmer to be due to crop loss or debt burden although it has admitted in the State Assembly a few days ago that 175 farmers had committed suicide in the State during 2015-16.Enquiries by the respective district administrations showed that none of the farmers ended their lives due to crop failure, said School and Mass Education Minister Debi Prasad Mishra while making a statement on behalf of Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy in the House. Mr. Mishra had said that the State government was not in favour of giving compensation to families of farmers who committed suicide because the move may encourage others to end their lives. While demanding adequate compensation for the family of the farmers who had committed suicide, the Opposition parties had demanded a change in the method and approach to probe into the farmer suicides taking place in the State."

Switching over from traditional farming methods to hi-tech methods, with hopes of better returns, many small and marginal farmers have taken up shade net cultivation in the district.But, many are reportedly suffering loss due to several reasons, including sudden price crash in the open market.Bhimareddy Rampurahalli (46) of Hattikuni village in Yadgir taluk is one among them. He planted around 5,500 tomato saplings in one acre of land under shade net cultivation in January 2016 and also got a bumper yield. After seeing the yield, he hoped for a better price. But his hopes were dashed as the price crashed suddenly in the open market. The price of tomato fell to Rs. 5 per kg from Rs. 25 per kg in a month. Meanwhile, buyers offered Rs. 100-Rs. 120 per bag (weighing 20 kg).Unhappy with this, Bhimareddy Rampurahalli, who was left with no option, has sold around 1,000 kg since the first week of March at cheap price. Bhimareddy Rampurahalli invested around Rs. 34 lakh, including on developing the land and installing nets using hi-tech methods. He drilled an extra borewell to meet the water needs of the crop. He also set up a transformer to avoid interruption in power supply. I made all-out efforts to cultivate the crop with modern techniques. But, even after I got a good yield, the price crash is causing concern, Bhimareddy Rampurahalli told The Hindu .He has lost hopes of getting even half the money he invested from the remaining tomato crop.Bhimareddy Rampurahalli also said that the government has not released the subsidy amount of Rs. 17 lakh as per norms, despite reminders sent to the officials.Satish Kumar, Deputy Director of Horticulture, said that there was no scheme to help farmers who suffer loss owing to price crash of crops taken up under shade net cultivation."

We want them to get familiarised with the new mode first, said G. Chandramouli, Chairman, South Zone, K&VIC.

To aide Central governments girl child scheme, the commission has decided to gift a solar charkha to artisans who have a single girl child. Responding to the financial woes of tomato farmers in Chittoor and Kurnool districts, the commission has decided to form a tomato farmers cluster in the backward Pathikonda area of Kurnool district. Tomato growers of Kurnool are distraught as they do not get good returns on their produce, which is highly perishable. We propose to use solar dryers to dry tomatoes and use them to make products such as sauce and ketchup. For marketing, we will collaborate with the Railways.

We also want to bring banana fibre into use for hand-made paper. It is of very high quality and has good demand in European countries. Cost-wise, it may be on the higher side, but the lifespan of this hand-made paper is 700 years. The commission will soon have an ancillary unit of banana fibre.

Residents are encouraged to grow vegetables in these gardens to meet their day-to-day requirements.The scheme, which was launched in Chennai and Coimbatore two years ago, has been extended to Tiruchi and Madurai as well.Under the scheme, the government distributes kits at a cost of Rs. 500 each to interested persons.Each kit comprises coco peat compressed bricks and vegetable seeds of brinjal, tomato, chilly, bush beans, cluster beans, and different types of greens.The kit contains bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides with pamphlets and a compact disc that contains information on terrace gardening.The distribution of kits was started in February this year, the Horticulture Department has so far sold about 2,000 kits as against the target of 3,000 kits.Although the declaration of elections to the Legislative Assembly is said to have slowed down the sale of kits to an extent because of enforcement of model code of conduct, the people continue to visit the Horticulture Department office at Mannarpuram to get kits.The response is good. We are happy to see urban dwellers visiting our office to get kits spontaneously, said a senior official of Horticultural Department.There are reports that those who have received the kits in February have set up gardens on their terraces in the city.They are about to harvest the vegetables. Several residents have raised terrace gardens by getting the kits from Chennai. They have reaped the benefit by meeting their day to-day requirement of vegetables grown in their gardens.We have stopped buying vegetables in the market ever since we set up terrace garden a few months ago. The yield is sufficient to meet our vegetable requirement, says K.S. Shankar, a property developer who has set up terrace garden in his house at S.B.I. Officers Colony in Cantonment.Stating that he was not applying chemical fertilizer to grow vegetables, he said it had enabled his family to eat fully organic vegetables. It had turned out to be a good hobby. He spends about half an hour either in the morning or in the evening daily for watering and maintaining the garden.Model code of conduct has slowed down the distribution of kitsThe kit contains bio fertilizers and bio pesticides"

They choose from the varieties of fruits and vegetable plants, and even the flowers of green leaves grown in this garden.Pleased to see the guests in her terrace garden, Nandini.R., a resident of Lawspet, says: I began the terrace garden to create a habitat for birds and animals.Starting as an experiment, she initially planted ornamental plants in the terrace. Her strong inclination to follow organic methods in terrace gardening allowed her to grow even vegetables and fruits. I was not blessed with a green thumb so I was hesitant to grow vegetables or fruits in the terrace. Initially, I planted only ornamental plants for the birds. As they grew, I saw tomatoes and pumpkin grow automatically from the compost. Watching them grow, I decided to plant more vegetables in the terrace garden, she says.She makes bed for the plants from the vegetable compost collected from her kitchen waste with a layer of soil and dry leaves. No organic waste goes out of her house. She collects the kitchen waste and prepares compost from it. It is because of the organic method that different bees visit the terrace garden. It takes at least two to three months to prepare the compost from kitchen waste. This bed is sufficient for the plants to grow. Thatched roofs are built to provide shade to these plants, she says.Now, her terrace garden has tomatoes, onion, broad beans, more than two varieties of green leaves and many other fruit plants. From these plants, one can save seeds to grow more plants. It is difficult to find a good source for native seeds. I got the seeds from an exhibition organised by an environment protection group. The first thing we should learn in organic farming is to save the seeds, she added.She wants to grow small trees in the garden including fruit-bearing plants to make a habitat for birds and animals. Nandini confesses that what she has done was very little as her family was soon moving to a different place. She believes that more could be done to grow vegetables from the terrace garden that can be self-sustaining. Not just that, people will also start managing the organic waste themselves rather than waiting for the government to tackle the problem."

The disease has been ascertained by a virologist at the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) in Tiruchi.It is said that the virus was transmittef by cotton whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci). It was found on two acres of brinjal (Manapparai local variety), which was about 50 days old. The incident level was around 20 to 30 per cent and the disease is spreading rapidly despite the farmers taking up spraying insecticides regularly.The disease, which is noticed on tomato crop, is noticed on brinjal probably for the first time in the region. It has to be quarantined as the virus spreads very fast, J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Kirishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur.Speaking to The Hindu , he said whitefly, which is a sap-sucking insect, might have spread the virus in the region. There was a possibility of noticing the disease in neighbouring Tiruchi district too. The disease would paralyse the plants, thus wiping out any yield.He said the plants would have shunted growth. New leaves would be reduced in size and wrinkled. The leaves would curl downward. Flowers might appear and they would fall before fruit was set.Removal and destruction of virus infected brinjal plants was the best way to prevent spreading of the disease.L. Sornamanickam, Assistant Director of Horticulture, Karur said that information about the disease had been communicated to all field-level officials. Farmers had been advised to destroy the plants, if they were affected.Mr. Draviam said the occurrence of the disease was communicated to the Centre for Integrated Pest Management Centre in Tiruchi."

GM mustard is likely to be the first transgenic seed, to be available in farmer fields. It has had a tumultuous history in India with activist groups claiming that it will be a gateway to several other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc.  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in farmer fields.The GM mustard in question has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology. The technology involves using a complex of genes, sourced from soil bacterium, which makes it easier for seed developers to easily develop hybrid varieties of mustard, generally a self pollinating plant. Hybrids varieties are generally known to produce greater yields but they necessitate farmers to keep going to seed companies every year to buy fresh seed. The technology, according to Mr. Pental, will contribute to increasing yields of such hybrids by 25% of existing varieties.Kavitha Kuruganti leads the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, which also campaigns against GM crops. Ms. Kuruganti  who petitioned the CIC  avers that the GM seeds so produced arent substantially better than existing mustard varieties and that seed developers and biotechnology regulators have colluded to push GM mustard. She also argues that in spite of multiple requests, the department hasnt made a copy of the biosafety dossier, which details the GM mustard varietys performance, available publicly.The Commission directs the public authority to verify and provide such informationspecifically the bio-safety dossier as submitted by the crop developer and any other material submitted by them and under review, after separating confidential information, if any, as per their independent decision. The Commission also directs all biosafety data pertaining to all other GMOs in pipeline as that is part of voluntary disclosure under Section 4 of the Right to Information Act reads the order, seen by The Hindu. These details are expected to be made available by April 30 after the seed developers have edited out potential proprietary information, Ms Kuruganti added. Through the hearing, the Environment Ministry was asked why this data wasnt voluntarily uploaded  Im not sure if it will be available on the website but once we get it, we will certainly make it public, Ms Kuruganti told The Hindu."

The British food blogger turned author was there to promote the publication of her second book, Deliciously Ella Everyday , in the United States, and she had caught a cold on the flight across the Atlantic. Her hotel was close to a juice store, though normally she prefers putting ginger through her own juicer and adding a squeeze of lemon.Its sharp and tart, but effective, she said. Ms. Woodward is a food celebrity in Britain, where her first cookbook, Deliciously Ella , named after her website, has had record sales since early 2015. It helps that even while sick, she has the look of someone who just came in from a brisk walk outdoors, with glowing skin, rosy cheeks and hair that falls in waves.She is one of a group of fashionable young women in Britain who are making a career of promoting healthy eating, including Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, Amelia Freer, Anna Jones and Natasha Corrett. The Guardian has called them the queens of greens; The Telegraph named them the superfoodies. One could also think of them as the Daughters of Nigella, the logical successors to Nigella Lawson, the food personality known for her lush desserts, sensuous presentation and high-profile split from art dealer Charles Saatchi.Ms. Woodward grew up in London, the daughter of supermarket heiress Camilla Sainsbury and politician Shaun Woodward.She used to eat lots of junk food but turned to a plant-based diet after she was found to have postural tachycardia syndrome in 2011. At first I had a lot of brown rice pasta with vegetables mushed with tomato, she said, but then she learned to cook.Her sweet potato brownies made with sweet potatoes, ground almonds, buckwheat, dates, raw cacao, maple syrup and salt are both popular and controversial, with online reviews calling them, alternately, divine, horrible and you will be disappointed.Chef sistersJasmine and Melissa Hemsley, aged 36 and 30 respectively, grew up eating food that was influenced by our mum from the Philippines fused with Grannys cooking. Jasmine Hemsley, a former model, said We ate a lot of old-school soups and stews, in no way fancy and without romanticism.Were big on bone broth soups, cooked vegetables and natural fats that come with meats, Melissa Hemsley said. Their signature dish is cauliflower crust pizza with Parma ham, arugula and Parmesan shavings.Vegetarian cravings36-year-old Anna Jones became a vegetarian at 25. She has written a A Modern Way to Eat: 200+ Satisfying Vegetarian Recipes . Taking something away opened up this whole way of cooking that hadnt existed for me before, she said.I love my salad with kale and coconut and miso and roasted tomatoes, but most popular with my readers are the recipes that are the simplest, the twists on classics, like my veggie burger, she said.Celebrity dieticianAmelia Freer, 40, grew up in England near the Scottish border, and was formerly an assistant to the Prince of Wales. Coming from a small town to London, to have a shop where you could buy lattes, croissants, ready-made sandwiches, I was like Woo hoo and would buy breakfast on the way to work and my evening meal on the way home, she said.A doctor suggested she change her diet, and she eventually went to school for nutritional therapy and has since attracted a clientele of mostly actors and musicians, including Sam Smith, who credits her with his recent weight loss. Working with the prince taught me to be discreet and not be fazed by anyone, she said.Natash Corret, 32, had a father who owned Le Boudin Blanc, a French restaurant in London. His side of the family is a long line of restaurateurs where you try everything and food is delicious and feeds your soul, she said. My mother, on the other hand, has celiac disease and is also very allergic to dairy, so I knew about gluten-free cooking and nut milk long before it was fashionable.I cant just eat what I want, unfortunately; I yo-yo dieted my entire life, she said. It was hard to find a balance. The thing is, it was a blessing in disguise. When I found the alkaline way of eating, it changed my life, and I created a career trying to show how great it is. (Alkaline eating aims for a certain acidity or pH in foods: corn, dairy, meat and wheat are all frowned upon.)Im a sweet-tooth person, she said. My sticky toffee pudding is insane.

It was a question of their livelihood. Therefore, they would fight it to the finish. And the fight would include legal fight.The farmers also said that they were not ready to negotiate compensation on the GAIL gas pipeline because there was no question of them accepting compensation.The police then removed them from the Junction.TirupurAround 75 persons, affiliated to various farmer organisations, were arrested when they attempted to block the train traffic here on Tuesday.

Very few go for cooking on a large scale anymore.The volume and variety of food also varies depending on the political party and the candidate in question.Changing preferencesIn the 1950s, parties used to serve upma and coffee.

The disease has been ascertained by a virologist at the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) in Tiruchi.It is said that the virus was transmittef by cotton whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci). It was found on two acres of brinjal (Manapparai local variety), which was about 50 days old. The incident level was around 20 to 30 per cent and the disease is spreading rapidly despite the farmers taking up spraying insecticides regularly.The disease, which is noticed on tomato crop, is noticed on brinjal probably for the first time in the region. It has to be quarantined as the virus spreads very fast, J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Kirishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur.Speaking to The Hindu , he said whitefly, which is a sap-sucking insect, might have spread the virus in the region. There was a possibility of noticing the disease in neighbouring Tiruchi district too. The disease would paralyse the plants, thus wiping out any yield.He said the plants would have shunted growth. The new leaves would be greatly reduced in size and wrinkled. The leaves would curl downward. Flowers might appear and they would fall before fruit was set.Removal and destruction of virus infected brinjal plants was the best way to prevent spreading of the disease.L. Sornamanickam, Assistant Director of Horticulture, Karur said that information about the disease had been communicated to all field-level officials. Farmers had been advised to destroy the plants, if they were affected.Mr. Draviam said the occurrence of the disease was communicated to the Centre for Integrated Pest Management Centre in Tiruchi and other officials concerned so as to take steps to control the disease."
58fa03efa3d24b0b70c43c2d,Choreographing masculinity,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/choreographing-masculinity/article8464117.ece,2016-04-12,,The Hindu,"This year, the International Theatre Festival of Kerala showcased an exploration of masculinity by Delhi-based dance director Mandeep Raikhy, A Male Ant Has Straight Antennae . It premiered in 2013, although it has only toured, nationally and internationally, over the past year. It is a piece whose expansive design could scarcely fit into the proscenium at the KT Muhammed Theatre in Thrissur. On both sides of a squarish arena, were large scaffold-like grids, with Jonathan OHears light fixtures on either side working like flickering Venetian blinds, creating pathways and intersections on the ground, and diffused liminal spaces in which the plays themes were to be negotiated. The seven-strong ensemble consisted of six men and one woman, perhaps to create a spectrum that ranged from the hypermasculine to the innately female.The performers patrol the stage along right angles, kitted out in only underwear, accompanied by a metallic industrial-style score by Yasuhiro Morinaga. At first, there is a workman-like quality to the sauntering, almost a steady ant-like progression across the turf. Later, it runs the gamut from quick darting movements to a slow drudge to an almost streamlined gait. Then, they strut across imagined ramps, and show off their assets. The woman accentuates her breasts, as the men do their arms and packages. The seduction is no longer veiled. When they stop mid-stride, the performers look outward probingly, trying to draw the onlooker/voyeur in. So, a secondary narrative that strongly emerges is closely linked with alternative male sexuality, in a way that is primarily a comment on the urban gay world. In the shadows, a couple of dancers who wear long black socks seem like male Venus de Milo figures, suspended in midair. This fetishisation, even if it is not erotically charged at this stage, appears to represent a superficial idealisation of masculinity, particularly true for a gay microcosm. The men are the various bare bodies one may encounter if one were to log on to a gay dating online portal, where an obsession with physical beauty is almost an affliction of human nature.Victorian-era laws outlawing homosexuality persist in the country, and the pieces of the puzzle here represent facets of an underground culture, some of which takes place very much in the open. They will perhaps be more easily discernable to queer viewers who may recognise their lives in this exploration.Much of the choreography is slickly executed, even if the set-pieces are not constructed to showcase technique as much as to represent a functional world. The movements have an observational quality, and the contemporary idiom employed seems organic to the characterisation of these men.The straight antennae, perhaps, is the conditioning that is part of every conforming mans rites of passage, but particularly oppressive to those with feminine psyches that must be purged from within. Diniz Sanchez, the only dancer with an average body, must bear the baggage of being an effeminate man. A martial Raikhy is at hand to correct his gait, and steady his posture, and ensure his hands flop about him appropriately, sounding a stentorian roar each time Sanchez falls back to feminine bearings. At one time, this onslaught of prescriptive behaviour gets too much for him, leading to an explosion of indignation in the form of an operatic strain in a falsetto voice.Moments of levity such as this enliven the piece. In another amusing set-piece, a wonderfully orchestrated power play of mine is larger than yours is taken to absurd lengths, and performed to a comic score. It underscores how we borrow from each other to make ourselves whole.The daily drill that converts men into automatons is affectingly rendered, and Parinay Mehra embodies this stoically, with an impassive countenance on a body that springs to life with short bursts of vitality.Yet, even if the dancers fleetingly evoke the hidden costs of masculinity, it is never in any real sense. No tough questions are asked. Many of these set-pieces operate only on the surface as if merely representing a sub-culture in itself is enough. Some of the sequences seem indulgently prolonged even if Raikhy appears to be constantly engaged in translating queer experiences.From a striking beginning, the lighting devolves into something more generic, except in one interlude, where the cast performs in silhouettes, which literally examines a combative form of interaction between dancers. The gym, the playground, the roads, the buses, the dark alleyways, are all sites where men negotiate territory and identity. Yet, the true diversity of the male experience proves elusive through the medium of these decidedly urbane men.Raikhy is the pieces anchor, and provides an almost nurturing stewardship to the others; touching, holding, guiding with his eyes. A public encounter between two men segues into a love sequence that is refreshingly devoid of power dynamics. The men find equivalence in one another, and the slumber of bodies that fit well into each other leads to a lyrical pas de deux , where one man holds the other as he swings around. Queer sexuality isnt ever talked about in such deeply felt terms, although Raikhy does put the brakes on taking the innate sensuality of his themes forward.Ultimately, the piece represents a fondness for the very masculinity that is shown to disfigure our psyches. This is why the lone female dancer (the otherwise efficient Manju Sharma) comes across as a token figure, single-handedly expected to provide counterpoints that are not germane to this exploration. The piece comes full circle, with the dancers restored to the insects crawl they started with. While the piece should not be taken as a nuanced take on masculinity, it is an evocative mirror to a concealed world that Raikhy is only too familiar with, one that remains obscured from the mainstream, for better or for worse.The writer is a playwright and stage critic"

He, however, repaid Rs. 6.5 lakh.The Union Government and the nationalised bank concerned should take steps to waive the rest, and hand over the land documents to the kin of the farmer, he said.Mr. Subramaniam asked the Horticulture Department to provide proper guidance to farmers.Ramasamy had spent nearly Rs. 75 lakh to establish a green house unit, and raised capsicum and tomato among others. But, he was unsuccessful as this unit did not facilitate growth of such plants there, he said after visiting the farmers land.At a press meet, he said that farmers expected waiver of all loans taken by them as agriculture has suffered a big blow in the last few years due to various reasons.Farmers associations will decide on extending their support to the party or alliance that promise to waive loans, he added."

That is the strange reality as the Stanley reservoir provides water for irrigation and drinking in the delta region but the local people face water scarcity. Efforts to draw the attention of authorities to their plight have proved futile so far.In the upcoming Assembly elections, the key candidates fielded in the Mettur constituency  S. Semmalai (AIADMK), G.K. Mani (PMK), S.R. Parthiban (Makkal DMDK) and Bhupathi (DMDK)  will have to walk the extra mile to convince people on implementing projects for sharing the surplus water of Mettur dam for irrigation in Salem and neighbouring districts and also implementing special scheme for the supply of protected drinking water to villages.Mettur has become a key constituency with Mr. Semmalai, a former Minister, and Mr. Mani, PMK president, in the fray. Both are three-time MLAs (Mr. Mani has won twice from Pennagaram). The incumbent MLA, Mr. Parthiban, as a candidate of the DMK-led alliance has made the contest an absorbing one.The constituency is also an industrial belt with the presence of a few major industrial houses while a large number of local people are fishermen.All the four leading candidates belong to the dominant Vanniyar community.A section of the local population is upset over the governments failure in constructing a spacious bus stand and also in promoting tourism. The demand for implementing the Thonimadavu water scheme and the Mettur surplus water scheme and a bridge across the Cauvery connecting Kottaiyur to Ottanur has been pending for long. Another unfulfilled demand is the provision of cold storage facility for tomato farmers of Mecheri and a factory for manufacturing value- added products.But the AIADMK cadre are hoping that the achievements of the government including the execution of the underground drainage works, construction of high-level bridge, commissioning of electric crematorium, funds for solid waste management project and for widening the road from Mettur Camp to Thottilpatti would see Mr Semmalai through."

Tomatoes, areca nut, grapes, small onions, and bananas are all cultivated here and for the residents of the city who want a short getaway, there are several spots on the banks of the Noyyal that they can go to.Well, things are not the same anymore. In several areas, the farms have given way to buildings and the Noyyal cries for attention. Elephants crossing the road, entering residential areas, and damaging crops are common.One of the significant demands of the constituency is efforts to support agriculture. It is an area where different crops are raised. In the recent years, small farmers have been selling their land as they do not find farming viable, say some of them. The grape growers have seen a sharp fall in area under grapes and have been asking for a research centre that can guide the farmers. Instances of elephants and boars damaging crops are on the increase and the agriculture community has sought protection for crops. Construction of retention walls on the bunds of the Noyyal will protect the river, they add.In some of the tribal hamlets at the foothills, the residents seek bore wells so that they can continue farming during summer months and when there is shortage of water too. The Noyyal restoration is important not only for the constituency but also for the districts through which the river passes. Now, untreated sewage is let into the river and waste is dumped on the river bed. The local bodies in the constituency need to go in for sewage treatment plants so that the Noyyal can be revived. Checking of violation of Hill Area Conservation Authority rules, controlling water bottling plants that operate without licence and improvement in public transport facilities for tourists are among the other demands.Eco-friendly measures that will conserve Nature, benefit tourists, and develop the religious and Natural tourist destinations will help develop the constituency better, say environmental activists.Sitting MLA S.P. Velumani (AIADMK) polled 62.40 per cent of the votes in 2011 in Thondamuthur Assembly constituency, which was bi-furcated in 2007 to create Kavundampalayam and had some areas of Perur added to it. This election, the main parties contesting include AIADMK (S.P. Velumani), Manithaneya Makkal Katchi in the DMK front (M.A. Syed Mohammed) and DMDK in the DMDK-PWA-TMC front (K. Thiagarajan). The constituency requires not just lights and roads but more development to increase the income of the people. It has potential for promotion of tourism and agriculture, says Mr. Thiagarajan. According to Mr. Mohammed, the constituency has not got any new industry or initiative to generate more jobs in the last five years."

The prices of vegetables that had begun to fall a few weeks ago continued to show a downward trend. As taking the perishable produce back home would require spending a few more thousands, Raghu had no choice but to slash his prices. He ended up selling ridge gourd at Rs. 80 for a 20 kg bag, bitter gourd at Rs. 25 for a 15 kg bag and green brinjal at Rs. 60 for a 10 kg bag. He earned only about Rs. 1,500 which was almost equal to the money he spent on harvesting and transportation.I have spent Rs. 35,000 on cultivating vegetables on two acres of land. I received only Rs. 8,000 by selling the crop so far and may get another Rs. 7,000 by harvesting the remaining crop.

When this reporter observed the auction of different vegetables held between 5.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m, it was found that the prices of all vegetables were down: tomato was priced at Rs. 80 for a 25 kg bag, cucumber at Rs. 100 for a 20kg bag, cauliflower at Rs.100 a bag of 10 pieces and green chilli at Rs. 100 for 10 kg bag.I have stopped harvesting green brinjal as it did not fetch m even the transportation costs last week when I had to sell it for Rs. 30 for a bag of 10 kg, Venkatesh, a farmer from Ele Bichhali village, said.Traders attribute the price fall to glut. Vegetables arrive from Shanti Nagar in Andhra Pradesh, Aija, Gadwall and Hyderabad in Telangana, and Chintamani and Belagavi in Karnataka, apart from the villages along the banks of the Tungabhadra and the Krishna in the district.Green chilli was sold at Rs. 600 for a bag of 10 kg a few weeks ago. Now, the price has dropped to Rs. 100 due to excess, Aarif Hussein, a trader, said.No benefitsWhen this reporter visited the only retail market two hours after the wholesale trading, it was found that the vegetables were being sold at much higher prices: ridge gourd at Rs. 40 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 4), bitter gourd at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs.1.60 a kg), green brinjal at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 6). tomato at Rs.10 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 3.20), cucumber at Rs. 30 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 5), cauliflower at Rs. 40 a piece (wholesale price: Rs. 10) and green chilli at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs.10).No regulationIn the absence of a statutory body to regulate the prices of perishable crops, the district authorities are exploring the possibility of safeguarding the interests of farmers and consumers by eliminating all the middlemen involved.Opening farmers markets where common people too can purchase vegetables directly from farmers is one option.

The increasing number of survivors say that the success is owing to early detection and treatment. In spite of that, with a million new cases being reported every year, cancer seems to be tightening its grip on India. Nearly 7 lakh Indians die of cancer every year, while over 10 lakh are newly diagnosed with some form of the disease. The greater part of the diseases in India are diagnosed when the disease has spread and has become either untreatable or hard.A new development offers hope for potentially increasing detection rates and enhancing the probability that those in need get treatment, and also lessening risk through nourishment and right dietary approaches. By some estimates, lifestyle factors, for example diet and exercise, assume a major role in cancer prevention. Dietary habits are assessed to be a causal factor in 30 per cent of all cancers. Combined with smoking, obesity, food chemicals (e.g. pesticides, additives and hormones), lack of exercise, air and water pollution, and the over-consumption of alcohol or certain pharmaceutical drugs (like, Estrogen, Metronidazole (Flagyl), Lindane (Kwell), or Griseofulvin), 70% per cent of all cancers can be connected to lifestyle.Cancer and the treatment of cancer are often connected with inflammation. Despite the fact that the inflammatory process may have a role in healing, if it goes on too long or if there is too much of it, it can damage cells and their DNA. Beside damage there are different components adding to perpetual inflammation, such as stress, obesity, chemical exposures, and such.The good news is that diet can altogether diminish inflammation. Here are a few things we can do.Lower fat intake - A low-fat diet is associated with reduced risk of cancer. Lower your fat intake to about 20 per cent of total calories. A minimum of 65 grams of fat per day is suggested; 50 grams is better. More of the fats should be mono and polyunsaturated types with a reduction of saturated fat intake and little or no consumption of refined and heated oils.Increase dietary fiber - Fiber has a protective effect against cancer, so a high-fiber diet is suggested to improve colon function, mainly by increasing carbohydrates in the form of whole grains and lots of vegetables, along with some fruits, all of which contain high amounts of many of the important nutrients.Maintain ideal weight and avoid obesity - Be as lean as possible, without becoming underweight.Exercise: for adults at least 30 minutes most days; for children 60 minutes most days.Avoid smoking - The best way for smokers to reduce their risk of cancer, and improve their overall health, is to stop smoking completely.Avoid smoked, salted, pickled and barbecued foods. Prepare meat, poultry and fish by baking, broiling or poaching. Low alcohol consumption - The less alcohol you drink, the lower the risk of cancer. To help prevent cancer, leading experts advise not drinking alcohol at all. Include foods rich in vitamin A and Vitamin C - Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant. Most dietary requirements of vitamin A comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils.Vitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. All fruits and vegetables contain some amount of vitamin C. Citrus fruits such as orange, grapefruit, lime, and lemon are excellent sources of vitamin C, and so are non-citrus fruits such as papaya, strawberries, pineapple.It is best to discuss your nutrition plans with qualified health & wellness coach.Expert- Preeti Rao,CEO & Founder, Total Wellness Management, & Consultant-Health & Wellness, Max Healthcare."

Surprisingly, when farmers all over the State have been screaming hard over failure of monsoons and water scarcity, tomato farmers here face a different situation where monsoon failure has resulted in a bumper harvest, resulting in steep price drop.Tomato farmers say that due to monsoon showers, the normal damage to crops would be high in terms of withering of flowers and fruit rot, but now, without the showers there was a rich flowering in the crops, and in turn a bountiful harvest of fruits.According to current market conditions, a container of 15 kg of tomatoes is sold at `20. Due to the drastic fall in prices, tomato farmers in the district are not even interested in plucking them and are leaving the fruit to rot in the plant itself.I have cultivated tomatoes in three acres of land, and have spent `3 lakh in raising the crops. But due the fall in procurement prices, I could not recover even `2 lakh, said Valukkuparai Balu, president, Farmers Association, Coimbatore. According to him, a farmer needs to spend `200 per farm hand a day for plucking tomatoes and he has to meet other expenditure like transporting the produce to markets.Similarly affected are shallot farmers. Following the fall in price, most of the farmers have created huts in their farms, and are storing the produce. According to farmers, the procurement price of shallots is `6 to `8 per kg, and hence, they are storing them in huts, expecting the price to rise.Farmers pointed out that the Economic Department of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) would normally indicate the price of every crop before the season. But this time, the university has failed to predict tomato prices. They demanded that utilising the excess production, a value addition industry for tomato should be started in the district.Meanwhile, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, A Ramakrishnan, said, Tomato is being cultivated in around 400 hectares in the district. Excess production has resulted in price loss. Practically, we cannot develop value-added industry due to the gap in production."

Two weeks on, his business is being hammered by the ensuing cash crunch.Sales at Somani's aluminium foil maker, Rockdude Impex, have fallen by roughly a quarter in the past week, and the cash shortage that followed the ""demonetisation"" drive has left his supply chain in tatters: his trucks are stranded with no money for fuel, workers won't load goods for free, and distributors can't pay up.Modi's move on Nov. 8 was aimed at cracking down on corruption and flushing out funds stashed away in India's ""black economy"". But the cancellation of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes ($7.3 and $14.7), more than 80 percent of currency in circulation, threatens to push Asia's third-largest economy into a liquidity crisis.Consumer spending makes up 56 percent of India's $2 trillion economy. But with just the small stock of smaller denomination notes available and a struggle to get hold of new bills, consumers are holding back.The government has acknowledged that the disruption would last weeks because of delays in note printing and technical problems with ATM machines, but Modi has made a plea for patience until Dec. 30. The government said it could not have printed new notes or recalibrated cash machines in advance for fear of the move leaking out.Meanwhile, supply chains at small, medium and even larger companies are breaking down, underlining just how much corporate India - not just the shadow economy - relies on hard cash.""The entire supply chain has broken,"" said Somani, who employs 150 people across India from his base outside Mumbai.Problems at Rockdude go from its network of suppliers to its 1,500 distributors and 150 stockists. Its sales team, spread from Delhi to Nagaland in the east and all the way to the south, is rapidly running short of cash to promote a planned new product, even for the rickshaw rides they use to travel.Revenues have frozen, Somani says, but fixed costs continue, including wages. These are paid online, but his staff cannot get access without being given time off to queue at the bank.""We are cutting production,"" he added. ""If this goes on for two more months, then it will hit us very badly.""An executive at a mid-sized hair oil manufacturer, a beauty staple in India, said sales had crumpled as consumers simply stopped buying shampoos and lotions. Wholesale markets, which operate in cash, are shut. Distributors have no cash.""We are planning to extend some discounts to the distributors so that they at least replenish the amount of stocks they are selling, instead of not buying from us at all,"" he said.""We are cutting production every day,"" he added.Like many of the businessmen interviewed by Reuters, he declined to be named, given the sensitivity of the issue.CASH CRUNCHEDIn the year to March 2017, the cash crunch is estimated to pull down India's gross domestic product (GDP) growth from last year's 7.6 percent by as much as 4.1 percentage points. Brokerage Ambit Capital says it does not rule out a contraction in the October-December quarter.Corporate operating profits are tipped to fall by as much as 40 percent in the current quarter.People ranging from taxi drivers and street hawkers to big consumer goods firms have seen their earnings plummet by as much as 80 percent in the first week of the swap alone, according to some analysts' estimates.Those relying on informal, cash-based channels are, unsurprisingly, worst hit. Greengrocer Ranveer Singh, who regularly borrows money to run his shop in New Delhi, sold vegetables on credit to regular customers in the first two days after the cash crackdown, but has been forced to shut up shop.""I don't have cash to refill stocks,"" said Singh, who used to make about $15 a day before the crackdown began.""If it remains like this for two more weeks, my family might have to go without food.""But even for more sophisticated firms, paying employees is a major challenge, and not just in the construction and building materials sectors, which still pay contractors in cash.As most Indians do not have bank accounts, most are paid in cash, though reliable statistics are hard to come by.With the government changing rules for currency withdrawals and exchange almost every day, Somani and others are struggling.Chandubhai Kothia, head of chemicals company Shree Ganesh Chemicals in Gujarat, with an annual turnover of 1 billion rupees, said a newly imposed 50,000 rupee cash withdrawal limit per week for some businesses that came in as part of the measures was simply not enough.""The payment of wages to workers and transport are a problem,"" he said.While Modi has promised the cash situation would become normal by year-end, Saumitra Chaudhuri, a former economic adviser to the government, estimates it will take six months to replace the stock of cancelled bills.EARNINGS CRUNCHEDSome analysts are already reviewing their estimate of company earnings for the rest of the year.Brokerage Motilal Oswal warned this week that its forecast of a revival in corporate earnings in the second half of the fiscal year 2016/17 was now in jeopardy, with autos, retail, consumer goods, cement, telecom and non-banking financial companies likely to see downgrades.India's vast services sector, which accounts for two-thirds of GDP, is worst hit.Credit Suisse estimates more than 90 percent of consumer purchases are made in cash as few Indians have bank cards and infrastructure for online transactions is poor.In Gurgaon's Cyber Hub, a corporate leisure centre, several eateries reported a crash in their card swiping machines, compelling them to decline customers who didn't have sufficient smaller denomination bills.In rural areas, where cash is totally dominant, the situation is worse.In the wheat-growing states, sales of seeds and fertiliser have plunged halfway through the sowing season as farmers told Reuters they had run out of cash.As the crunch continues, more are beginning to ask whether the government could have done more to ease the impact.""The Prime Minister to my mind has done an income tax raid in every house in the country,"" said Abhishek Saraf, joint managing director of SquareFoot, a flooring-maker in Mumbai."

The cold buffet included Parma ham with melon, sesame crusted tuna nicoise, smoked duck with pear compote, shrimps ceviche, barley wuith prune and kalamata, artichoke and tomator terrine.The simmering hot roasted pumpkin soup was soft, sweet, rich in texture and creamy.The roasted turkey was carved and served to us. The turkey was well cooked, with subtle flavours of the giblet gravy, cranberry and potato that added to the glazed tasting.Honey glazed ham had a hint of sweetness, almost nil with the size of the slices served, the meat was succulent.The steak served was juicy and flavoured with barbecue sauce.The Coq au vin rouge won the buffet at the table - the meat was moist and cooked thorough.The classic pumpkin pie was dry, crumbled easily.The pie could have been better at least with a whipped cream on top.Maple pumpkin twists with cream cheese frosting was an interesting concept, but failed as the pumpkin stuffing was way too sweet.I had a diabetes threat in my mouth with the dessert.The Pavlov was the saving grace among the dessert with creamy and crumbly textures breaking into a moist combination of subtly sweet and fruity flavours.M Cafe at the Marriott also served red wine, which goes well with the meaty delight.They also served cinnamon maple whisky sour, ginger cranberry cooler and buck fizz at the dinner. Not a fan on buck fizz. The acidity of the citrus overpowers the sparkling wine flavour.Overall the dinner is a delight for a meat lover, especially if you are a fan of ham and turkey."

If you know Israel and Israelis, you can guess how quickly I fell in love with this word. Just imagine a small nation, spread across the world, suffering for being different, looking for a place to call home and building one for itself, almost from a scratch. The State of Israel is Jugaad! Jugaad is the way we think, the way we invent, the way we work, he said.He said, We in Israel were concerned about homeland security, but India taught us to think about food security. And this is why we are all here today. India and Israel are both old-new nations. We both know that building a home means being able to provide food for your family, and that building a nation means to be able to produce and provide food for all: now, and for the next generations. It is about taking care of your home with your own two hands; it is about taking care of your people and your land.A few days ago I visited Karnal where Indians and Israelis are developing new kinds of cherry-tomato, which are an Israeli invention. When Indian experts and Israeli experts place solar panels on the roofs of trucks so that the solar energy will keep the food inside the trucks fresh and prevent food waste  they are doing magic together. When Israeli companies and Indian farmers create professional and financial networks to help the farmers keep growing their crops, they are doing magic together, he said and making a special reference to the Central governments Make in India programme, he added that, Israel not only thinks that it can Make in India, but also Make with India.Pranab Mukherjee, President of India said, Im happy to share the platform with the president of Israel, a country that has made a mark in agriculture through innovation, technology solutions and converting its knowledge into value addition. Israel has created water and food surplus by successfully using technology.There is much to learn from Israel, a country which has converted its disadvantages to advantages with courage, conviction and fortitude. I was a part of the decision making team in 1992 that entered into a partnership for defence equipment with Israel, and I am happy we can do so in the field of agriculture as well, Mukherjee said.The union minister for agriculture Radha Mohan Singh said, It is appreciable as how CII is bringing digital krishi to farmers. When we talk about Indias agricultural production, the states of Punjab and Haryana get a supreme mention because it was here that the Green Revolution started off. However, in the last few years, water levels in these states have depleted and we need to develop ways to use water more judiciously.Barak Granot, head of Economic and Trade Mission, Embassy of Israel said, As a step towards promoting the cooperation between India and Israel in the agricultural sector, Israel seeks to increase the number of Centres of Excellence across India. There are currently 15 such centres that enable rapid transfer of Israeli agricultural technology to farmers, including those in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, and going ahead, these would be increased to 29."

We will be able to complete the entire 2 million tonnes by June 2017, Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande said on the sidelines of FICCI conference on food service industry.Pulses production is estimated to increase to more than 20 million tonnes in 2016-17. So, we will be able to procure one million tonne of pulses from domestic market for buffer stock and rest one million tonnes will be imported, he said.India has imported 3.5 million tonnes of pulses so far this fiscal, out of which 0.4 million tonnes is by public sector trading agencies In an initiative to safeguard the interest of buyers, the government is also coming up with a new Consumer Protection Act which is scheduled to be introduced in Parliament soon.Ensuring the availability of 24-25 million tonnes of pulses, the Ministry expects a reduction in imports as they expect a significant rise in production. Last fiscal, India imported nearly six million tonnes of pulses to meet the domestic demand.The price of pulses which had skyrocketed to `200 per kg, have seen a steep correction while the price of sugar is stable.Meanwhile, the wastage of tomatoes produced, makes it imperative that other fruits and vegetables are safeguarded from this wastage. Hence, the need to reduce post-harvest crop-loss and wastage of cooked food is also being emphasized with the need to increase the processing level of fruits and vegetables to 20 per cent in a attempt to reduce post harvest losses."

Its an everyday struggle as small vendors suffer a huge dip in their collection while labourers are left with no wages or work to meet ends. Express spoke to a few of them on how they are surviving against the odds.Ahmed | Age: 47 | Chaat sellerAhmed and his family live in a rented house near Shivajinagar. The demonetisation drive, Ahmed says, has taken a large chunk of his earnings as people do not have cash.Most of the food items I sell cost either Rs 30 or Rs 40 per plate. From noon to 9pm, Rukiya (his wife) and I used to conduct business worth Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. Everything has changed since the new notes were introduced. We are unable to make half of what we used to, he said.He has two school-going children.The couple has been selling food items near Commercial Street for over a decade now.Explaining his constraints, Ahmed said that it has become difficult to raise enough money to even buy tomatoes and onions among other items for his business.Since all my earnings go to my family, I have no savings or a bank account. The cash crunch, I fear, will push me towards debt, he said.However, he is hopeful that the situation will return to normal soon. If not, I will have to ask my son to quit school and assist in looking after the family, he added.Venkatesh | Age: 45 | Flower vendorIn a corner on Veerapillai Street in the city, Venkatesh has been selling flowers with his mother Lakshmi for the past two-and-a-half decades. Ever since demonetisation was announced, Venkatesh has been witnessing a steady decline in his income. We had never faced such a financial crunch before, he said.The income they generated by selling flowers has shrunk by 66 per cent in the last 15 days. Earlier, we used to sell goods worth Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 on a daily basis, of which we could make an earning of Rs 500. What can we do if we only earn Rs 1,000? he asked.He resides at Anepalya in the city with his mother, wife H Devi and two children. His recent income, he says, is inadequate to make ends meet. We dont have a bank account. All that we earn is enough to meet only our daily demands. If business continues to be this dull, we will have to explore other options to sustain the family, he said.Kannan | Age: 27 | Daily wage labourerIf not for the charitable gesture of his employer, Kannan says he and his wife would have been forced to beg. Kannan, his wife Vijayalakshmi, and a group of other labourers are working at a construction site in Banashankari and are being fed by the contractor.Thats all we are getting now  food. We have not received payment for the past two weeks, Kannan said. Kannan has left his parents and younger brother back in Kolar district. Though his brother does menial jobs, Kannan and his wife are the primary breadwinners. Kannan used to travel home every two weeks to give money to his parents, but he has not been able to do so since November 8. They have resorted to borrowing from people. I cant ask the contractor to send money to my parents because they do not have a bank account. Without salary we cant go home. We cannot insist that the salaries be paid because we might lose our jobs. We have to be understanding. How will the owner pay salaries if he cant take cash out from bank, he said.Karthik Kumar | Age: 32 |Migrant labourerKarthik Kumar and his family spend about six months in Bengaluru and six months in their village near Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu. He says his bank has been turning him away due to lack of change for the high denomination notes he is paid with.He and his wife Mutthu earn up to Rs 500 and Rs 300 respectively. The money he earns, he deposits it every month in his mothers account, who lives alone in the village. I used to deposit money in the Bengaluru branch of a bank we have back home. When I went last Tuesday, bank personnel insisted that I deposit the money at my home branch, he said.We cannot afford to travel more than 300 km every week to deposit money. We cant keep it safe with us either, he said. The Rs 2,000 denomination too has caused problems for him. When we are trying to save every penny, having a Rs 2,000 note is a problem as we are forced to buy more to get change, he added.Zarina | Age: 37 | ArtisanZarina, her husband Saleem and daughter Ayesha hail from Ahmedabad and have been residing on a footpath in front of Cantonment Railway Station.To a question, she said that she had heard about old notes being taken out of circulation but is not sure if it has made any difference.In Bengaluru or any other city, if we sell our wares we can make a maximum of Rs 200 a day. So, to earn Rs 500, my husband and I have to roam around the city for three days, said Ayesha as she started to cook on the footpath.People with money might have faced problems. But, we dont have any money. If our wares do not sell, we will beg and feed ourselves. There is always a tomorrow where we will earn enough for us to survive, she added.Mehboob Pasha | Age: 20|Construction labourerMehboob Pasha and his two brothers work in different parts of Bengaluru. They moved from Raichur district. For Mehboob, who started working as a construction labourer a month ago, demonetisation has put him in a personal crisis.Mehboob told Express that he had arrived in the city with his brothers with little money. A few days later he was left only with a Rs 500 note. This was a couple of days after the demonetisation move. Then, his employer gave him Rs 1,000 as salary.When I went to the shop with the money, they told me that both the denominations have been withdrawn. They asked to me to go to the bank to deposit the money, he said. Since he did not have a bank account to deposit the money, he was forced to stand in a queue for almost a day to exchange the notes. I lost a days earning. Since we receive a meagre salary, we cant afford to take leave, he said. Echoing similar concerns was his relative, who did not wish to be named. Even now we are paid in old notes. We have been asking the contractor to give new notes as we cant afford to stand in a queue and lose a day, she added."

The ongoing Italian food festival at Prego, The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace (which is on till October 29) boasts of a menu hand-crafted by chef Roberto Boggio that has all of above. He has been flown down from Le Meridien Pune and the full-course meal served by him and his team has already found favour with the Italian food enthusiasts in the city. It also helps that the Chef can make you fall in love a little bit more with his cuisine with his dramatic storytelling. My life is my job, says Roberto after giving a lively presentation about and dishing out some trivias about the fare on the table.The full-course meal rustled up by the team comprised starters, soup, pizza, pasta course and dessert. The Saturday afternoon feast begun with Tartara di asparagi con salsa di taleggio which is pudding comprising asparagus, a hint of egg and taleggio cheese sauce. The minestrone made with vegetables and pesto sauce was warm and comforting. The pizza with tuna, squid, prawn, crab, with a generous layer of pesto and tomato sauce sums up an ideal brunch food. However, the Cotoletta impanata, classic chicken pane served with rosemary potatoes stole the show before the desserts arrived. The coffee dust sprinkled tiramisu was the perfect way to end the meal."

This restaurant, a darshini, serves organic vegetarian. This is the brainchild of four friends  two who worked in a health-insurance office, and two in the software industry.Vivek Patil quit his well-paying job in the insurance company. I worked there for almost five years and observed the disease patterns. I found an unhealthy lifestyle to be the main culprit, in fact eating habits to be more precise. That got me and my friend Srinivas Hatti thinking... and we decided to open a restaurant with health as the main focus, says Patil, who has also enlisted the services of an in-house Ayurveda doctor for consultation. Dr Radhapriya convinced us to open an organic restaurant, he says. Shivanand Naik and Kiran DS, two software engineers, joined in.The most interesting section of their menu is The Health Special Organic Juices. It lists 15 to 20 juices combining fruits and veggies with names indicative of their effect on the body.So you have Flat Tummy (for burning fat), Red Cooler (for reducing cholesterol), Heart Beat (for a better heart), Acid Free (to fight acidity) and Body Builder (for muscle gain). All are prepared under the guidance of the in-house Ayurveda doctor, who is also available for consultation between 7 am and 10 am everyday.Health juices are famously tasteless, so the restaurant has cleverly altered their range to be palatable.Snacks such as Organic Idli, Masala Dosa, and Roti Khara Bhat dont taste like anything out of the ordinary, but it does leave you satisfied that you had something organic.Millets have been used in the dishes and the Millets Special Organic Lunch Menu features millet idlis, millet bhath, millet puliogre, millet sweet and pongal. All taste like they are homemade, bland and familiar.Davangere delicacies such as Davangere Benne Dosa, Girmit (a bhel puri like mixture made from onions and tomatoes, roasted gram powder and puffed rice) and Mandakki Oggarane (again a mixture of puffed rice, roasted gram dal and condiments), and some of the popular dishes from North Karnataka also find space on the menu. Be careful with the chilli fritter (bhajji), which is startlingly hot.There is also the special menu for the day with its 10-12 varieties of organic sandwiches. Coffee too has Regular, Black and with jaggery options. In teas, you could have a masala tea made from organic milk."

The secret behind the delectable spread of paya, nihari and marag served fresh with hot dil naan is that there really is no short-cut. Itminan or patience is the byword followed by the chefs who make it. The launch of a new Hyderabadi Irani menu, as a tribute to the Nizami traditions atSodaBottleOpenerWala, Hyderabad was another reminder of this fact. You cant cook this fare by a recipe book, it takes painstaking hours of cooking and a whole lot of love to put these delicacies on the table, says Shaaz Mehmood, partner, SBOW.From this week onwards, the Jubilee Hills-based Irani Cafe has been serving two kinds of cuisines-the usual Parsi Bombay fare and the Hyderabadi delicacies along with liquor. If this strikes a chord with the food lovers in the city, the plan is to replicate it in the other outlets through out the country. It took three months and copious hours in the kitchen for us to train our chefs. My mother, my partner Shirazs mother, my grand-mothers cooks, my fiancs grand mothers cooks, over six households got together to come up with the dishes, informs Shaaz.For starters we tried the mutton varqi luqmi with mint and tomato chutney; this could be the perfect companion for your cuppa of your signature Irani chai. The baked Irani specialties also include Osmania biscuits, macrom, badam biskoot, naan khataais.What came next at the sampling session was the paya, nihari and marag with dil naan and zabaan. The spice level was muted but it allowed us to savour the flavour even better. The talihuwi arbi and talahuwa gosht, would go well with your baghara khana and khatti dal. One must pair the kaddu ka dalcha (a warm and wholesome variant of dal with gourd) with steamed rice. The Irani haleem, somewhat different from the characteristic preparation that you get almost every nook and corner in Hyderabad during Ramazan. Served with chopped mint leaves, a squeeze of lemon, fried onions, and green chillies, this dish had a fresh taste. The biryani, both mutton and vegetarian were not the usual spicy variation but stayed true to the authentic Hyderabadi taste. The dum ka murg was distinctly smokey as this dish is meant to be. The meal ended on a sweet note with khubani ka meetha and kulfi-falooda that was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth.The new menu lives up to the promise of serving food that is truly Hyderabadi in every morsel. For your next relaxed meal with conversations that go on for hours, this could be an apt bet."

58fd43da7be9e06c937184b9,Travels inspire a ‘convertible’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/nov/18/travels-inspire-a-convertible-1540091.html,2016-11-18,,The New Indian Express,"BENGALURU: Growing up in the city, Amit Gowda, saw many of his favourite restaurants shut down because they were operating from basements. City byelaws made this use of space illegal. But with that, according to Amit, the city lost half of its charm.A food enthusiast and an ardent traveller, he decided to open a multi-cuisine restaurant much in line with Tycoon restaurant that once was his go-to place in the city. It took him two years and travels to 15 countries to finally open his ideal restaurant.The Druid Garden was opened yesterday in Sahakarnagar.The 32,000-sqft restaurant is on the third and fourth floor of a building that houses a fitness gym and grocery stores. But pass the first two floors and you enter a world starkly different with its striped Aztec black and white marble floor.The entrance is dimly lit and, almost all of a sudden, the restaurant turns bright and open. There are different seating arrangements -- German communal tables and elevated corners to VIP sections and closer-to-the-DJ rooms.Our idea was to have an outdoor space and yet a controlled one, says Amit. What if it rains? An open space will not be fun, he says. I look around to see the open space and see the glass roof above my head starting to slide. The retractable glass roof gives way to open skies and a cool breeze.There are planted gardens all around, to remind you of this garden city. In the nights, with fairy lights, the restaurants wears a warm yellow tone.I seat myself in an elevated area, to the right of the entrance. Seated in a handcrafted Italian oak chair, I get an open view of an Italian kitchen. The kitchen boasts of a wood-fire grill and imported teak, oak, rosewood and hickory are used to smoke meat in the grill.The kitchen occupies 20,000 sq ft area and is driven by 60 chefs. You can take a tour of it on request. The store rooms and the refrigerators are stuffed with imported products from all over the world, such as chocolates from Belgium, salmon from Venenzula and cheese from Italy. While the organic vegetables are brought in from Talakadu and Chikballapura, the lamb is from Banur. Majority of the basic ingredients such as garam masalas, breads and ice-cream are made in-house. All ingredients are sealed with a sticker that carries the name of the chef who prepared it, the date on which it was prepared and Best Before date.Adjacent to the kitchen is a brewery with 36 tanks imported from Czech Republic. The beer is made exclusively by a master brewer Ladislav, who is from Czech Republic.The 140 dishes on the menu were carefully picked from 400 dishes. It was tough to narrow them down, says Niharika Raval, general manager of the restaurant.The dishes are from all 15 countries Amit travelled to: Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Portugal, Vietnam, Thailand, South America, Honduras, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Mexico, Japan, China and India. The menu was curated, over eight months, after tasting food from streets and from fine-dining restaurants.I cant try all, so I pick 10 dishes.First, I am served Vietnamese Summer Roll with Peanut Sauce. Fresh lettuce, glass noodles, red cabbage and herbs were assembled together and wrapped in a feather-light rice paper. Maybe because Vietnamese is my favourite cuisine, I find this roll to be the best I have ever had. It has unobtrusive flavours and crunchy, raw textures that are not too loud to chew on. Moist glass noodles adds a smoothness to it too.Hoisin Duck Taco is a surpise. The taco is small, round and soft. Shredded duck is layered with crispier pieces. The duck is prepared in confit, which means it is cooked slowly over a long time in its own fat. The process takes a whole day. The skin of the duck is crispy fried and topped on the taco along with cucumber, spring onions and chayote. The tanginess of the ketchup contrasts well with the sweetness of the duck.Campagna Burrata is sheer delight for cheese lovers. A solid mozzarella holds a refined silky mozzarella and fresh cream.Danish dish Smorrebrod with Anchovy Paste, an open-faced sandwich, has toasted bread drizzled with fresh lettuce. It is divine with the tangy flavour of marinated tomatoes and savoury anchovies. I can taste a hint of basil, roasted pepper and olive oil.Asian cuisine is served with dips that have soy sauce and garlic and Mediterranean dishes have creamy cheesy dips.For the dessert, I am served Orchard Fresh Sorbet that excels in presentation. There are fruit jellies and roll ups. You can pick from three kinds of sorbet -- the brown one that is Chocolate-Chilli flavored, white is Kaffir Lime and Coconut flavoured, and red is Mixed Berry. I try Chocolate Chilli sorbet first, out of curiosity. It tastes first of chocolate then the hotness of the chilli shoots in. The chilli is an after-taste. The Kaffir Lime-Coconut is tangy and creamy. The Mixed Berry sorbet tastes like something you can layer on a bread, instead of jam.Approximate cost for two: `1,400 without alcohol."

We get a rousing welcome at the recently opened restaurant, in UB City, with Punjabi songs from Bollywood.Popeyes loves spinach, so there is Popeye Paaji ki Chaat. On the plate is fried spinach leaf topped with yoghurt, mint and imli chutney. It is chatpati and a healthy dish to start off with. Tokri Chaat resembles Raj Kachori minus the puri, the tokri is kept in. It has different kinds of sprouts, which are boiled. We get the tangy taste of imli and dahi as we bite into the tokri.This is accompanied by Nashili Chai and Jatt Risky After Whisky. Nashili Chai stands true to its name and will be loved by any tea fanatic. It is tea mixed with vodka, gin, white rum, orange liqueur, lime juice and orange marmalade. In Jatt Risky After Whisky, whisky is shaken with apple cinnamon reduction, egg white and lime juice.I love paneer and dahi and find starters loaded with both -- Paneer Barrel Tikka and Dahee Pataka. Paneer, in the shape of hexagonal barrel, is stuffed with a filling made of sweet mango chutney, dry fruits and cottage cheese. It is cooked in tandoor. Dahee Pataka is made with hung curd, chopped chilli added to it. We bite into it and the dahi oozes into our mouth tangy, spicy and with a hint of ginger.Gabbar Prawns, made with jumbo prawns, has smoky flavour with a taste of herbs. The prawns are marinated in hung curd, green chilli, garam masala, jeera powder, heated mustard oil and cooked in tandoor. All these are served with mint chutney.The main course is, the unforgettable, Maa Ki Daal. The traditional dal makhni made with black gram, pigeon pea, green gram and kidney bean is slow cooked on tandoor which gives it a burnt flavour. Cream and butter add to its rich texture.BC Classic Butter Chicken too is creamy, tastes sweet with the right amount of spice. It has a thick gravy with chicken tikka. The tikka is marinated in hung curd, ginger garlic, deghi mirch, jeera powder and kasuri methi. The taste of tomato and cashew stands out, along with cream and butter.Chenna is the hero of Lehsun Palak Chenna. It melts in our mouths as we eat it along with ground spinach that carries a note of garlic.The crispy sweet jalebi is served on the streets of Punjab with rabdi and the same makes it to this restaurant, along with Ras Dates Malai. In the second, ground dates is smothered with soft Ras Malai.Approximate cost for a meal for two: `1,500"

58fd46637be9e06c93718834,"Food prices steady, but is there a secret behind that?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/nov/28/food-prices-steady-but-is-there-a-secret-behind-that-1543360.html,2016-11-28,,The New Indian Express,"More than two weeks after confiscatory demonetisation sucked cash out from the economy, the food market has remained by and large steady, rather deceptively so. This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

These days however, the abundance of tempting roadside food and negligence in drinking enough clean water has made it easier to fall prey to infections, kidney stones and chronic kidney disease among other maladies. One does not understand the necessity of a healthy diet at an earlier age as the young body is capable of overcoming these disorders without much ado. It is only over time that one feels the long-term consequences of an unhealthy lifestyle and at this point usually the damage done is irreversible.Here are some pointers to follow to avoid dealing with unnecessary urinary troubles -A few simple tweaks to ones lifestyle can help ensure that the urinary system runs smoothly till a ripe old age. One must keep in mind that the above tips contribute to not just a healthy urinary system, they also lead to good health overall. A healthy lifestyle consisting of a good diet, enough physical activity and low stressors contributes towards strengthening the immune system and keeps the body running as efficiently as possible.Practice good hygieneBadly maintained public toilets are chock full of bacteria that are waiting to prey on unsuspecting victims. One must be careful and make the best use of toilet paper and water to keep their privates clean. Clean well before and after sex as well.Water water everywhere, stop and take a drinkWater flushes out all of the toxins in the body and keeps the cells at their most active. Do not underestimate the importance of this life giving liquid- not only does it energize your muscles and help in weight loss, it also keeps the skin clear and glowing. To help one remember to drink water: There are a number of mobile and desktop apps that post regular reminders to drink water. Keep a few full water bottles around at all times so that they can serve as a reminder to drink water. Buy some attractive water bottles or mark the water bottles.Careful with caffeineCaffeinated beverages like coffee act as a diuretic- which means that one will expel water from the body faster than usual. As long as one remembers to replace the lost water by drinking more water, caffeinated beverages can be enjoyed in moderation.Examine the dietIncluding a lot of water based fruits and vegetables in the diet will help give the body the water it needs to run smoothly. Watermelons, strawberries, cucumbers, and tomatoes are some examples of foods that are high in water content. Antioxidant rich foods such as blueberries help strengthen the bladder to fight away infections.Easy on the saltSalt is delicious but too much of it leads to water retention which is harmful for the body. A diet high in sodium leads to increased blood pressure which, if left uncontrolled results in kidney damage. One must also pay attention to the amount of sodium being consumed via packaged or canned foods.- Dr Anand Armugam, Apollo Spectra Hospitals"

Is their any connection? Yes, proves a group of head load workers who have joined hands with a few residents at the Kalikkotta Palace Road near Tripunithura Statue junction. The initiative has not only helped in curbing stray dog menace but has also yielded them good harvest of vegetables.How the dogs grew in numbersThe area near the Statue Junction was once a dumping yard for waste materials where people often dumped food and plastic waste during the night. It was common for stray dogs which hunt for food to camp in the area. Soon, the number of dogs visiting the spot increased, creating a threat to school children in the early hours of the day.Fed up by the foul smell emanating from the waste and the increasing number of dogs, the CITU head load workers whose office is located at Statue Junction decided to take matters in their own hands.We were thinking of a solution. This is when we realised that the area on the road side was lying vacant which is the major reason why people were using it as a dumping yard. If we use the land effectively and make them feel that the spot is not vacant, they will hesitate to dump waste there. After discussions, we came to a conclusion that vegetable cultivation was a good idea, said A M Manoj, a head load worker.Manoj, along with other workers Purushan, Raju, Babu, Pushkaran, Mohanan, Sasi, Johnson and Viswakumar decided to go ahead with the plan. As the cultivation will not affect the pedestrian movement, they were not worried about official sanction.We bought the seeds from the agri-outlet in Tripunithura and planted ladys fingers, tomatoes and cow peas initially. Seeing the success, we have planted more varieties like chinese potato (koorkka), green chilly and ginger, he added."

Chilli and other vegetables grown in the region have a good market in Tamil Nadu.Thousands of farmers who have grown varieties of vegetables using underground water and by judicious water management have also given up harvesting as the prices have crashed.The farmers have grown bullet chilli, beans, cabbage, potato, brinjal and flowers in hundreds of acres expecting good prices in Tamil Nadu market during Navaratri season.Farmers in Bommanahalli, Attigulipura, Siddaiahnapura, Chikkahalli, Chatra, Ankashettypura, Ramasamudra and other villages depend on Tamil Nadu markets particularly Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Mettuplayam and Madurai. They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court.

They now bring several currencies of smaller denominations that makes it more difficult for transactions in a wholesale shop like ours, he said.But, that is the least of Jayaramans worries. Ever since the high-value note ban, his shop has seen a 60 per cent drop in footfalls, said Jayaraman, while some customers had to be simply turned away due to the owners inability to issue change.Consequently, their income has halved and their profits are close to nothing, said Jayaraman and his friend M Abdul Khader, who runs a vegetable shop in the market, agrees. This month, I had to send four of my 10 labourers to Bihar where they come from, since I couldnt afford them, Jayaraman added.Apart from that, wastage has been a constant source of worry, said shop owners. For instance, a vegetable shop owner claimed to have lost around 4,000 kg from a load of 25,000 kg during the last month.Before this, wastage was contained to around 1,500 to 2,000 kg, he said.As a result, shop owners in the market have increasingly turned to onions and tubers like potatoes and yam that have a slightly longer shelf life. Likewise, fruit vendors stock up apples that can be preserved in cold storage for around two months.In Koyambedu, Asias largest perishable goods market, around 600 trucks arrive every morning - around 400 trucks of vegetables and 200 trucks of fruits. Flowers are usually carried in bags and baskets, brought to the market by the vendors themselves in share autos or buses.While calling off the days load would seem like the best way forward considering the previous days load has not been sold, vendors like Jayaraman, who have been in business for over 45 years, have an image to protect.If the trucks dont arrive even for one morning, the neighbouring shops would take notice and the word will spread.Its not good for business.Produce arrives at the market from across the country - watermelons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, apples from Himachal Pradesh and Kashmir, malta (blood oranges) from Ganganagar in Punjab, seedless grapes from Solapur and sapotas from closer home in Tirupattur.The key, said wholesale dealers, was to retain the customers at all costs. Some retailers have the option of closing their shop for a month and going to their hometowns for other work. We cannot do that, said Jayaraman, adding that their business was based on reliability. If we close our shops even for two days, they will find the next shop and move on, he said.So despite the wastage, they accept the next days load and find other ways to cut down expenditure.Abdul Khader, for one, has canceled all family outings until business returns to normal.In addition to their losses, shop owners said they were charged a maintenance fee of Rs 1 per square feet a month.Hence, for an average shop owner with a 1,200 square feet shop, Rs 1,200 would have to be paid.However, business has begun looking up in the market, say dealers. The last few days, sales has gone up by around10-20 per cent. So, were hopeful, Jayaraman said.On November 8, the price of tomatoes in the market was a mere Rs 4 per kg, according to the vendors, when usually a kg was priced at Rs 12.Last week, before Ammas death, it was Rs 7 per kg, said Abdul Khader."

The 45-year-old works for Ananda Foundation for Holistic and Healthy Learning and Living, where she helps schools, teachers and family with planning out the curriculum. Her home in Film Nagar in Hyderabad has a huge garden with a path leading to it from her kitchen.It is not a manicured garden as she believes in permaculture; a system where you directly utilise all the features observed in natural ecosystems. When you walk into her house, a shock of greenery welcomes you.Gardening for me has always been a passion since childhood, as my parents were vegetable gardeners and most of the fresh greens we consumed used to be from the farm or the ones we grew at home, she says. I could not continue farming once I moved to Hyderabad from Chennai as I got married and had kids. But for the past seven years I have been farming in a more organised manner.I grow a lot of vegetables in my garden such as tomatoes, chilli, greens, spinach, lemons broad beans, pomegranate, lettuce and gourds, she says. Maintaining a garden which produces so many vegetables is not easy. When asked about how she maintains it, she replies, If you are consistent, it is easy. I enjoy watering and looking after my plants. I have a gardener who is not good and does not listen to what you say. So, it does get tough to maintain at times.She advises people, saying, Everyone should grow their own vegetables. The nutritional value of a vegetable reduces when we buy from outside as we do not know what chemicals and pesticides they have used. We can also save a lot of water when we grow them at home as we can re-use water used to wash utensils and so on to water the plants. Composting is better than buying even organic fertilisers because it is home-made and saves the planet.I have plants inside my home which help in increasing the circulation of oxygen indoors, she further adds.For further details, please visit the Facebook page of Ananda Foundation and Art of the Heart."

Shut out of banks and starved of cash for inputs like fertilizer, seeds and pesticides, farmers across the south have slashed their rabi sowing, at some places by more than half the normal acreage.In Ballari, farmers who had already sown crops when Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were withdrawn from the market on November 8 are not much better off and face the risk of losing the investment they had already made. One farmer, Lepakshi Naidu in Hosapete taluk, Karnataka, said he had sown 30 acres of chilli prior to November 8 and now with banks allowing him to withdraw no more than Rs 2000 per day, he was unable to pay workers. The loss of crop over 30 acres could cripple his hopes, he said.Pesticide dealers confirmed that rabi sowing is down by 80 per cent in Ballari and by at least 40 per cent in Telangana, where a fertilizer trader said he would normally do business of Rs 20-25 lakh per day, but had not sold a single bag of fertilizer all week. Farmers across the peninsula said they would trade their produce for a deep discount if only they would be paid in low-denomination bills. But with no one having small notes, that was a remote possibility.For tomato farmers in Odisha, prices have fallen so low (Rs 2 per kg in Bargarh) that it was not even worthwhile to transport it to the market. Traders have been absent from auctions in the vegetable markets, and the only consignments moving are those that had been paid for before November 8. Not that such farmers are happier.Most have put their money in the bank and are now effectively shut out of any access to it. All told, its been a vicious cycle for farmers be it in Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Telangana. If in Kerala farmers are unable to repay their loans because their procurement incomes have been delayed, cultivators in Nalgonda, Telangana, said the loans from moneylenders and deposits in banks are out of reach as well while they pay interest on loans."

They are consultants to those wishing to nurture gardens of different sizes, as well.Minette shares some valuable information and tips with our readers.Watering requires to be done everyday, unless the soil is already wet/damp from the previous day. Among the herbs, rosemary is a delicate darling which requires some extra attention and care.Water your plants enough to keep the soil moist without over-watering (roots will rot in a soggy container). Let the top of the soil, or growing medium, dry out completely between watering and check moisture levels often. Mint, parsley does best in fairly moist soil, whereas rosemary, thyme and sage prefer soil that is only slightly moist.Herbs grow well in equal parts compost, sterile topsoil and builders sand. An all-purpose organic fertilizer can be added to this mix. The soil mix needs to drain well. Since they can thrive on any type of soil, the soil does not have to be completely organic. They are not often bothered by insect or disease pests. Neem oil works best in case of any diseases.Herbs can be grown in pots or on the ground. They require a minimum of 6 hours of bright sunlight and can be grown indoors where they get sufficient light. Indoors the advantage is no weeds, easy to access but the yield is less. A south west facing window will do well. Outdoors, the yield is larger, the herbs are more flavoursome.The beauty of herbs is that they can thrive on your kitchen window sill, balcony, patio etc as long as they get the required amount of sunlight and water. One can buy seeds from most garden stores. Most herbs are available as saplings and can be re potted into bigger pots or into the ground. Basil gives out flowers which dry into seeds. Once it flowers, it needs to be pinched and the seeds can be dried and grown. The same goes with garlic and onion chives.Seeds of annual herbs (basil, coriander, dill and oregano) can be started indoors and grown year round. Place a collection of popular culinary herbs in a sunny kitchen window and theyll be available when needed. Perennial herbs, like chives, parsley, sage, sweet marjoram and thyme, can be started from seed, but it is often easier to purchase young plants from a nursery. Because perennials grow for more than one season, its best to keep them outside in pots during the summer and bring them in if the winter is too cold.The Tale of a TeacherI am the proud owner of a farm in the heart of Bengaluru in Jayanagar. It is just a 3ft by 14 ft patch in my backyard but I call it a farm because in that small space I grow a variety of vegetables and herbs!says former teacher, Mythili Ramaprasad, her eyes sparkling with joy and pride. To make maximum use of the little soil in the patch and also the limited sunlight available, I grow climbers, shrubs, herbs and tubers.So there is a happy mix of pumpkin, turmeric, cherry tomatoes, sweet potato, colocasia( kesuvina soppu) along with curry leaves, chilies, mint, basil and ajwain ( dodpathre soppu) ,all growing in symbiosis. I have also tried growing climbers like passion fruit, chow and hyacinth beans ( avarekai) in the past which have given good yields.She says I took up gardening seriously as a hobby after I retired as a teacher. What began as a hobby has now become a passion. I love to spend time every morning in the garden, examining each plant and discover a fresh green shoot or a healthy new bud. It is very relaxing and has great therapeutic value. Very little investment is needed to plan a small kitchen garden. It is best if it is organically cultivated. Kitchen wastes like vegetable and fruit peels can be collected and buried in a pit in the soil.Sometimes the plants are attacked by caterpillars and insects which need immediate attention as they can seriously damage the plants and affect the produce. Monkeys can also be a menace and cause destruction.....she rues. And those who know Mythili Ramaprasad will tell you just how alert and vigilant she is especially when it comes to her beautiful garden!"

A total of 188 samples were collected and tested as per the directive of the Agricultural Minister. While 172 of the samples (91.5 per cent) were found to be safe to eat, the remaining 16 samples(8.5 per cent) showed presence of harmful pesticides.The tests conducted at the Pesticides Residue Research and Analytical Laboratory of Kerala Agricultural University found that the samples of brinjal, snake gourd, bitter gourd, ladies finger, tomato, potato, onion (big and small), carrot, yam and cole collected from markets across the state are found free of pesticide residues. But samples of beans, curry leaves, mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chilli and beetroot, coming from the neighbouring states, contained residues of banned pesticides like Profenophos, Chlorpyrifos, Triazophos, Phenothrin, Lambdacyhalothrin, and Cyfluthrin in alarming levels.According to the report, the various projects executed by the agricultural department have helped in production of pesticides-free vegetables in the state.It is for the first time that such a massive test, taking samples from all districts, was conducted in the state.

But the most inspired people stay with her- her children. ""Both my children want to help, gardening is a fun activity for them.Since they're so young, I can't let them do much. But I always let them sprinkle seeds. They've started respecting Nature, they know the role farmers play in our lives and that there is so much work that goes into the food we buy from the supermarkets. Kids have forgotten that today, and so have we.""While many complain of high temperatures and a dry November, Aashita finds Bengaluru's weather ideal. ""The weather changes in phases, she says, and the temperature remains moderate most of the time. I can also grow winter plants in my garden because the sun isn't too harsh.""

It had cabbage, onions, pepper, tomato ketchup sauce and garnished with a fried egg. Wouldnt you love to try that? I remember being the happiest little kid when my mom would cook her amazing meals for the family. I began to cook too. Actually, I wanted to join armed forces because I always admired their dedication and discipline. But I could not pursue it further; so I decided to be a chef, which also requires equally high levels of dedication and discipline. No regrets at all!Sujit MukherjeeThe first professional kitchen experience I had was peeling onions for a large banquet and I grew to cooking food for 2,800 people. I started my career in an Indian kitchen. The blend of spices and the union of flavours with exotic spices fascinate me. A lot of young people have no idea what this kind of job requires. Its tough; so try not to take this as an easy way out. Nowadays, chefs are in serious demand all over the world.Recently, we did a complete themed brunch which was based on molecular cuisine using techniques like sous vide, nitrogen cooking, gelling and spherification. Of course, certain experiments dont work out. I tried making a pizza pie with a twist but it didnt come out the way I wanted it too. Food is not just about cooking; I educate myself on flavour, taste and seasonality.You should try Spaghetti Aglio Olio with grilled chicken, which has a nice charcoal aroma of the chicken, caramelised garlic and extra virgin olive oil for that additional flavour. Its my favourite! Always use garlic and herbs in your dishes. While the former helps in controlling cholesterol, the latter helps in reduction of heart diseases.Ive got a good understanding of food and cuisines from other countries. A tip to aspiring chefs: eat a wide range of food and experiment with things; its the only way to update yourself in the present market. So start at the bottom and work your way up, learn and absorb as much as possible. Assisting in kitchens is essential to understand the industry on a deeper level. If you have that passion and youre willing to work hard, youll do well. And fast.As for me, Ive been in the kitchen for a long time and I soon want to travel to various places and try the local flavours there.Also, cook under the open sky and indulge in a nice warm chocolate souffl."

My father had a few acres of agriculture near Sadenahalli, around 16 km from Bengaluru. I grew up on the vegetables and other produce grown from the land, which inspired me to try my hand at terrace gardening.After my marriage in the mid 70s, I planted a small kitchen garden in our Rajajinagar house and grew beans, papaya and greens. When I shifted to Malleswaram, I became a member of the We Care for Malleswaram group. The groups focus was on educating residents on the segregation of wet anddry waste.The compost generated from the wet waste and the availability of abundant sunlight encouraged me to start my own terrace garden. Here I grow beans, greens, tomatoes and German Turnip, to name a few. I have not bought any greens from the market since 2013. When I started my garden, I had decided on two aspects -- no chemicals and judicious use of water.Today, I make manure from the wet waste generated from my own kitchen as well as my neighbours, leftovers from the pooja room, dry leaves and sour buttermilk.I have close to 150 pots on my terrace, in which I use an equal measure of coconut husk and manure. I keep experimenting with the crops and have managed to grow sweet potatoes, three varieties of brinjal, double beans, chickpeas, cucumber and bitter gourd. In addition, I also have basil, parsley, coriander, mint, green chilies and curry leaves. A portion of the beans and brinjal are left to age on the vines. Dried seeds are then collected and preserved for future plants.I also have a good variety of flowers, which are used for prayers. The remnants of the flowers post pooja are added to the compost bin. The garden terrace attracts honey bees and insects that aid in pollination too. I enjoy taking care of the plants and spend close to an hour every day tending them. It is a stress buster."

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

However, some enterprising people like Sunita Fatehpuria, a 66-year-old-housewife, manage to create their own garden and grow enough vegetables for a meal.Living in Tarnaka along with her family in a spacious independent house, gardening was not the first thing on her mind. However, she soon grew to love the plants, thanks to her mother, a certified green thumb. Today Sunita is an owner of a fruitful vegetable patch.Im happy to maintain this little space  which is the size of an average master bedroom. Water problems are aplenty and this is the reason I did not plant flowers. I feel that letting a flower die is a sin and on days when water is short, we barely meet our needs and the plants are left to wilt, she says.Her patch currently sprouts ladies fingers, spinach, mint, coriander, brinjals, bottle gourds, tomatoes and chilies, but lately, shes been noticing a batch of cucumbers growing as well! I never planted the cucumber seeds. Recent showers have caused havoc on my garden. Most of my crop got washed away or killed due to the excessive rains and the next thing I see is these wild cucumbers growing she adds, hinting at the almost flood-like situation the city saw last month.One of the major challenges of maintaining a garden is to ensure that the foliage does not get infected by pests. It gets even tougher when one avoids chemicals (as it destroys the nutrition in the vegetables). Sunita adheres to the philosophy of keeping everything au naturale.Using manure and neem cakes, she ensures that her vegetables get all the nutrition they need whilst remaining free of pests. Water for the plants comes from the boring water and occasionally government supplied water is used.Although she is glad to keep working on her own project for nearly three decades now, she confesses that it pains her that due to her age, she is forced to hire a few gardeners. ""But its a small compromise in exchange for a green and bountiful garden"". Now her aim is to ensure that her patch stays that way."

Monetary returns aside, working outdoors brings rich dividends for the young mind. It is fun, engaging and influences children to embrace sustainable livelihoods.According to Janani Eswar, founder of Growing in Nature (GRIN), a Bengaluru-based organisation that works in connecting children to nature, we are suffering from what Richard Louv calls nature deficit disorder. Children spend less time outdoors and more time indoors and on their screens, resulting in many behavioural problems.I met a seven-year-old who told me that tomatoes came from a supermarket. We are getting so disconnected from nature that we do not realise that working outside and with plants is not just a life skill but is as essential as speaking a language. Our bodies are built to be outside, so when children work outdoors, they are operating on an instinctive level and are forging deep connections with their surroundings. says Eswar, who also works with schools to devise curriculums that include nature as part of their teaching process.So why should children work in the garden and grow their own vegetables? When we get our hands dirty with soil and plants, the bacteria trigger serotonin or happy hormones in our brains. When we deprive ourselves of these natural anti-depressants, it leads to obesity, ADHD and depression, says Eswar.These three schools in Bengaluru have included organic farming as part of their curriculum right from the first standard. They grow their own produce, compost and teach their students advanced techniques like vertical terrace gardening and greenhouse farming.BM English SchoolLocated in Hennur, BM English School has been actively involved in gardening and organic farming for more than 6 years. With an organic vegetable and herb garden in the campus, its students display a remarkable knowledge of plants. They also produce vegetables that are used for the canteen and compost waste. The school's 'Green Club' actively participates in farming, grows and sells vegetables and also takes part in famous organic farming events in the city such as Oota From Your Thota. The organic farming module was put into place by Dr. Vishwanath Kadur, the most renowned urban agriculturalist in Bangalore and a pioneer in organic terrace gardening in the country.Says Dr. S Rajesh, Principal of BM English School, We have organic farming as part of the curriculum from grade 1. There is one class a week. Each group is given a patch of land to cultivate. The older children make their own organic pesticide using neem oil, clove and turmeric. We also do not use hybrid seeds and seed making is an important part of our curriculum. Children grow vegetables and take home the produce.Prakriya Green Wisdom SchoolPrakriya Green Wisdom School goes one step ahead of an organic farming curriculum - it strives to be an all-round sustainable campus that grows its own produce through recycled wastewater and places its children in an environment that turns them into conscious users. Children learn from nature and work on patches of soil right from nursery. The school does not encourage junk food. The campus is a no plastic zone and a conscious living practice is developed throughout the childs stay in the school.Says Rema Kumar, Director of Prakriya Green Wisdom School, The whole idea is that when children grow their own food, they become co-producers and understand that everything is interconnected, including chemicals in insecticides and how they destroy the soils health in the long run. Our canteens food is nutritious and we use a lot of local vegetables and fruits that we cultivate. Water consciousness is another keen focus area. We have rain water harvesting and we recycle the water that we use in the canteen and kitchen. The campus has more than 100 varieties of trees and is home to vegetables and fruits, mostly of the local variety, including papaya, mango, guava, rajma, beetroot, carrots and beans.Salads are prepared at least thrice a week and the school composts vegetable waste from the canteen and children are encouraged to never waste food.As a society, we are not doing enough to avert the problems that surround us. Our children will have to face their consequences so we w ant them to understand that water crisis can be averted by using really sensible water management systems that have been practiced over a million years,"" says Kumar."

Insects which feed on plants are called as pests. In nature, these pests are consumed by the predator insects, that are garden friendly or farmer friendly. However, chemical farming has collapsed this balancing system in nature. Chemical pesticides kill predators and pests resistance towards these chemicals as well. In natural farming, pest management is based on the principle of 'prevention is better than cure'. Weaker plants are easily susceptible to pest attacks while healthy plants don't get affected by pests and thrive best if they grow in good quality soil. Humus is the best way to create healthy soil. Humus could be created by adding biomass and beneficial micro organisms to the soil. Desi cow dung and cow urine are the best sources of beneficial micro organisms. Creating healthy soil as well as the following simple gardening tips will help you to make your garden absolutely healthy.Plant protection tips for your gardenSeeds should be treated with a microbial culture before sowing, which gives protection from all fungal diseases.Providing proper space between plants will facilitate aeration and avoid spreading of disease between the plants.Marigold can be grown around the garden, as a trap crop. The yellow flower attracts pests and secures the main vegetable plants.Grow companion plants. When vegetables are grown with herbs, the herbs act as a repellent plant for pests. Tomato and tulsi can be grown in the same pot.Crop rotation should be followed. Grow different plants instead of same plants in each container. For example tomato - beans - onion can be grown consecutively in one year.Grow maize and cow pea in between vegetable plants. The maize and cow pea foliage attracts pests and prevent other vegetable crops from getting affected.If any plant or plant part gets affected by insects, remove the affected pant or plant part manually and use it for composting.Growing marigold and castor plants once in a while in the pot which will give protection from root nematodes.Have lights in the garden during night hours. The nocturnal pests, which are active during night time will get attracted by lights and does not affect the plants.Take a piece of yellow colour chart paper and apply castor oil on both sides and tie it on the plant. Adult pest insects get attracted by the yellow colour and acts as a sticky trap.Nursery trays could be covered with a mesh/net to avoid the fly attackAdd neem cake with the potting mixture to give protection from root diseases.All the above prevention measures give maximum control over pests. In case any further pest incidence to be observed in the garden then go for a repellent spray, which will not kill the pest but give a repellent effect to the pests.These tips will help you to get rid of the pests from the garden. If you still find any pest infestation then use a neem based spray on weekly intervals until it is controlled.For more information on urban farming or any other related queries contact author at nalini@artyplantz.com"

You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

Apart from flowers that she has been growing for years, four months back, a vegetable garden found its place on her terrace.Radish, spinach, brinjal, tomato, beans and chillies  its a proper kitchen garden. For a long time I have been wanting it but a kitchen garden requires a lot of personal attention. So, till I could personally be involved, it didnt make sense to set up the vegetable patches. Its been four months now and its looking good, says the Nature lover who buys the seeds from a nursery on ECR Road and adds egg shells and tea leaves from her kitchen into the manure mix.Kushboo believes in personal care and claims that her plants dont bloom like usual when she isnt around. Yes, there are people who take care of them when Im travelling erratically but when I come back, I see the changes... they havent bloomed well enough. Im not happy when I dont take care of the plants myself, says the actor who loves anything green.Sharing her school-time memories, she tells us about the date palms and tamarind trees. We would run early to school, collect the dates, wash and eat them. I would also climb the tamarind trees to pick the white flowers. No, no one stopped us. Our school was cool that way, she grins.You know when I lose my cool? When the plants are withered or dried up, and not taken care of. Nobody taught me how to garden properly nor is anyone in my family interested. I taught myself through trial and error. They need proper trimming and have to be watered according to the season, with an understanding of their needs! she further says."

The second time she repeated Gadagada gudugudu.. gadagada gudugudu, even the adults joined her. Asha, who hails from a teaching background, belongs to the Chennais Storytellers Association. I was told stories while having food. I was so fascinated by this, I took up storytelling. As a storyteller, I believe in reviving old stories, traditions and passing them to the younger ones, said Asha.But what was the gadagada, gudugudu all about? Well, Asha was narrating the story of Krishna Rao who owns the Woodlands Hotel, a city landmark. As she finishes the story, Sharanya went on stage and begins dancing to the songs of the good old Madras. She enlightens the kids about five things Madras is famous for  the Marina beach, hot idlis with a variety of chutney, the Vandaloor zoo, Sem Mozhi Poonga and the Rajni craze. As she finishes, Banu jumps onto the stage and narrates the story of Thiruverkaadu Amman temple.The trio has been associated with storytelling for many years, and now has learnt new tricks to ensure kids can relate to what they say. Well, a few kids grasp immediately, while a few look at our actions and pick it up slowly. For some others, it is the rhyming words and songs that help them understand what is told. So when it comes to Madras Day stories, we try and incorporate all of these so that they can relate it to, says Sharanya.Today, Chennai has many heritage buildings and sites. How important is it for kids to know about these historic structures? I personally feel its very important for all of us who stay/live in this city to know about its history and heritage, says Banu. Of all the places that have become history, Asha says she misses the Moore Market complex most. Well, I treasure the hours I spent shopping there. I still remember buying books for 90 paisa, a basket for 25 paisa and I miss that place a lot.As she finishes, Sharanya drifts her thoughts to the days when Drive-in Woodlands was a happening-spot in the city. The bread and peas that used to be served there for breakfast used to be my favourite. The bread would be toasted with butter on plain tawa with the onion, tomato and green peas curry. Even today I pine for it, she laughed."

I specialise in North Indian cuisine, and I love cooking Rajasthani, Kashmiri and Bengali. Although I havent tried South Indian cuisine much, Ive learnt one item, Ardha Pathi or Adai, which my boss in Delhi loves.Indian cuisine is vast and there are so many things to experiment with, so I would still say that I am in the learning process. In the south, although there are many North Indian restaurants, I always find that theres a South Indian touch to it, just like how I cook South Indian food in Delhi. I use curry leaves instead of coriander in sambhar, and people like it that way there. The base for North Indian cuisine is onions and tomatoes. Like in the south, people use tamarind to get a sour flavour, in the north we use tomatoes to give a tangy touch. Today, I find people are open to all kinds of cuisines, and they want a change from the routine they are used to.I believe in cooking authentic food rather than innovative food. Im not against fusion, but I feel it can be adopted while presenting a dish rather than while preparing it. Let me share a funny incident that I faced in a restaurant a few years back. I had ordered a kofta, and the way they presented it was funny. It had a cup with gravy, a loaf of crispy bread placed over the cup and the kofta balls placed aside. However, the beauty of the dish is that the kofta balls should be soaked in the sauce/gravy! (laughs)Some of my vegetarian specialties are Butte ke Kabab, made from corn kernels, nuts and spicies, which are made into patties and cooked in kebab style. This is a vegetarianNorth Indian dish. In non-vegetarian, my specialities include Tandoori Jinga, Chicken Tikka and Tandoori Chicken.The kind of ingredients used play a major role in making sure the taste is retained in a dish. Today even in the south, we get all the ingredients required to cook North Indian food. But there are a few exceptions like the kachri powder (used to bring a sour taste to a dish), which I bring from Delhi. When it comes to dessert, the main difference is that North Indian desserts do not use coconut at all, while in the South, several desserts have coconut as a base."

Most of the Kudumbasree units are already engaged in organic farming in their respective areas.The programme has been titled as Harvest in three cents (Moonu centil veetham polivu). As part of the project all Kudumabsree members will also grow vegetables at their houses, utilising available space.Those who are interested in farming will be supplied with seeds and saplings through panchayats. For students, the same will be supplied through schools. Organic manure will be supplied on a subsidised rates to those who take up farming.Meanwhile, most of the local bodies have launched various initiatives as part of Haritha Keralam.At Amballoor panchyat, organic cultivation was launched on nearly two and a half acres of land. The vegetables being grown here include long beans, ladys finger, spinach, tomato and plantain.With this initiative, we are planning to carry out the ward level plans for organic farming to another level, said Amballoor panchayat president Jalaja Mohan.The two and a half acres at Poyyattithazham will be used for the cultivation. A group of farmers from the panchayath has already agreed to carry out the work. The vegetables will be cultivated organically by using compost and cow dung as the main manures, she added."

His action resulted from acute frustration over plummeting market price of tomatoes which stood at Rs 50 a box. Hailing from Anantapur, the farmer had spent Rs 60 per box in just bringing his produce to the city.This is not an isolated case and is bound to have happened, say experts, attributing it to demonetisation. It has not made it easy, but added on to the misery of small and marginal farmers, that started two years ago with severe drought in TS and AP.These small and marginal farmers have not seen the light of the day for two years now. Leave alone recovering costs of cultivation and making profits, they are not earning anything to make ends meet, remarked Pidigam Saidaiah, assistant professor, Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University.Small and marginal farmers have shifted to cultivating short-term crops because of drought.Also, productivity of horticulture crops is high during winter. Hence there is a lot of supply. With no money and people opting to buy from markets and going cashless, these farmers are running in loss, pointed Saidaiah.The cost of cultivation in this season can be estimated to be Rs 6 per kg and an added Rs 2 for transportation. While the official cost was Rs 4 per kg on Wednesday, this farmer was quoted Rs 2 for his produce.You cannot even call it a no loss or no profit. He also has to go back and there is no guarantee that he would sell all of it, said Saidaiah, adding that this has become the trend with farmers selling horticulture crops that include fruits and vegetables."

This green inititative comes from a group of women under the banner of Women Entrepreneur Belagavi (WEB) Association.They have launched these idols made of natural clay, in association with a Bengaluru-based organisation. These idols, instead of creating pollution after Visarjan (immersion), grow into plants.What is interesting is that you dont have to take the idol to any water body for immersion. It can be done at your home itself without creating any kind of pollution.Sonia Netalkar of WEB said the height of the statue is 10 inches and the base tub about 8 inches. The total weight of the set is about 5 kg, she added.Explaining the concept of a green Ganesha, she said the statue is placed at the base filled with organic coco peat.She said: Coco peat is very light, highly compressible and readily absorbs and retains moisture. All of these factors make it perfect for horticultural applications.Sonia said the idol is filled with Tulsi and tomato seeds. During the immersion, the devotee will just have to place the set in a gallery or terrace or garden and pour water on it.In about three days, the idol dissolves and seven days later, one can find a sapling of tomato or tulsi grown in that same base, she said.As this is a novel concept, we need to spread awareness. This year we want to sell 108 idols, each costing `1,151. Already more than 60 idols have been booked, she said.Rasika Kadolkar of WEB said these green idols will make the festival pollution-free without diluting the spirit of the celebrations.According to the pollution control board officials, Plaster of Paris idols may take several months to years to fully dissolve. This material also reduces the oxygen level in the water, killing fish and other aquatic organisms, they added."

An auction takes place there. Traders from a wide area come to pick up huge volumes of vegetables. Its a unique market. The bids begin past midnight and the deals last through the wee hours. Prahallad Sahu hasnt been there in more than a week. Its 10 km from his village of Kalangapali but whats the point?There have been good years for Prahallad there but 2016 has been different. Tomato was going for a measly Rs 2 a kg, so he decided not to hire labour and made his family harvest the crop. Some of this seasons produce was picked up for that paltry price but the traders came to the village to pick it up. The rest is rotting in field.Vegetables had been a fetching crop for farmers in Bargarh block in previous years. This year too the yields had been bumper but then demonetisation drove the traders away. The only traders turning up in the market are those who had buy-back deals with farmers and had paid in advance. They got by the challenge of procuring fertilizers and seedlings by arranging credit, but paying for labour has no such solution. Many of the farmers have money in the bank but there are limits on how much you can withdraw.Winter is when vegetable prices soar. So theres hope when this demonetisation thing ends on Dec 30. When this crisis is over and we can sell vegetables for some profit again, said Uddhaba Deep, a farmer in Jamurda village. No one in Bargarh has read Shaktikanta Dass latest time horizon for that.Farmers who had already sold their produce before Narendra Modis bombshell on Nov. 8 ought to be happier, but they arent. Bipin Biswal is a cabbage farmer who sold his harvest before Nov. 8 and put his money in the bank. Now its locked and he cant pay his labourers. Really, the only lucky ones have been those who engaged local labourers. Villagers here have revived an age-old to cope with demonetization: they pay them in rice and vegetables. Farmers who employed migrant workers dont the luxury or barter.Bidyadhar Pradhan owes his labour contractor Rs 43,000. He can withdraw a maximum of Rs 24,000 per week from the bank. If he chooses to pay off the labourers as they are breathing down his neck, he has to forego preparing his field for the rabi rice. Hes got some tight management to do: he feeds his labourers twice a day and plies them with tea so they will a bit longer. Or, if the stars will it, his kharif crop will be sold and there will be money to pay them off.Some farmers said the heck with it and sold to any trader who will pay them in cash at whatever price, profit or loss, throwaway or handsome. Vegetable grower Shatrughan Mallick got rid of his entire lot of ladies fingers at one go. At least I got some money, he said.Take away the gnawing demonetization worries, villages in Bargarh have been sent back in time to days when apparently -- like in the Desh ki Dharti movies of the 1950s and 1960s -- kind neighbours helped out in each others fields and sang songs when the rain came. Since everybody is in the same boat, the merchants and traders of Bargarh are being sympathetic to the farmers, offering fertilizer and pesticides on credit.The villagers are ignorant but they never cheat and are very conscious of their prestige in the village. So they repay immediately after receiving the proceeds of their harvest, said a local merchant.Funny how the cashless economy has put rural India in the warm embrace of feudal practices."

The buffet will be at offer for guests and visitors on December 24 and 25 and is likely to feature close to 20 desserts, he adds.The roasted pumpkin soup was a warm and traditional start to the dinner. The soup is soothing, with the pulp mashed to a puree, leaves a hint of garlic and thyme taste. The pine nuts adds a crunchy bite to the soups.The Chicken Consomme looks like green tea with shreds of coriander leaves. The soup is thinner than the usual chicken broths, the consomme is carved into the shape of a rose and is stuffed with minced chicken.The Eggplant Parmigiani won the festive spread, with the vegetables spiced circlular slices baked well, with a smoky skin on, aligned over each other.The tomato sauce tastes of a pure extract and garlic. Although not a fan of cheese layered over eggplant, here the whole ensemble just melts in the mouth and the acidity of the tomato sauce strikes the right balance for deliciousness.The mushroom lasagna too is a tomato puree based vegetarian preparation. The tiny button mushroom chops are layered between the lasagna sheets and served with the garlic-tomato sauce and topped with basil. Enjoyed the dish, but my mind still wanders around how tasty the parmigiani was.Despite being a dessert person, this ensemble was a bit of a disappointment for me.The plum cake in a star cutout was just a regular tasting one and nothing extraordinary and same goes for the most desserts on my table.The pumpkin pie would be my best bet if you wish to end your meal on a sweet and satisfactory note."

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments.

BJP think tank here feels that too much activism in the case has given more publicity to the former MP than she deserves.Elders in the BJP as well as its fringe groups feel that the film actress has been known for her inhospitable statements in the past too and there is no point in making her a public hero by giving her all undue publicity. Even her appreciation of Pakistan should have been ignored as it is inconsequential in the present situation. By overdoing it, we are in fact playing into the hands of the Congress party, they said.Mysuru-Kodagu MP Pratap Simha has already gone on record saying what was the need to send her to Pakistan for SAARC youth conference as she is not a peoples representative.Lok Sabha member from Dakshina Kannada Nalin Kumar Kateel who is now camping in Kerala overseeing the arrangements for a BJP national executive meeting told Express that Ramya is a novice in politics and has strange ways of reacting to issues. She does not deserve so much attention, he said.Ramyas mood in Mangaluru was jovial on Thursday. She never stopped smiling during her four-hour outing in the city despite being subjected to humiliations. Youth Congress leaders who accompanied her said she was happy for all the attention she got.Public attention and media glare has made her a hit in not just the coast but elsewhere, they said.Ramya has lost mental balance, say BJP workersMandya: BJP party workers staged a protest against former MP Ramya condemning her statement that Pakistan is not hell. Hundreds of BJP workers who gathered at the Siver Jubilee Park raised slogans against her and threw tomatoes and eggs at her banner. Ramya has lost her mental balance after returning from Pakistan. She should not give statements which hurts the feelings of people, warned the protesters."

However, the free food is being wasted by some pilgrims leaving others hungry.Owing to a heavy rush during Krishna Pushkaralu, around 55 voluntary organisations and philanthropists have set up stalls in the 20 Pushkar Nagars to feed the pilgrims. Vegetable biryani, lemon rice, curd rice, tomato rice and sambar rice are being offered to the pilgrims at many makeshift tents. In the wake of consecutive holidays during the weekend, voluntary organisations made elaborate arrangements to feed as many as pilgrims they can.But the situation was different at many Pushkar Nagars as many dumper bins were seen filled with the excess food thrown away by the pilgrims. Pilgrims who arrived late at the Pushkar Nagars, were forced to return with empty stomachs as the food packets were exhausted.Karanam Jogayya, pilgrim from Lakkavarapu Kota in Vizianagaram district, expressed his dissatisfaction over the officials for their failure in monitoring the food supply near the Pushkar Nagars. I cant afford the food at roadside eateries which were being sold out at an exorbitant prices. The voluntary organisations should not confine themselves to particular area, they should spread their activity to other places to feed the hungry, he said.Most of the pilgrims at Pushkar Nagar near Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) and city railway station had bitter experience and left the place with hunger. We have prepared estimations to supply lemon rice and sambar rice for 30,000 pilgrims per day, said D Chalapathi Rao, an NGO volunteer at PNBS.From Day One of Krishna Pushkarams, Chalapathi Rao said that they have noticed that most of the pilgrims were taking excess food as a precautionary measure but throwing it away after all of them ate. To reduce wastage, we deployed additional volunteers near the queue lines to control the food wastage. Every pilgrim should feel responsible and extend their support in controlling the food wastage, he maintained.Meanwhile, the roadside eateries and hotels dotting the main stretches increased the rates of eatables and were fleecing the pilgrims. Pilgrims complained that the roadside eateries and hotels were charging anywhere around `10-20 per dish in excess of the prices mentioned in the menu. If opposed, many hotel staff were asking the pilgrims to leave. Some hotels have adopted a clever tactic. Though prices were not changed, they have reduced the quantity per each dish, said Raghavendra, a kirana shop owner."

Moreover, since it is located on the canal bund and restrictions have been imposed on vehicle movement in the area, even if the wholesale market is kept open it will not be accessible. The local vendors are sourcing the vegetable from other areas and hence, the increase in prices coupled with the shortage of vegetables, said K Sivashankar, a roadside vegetable vendor in Satyana rayanapuram.Out of fear, people are hoarding veggies in large quantities for the next 12 days. Even if vegetables arrive tomorrow, the cost may touch the sky. So, we are buying and stocking them for the next fortnight, explained P Sirisha of Ayodhya Nagar.However, the marketing officials in Krishna district say there is no need to worry. We decided to open rythu bazaars in the city, round-the-clock during Krishna Pushkarams. We are also operating as many as 20 mobile rythu bazaars in areas that are at considerable distance from the nearest rythu bazaar, said J Ravi Kumar, assistant director of marketing.There are six rythu bazaars in the city including the one at Ibrahimpatnam and running them round-the-clock will certainly help. When pointed out that potatoes, tomatoes and onions are not grown in Vijayawada region and have to be imported from other parts, the official said they have made alternate arrangements even though restrictions on vehicles have been imposed in Vijayawada.The government itself will supply potatoes, onions and tomatoes to rythu bazaars during Pushkarams.

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

She entered Patnagarh via Gaiselet in Bargarh district where her vehicle was first attacked with eggs. She was shown black flags at Dalpali.As Chhuria ignored it and moved ahead, similar demonstration was staged at Ramji Chowk in Patnagarh town. The police, who were clueless, changed the route. But the move proved futile and the Ministers vehicle came under attack at the bus stand and at Dhumabhata Chowk of the town. The workers hurled eggs and tomatoes at the vehicle.While police took BJP worker Dhananjay Rout into custody at Ramji Chowk, partys district secretary Shailabala Bag and Mahila Morcha leader Pramodini Bhorasagar were detained at Dumabhata.An undeterred Chhuria went ahead and attended the programme at Subhadra Bhawan of the town before proceeding to Khaprakhol to attend the next programme.Chhuria said she was unperturbed by the incident as she had come to work for the welfare and uplift of women. People should understand that the area is lagging behind in development and things need to be set right for their benefit. Politics and development of the area are two different things and it is not right to mix the two, she said.Police, who were caught unawares, detained three BJP workers, including two women, for their alleged involvement in the incident.The detention kicked off another storm with Balangir district BJP president Bhaktabandhu Nayak claiming that policemen were deployed to pick up women BJP workers. The BJP also gheraoed Patnagarh police station protesting detention of BJP workers and demanding their release.Admitting that BJP workers had hurled eggs, Nayak said the Minister was scheduled to attend three State Government programmes in Patnagarh sub-division but local MLA K V Singhdeo was invited only for the Monday evening function making it difficult for him to be present. It was an intentional agenda of the ruling BJD and will not be tolerated, Nayak added.On September 13, eggs were pelted at the vehicle of Agriculture Minister Pradip Maharathy during his visit to Balangir."

In Ernakulam market, the wholesale and retail vegetable merchants have already begun to feel the heat with the sales registering a 20 to 40 per cent dip. The prices will likely pick up in the coming days, they hoped.The prices of perishable veggies like tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, chillies, okra and drumsticks have gone down. Vegetables like tomatoes, which are available through all seasons, are bought by wholesalers on the basis of the demand. Though there is a genuine demand for tomatoes among customers, the retailers are in a tough spot due to lack of lower denomination notes which can be given out as change.Some retail vegetable vendors were left with no other option than accepting the old Rs 500 notes. Most of the vendors urged the customers to buy veggies for at least a minimum of Rs 300 if they were to accept the old Rs 500 note. Every political party which comes to power brings in new policies and these create difficulties for the public, said Bhava, resident of Kadavanthra.The retail vendors said that on Saturday and Sunday, they had to sell their vegetables at a price lesser than the market in order to sell off the stock. I still accept the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. If I do not accept them, my business will go down.

Many denizens in the city wrap themselves in their woollens and head to the Old City. The delicious gourmet itinerary, of course, leads them to the bowlfuls of nalli nihari, paaya, marag, and kaleji gurda washed down with piping hot Irani Chai.What is common about these comfort winter food items is that they are all made from juicy mutton/beef chunks or succulent chicken. But what about those who, by choice or not by choice, are hard-core vegetarians? Do they have a choice? Well, if you are a vegetarian and want to beat the winter chills we bring to you the list of delights that are prepared only with veg ingredients and keep you equally warm as would a liver pie do. Read on to mark the same in your winter bucket list:Classic Cheese LasagnaThis one dish can never fail you. Thick cheese layered with lasagna sheets and a whole gamut of other finger-licking ingredients like cherry tomatoes, button mushrooms, zucchini, bell peppers and, of course, marble onions. What actually keeps you warm is the use of basil and oregano - the herbs known for their unique warmth-providing properties. A dig into the sinful layers and you feel comforted immediately - the rich taste stays with you till you head to bed. Recommended places: 10D, Deli9 and Autumn Leaf Cafe.Date palm halwaRich in nutrients and a handful of these desert fruits ensures that your energy levels remain high during the day. Sweet in itself, the fruit when cooked, doesnt need any sugar in it. Preparation of halwa just needs a box of fresh juicy date palms de-seeded and cooked on slow flame in milk. The result is a smooth mixture dark like winter night itself. A few spoonfuls with a glass of milk provides warmth enough to beat the chill.Mewa laddooWell, ask your grandmother and shell tell you the tales of mortal and pestle crushing those ochre coloured nuts into a granular powder that would be mixed with sugar, some ghee and translucent chunks of fried edible gum. The result - globules of warmth. Have two of these laddoos in the morning and you are set to take off your jacket even if the weathermans chill wind prediction comes true. Almond House is the best place to get a boxful.Beetroot RisottoFaint scarlet with that mix of fresh herbs - this is a must-try. The richness of seasonal vegetables paired with goat cheese makes this dish winter essential bringing to you the feel of balmy Italian afternoons. You can relish beetroot risotto at Tuscany, Trident Hyderabad with champagne or white wine. Shares chef Manik, Such foods are real comforters even if they are prepared with vegetables.

The ginger and garlic flavoured soya chunks, steamed in a bamboo were quite easily forgetabble. The chicken however, with a similar treatment was flavourful and well emulsified with the spices.The drumstick soup is thick, with palak and dal adding consistency to its texture. The soup stands by its name, tastes of dumstrick extract, dal and leaves a pepper hit in the end.The corn fried with til, served with garlic sauce leaves an oily after taste and the primary falvour you get is of the batter and cooked corn.The fixed vegetarian meal is soothing, filling and definitely my best take away from the place.The dal is took thick in consistency, for those who like it a little thinner and liquid-y, give this one a miss.The sambar and rasam is much like it is cooked in any South Indian household, same goes for the vermicelli paysam, which wasnt warm. However, paysam is served cold at some places, I learnt later.My recommendation from the place is the tomato chutney - a very simple mash of the vegetable with no mixing of sorts, the ginger pickle and the gongura - a traditional Andhra chutney.Experiment with the non vegetarian cuisine, if you are a meat lover, but if like me, you favour the greens, keep it simple and fixed meals order maadi!Nandhana Palace has inaugurated Amarvathi Foods Special at Shakaranagar."

And it gets spicier when it comes to colloquial and cuisine. What better way to witness the same on chefs table? Thats why we got to sample food prepared by chefs from North and South at K&K, ITC Kakatiya. Whats interesting to note that the food festival is titled Bade Miyan, Chhote Miyan. The celebrity chef Imtiaz Qureshi was supposed to come, but couldnt make it. Instead, chef Nisar Waris from ITC Maratha came and joined hands with chef Aamer Jamal and rustled up Awadhi dishes with a one or two Dakhani delights.One thing that ruled the roost was the use of kewra and silver varak on the dishes. For example, Murgh Chaandi Tikka lived up to its name wrapped in thin too-delicate-to-touch silver. And it was not just the tikkas, Kakori Kebab, too had hints of the thin-like-air silver foil. Chefs brought on table dishes cooked with traditional methods that were and are unique. Murgh Khushk Purdah was one such dish. No, the chicken pieces werent hidden anywhere, the pot in which the chunks were put was covered with dough that had turned crisp with heat.Inside, the meat was cooked with greentbell peppers, chunks of tomatoes and some red wine. Explained chef Jamal, This was the traditional method of cooking. The use of wine is more to do with English battalions and officers invited at the royal dinners of Awadh. This is a typical dum cooking method in which the dough layer, better known as purdah, is savoured with the curry inside.The recipes are from the star chef Imtiaz Qureshi himself. The food items have prepared with traditional dum method and thats why the pieces dissolve in the mouth and are so well-cooked.The festival will be on till October 2. Its only for dinner and is priced at `3,000++ taxes"

The dossier addressed key areas that the Central, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments must concentrate on to ensure for the smooth enforcement of the much awaited bill.The central government had on June 14 released a model law comprising 169 sections. We have gone through those sections and we are recommending a set of aspects which need to be clarified, said co-chairman of FTAPCCI JS Kasunendra.The recommendations are a set of aspects which need to be clarified. FTAPCCI has already submitted the recommendations to the Centre on the business module consisting of registration, payment, return and refund, said Ravindra Modi, President of FTAPCCI. We are going to submit the same to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and also to the empowered committee of state finance minister on GST, he added.The Telangana state government had on Tuesday ratified the Bill, thus becoming the tenth state to do so. After fulfilling the requirement of ratification from 15 states the bill is now at the table of the President of India for his approval.Speaking on the key sectors that will need careful intervention from the central government, Ravindra Modi said We have identified some key areas that need to be discussed, the food processing industry is one of them. Take an example of food processing industry where the farmer who sells tomato or mango do not pay tax but the converted products like ketchup and mango pulps need to be pay taxes,. There is no input credit from those products. The consumer is bearing the tax of those products. So we recommend the government to extend the deemed input tax credit to the food processing industry. Similarly the subsidy in the fertilizer industry will also have to pay GST so subsidy should be excluded from the preview of GST, he added.One of the important issues is dual control. The GST will be controlled by both central and state governments. We recommend to have a single control and it should be a rotating method, said S Tirumalai, advisor of FTAPCCI.We want the Central government to provide an educational guide about the GST. Majority of the industries and businesses are not clear about the GST law. We intend to help the business and industrial sectors to get a clear idea about the law, he added."

We have enough tomato and other vegetables stocks, which we import from India only in case of shortages in the domestic market,"" he said.The reason behind the ""suspension"" of cotton imports from India was, nevertheless, different, he said.""No. We have not stopped cotton imports from India. It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions. We're looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong,"" Shami said.He said only those cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes where importers had already secured permits from his department and carried phyto-sanitary certificates.""Our cotton consignments are not being allowed to enter Pakistan through Wagah and Karachi for reasons known to the ministry but cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn is being brought in without any let or hindrance. At least 11 trucks of Indian yarn entered Pakistan on Thursday when the department stopped cotton consignments from coming to this side of the border,"" a textile factory owner told Dawn.He said the suspension of cotton import from India would create a huge problem for the textile exporters as the truncated domestic crop target of 11.25 million bales for this year appeared difficult if not impossible to meet.""The industry requires 14 million bales. We will still be short by three million bales of cotton even if the crop target is achieved,"" he said.He said cotton shortages after the ban on Indian imports would make domestic prices shoot up at the expense of exports.Pakistan had imported 2.7 million bales of cotton (1 baleis 170 kgs) - about 40 per cent of India's total cotton exports in 2015-16 - due to crop failure that wiped off 0.5 per cent of GDP growth.

Cooked to perfect thick consistency, the tomato flavour drumstick leaf soup is creamy and delectable. The drumstick leaves lace the spicy soup with a bitter taste.The Chettinad cuisine served here offers a wide variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. For starters, there are Palkatti Chukka, Kaikari Kola Urundai, Chettinadu Egg Roast, Chicken Leg Roast and Kuvepoo Kara Varuval.Palkatti Chukka is batter-fried paneer cubes tossed in Chettinad masala. The crunchy cubes are served along with generous amount of lightly fried curry leaves and shallots. The Kaikari Kola Urundai are fried balls of minced vegetables coated with bread crumbs. They are laced with Chettinad spices. Boiled egg is fried crispy for Chettinadu Egg Roast. They taste zesty.The Chicken Leg Roast is tawa roasted. The sounf-flavoured chicken drumsticks are juicy. Marinated with spices, the drumsticks are pan fried. This crunchy appetiser has a blend of ground masala and curry leaves. The Kuvepoo Kara Varuval has some crispy fried cauliflower florets tossed in Chettinad spices. Though the name suggests Kara, meaning spicy, it is not spicy at all.All the preparations are garnished with curry leaves lending them a strong aroma and flavour to the food. Though the Chettinad cuisines are believed to be spicy and rich, these food preparations are made less spicy, customised to the taste of the Bengalureans. Though, towards the end, everything tastes the same.For the main course, there is the Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryani. Both look appetising and colourful but, on tasting, the dish is mediocre. The chicken pieces in the biryani are bland. The Kothu Parota is a better option with tangy and moist tomatoes and caramelised onions.The desserts are the best.

Of the four crore eggs, nearly 50 per cent remain unsold after demonetisation.We cannot stop production and at the same time have to feed the live birds which involves huge cost.The poultry industry provides livelihood to a significant section of rural population, Reddy said.As government has been accepting old currency notes as payment for property tax, water and power bills and arrears, it should also accept old currency notes to purchase eggs and chicken, at least for next three weeks.Reddy also wanted the bankers to impose a moratorium on loan repayment by poultry farmers for a year.Telangana Poultry Federation president Erraballi Pradeep Rao said vegetables as well as non-vegetarian food are perishable in nature.Thus, the government should accept old notes to purchase eggs and chicken till the stocks are sold out.The months of November and December are crucial for the poultry industry as production is high during this time, besides consumption of chicken also being high.Therefore, the state government should realise the issue and accept old currency notes of the denomination `500 and `1,000 to purchase eggs and chicken for few weeks, Pradeep Rao said."

I could draw parallels between the spicy chunky tomato salsa to Indian tomato chutney grinded at home as the Mexican cuisine festival was made more Indian by the chefs at My Caf restaurant in My Fortune. Had it not been for the texture and cheese I would have easily been mistaken. The Tex-Mex festival which has been on-going since November 23 will host its final round this weekend.First we had Cheese Quesadillas, which is in fact Tortillas, a traditional bread of Mexico made either from corn or wheat and rolled in circles, just like roti. Grilled bell pepper and goat cheese was sandwiched between the tortillas. Salsa sauce and sour cream was served along with boiled veggies that made the plate a visual relish.Next came the Enchiladas, which was another version of tortilla cuisine. Filled with goat cheese and veggies and coated with shredded cheese, the hint of spicy Enchilada sauce was a mild zing. The salty and mild cheese balanced the hotness of sauces.Fish cakes, served after the Enchiladas was the show stealer. As a lover of seafood, I savoured the juicy fish meat. The fish fillet was shallow fried and kept tangy with the essence of lime. The first bite was like a drizzle in my mouth.Then Tacos abounding in jalepenos, tomatoes, yellow capsicum, chicken pieces, lettuce and pineapples followed, which was refreshing to taste. The tacos were soft and cunchy. The sour cream was in harmony with the outpouring and moist goat cheese.The food was kept true to its a la carte nature and it is ideal if you want to grab some Indian-Mexican bites with some chilled beer. But I did expect a bit more variety especially with the sauces. Salsa and sour cream is almost overrated for all Mexican cuisine. Where are my Guacamole Taquero and Chiltomate at?"

One fine morning, executive chef Prakash Chettiyar and he headed to Kozhikode to unravel the magic that left many drooling. They visited the kitchens of Kozhikodes favourite and famous food haunts, tasting and learning the secrets.And, for those who want to have a taste of the treasure (read: handful of tasty tips), one can have it at the month-long Kozhikodan food festival, going on at Cassava, Kochi Marriott.We wanted to know why people thought the Kozhikodan variety was supreme. That was the whole motive behind the journey. It is not just about the biriyani, but other dishes like the fish curry, too. Undoubtedly, Kozhikode is a foodies haven. The journey in search of food gave us the first-hand experience, says Saji.He also learnt some valuable biriyani lessons: the first being the meat used. In chicken biriyani, the difference lay in the chicken used. The taste of Kozhikodan biriyani is the white leghorn breed. The meat is firm but very juicy. That makes a lot of difference, says the chef.Even the spices are minimal. There isnt an excess of flavours. The balance is perfect, says the chef, who has replicated the technique at Cassava, including the cooking method.Slow cooking is the key. It should be the heat that cooks, and not the flame. It takes over one hour and 40 minutes to prepare it, says the chef.Saji also speaks about how flavour overdrive can kill the taste. Meen Mulakittath is a famous Kozhikodan dish. They usually have it with porotta. The secret of the curry is that it is cooked using tomatoes for the sour taste. Unlike in other parts of Kerala, the people dont use tamarind. The advantage is the curry doesnt kill the taste of porotta. It is such subtle things that give the dish its authentic taste, says Saji.The food festival also features dishes like beef dry fry, chicken chukka and the Kuttichira-special chemeen charu.The people here are very innovative when it comes to food, says Saji. Try kozhikal, a vegetarian snack made of tapioca, besan, maida and rice flour, you will know how. Vegetarians can also try the koon pathiri (mushroom pathiri)."

Several decades ago, with no bakeries, families in Italy used to bake breads at home. Bread is a must on the menu.The dining begins with a welcome watermelon drink. The starters consist of Bread Sticks, Baked Zucchini, Aranchini and Bruschetta. The platter is simple yet appealing.The round Aranchini, made of rice is crunchy outside and creamy inside. There are breads in different shapes and sizes too. The Bruschetta is said to complement many dishes. The bread is topped with fresh chopped tomatoes and sprinkled with salt and pepper which helps draw out the tomato juice. The sweet and tart flavours magically blend in your mouth. Even people who dont care much for tomatoes will be tempted to have a bite.The slice of Zucchini is baked with ricotta cheese and mixed with veggies, lending it a fresh flavour and creamy texture. The pizzas on the menu are with a thin crust and named after different places in Rome. The Trinita Dei Monti is named after the church in Italy. The velvety ricotta cheese lends it a sweetness. The asparagus topped on the light pizza base is crunchy.The Colosseo Pizza is topped with cheese and crushed black pepper. More the black pepper, better the taste. In Quirinale, cream of broccoli, you can get the raw and bitter taste of the florets.The Pincio is unique. Topped with thin slices of ham, decorated with figs, they are perfect to romance with this monsoon.

There was gym for the fitness freaks and spa for those who wanted instant rejuvenation. The executive chef with his team would throw a surprise at each meal, one excelling the other.The best of Continental and Indian cuisines won the hearts of many, adding inches to their midriffs by the end of the trip !! With exotic dishes, just to name a few, a typical dinner menu would read like this: Assorted Pasta in Tangy Cocktail Dressing, Mulligatawny Soup, Grilled Fish served with Lemon Butter sauce, Supreme of Chicken in Tomato, Basil and Black Olive Sauce, Fried Fish with Black Pepper, Mangalore Chicken Curry, Mysore Brinjal Curry, Masoor Dal, Kori Roti , Steamed Rice...all this topped with Mango Cheese Cake, Elaichi Shrikand and tea or coffee! Rocked into sleep by the gentle swaying of the train, we woke up at Mysore with a special ensemble playing clarinet on the platform. We had breakfast on the train and left in the luxury coach for sight- seeing. Starting with the magnificent Mysore Palace, known as the Amba Vilas Palace, it is one of the grandest structures and the official residence of the Wodeyars, the erstwhile royal family of Mysore. Designed by Henry Irwin, here the Indo-Saracenic architecture blends with Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and Gothic styles, with two splendid darbar halls stealing the show.In Srirangapatna, the capital of Tipu Sultans kingdom, his summer palace is an outstanding structure that was built entirely with French rosewood, complete with pillars, arches and balconies. The walls are adorned with many interesting murals depicting battles. Gumbaz is where the tombs of Tipu Sultan, his father Hyder Ali and mother Fakrunnisa Begum lie. It has a beautiful dome above, ivory inlaid doors and finely carved stone windows. That night our dinner was at the splendid Lalitha Mahal Palace Hotel, another imposing structure built by the Mysore Maharaja specially to host his British guests.Our journey continued, to regions of yore, to hear the tales of lore .......on the Golden Chariot. Thus I embarked on a heritage trail rolling on the Royal Wheels. Visiting history, feeling proud of our rich cultural legacy my voyage continued. More of it later, next week!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; blogs at www.vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

Just make a trip to any of the Barbeque Nations outlets for Dilli Wali Khau Galli Festival.Were serving some usual favourites such as chaats, parathas and different types of kebabs, says Chef Ashish Rai, Head - Culinary, Barbeque Nation.Our meal at the restaurant begins with starters. Barbequed Pudina Ananas Ke Tikke  a grilled pineapple roast with mint flavour  and Dhelvi Paneer Teh Pe Teh  barbequed cottage cheese coated in mint, besan, etc  steal our hearts.I am a yoghurt fan and so enjoy the next, Dahi ke kebab, which is yogurt-based and vermicelli-coated. The dahi oozes out of the kebab, which is to be had with mint chutney with curd and amchur powder and khajoor ki chatni.Fish used in Surkh Fish Tikka in non-vegetarian starters is fresh. But Tandoori Murgh Akbari is a disappointment.Nimoda Tandoori Zinga, as the name suggests, has lemon marination. The dish with fresh prawn was the best among the starters, with its mix of lemon and spice.Dehlvi Shahi Chaap, a single bone strip of mutton chaap (chop) seasoned with Indian spices, is dry and powdery. Fathepuri Ka Fry Chicken, seasoned with spices could have been juicier.I make sure to hit the chaats live counter before moving on to the main course.Pani Puri comes first, with its aloo sabji and diced onions. The pani is just the right amount of tangy, sweet and spicy.The buffet has a wide variety of dishes.Sarai Ki Muglai Dum Biryani and Ballimaran Ka Gosht Pulao taste the same until we bite into chicken in the former and mutton into later. We recommend Ballimaran Ka Gosht Pulao because the spices are perfect and the mutton is fresh.The vegetarians are treated to Makhmali Paneer, the cottage cheese is as makhmali as the name promises. The tangy tomato flavour in the gravy makes it a treat.Dunkaar Anjeer Kofta Curry is artistically prepared with anjeer wrapped inside cottage cheese. The soft cottage cheese complements the crunchy anjeer seeds.Kache Paneer Ka Biryani and Chandni Chowk Ki Subz Briyani stand out with their cottage cheese and vegetables cooked to perfection.In desserts, Tiramisu is the best for its creamy texture and Dark Cheesy Brownie lives up to its name. Jama Masjid Ka Shahi Tukda, which is bread dipped in milkmaid, resembles Double Ka Meetha. Pan Kulfi does not make us miss paan. After a heavy meal, it tastes like paan served with gulkand and sweeteners.The festival is on till August 7."

""This year, they had a scheduling conflict. Actually, they just couldn't take my jokes anymore,"" the president said.His nephews, Austin and Aaron Robinson, filled in admirably. Obama joked they had not yet been turned cynical by Washington. ""They still believe in bad puns. They still believe in the grandeur of this occasion,"" Obama said. ""They still have hope.""The White House asked people on Twitter to vote for which turkey will receive the pardon, though both will get a reprieve. The White House even provided a biography for each bird to help voters with their decision. For example, Tater's favorite snack is worms. Tot prefers tomato slices. Each 18-week-old bird weighed in at about 40 pounds.While only one could be named the ""National Thanksgiving Turkey,"" the White House said that both birds will be sent to their new home at Virginia Tech's ""Gobblers Rest"" where they will be cared for by veterinarians and students.The ceremony also gave Obama a chance to reflect on the spirit of Thanksgiving. Obama said it's a time to remember that ""we have a lot more in common than divides us."" He also challenged Americans to show the world that the United States is a generous and giving country, and to make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving.After the ceremony, the president and first family served Thanksgiving meals to residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington. The campus is home to 405 previously enlisted service members, who represent every campaign since World War I. Obama served the turkey and gravy and briefly chatted with veterans and workers as they went through the line.First lady Michelle Obama served beans and spinach, while Sasha provided the mashed potatoes, dressing and cranberry sauce.The pardoning ceremony brings levity to the endless list of serious issues the president faces daily. It inevitably also leads to several bad jokes that will leave the audience responding with ""oohs"" instead of laughs. A baby began crying after one of the jokes, prompting the president to reply: ""Oh, it's not that bad. Now, come on.""Obama was not deterred by the groans or the crying saying he hopes that when somebody at the Thanksgiving dinner table says you can't have any more food, you'll respond: ""Yes, we cran.""The National Turkey Federation began bringing live turkeys to the White House when President Harry S. Truman was in office. The White House Historical Association said Truman remarked they would ""come in handy"" for Christmas dinner. President John Kennedy spared the turkey presented to him in 1963, saying ""let's keep him going."" And President George H.W. Bush is credited with beginning the formal pardon tradition saying that year's bird was ""granted a presidential pardon as of right now."""

Civil protection officials were working to find alternate routes, since the bridge is crucial for emergency crews moving in and out of town.The aftershock was preceded by more than 50 overnight and was followed by another nine in the next hour  part of the nearly 1,000 aftershocks that have rocked Italy's central Apennine Mountains since the original 6.2-magnitude quake early Wednesday.Premier Matteo Renzi has declared a state of emergency and authorized 50 million euros for immediate quake relief.Rescue efforts continued through the night and into Friday, but more than a day and a half had passed since the last person was extracted alive from the rubble. While Renzi hailed the fact that 215 people had been rescued after the quake, authorities reported a steadily rising death toll that had hit 267 by Friday morning.Civil protection operations chief Immacolata Postiglione still insisted Friday that the rescue effort hadn't yet switched to a recovery mission. Rescue workers have noted that a person was pulled out alive 72 hours (three days) after the 2009 earthquake in the Italian town of L'Aquila.""I confirm, once again as we have from the start, that the units that are doing the searches and rescues, including with dogs looking for other people trapped in the rubble, are absolutely fully active,"" she said Friday.On the ground, authorities were still struggling to account for all the missing, since that number is still uncertain given the large number of visitors for summer holidays and an annual food festival.""There is still hope to find survivors under the rubble, even in these hours,"" Walter Milan, a mountain rescue worker, said Friday. But he conceded: ""Certainly, it will be very unlikely.""The vast majority of the dead were found in Amatrice, the medieval hilltop town famous for its bacon and tomato pasta sauce that was leveled by the quake. The other dead hailed from nearby Accumoli and Arcquarta del Tronto.Flags will fly at half-staff Saturday on all public offices and a state funeral will be celebrated by a bishop in a gym in Ascoli Piceno for the victims of nearby Arquata del Tronto  to date, 49 of the dead have come from the tiny town and its hamlet Pescara del Tronto.Across the area, thousands have been forced to abandon their homes, either because they were destroyed or they were determined to be too unsafe. Overnight some 2,100 slept in tent camps, nearly 1,000 more than the first night after Wednesday's quake, in a sign that a significant number had found nowhere else to go.""I have no idea what I'm going to do now, because I had renovated the house two years ago,"" survivor Umberto Palaferri said, showing a photo of his collapsed home on his phone. ""It was all new and now I don't know what to do. I'm 76 and don't know if I can rebuild it."""

No, it's not,"" he said.He also said there was no need to ""smash"" the Sakharov Centre exhibition -- while condemning it for ""glorifying"" Ukrainian troops.- 'Powerful supporters' -Such protesters remain on the fringes but they have powerful supporters, said Sergei Lukashevsky, director of the Sakharov Centre.""These radical marginal people -- the government condones their activities,"" he said.""There are people in power who protect them or even directly support them.""After Belikov defaced the images of Ukrainian forces at the Sakharov Centre -- part of a documentary photo exhibition -- the centre decided to reopen.But the next day, some 40 protesters arrived -- among them Cossacks and a local lawmaker -- carrying a jar of tomato juice labelled ""blood of the children of eastern Ukraine.""Entering the building, some tore down signs.But when the police arrived, they questioned staff about the exhibition's content, not about the protesters' actions, said Lukashevsky, who said the centre would not press charges.The photos by Sergei Loiko for the Los Angeles Times and Belarusian Alexander Vasukovich were ""war reportage -- they did not glorify or condemn anyone,"" he explained, saying the protests were the result of ""the general atmosphere being whipped up by government propaganda.""Yet the latest protests will affect the centre's decisions about future events, he acknowledged.""We will undoubtedly weigh this up,"" he said.""Our doors are open, so I have to worry about the safety of staff and visitors."""

(Photo | AP)KASHIWA: At a public bath in a Yokohama slum in the 1950s, a red-haired girl scrubs her skin with a pumice stone, hard, to try to get the white out.Other kids sometimes taunt her. ""American, American."" She yells back, ""I'm Japanese!""There are more hints that she is different. Once a year she's taken to a grave in the cemetery for foreigners. Once she is made to listen to a record of people singing ""Happy Birthday"" in English. The reasons are as unknown to her as the Western-looking couple she sees in photos hidden in a brown leather suitcase in the closet.She is told she was abandoned. Only much later would she learn that her family had been a casualty of anti-Asian immigration policy in the United States. Her American father got Congress to pass a special bill that would have allowed her to enter the US, yet she would go most of her life without knowing that.Her life became headline fodder in two countries  Japan and Sweden  as a custody battle waged, yet she would be the one to sort out her own fractured identity. It took decades, and the last piece was put into place only this year.""So many coincidences happened in my life,"" she said in an interview at her house outside Tokyo, reflecting on her 67 years. ""But altogether, you know, I managed to put the whole story, that now I'm settled, and I have peace of mind. Thank goodness that I don't have to live with two people anymore.""Those two people are Mary Ann Vaughn, the girl she was born as, and Marianne Wilson, the girl that fate made her.Texas-born James Vaughn arrived in Japan in early 1946, a 20-year-old civilian assigned to a U.S. military base in Yokohama. Photos show a handsome lad with a bit of a James Dean look.He met 16-year-old Vivienne Wilson working in the PX to help support her family. It was an ill-fated romance. Overseas U.S. personnel needed permission from the military to get married, and Vaughn was denied because Wilson was half-Japanese. U.S. law at the time barred Japanese from becoming citizens or even immigrating to the country.Vaughn and Wilson didn't give up. They tied the knot at a Japanese shrine in May 1948. But U.S. military police harassed the couple, and Vaughn returned to the U.S. that August. Wilson gave birth to Mary Ann Vaughn in a Yokohama hospital on April 17, 1949.James Vaughn wrote to Congress, which passed a law exempting Wilson from immigration restrictions so she and her daughter could enter the U.S. It was dated Aug. 5, 1950.That very day Vivienne Wilson died of tuberculosis. Mary Ann was 16 months old.Wilson's family was struggling financially, and asked Mary Ann's nanny to take care of the baby until her father returned to get her. He never did.And so Mary Ann ended up trying to peel her whiteness off in a public bath. ""I was wondering what kind of disease I had,"" she said. She hoped she would wake up transformed, her red hair gone to black.She became Mary Ann Kizawa, taking the surname of her nanny's first husband. She called him ""Papa."" They lived in a one-room shack in Yokohama, got water from a shared pump and cooked outside.The young girl didn't know she was American  she was taught to be terrified of Americans. She wasn't sure who or what they were, but would jump into a covered wooden tea crate whenever they came to the neighborhood. They will make you into sausage and eat you, she was told.Ultimately, an organization set up to help ""GI babies,"" orphans left behind by American soldiers, found her. In letters to the Swedish consul in Tokyo in 1955, the group reported that Mary Ann's nanny wanted to adopt her, but questioned whether that was advisable, given her impoverished circumstances. Sweden decided it should find a home for her, and a custody battle ensued.The media descended on the first-grader. Magazine photo spreads from 1956 show a smiling, pig-tailed girl at school or eating at home. Behind the sometimes impish smiles was a child who didn't understand what was happening to her.Her nanny, Fumi, took Mary Ann every Aug. 5 to Vivienne's grave in a mosquito-infested cemetery, without telling her it was her mother. The child couldn't read the English on the tombstone.Fumi once took her to the beauty parlor where she worked, so she could use the record player. Mary Ann listened to a recording of ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Mary had a Little Lamb"" without realizing it was her father and his family in America singing.The nanny did lay out what was happening after a court ruled in Sweden's favor in 1958. ""I'm going to tell you something very important,"" she told her. ""Sit here and just listen. You're going to quit this school. From September you're going to go to a new school on the bluff where all the A-B-C kids are living. And from now on, your name is going to be Marianne Wilson.""It was a name she hated. Marianne is the Swedish version of Mary Ann, and in her 9-year-old mind, it was the source of all her troubles.With no English, she was sent back to second grade at the ""A-B-C school""  the international school in Yokohama. It was a blow to her ego. She couldn't stomach the strange food  ham sandwiches and tomato juice  and threw it away.""I just couldn't understand a single word the teacher was saying,"" she said. ""I couldn't even write my own name.""An excerpt from a recent email captures her confusion:""On my first day, we took the bus to the bluff. To my big surprise came a little boy who looked like me accompanied by a Japanese woman. When I heard the boy addressing a Japanese lady 'Mommy,' my mind just spun with great joy. I had found the same species!""Her joy was dashed when she discovered the father of a similar girl was a tall white man.""Oh my goodness, I was totally confused,"" she wrote. "" ... I expected a little girl who looked like me to have a Japanese mommy and a Japanese daddy! My little head at that time had no idea about mixed-race, and just left me with the great grief that there is no planet for me to live in. I searched for Krypton, a planet which Superman came from, for there might be some aliens existing like me on that planet.""Under a compromise with the Swedish Embassy, Marianne would live with a foreign host family during the week, and stay with her nanny, now remarried as Fumi Yamaguchi, on the weekends. A Swedish company moved them out of the slums and into a house in Tokyo with new wonders for Marianne, from a refrigerator to a vacuum cleaner.She transferred to the American School in Japan, and rotated through about half a dozen families during her school years. Now, when she visited that gravestone, she could read ""Vivienne Wilson"" on the marker, and realized it was the same last name as hers. She peeked at the photos in the suitcase. A young man, a young woman. A little boy. How were they a part of her life?After high school, she was sent to Sweden, speaking no Swedish. She worked for SAS, the Scandinavian airline, but returned to Japan in 1974, after five years.On her deathbed in 1975, Fumi finally told her everything. James Vaughn was her father, and he hadn't abandoned her, but had tried to find her. It was him on the record, singing to her. She gave her the photos, and told her, these are your parents.Marianne was not ready to try to track down her father until the 1990s, after she got married and had a son. The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo gave her a list of agencies to try.""Every time an envelope came from America, I thought, 'Yay, they found him,'"" she said. ""Then I would start crying. It didn't work.""An acquaintance suggested the Japanese Red Cross. The answer came by phone in 2004: We found James Vaughn, but unfortunately he died 11 months ago. There is a short obituary. And you have a younger brother in America.Marianne Wilson Kuroda was drinking her coffee and shaking, waiting in the kitchen for the phone to ring. It was Steve Vaughn, the son of the father she never got to meet.At first she didn't know what to say. ""What was father's favorite color?"" she asked. Then the emotions overflowed.""I thought, 'Gosh, I wish I would have taken care of you,'"" she said. ""I missed him so much as a baby. I could have been big sister to him ... changed his diaper, given him milk. I guess that's what you call family.""Three months later, she was flying to New Mexico. Vaughn, 56, is a doctor at a Veterans Administration clinic outside of Albuquerque.""She got off the plane. I could not look her in the eyes,"" he wrote in response to questions. ""Her father's eyes scrutinized me, stared at me.""It's not clear whether James Vaughn attempted to contact his daughter after the death of Vivienne Wilson in 1950, but his family kept an envelope on which his mother had written, ""May be important some day.""Inside were some photos and a note: ""The baby in these pictures was named Mary Ann. The last time (I) heard about them was 1958. The mother had died, and baby or girl Mary Ann was adopted in Tokyo, Japan, by unknown parents.""Steve Vaughn, whose mother had married James Vaughn in 1956, wasn't told about his half-sister.He and Marianne compared photos, and found they had similar ones of their father as a little boy. They visited the grave of their father, who had died on Feb. 3, 2003, at the age of 77.""I had to give him respect, you know. But, um, hmm, it was like, you know, 'Why did you die 11 months ago?'"" Marianne said, her laughter mixed with pangs of regret. ""You could have lived a little bit longer after all these years.""The puzzle was coming together. An uncle remembered something about a law related to her story. Steve Vaughn wrote to the U.S. National Archives and found under Private Laws, Chapter 596, ""An Act, for the relief of Vivienne Joy Wilson and minor daughter Mary Ann Vaughn.""Marianne was stunned.""I saw the name Mary Ann Vaughn, which I was called in my very early childhood, and was shocked that she really existed, and my father was truly an American,"" she said.And so was she  or at least should have been. She decided that she should make it official and claim her citizenship, in his honor.It would take 12 years.A U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo asked her why she wanted citizenship when she didn't intend to move to the U.S. He gave her a long list of requirements.""He even said it is almost impossible,"" Marianne said. ""He raised my anger to fight for anything to get justice.""She got help, in a way, from her grandmother. Vivienne's mother. She, amazingly, had gone through very much the same struggle.To get the bill passed, James Vaughn had written Nevada Sen. Pat McCarran letters pleading for help. Steve Vaughn obtained those letters through the McCarran archives.A 1949 letter said that Vivienne Wilson's mother, Helene, had divorced and gotten remarried to a man named John Bouiss and was living in Portland, Oregon. That was something she never knew.Searching the internet in 2012, Marianne happened upon a 78-page paper on Helene Bouiss in the New York University Law Review. Half-Japanese and half-German, she had been denied entry on arrival in Seattle and detained because of her ethnicity. She only was admitted after Congress amended the War Brides Act to allow in spouses like her.It boggled Marianne's mind. She sought help from the author of the paper, professor Rose Cuison Villazor from the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.""Her case is a consequence of this history of discrimination from immigration law and citizenship law that I thought really needed to be corrected,"" Cuison Villazor said in a telephone interview. ""There was ... this awful history that I felt needed to be addressed as a matter of justice.""Kevin Brosnahan, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs, said that consular officers are required to determine whether a person meets the legal requirements for citizenship that were in effect on her birthdate.For Marianne, born in 1949, that meant she had to have established that Vaughn was her father by the age of 21. A later U.S. law allows a qualified person to take an oath to restore her citizenship, Brosnahan said.Cuison Villazor, in a submission to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, argued that the 1949-era requirements are unconstitutional, but that either way, Marianne had met them.The U.S. ultimately agreed. A photo posted this June on Facebook shows a smiling Marianne standing outside the embassy holding up the oath of allegiance she had just signed.She has one more task before that mission feels complete. She wants to visit a cemetery in the west Texas city of Spur, population 1,300, where her paternal grandparents are buried.""I want to show them my American passport and say, 'Grandpa, Grandma. I'm home.'"""

When its suggested to the overtly proud unemployed commerce graduate, Dasan (Mohanlal), that he could rear cows and become a successful dairy farmer, he exclaims, Me? A first class B Com graduate, become a dairy farmer? I dont think so.Three decades on, trends have reversed and theres no shame in picking up the plough. A growing breed of youngstersarmed with professional degrees and successful enterprisesare proving that their degrees are assets out in the field. From using lessons in mechanical engineering to mechanise farms and creating e-commerce websites to sell organic farm produce, these youngsters are proving that careers can be created away from the confines of a cubicle.Your creations on the computer are intangible. When it comes to agriculture, you can touch, feel, smell and taste your creations, and even share your outputs with your loved ones. I believe this school of thought is urging youngsters to take up farming, says Mathew Sebastian, a veteran agriculturist and co-founder of the farm-certifying agency, INDOCERT, elaborating,Currently, the biggest hurdles to agriculture are lack of access to markets, real-time information, and middlemen who rig markets to their convenience. Now young agriculturists have opened online market places (think Farming Colors, Farmers FZ and Ente Krishi), which are supplying farm produce directly to households and cutting out middle men. Queries on agricultural practices, too, are easily clarified on Whatsapp groups like Kaarshiga Rengam (details: 9447001122). These individuals are poised to change the face of agricultural commerce in the coming years.Pradeep P SChief profession: PHP developerAgricultural land hold: Six acresProduces: Tapioca, ladies finger,red banana, bitter gourdThe monotony of working full-time as a web developer and the thirst to find a larger market for the agricultural produce from his household in Mala, Thrissur, motivated this 26-year-old to take the shovel. My father grew vegetables in our backyard. Once, when he tried to sell 200 kg of bottle gourd in the market, he was offered `1 for a kg. This really disturbed me. I vowed to create something that would take our farm produce directly to households, where it would be appreciated.

Applying his expertise on the field, the 37-year-old developed precision farming methods in his farm at Ashtamichira, Thrissur, by introducing drip irrigation, hybrid seeds and farm mechanisationall of which greatly reduced water consumption and wastage, and recently earned him an accolade from the Kerala Government: Best Young Farmer. I used simple plastic sheets for mulching, which increased the moisture content of the soil and water retention. I also skipped the heavily-built high power consuming tractors in the local market and opted for the smaller Japanese Kuboto tractor and customised it with multiple attachments, which could pluck weeds and till the soil, says Chitteth, who keeps tab of the latest technologies in agriculture on the Haifa Chemicals website (aifa-group.com) and Tamil Nadu Agricultural Universitys e-learning portal (tnau.ac.in/eagri). Only after researching online did I realis our soil was acidic, compared to the alkaline-rich soil in Tamil Nadu, which gives more yields. I am aware about the benefits of going organic, but going completely organic will reduce 70 per cent of my output and the projected market for organic produce is hyped, too, so I will stick with using pesticides responsibly, adds Chitteth.

If reports coming in from Technopark and the incident which occurred at the Infopark in Kochi are any indications then it can be said, Yes, they are. Three days ago, techies at the Infopark were shocked to find a millipede in a snack served by a cafeteria attached to one of the blocks in the park.The situation is not so different at Technopark! For years, the techies have been complaining about the poor quality of food and also the unhygienic conditions in which they are being prepared at the several cafeterias inside the campus.Techies point out that several cafeterias have been serving stale food even after being served notices by the Food and Safety Department threatening closure if conditions arent improved. At present, 22 cafeterias are functioning inside the park at various blocks. Apart from branded food outlets, several cafeterias serve local cuisine to attract Kerala-based techies. In fact, it is these cafeterias which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. Two weeks back the Food and Safety Department raided the cafeterias inside the park after receiving large number of complaints from techies. Food and Safety officials issued warning and penalised many of these restaurants for serving stale food and that too in unhygienic conditions. They also slapped closure notice on a restaurant functioning in Bhavani building.Techies said that they have been at the receiving end for years. Though Technopark exudes glamour, the condition of the eateries inside the campus will put off people from food for a long time. For how long should we suffer unhygienic food ? a techie asked.Harrowing experienceOn August 4, a group of techies spent a harrowing night after having food from one of the restaurants functioning on the ground floor of Nila building. A software developer who didnt wish to disclose his identity told TPuram Express that he was served tomato rice which was two-days-old and spent half of his day puking. When they complained to the owner, he tried to return their money. We dont want the money back. What we want is hygienic food. Ours is not an isolated incident. Others too have been complaining about the poor quality of food here, a Senior operations manager with a multi-national company said.The records with the nearby hospitals indicate that there has been a rise in food poisoning cases from Technopark.

He also added that this is the third incident being reported from the park.We have formed two special squads to keep a check on the food inside the park. Two weeks ago, we raid all the cafeterias and found that eight to nine restaurants have been serving stale food and that too in an unhygienic environment. This is a serious issue. We have penalised some restaurants functioning at Nila and Bhavani buildings. We have also issued a closure notice to one working at Bhavani building. They were also directed to replace all the unhygienic plates and bowls. However, the raids dont end here. It will be continued in the coming days.

In a way, he was right.Twelve months from the deadly accident at an iron ore mine in Minas Gerais state, the Samarco company and its giant owners BHP-Billiton and Vale say they are putting the pieces back together.Yet the way of life Pascual has known all his 76 years in the village of Paracatu de Baixo shattered beyond repair that day.The disaster began in the afternoon of November 5, 2015, when a dam holding mining waste burst without warning about 17 miles (27 kilometers) up a small river from Paracatu.Thirty two million cubic meters (42 million cubic yards) of sludge rushed down the valley, killing 19 people unable to get out of the way and smashing anything in the flood's path, starting with the adjacent village of Bento Rodrigues.A helicopter reached Paracatu in time to warn villagers before their turn came.""I was in the garden and my wife was putting clothes out to dry when they came,"" recalled Pascual, a lean, strong man, whose snowy hair was hidden under a battered Stetson. ""They said: 'Get out of here!'""Running uphill with the rest of his neighbors, Pascual heard the disaster before he saw it.""It was the noise of a runaway train. Then we looked at what was coming,"" he said. ""It was the color of the clay. There wasn't even water, just clay coming and this strong wind.""The sliding wall of mud tore apart or submerged orchards, houses, roads, cars, animals, trees.""It was like the end of the world,"" Pascual said. ""The lights went out.""- Neck deep in mud -Pascual and his wife, whose 12 children live in other towns, were safe and their small house and plot of land, located on a slight rise, were spared.But Paracatu was finished. A year later mud still clogs the main street. Mud sits heaped in roofless houses. Mud stains walls of the ruined church.Pascual is hardly the quitting type, recounting how he waded back home through the mud to retrieve his wife's forgotten documents. ""It was up to here,"" he said, pointing to his neck.Even today, he tends his crops of manioc, onion, tomato and maize. Ever resourceful, he has grown his own tobacco for cigarettes that he rolls in dried maize leafs.Yet the clock is running down.Samarco says it will build a new Paracatu in a different location, with each inhabitant receiving a house equal to the one that was lost. A majority of residents have agreed to take the deal, although it means abandoning their ancestral home -- and Pascual is with them.His house and crops may be intact, but too much else has been spoiled.The river where he used to fish now runs red with mining waste. His two best cows were killed and so his production of round, white cheeses depends on two skinny survivors that he herds around the ruins. Income is down 75 percent.Samarco says it could take until March 2019 before the new Paracatu is built.In the meantime, Pascual tends the farm alone, making a journey of about an hour on weekends to see his wife. It's a lonely, sometimes spooky existence.""Sometimes I spend the whole night awake. Any noise will wake me,"" he says.And even if he could somehow hang on in the village, community life was always about more than mere survival.""We've ended up without a bar where you can go to get a drink, just a tiny drink,"" he said mournfully.""Yes, I want to leave."""

He was over the moon when he saw biscuits,"" said Kamel, a pale-faced woman, aged 38, wearing an old, black coat.""Yazan asked me if ice cream was some kind of cake.""In the two-day evacuation which started on Friday, around 4,000 civilians were to be directed to reception centres and at least 700 rebels escorted to the rebel-held city of Idlib in northwest Syria, the state news agency SANA said.The four years of life under siege was just as hard on the adults.""All anyone of us had to eat was a portion of soup at sunset and we'd then have to fast until sunset the next day,"" said Yazan's mother.""We had no gas or electricity... My heart would break and I'd cry at the sight of my son starving and I had nothing to give him.""Kamel said her family spent most of their time in shelters to avoid the bombs which often rained down on Daraya. Like most other residents, she did not dare send the children to school.Another mother, Houda, said her children were in awe of vegetables which used to be in plentiful supply in the agricultural province of Damascus before the war.""My children, who are three and five, were very surprised to see tomatoes. It was the first time for them,"" said the 30-year-old woman. ""All we had to survive on was grass.""Staple diet of fearThe surrender of Daraya, where Syrian authorities said soldiers deployed on Saturday, followed growing malnutrition and illness among its residents.For Houda, leaving her hometown, despite all the suffering of the past four years, has been a heart-wrenching experience.She said she brought along some stones ""as a souvenir of the smell of the town"", and hopes to return one day.At the entrance to the reception centre, made up of 30 prefabricated units, children played under a blazing sun as Red Crescent volunteers distributed mattresses, blankets and food.Apart from starvation, the evacuees said, fear had been the staple diet of everyday life in Daraya.Adnan Naccache, 47, told of how he and his family spent each night for more than four months in a hole they had dug in a patch of open ground that was mostly spared bombardment.""We would squeeze against each other, eight of us, and not dare to fall asleep for fear of the bombs,"" he said sternly.""Life was hell. We were at the end of our tether. We even reached the point where we'd rather die than have to do without any food or medicine any more.""Naccache said his weight fell from 86 kilograms (190 pounds) to 68 kilos."
58fed6e27be9e0420db28061,A just exchange,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160525/jsp/opinion/story_87368.jsp,2016-05-25,,Telegraph,"The Supreme Court passed a landmark judgment on May 13, 2016. It returned to the Haryana Urban Development Authority 280 acres of land that had been licensed to Uddar Gaggan Properties Limited by the Haryana government in 2006. The land was acquired by the government from farmers and then transferred to Uddar Gaggan Properties to build residential houses. The court termed the process ""illegal"" and deceptive. What is the main issue here? Land that was privately owned by farmers was acquired by the state government and then handed over to a private commercial interest. The state acted as an intermediary in a transaction between two private parties. Intermediation is common in private transactions, especially in land and buildings. Most of these transactions are effected through brokers who are the intermediaries. In this particular case, the state was an intermediary. There is nothing against the state acting as intermediary in private transactions. What makes this intermediation problematic is that the state used its legal powers to compel farmers to give up the land. If a broker did such a thing, the broker would have been jailed. However, the government has been forcing people to give up their land by the powers vested in it by the Constitution. This legitimate power enables government to acquire land from private entities if the government can justify the acquisition and if the erstwhile owners are compensated. While there has been a lot of debate in recent years on what is the fair compensation, there has been little, or no, debate on what justifies acquisition. This is largely because, till now, the Supreme Court accepted the 1984 amendment to the Land Acquisition Act that empowered the legislature to decide what the meaning of public purpose is. And both the corrupt and the well-meaning politicians have been interpreting public purpose to mean whatever is in keeping with their own ideas of developmental policies. Haryana is not the only state where such things have happened. Neither is India the only country where such things happen. Indeed, such government induced, or coerced, transfers have happened in other democratic, rule of law states also. In 2004, the Michigan Supreme Court in the United States of America corrected a wrong by returning land taken by the Detroit Wayne County Stadium Authority from a certain Frida Alibri. The reason for returning the land was that the local government gave the land to a private party to build and own a stadium on the land, when the government's justification for acquiring the land was to build a publicly-owned stadium. More famously, in 1998, the drug company, Pfizer, built a new plant in New London, Connecticut, US. To take advantage of the additional business the plant might bring in, the City of New London wanted to acquire 115 nearby houses and commercially develop the land on which the houses stood. The house owners sued the city in Connecticut courts. The case ended up in the US Supreme Court. In a five-four decision, the Supreme Court upheld the city's decision. The irony is that Pfizer, after a 10-year tax holiday, which was an integral part of the city's development plan, moved out of the city just when it was time to start paying taxes. And, instead of creating new jobs, it destroyed them by moving its facilities to a different location. Eventually, the City of New London apologized to the original home owners and so did one of the Connecticut Supreme Court justices who had earlier voted for the city. The first time India faced such an issue in the Supreme Court was in 1971 where the plaintiff objected to his land being taken for a public sector unit and then that land being given to a private corporation. It is uncanny that there should be two near identical cases (the case of Alibri above) in the two largest democracies concerning the government's affinity for the forceful acquisition of private land on behalf of other private parties. In the US, while initially the courts supported the state's behaviour, they drastically changed their stance by the beginning of the current century. Eminent domain can no longer be used by the State in the US to transfer land from one private entity to another unless ""public purpose"" is somehow associated also with the public ownership of the acquired land. The recent judgment by the Indian Supreme Court suggests that our courts also have started to think in a similar fashion. Private property is an essential concept in market driven, rule of law economies. Without property rights, market exchange of assets and goods is not possible. Thus, any suspension of such property rights, that are fundamental to an economy like ours, must have a solid argument justifying it. It cannot be justified simply because some interested group has a temporary majority in the legislature. Indeed, this is why democracies are also rule of law societies - the latter institution prevents the tyranny of the majority. There is some theoretical argument in certain cases for the involuntary transfer of private ownership to public ownership. That is how roads, hospitals and schools get built on land that may or may not have been government land to begin with. No similar argumentation has ever been made in economic theory for the forced transfer of land held by a private entity to another private entity. Quite frankly, that is precisely what such land transfers are. And, justifiably enough, the farmers who have lost their land are agitating against this. Of course, the land market is different from the market for tomatoes and, hence, a land transaction is not as simple as buying many other things. But the fact that land markets are not perfect is no justification for letting government officials and politicians decide on the principles of exchange. It is not a very deep insight; it is immediate as soon as one realizes that they are arbiters who have a huge stake in the outcome. If you are not convinced, think of Adarsh. If that happened too far away, look around you and identify the buildings and land where government officials and politicians stay. There are others who stay too, in the neighbourhood, but they were not directly involved in fixing the terms of exchange. If there was any involvement, it was one of collusion with officials and politicians. Controlling the land market since Independence has not rid us of the land sharks; it has only made them respectable. The Supreme Court judgment gives me hope that people in India are reclaiming their rights as we move towards a more mature democracy. The author is Research Director, India Development Foundation"

With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160728/jsp/nation/story_99226.jsp,2016-07-28,,Telegraph,"New Delhi, July 27: Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan today cited the example of bank interest to justify the rise in prices of food items over the past year while making it clear that middlemen and hoarders were the main problem. Paswan claimed the only increase had been in the price of dal, as he replied to a short-duration discussion in the Rajya Sabha. ""Only dal price has increased. The states have to take action against the middlemen and traders,"" he said. Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the prices of all food items had skyrocketed and Paswan could face a ""privilege motion"" for misleading the House. ""The minister says only dal price has increased. This is incorrect."" But Paswan came up with the bank interest analogy. ""If the price of something was Rs 29 last year and increased to Rs 32 this year, what is the increase? Don't you get interest benefit of Rs 2/3?"" he asked. The link between ""interest benefit"" and price rise was not clear. Unhappy with the reply, Congress MPs walked out. Paswan said the price of arhar dal and urad dal had increased because of a fall in production. The international production of arhar has declined from 75 million tonnes in 2012 to 71 million tonnes this year. In India, 171 lakh tonnes of arhar dal was produced in 2014-15 against a demand for 236 lakh tonnes. In 2015-16, the production remained almost stable at 170 lakh tonnes, whereas the demand increased to 246 lakh tonnes. Therefore dal is being imported, he said. ""If the price is high, why cannot the states relax tax on dal, why cannot they take action against the hoarders, why cannot they directly import?"" Paswan said. Initially, however, Paswan had mentioned some items whose prices had increased. The price of sugar, for example, was Rs 29 a kilo this time last year but had increased to Rs 40, while tomato prices had gone up from Rs 29 to Rs 39. Earlier, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the Centre was responsible to a large extent for the rise in prices of essential commodities, a major reason being the high price of fuel that increases the transport cost of goods. While the international price of crude oil has fallen from $110 a barrel in May 2014 to around $40 now, the government has increased the excise duty on petroleum products by ""nine times"", he said. Trinamul Congress leader Derek O'Brien asked the government to introduce air-conditioned vehicles to transport vegetables to stop them from rotting in transit."

The retail price of the tomato has breached the Rs 60-a-kg mark in local markets and, if sources are to be believed, the tag won't change at least for the next few weeks. ""Extreme temperatures, which crossed 45C this summer, has adversely affected tomato production in vegetable bowls of Jharkhand. This has led to short supply and hence, the price has doubled over the past fortnight,"" said A. Wadood, an agriculture scientist at Birsa Agricultural University in Kanke, Ranchi. Gopal Kumar, a vendor at Bistupur vegetable market, said against a daily consignment of two trucks of tomatoes, they weren't receiving any for the past week. ""Stocks in cold storage are getting exhausted while there are no supply of tomatoes locally (from Patamda),"" he said, adding that tomatoes were available for Rs 40-50 a kg, depending on quality, in the wholesale markets of Bistupur and Sakchi. If the berry-type fruit is troubling kitchen budgets, so are vegetables. Beans, which were available at Rs 70-80 a kilo in local markets until a few days ago, sold at Rs 120 a kg on Wednesday. Carrots are selling at Rs 70 a kg against Rs 50 last week and capsicums are a costly Rs 80 per kilo against Rs 40 earlier. ""The price surge has been triggered by inadequate supply. We are keeping our fingers crossed because the situation is unlikely to change for another few weeks,"" said Arun Mandal, a vegetable vendor in Sakchi. A vegetable seller from Patamda, Panchanan said poor production because of harsh temperatures had resulted in the wide supply-demand gap. ""We are hopeful that the situation will become normal with the advent of monsoon."" A survey of the twin markets in Bistupur and Sakchi revealed that prices of vegetables like bottle gourd, pumpkin and bitter gourd are also on the rise. ""We are left with little choice but to buy at increased rates. I think the rise in demand of vegetables in summer has also led wholesalers and retailers to hike prices,"" said a buyer. Bistupur homemaker Shalini Rao said no vegetable was available below Rs 40 a kilo. ""The price punch is taking a toll on our monthly budget,"" Rao rued. Catering staff Amar Babu added, ""Tomatoes are doing a vanishing act from salads because of its shooting price."""

In the inaugural session, the vice-chancellor of the university, K.M. Bujarbaruah, said the strategies should take into consideration an increase in productivity by linking it with biotechnology and agro-climatic conditions of the regions, treating each state differently. ""The area under banana cultivation, 1.03 lakh hectares, is good but the low production of bananas - only 13.5 tonnes per hectare compared to the all-India average of 37 tonnes per hectare - is a matter of concern. We have to devise strategies to increase productivity and this research can be linked with bio-technology,"" he said. The vice-chancellor added that for bananas, the temperature suitable for growth was 27 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees Celsius. Hence, in states like Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, where temperatures fall below 10 degrees Celsius, the productivity of bananas per hectare was lowest - two tonnes and three tonnes respectively. Productivity of Assam was the highest at 16 tonnes, followed by Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur. ""While devising the strategies, we have to consider whether Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh should be brought in at all or whether the strategy should be different for these states and find varieties suited to that climate propagated there,"" he said. He also stressed that biotechnology would help prevent diseases and increase shelf life of a perishable crop like banana as it had been done for tomato by switching off the ripening enzyme. Bujarbaruah said it should be considered that different varieties of bananas should be cultivated according to requirement as is done in Mizoram where a particular banana is cultivated for fibre. Bananas should be cultivated for fibre, processing and consumption after studying the market. S.K. Mukherjee, the senior consultant, department of biotechnology, New Delhi, said while preparing the roadmap, there was a need to find ways to value add nutrition as bananas are deficient in vitamin A. B. Padmanabhan, the director in-charge, National Research Centre on Bananas, Tiruchirappalli, stressed ways in which bananas could be made disease free, as there was great loss from the production to the consumption stage. Scientists from the fruit science department, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Coimbatore, National Research Centre on Bananas, Tiruchirappalli, microbiology department, Sardar Patel University Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat, PGP College of Agricultural Sciences, Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, and The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) participated in the meet. The session has been organised by the department of biotechnology, Assam Agricultural University, and sponsored by the central department."

Pictures by Prashant Mitra Organic and affordable BAU capsicums, gerberas, mangoes and more. Sounds good? Wait for six months. Ranchi-based Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) is in the process of setting up its own air-conditioned retail outlet inside its Kanke campus at a cost of Rs 15 lakh, which the National Horticultural Mission is funding. Once it starts direct sales, the varsity's produce of vegetables, fruits and flowers would be sold under the BAU brand name in about six months. The varsity grows tomatoes, red, green and yellow capsicums, mushrooms, limes, lady's fingers, mangoes, litchis, papayas, roses and gerberas. The produce basket is fully organic as no chemical fertilisers are used. Chairman of horticulture, Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Ranchi, K.K. Jha said they were already contributing around Rs 10-15 lakh a year to varsity coffers from the sale of vegetables, flowers and fruits and expected to double it with the proposed direct sales. ""Currently, a reputable food chain buys all our produce which it markets to consumers. That's why the BAU tag is missing. But, soon this will change. We shall begin the sale of vegetables, fruits and flowers grown at BAU directly to consumers within the next six months,"" Jha said. ""The AC sales outlet is expected to be fully functional in the next six months. Since no middlemen are involved, BAU produce would be available to consumers at prices much below market rates,"" Jha said, adding they had given orders to print poly bags with the BAU name. D.K. Singh Dron, BAU director (research), said the varsity had started to grow all types of vegetables at the fully refurbished and naturally ventilated poly houses or greenhouses, irrespective of season. ""The poly houses, over the past five years, had been in a bad shape,"" he admitted. ""Last year, we had revamped them with funds from Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi,"" he said. ""Since then, we are growing all types of vegetables, fruits and flowers under controlled conditions round the year and irrespective of season. The quality of the produce is better than in open-field cultivation. Even crop yields are better, four to eight times more compared to open-field cultivation,"" Dron said. He added they were encouraging state farmers to take up commercial cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers in poly houses. ""At BAU, we successfully demonstrated their cultivation at our poly houses, which farmers can replicate on a commercial scale,"" he said. The cost of a poly house depends on size and shape. The cost of a naturally ventilated poly house ranges from Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 per sqm. ""Farmers willing to construct poly houses on their land are eligible for a 50 per cent subsidy borne by National Horticultural Mission,"" Dron said. BAU airs informative bulletins on agriculture to farmers through its radio channel Birsa Hariyali on 107.8 FM. Farmers can also approach their Krishi Vigyan Kendras located at each district of the state for necessary guidance, he added. Will you drive to Kanke for farm-fresh veggies & fruits?

(Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP, File) A huge toxic algal bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi River, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water. (Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune via AP, File)A huge toxic algae bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi River, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water for days during the hottest part of the year.The bacteria commonly known as blue-green algae has spread rapidly to cover almost all of 150-square-mile Utah Lake, turning the water bright, anti-freeze green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore.It smells like something is rotting, said Jason Garrett, water quality director for the Utah County Health Department. We dont have an idea of how long this event will last.Toxic algae is a problem around the country. An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the Atlantic coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.Utah Lake doesnt provide drinking water, but its closure has caused big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities and for farmers with thirsty crops.Watch Video: Whats making newsUtah Poison Control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including some 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.The contamination spread to the Jordan River, which supplies irrigation water to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.Weve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have, said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. Were real worried about it.Farmers got some relief on Friday after the state lifted a week-long advisory against using the water for food production. Officials cited new test results that show lower-than-feared levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria.Meanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.This will be a real hit, said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that its murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.The lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah Division of Water Quality.Longstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.There are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.For now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.To stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater thats pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.Weve been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and its catching up with us, Gaddis said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Prashant Mitra Don't want to go veggie shopping amid dust, heat and crowds? Just tap on an app. Two young Ranchi guys with BCA and MBA degrees under their belt from Manipal and Pune are back home to open a start-up selling vegetables and fruits at prices lower than retail markets. Friends from their days at DAV Public School, Hehal, Bariatu boys Ankit Kumar (25), a BCA from Manipal, and Aman Lal (24), an MBA from Pune, have teamed up to open Meri Sabzi, a vegetable shop with a difference, from June 20. The boys have provided three options for customers to order fruits and vegetables, through the portal www.merisabzi.com, an app called Merisabzi and a WhatsApp number 8351155455. Ankit, who worked as an event manager, and Aman, who was with a telecom company, came back home when the business bug bit them. ""We wanted to open something people needed everyday,"" said Ankit. ""Vegetables and fruits are a must, but busy young professionals, couples who have a packed day juggling many things or elderly people who don't want to depend on domestic help do face problems going to the market to buy the essentials."" ""Plus, the skyrocketing prices,"" chipped in Aman. ""From farm to wholesale to retail, prices keep inflating at every rung and the customer bears the full brunt of it. So, we wanted to put in place a seamless logistics, from farm to Meri Sabzi, to give our customers the best deal possible, eliminating middlemen."" The duo made their home delivery plunge after six months of planning. They took care of the software, built contacts with farmers on the outskirts of Ranchi in places like Bundu, Chanho Pithoria, Ormanjhi, Bedo, Nagri, hired delivery boys and opened up their Bariatu office. The efforts seem to have paid off. Thanks to their farm links, they have managed to deliver potatoes at Rs 15 per kg, onions at Rs 14, tomatoes at Rs 25, brinjal at Rs 22 and lady's finger at Rs 23 when the market rates are Rs 20, Rs 18, Rs 40, Rs 30 and Rs 30. In mornings, they delivery only vegetables from 6am to 9am. In the evening, they also deliver fruits and fresh veggies between 5pm and 8pm. Orders must be worth Rs 100 and above. If someone places an order worth Rs 250, he or she will get 5kg onions for Rs 50, the duo promise. The best part? Delivery is free of cost. So far the maximum orders are through WhatsApp, though the duo hope their own app also catches on. ""But our five delivery boys are busy all the time, which is important as we have just started out. We got 60 orders on Day One. We've come close to 100 orders in one day,"" said Ankit. ""We've got customers from Namkum, Hatia, Piska More, Booty More, Kanke Road, Bariatu, Morabadi, Ratu Road and many other places."" Their first customer, Bariatu homemaker Rachna Sahay, said she was thrilled when the fruits she had ordered, worth Rs 167, came smartly wrapped in plastic in a basket.

58feeb357be9e0420db2968a,Aussie MP is Depp's 'Lecter',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160526/jsp/foreign/story_87645.jsp,2016-05-26,,Telegraph,"May 25: Australian deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce today billed himself as Hollywood star Johnny Depp's Hannibal Lecter, playing mind games in his head and escalating a ""war on terrier"". The sparring began with the illegal entry of Depp's two Yorkshire terriers into Australia last year when the actor was filming the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie, breaching the country's tight biosecurity laws. Depp's wife, actress Amber Heard, was convicted in April of falsifying travel documents to sneak the dogs into the country on a private jet and was given a suspended fine of AUD$1,000 (500). A deadpan video apology by Depp and Heard for the offence, dubbed ""terriergate"" by the media, went viral. Joyce, who is also agriculture minister, couldn't help but gloat after the video was released, mocking Johnny Depp's acting skills. Depp kicked off the latest round in the war of words when he appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! chat show yesterday, describing Joyce as someone who ""looks somehow like inbred with a tomato"". ""It's not a criticism. I was a little worried he might explode,"" said Depp. Joyce, who had threatened pets Pistol and Boo with euthanasia, fired back today, comparing himself to the fictional forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer who has graced both the big and small screen. ""I'm turning into Johnny Depp's Hannibal Lecter, I'm inside his head, I'm pulling strings and levers,"" Joyce told reporters in Australia. ""Long after I've forgotten Mr Depp, he is remembering me."" Joyce, who is also the agriculture minister, thanked Depp for the free publicity on Australia's bio-security laws. Depp suggested the video was not sincere after Kimmel said it was the greatest apology he had ever seen. ""There are things you have to prepare a long time for to be able to tap into the emotion,"" he said. ""I played that anti-government Australia, when someone threatens to euthanise your dogs ... tiny teacup things, [that are] clearly dangerous in Australia because of so many poisonous creatures in Australia you could die at any minute, so the dogs were obviously a problem."" Depp said ""an absolute genius"" had written the apology and it was directed by an iPhone but there may have been more than one take because ""sometimes you have to giggle a little"". When asked if he watched the video before releasing it, Depp responded: ""No, because I didn't want to kill myself."" ""I think the choice they made to utilise the taxpayers' dollars to globally chase down teacup yorkies and give them 50 hours to live, I realised the badness of my ways, I was kind of repenting."" The charges were dropped against Heard after the pair released the video which Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan said at the time was ""of far more benefit to this country"" as a warning to would-be illegal importers than any conviction recorded against Heard. The agriculture minister made global headlines when he said the dogs had to ""bugger off"" to California or face being euthanised within 50 hours after it was discovered they had not been declared when they entered Australia. Depp has already mocked the apology since the charges were dropped. ABC reported today that Joyce was asked if there was a vegetable he would prefer to be compared to. ""Something sleek and sensitive, just like me,"" he responded."
58fef25e7be9e0420db29cce,An engineer who fixes farms,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160629/jsp/jharkhand/story_93752.jsp,2016-06-29,,Telegraph,"Techie-turned-farmer Santosh Yadav at his veggie farm in Barmasia, Dhanbad. (Gautam Dey) The hands which handled machines three years ago are now sowing seeds and reaping fresh vegetables. From the world of machines to the lap of mother earth, it is a huge leap for 36-year-old Santosh Yadav. Yadav, a senior manager with Electrosteel Steels, Bokaro, till three years ago, is now an organic farmer at his hometown Barmasia on the fringes of Dhanbad. So, what provoked this mechanical engineering graduate from BIT, Sindri, to follow the reverse trend at a time when most people leave their roots and migrate to big cities for the rat race? The ""24/7 work culture at private companies"" leaves almost no time for one's family, friends, hobbies and social obligations, said Yadav. ""I wanted to give my wife and two children time and do something for society. So, I decided to leave my 13-year-old career and come back to my roots. I wanted to show that if farming is done scientifically using modern techniques, it is as profitable an industry as any other. At a time when farmers are committing suicide or migrating to bigger cities, I want to prove that farming can be fruitful if proper techniques are used,"" he said. ""This year, I earned a profit of around Rs 1.5 lakh in three months from April to June,"" said Yadav, adding that though his income at present was not commensurate with his earlier jobs, he was confident of increasing it. He said he followed organic vegetable farming on his 5-acre family plot near his house. ""Education is never wasted. Every day, I apply my years of learning and experience on fields. I use drip irrigation to save water, and mulching, which is rarely used, to protect soil from weeds,"" said the BTech graduate who prefers doing most of the work himself but employs labourers during sowing and harvesting. Admitting that farming had uncertainties, Yadav, said he also suffered losses in tomato last year but soon learnt from his mistakes. ""I always use organic fertilisers to cultivate seasonal vegetables like tomato, cabbage, capsicum, chilly, brinjal and lady's finger.? His wife Amrita Kumari (32) is his greatest strength, Yadav admits. A CA who prefers the role of a homemaker, Amrita encouraged her husband to do whatever he wanted, though the couple have two children, Priyansh, a Class V student and Kavya, who is in UKG at St Xaviers International School, Dhanbad. About the reaction of relatives and friends, Yadav said they at first laughed at him. ""Now, after three years, when I'm planning to expand my business and launch a packaged drinking water plant on a portion of my land with my savings I have, they seem to appreciate me,"" he said. His eyes gleamed speaking about his new endeavour: ""Clearances from irrigation and pollution departments have come. I'm waiting for machines to arrive. I'm positive about starting construction in the next two months. I'm looking forward to train local jobless youths who can join me."" He also keeps his Sundays for the poor children. He takes free classes at the Jharia and Dhanbad Bank More centres of NGO Samadhan. ""He lives life to the fullest,"" said Samadhan founder Chandan Singh."
58fef5217be9e0420db2a12a,Caterpillar cloud on tomatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/nation/story_91510.jsp,2016-06-16,,Telegraph,"UNDER SCANNER New Delhi, June 15: Government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to South America that has slipped into at least four Indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year. ""The United States is taking it so seriously we haven't even given permits to do research (in laboratories) in order to prevent any possibility of the insect's escape (from the labs into farms)."""
58fef7c07be9e0420db2a56a,Showers set stage for bumper veggies,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160530/jsp/jharkhand/story_88342.jsp,2016-05-30,,Telegraph,"Fresh vegetables on sale at a roadside market in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Sunday. Picture by Hardeep Singh The May showers, triggered by a series of Nor'westers, cyclonic circulations and low-pressure troughs, augur well for bumper vegetable yield in Jharkhand, which is expected to keep prices under check this year. ""The ongoing spell of pre-monsoon rain has helped keep the mercury at near-normal level and saved standing crops of bitter gourd, bottle gourd, tomato, sponge gourd, spinach, beans etc. from withering away under harsh sun. These vegetables are now available in abundance at local markets across the state. The prices are under control,"" said A. Wadood, weather scientist and chairman of agricultural physics and meteorology at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) in Kanke, Ranchi. Another good news is that rainfall so far has been moderate, and not too heavy, which has allowed the soil to retain moisture. ""There has not been any run-off... not a drop of rainwater has been wasted. This is an added advantage,"" Wadood stressed. The weather is conducive to kharif crops such as paddy, pulses, soya bean, groundnut, chick pea and mustard. With the soil enriched with moisture, BAU has started advising farmers to go in for intensive ploughing so that when monsoon finally arrives, the fields are ready for immediate sowing. ""Timely sowing of paddy and other crops and vegetables will help ensure a bumper harvest,"" Wadood said. ""Had the pre-monsoon rain not come at this time, standing vegetables would have withered away and sowing of paddy got delayed,"" he added. However, the BAU weather scientist emphasised on the need for urgent measures like creating dobas (farm ponds), check dams and intake wells on a war footing to help recharge groundwater to tackle the prevailing water crisis. Compared to an average annual normal rainfall of around 1,400mm, the state had received 900mm in 2015. Again, the number of rainy days per year has come down to 55-60 days as against 80-85 days in 1980. In the absence of adequate measures to conserve water bodies and recharge groundwater, the entire state is currently in the grip of acute crisis, he pointed out. Under the Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers' Livelihood (SAFAL) programme, the BAU has demonstrated how dobas can help retain rainwater for months. ""On a pilot basis, we had dug dobas in 10 villages of Angara block (Ranchi district) in June last year. They retained water for up to 11 months till April. Farmers in these villages have reaped two to three times higher yield of improved varieties of paddy and vegetables. This success story needs to be replicated across the state,"" he said. The SAFAL programme is being implemented by BAU in association with United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Columbia University's Centre for International Projects Trust."
