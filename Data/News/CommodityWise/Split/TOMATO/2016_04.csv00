BitGiving, a platform that helps raise funds and had most recently raised Rs.60 lakh to prevent Friendicoes from shutting down, has started a campaign on the behalf of Akshara.The goal is to raise Rs.5 lakh in 30 days to keep the lights on, and enjoy many more plays, shows and home-made tomato soup that the theatre is know to serve after the performances.Speaking about the theatres s situation, co-founder Jalabala Vaidya, whose solo performance of The Ramayana had helped raise funds to build the theatre, said at first the group used to tour abroad and within the country, which brought in money to keep the space running. However, lately the costs began to gallop so fast that they could not keep up.It has been a hard struggle as we are a family-run theatre group that does not have access to government funds.Ms. Vaidya feels that performing arts have managed to keep the identity of Indian people and society alive, and if it was not for the arts, the individuality and uniqueness of our culture would not have survived for so many years. She hopes the government will step forward to encourage the performing arts and keep them alive.The theatre has been home to many young theatre groups and college students. Some have even discovered their love for acting during summer workshops organised at the venue.Theatre actor and director Karam Vir Lamba said: For years, Akshara remained a very small group of affordable performance venues in Delhi. It is a welcome refuge for aspiring artists and creative minds that have needed a space to experiment and share their work. Most importantly, the owners of the establishment have always run it with a genuine love and passion for the arts.Speaking about its current situation, he feels that its closing, should it come to pass, will not only be tragic, but further evidence that the flickering flame of culture in this city, which is in desperate need of love and nurturing, is steadily dying.Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right now, the actor added.Tanima Dey, who was visiting the venue for an event on Friday, said upon learning that the theatre may be forced to shut down: It is such an active space, an oasis in the heart of the city. I am sure those passionate about the arts will not let the lights fade out. I am looking forward to many more lively evenings discussing a performance over some tomato soup.The crowd-funding campaign can be found at www.bitgiving.com/aksharatheatre .Im sure I speak for many artists when I say that this city needs Akshara much more than the help it needs from the people of Delhi right nowKaram Vir LambaActorSince 1972, we ran Akshara with the money we earned from performances across the world. We couldn't keep up with the costs once we stopped touringJalabala VaidyaCo-founderDRAMA-ramaAkshara Theatre opened to a houseful of Lady Shri Ram College girls on March 11, 1972The Ramayana, written by Gopal Sharman, is the only Indian play to date to have appeared on Broadway in February 1975.

S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the prices have dropped by 10 per cent this winter compared to last year because of sufficient water in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

However, the farmers have started using the light trap method to control insects. Many of cereal crops such as sorghum, rice and maize and vegetable crops such as tomato and brinjal attract insects and pests. Horticultural crops and pulse crops also attract insects.Agricultural officials and researchers say that one light trap was enough for controlling most of the insects that might attack the crop. It can be used from the stage of planting to harvest. As per the method, the traps should be placed at a centre of field for three hours between 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., as insects are active mainly during this period.J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur, told The Hindu that light trap was a vital tool to trap both the sexes of insects. It could reduce the carryover pest population substantially. Many farmers in Karur district had started placing light traps to kill insects.P. Baskar, a farmer at Thammanaickenpatti, said that he had raised bitter guard, onion, brinjal and a few other horticultural crops in his field. He had brought his field under the light trap system. He could say that his field was almost insect-free thanks to the light trap.He said he had bought the light for Rs.1500. It was a cheap and effective method to control insects."

The inmates of jails across Telangana will not only access these recipes at `wet canteens that are coming up within the confines but are treated to a variety of items even in breakfast nowadays.Breakfast spreadThe routine 100 gms of khichdi rice which was the only item at breakfast everyday for decades has gone and now the prisoners relish chapatti, tomato bath, upma, puri, pulihora and pongal by rotation during the week. They also get boiled eggs and banana. But, senior jail officials, said the menu is served within the sanctioned budget of 600 gms of rice, 100 gms of dal, 250 gms of vegetables and 30 gms of oil per head per day.To adjust the cost, the jail authorities have restricted the free supply of 175 gms of mutton to one Sunday against two in the past. They are getting 175 gms of chicken for three Sundays. More ingredients like coriander, curry leaves, garlic and chatni were also added to the items in breakfast to make the food tasty.CouponsFor lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before. The same is served in packets of 600 gms for under trial prisoners and 700 gms for convicts the next day. While the under trial prisoners are issued coupons to an upper limit of Rs 3,000 per month, the limit for convicts is only Rs 1,500 a month because the money had to be spent out of the wages earned by them in works assigned while serving sentence.The convicts have to necessarily send 50 per cent of wages to their dependents. In the case of under trial prisoners, the limit is higher as they will be spending from their personal cash that they brought at the time of admission or when their relatives gave them during mulaqat.Small gestureThe Deputy Inspector General of prisons A. Narasimha said the changes in menu were brought about as part of jail reforms in a bid to remove the vengeance among the inmates on having landed behind the bars.He said it was a small gesture to make them at home as their freedom and liberty was already curtailed. The facility was already provided in Tihar jail.For lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before"

Trilokchandra has conceived an idea of converting tomato into animal fodder. He has submitted a plan to the State government, which has given the green signal for setting up a plant at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard in Kolar.Mr. Trilokchandra got the idea after seeing a huge quantity of the vegetable being abandoned at the yard, one of the largest tomato marketing yards in Asia. On an average, transactions involving 150-200 tonnes take place every day during lean season. About 15 tonnes are wasted during loading and unloading.At the same time, farmers dump huge quantities of tomatoes on the roadside when there is a glut. Now, this will be fed into the plant that will turn it into a lycopene-rich meal for poultry, cattle, pig, and fish."

Among other efforts, it plans to revive karunkanni, a cotton variety getting extinct. It will convert cotton into value-added products, including naturally-dyed yarn, and sell it to other khadi units for cloth production. It has roped in traditional farmers in Athoor and Reddiyarchathiram blocks in Dindigul district to raise this variety. Similar efforts are on to revive 23 traditional cotton varieties throughout the country.These points were highlighted at a workshop on Revival of desi cotton and contemporary khadi held at Gandhigram near here on Monday. Trust secretary K. Siva Kumar said that the proposed facility would procure the entire produce from farmers and add value to it. The main aim was to end farmers marketing problem. This short staple yarn was best suited for producing bandage cloth and bed sheets.The natural dying unit would use cotton to make naturally-dyed yarn to tap emerging markets. Seeds would be supplied to farmers and the unit would act as a full-fledged model centre for organic cotton and value addition. It would also facilitate formation of a federation of desi cotton producers in the State, he added.Ananthoo of TULA Organic Clothing said that 97 per cent of cotton produced in the country before Independence was of traditional variety. The British, who tried to kill native varieties, and introduce foreign varieties could convert just three per cent of farmers. But, after Independence, Indian scientists had successfully killed traditional varieties and converted 97 per cent per cent of farmers into hybrid cultivation. Now, khadi units were using foreign cotton. Production and input costs for traditional varieties were very less when compared to those from Egypt and the US, he added.Other varietiesKrishna Prasad of Sahaja Samrudha, a peoples movement in Karnataka, said that 23 traditional varieties, especially Bengal Desi, Pundur, Kaala cotton, Wagadh, Karunganni, Jayadhar and Pandrapura, were being raised in the country for the past 1,000 years. Efforts were under way to revive these varieties. All Indian varieties had been grown as inter-crop to channa, coriander, chillies, pulses, tomato and onion, he said.Traditional cotton grower Visvasam of Vellode said that 500 acres of karunkanni variety had been raised in Reddiyarchatram and Athoor blocks. Owing to lack of marketing facilities, many farmers had shifted to other crops. These farmers would be encouraged to grow this variety. Besides Dindigul, Karunkanni was grown in Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam only, he added."
