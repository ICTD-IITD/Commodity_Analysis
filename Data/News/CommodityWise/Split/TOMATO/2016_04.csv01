The deceased was identified as Purushottam Dehuri who hailed from Janardanpur village under Sadar Block. According to sources, Dehuri consumed poison on Tuesday night and was admitted to the district headquarters hospital at Keonjhar town. He breathed his last in the morning. The deceased had taken loans amounting to Rs.40,000 from different sources, and had cultivated tomato in two acres of land. But the crop was damaged due to scanty rainfall.Of the three other cases, two were reported from Balangir and Bargarh districts in western Odisha where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally a few weeks ago, and one from Dhenkanal.The State government, however, has not admitted a single such death of farmer to be due to crop loss or debt burden although it has admitted in the State Assembly a few days ago that 175 farmers had committed suicide in the State during 2015-16.Enquiries by the respective district administrations showed that none of the farmers ended their lives due to crop failure, said School and Mass Education Minister Debi Prasad Mishra while making a statement on behalf of Agriculture Minister Pradeep Maharathy in the House. Mr. Mishra had said that the State government was not in favour of giving compensation to families of farmers who committed suicide because the move may encourage others to end their lives. While demanding adequate compensation for the family of the farmers who had committed suicide, the Opposition parties had demanded a change in the method and approach to probe into the farmer suicides taking place in the State."

Switching over from traditional farming methods to hi-tech methods, with hopes of better returns, many small and marginal farmers have taken up shade net cultivation in the district.But, many are reportedly suffering loss due to several reasons, including sudden price crash in the open market.Bhimareddy Rampurahalli (46) of Hattikuni village in Yadgir taluk is one among them. He planted around 5,500 tomato saplings in one acre of land under shade net cultivation in January 2016 and also got a bumper yield. After seeing the yield, he hoped for a better price. But his hopes were dashed as the price crashed suddenly in the open market. The price of tomato fell to Rs. 5 per kg from Rs. 25 per kg in a month. Meanwhile, buyers offered Rs. 100-Rs. 120 per bag (weighing 20 kg).Unhappy with this, Bhimareddy Rampurahalli, who was left with no option, has sold around 1,000 kg since the first week of March at cheap price. Bhimareddy Rampurahalli invested around Rs. 34 lakh, including on developing the land and installing nets using hi-tech methods. He drilled an extra borewell to meet the water needs of the crop. He also set up a transformer to avoid interruption in power supply. I made all-out efforts to cultivate the crop with modern techniques. But, even after I got a good yield, the price crash is causing concern, Bhimareddy Rampurahalli told The Hindu .He has lost hopes of getting even half the money he invested from the remaining tomato crop.Bhimareddy Rampurahalli also said that the government has not released the subsidy amount of Rs. 17 lakh as per norms, despite reminders sent to the officials.Satish Kumar, Deputy Director of Horticulture, said that there was no scheme to help farmers who suffer loss owing to price crash of crops taken up under shade net cultivation."

E. Theranirajan, head, Paediatrics, Government Vellore Medical College Hospital (GVMCH), said the common diseases that occur during summer are typhoid, hepatitis A and chickenpox. Throat infection and prickly heat can also cause trouble.Drinking contaminated water can cause typhoid and hepatitis A. It is important to avoid drinking water outside. Give purified water to children. Dehydration is a problem during summer. Children should take plenty of fluids, like home-made buttermilk and fruit juice, Mr. Theranirajan said.Tender coconut can also be given for children, while ice creams can be avoided, he said.Parents can give bath twice a day for children, he added. With chicken pox also being common during summer, he said vaccination was available for children aged between 15 months and five years, in two doses.Accidental ingestion of kerosene was another problem. He advised parents to keep kerosene out of the reach of children.Go. Bharani, retired professor of medicine, GVMCH, said people should avoid going out in the sun from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is better to finish important work early as the sun is at the peak during these hours. Drink butter milk, lemon juice and tender coconut and wear cotton clothes to manage the heat, she said.Diabetics, too, should take utmost care. They should keep the sugar level under control. They can drink buttermilk and lemon juice with salt, consume vegetable salad, tomato and greens soup, she added.Carbohydrates intakeIt is important to reduce intake of carbohydrates and oily food during summer, and increase vegetables and greens in ones diet.

Besides playing Holi with tomatoes, people could buy them, dry them and powder them for future use, he said.The aim was to create market demand and give a reasonable price to tomato growers and, at the same time, help revellers rejoice.Students of STBC College, who were trained in deseeding, drying, and powdering tomato, would demonstrate the process during Holi on Wednesday, Mr. Reddy said.Splash-a-tomato concept is aimed at helping farmers in distress, says Save Hundri"

We want them to get familiarised with the new mode first, said G. Chandramouli, Chairman, South Zone, K&VIC. Each unit of solar charkha costs around Rs. 40,000 and the cost may go up depending on the number of spindles used. To aide Central governments girl child scheme, the commission has decided to gift a solar charkha to artisans who have a single girl child. Responding to the financial woes of tomato farmers in Chittoor and Kurnool districts, the commission has decided to form a tomato farmers cluster in the backward Pathikonda area of Kurnool district. Tomato growers of Kurnool are distraught as they do not get good returns on their produce, which is highly perishable. We propose to use solar dryers to dry tomatoes and use them to make products such as sauce and ketchup. For marketing, we will collaborate with the Railways. The commission proposes to have two such clusters in each district depending on the availability of raw material, manpower and demand in the local market.We are identifying local NGOs who will be our implementing agencies. The budget will vary, depending on the number of people involved, from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 7 crore. Farmers will have to bear 25 per cent of the cost while the remaining 75 per cent will comes as a grant from the Central Government. We have sent a DPR (Detailed Project Report) to this effect, said Mr. Chandramauli.In Kadapa, which has large areas of banana plantation, it intends to help farmers add value to their produce by making use of the banana tree fibre to weave high-quality saris after blending the fibre with cotton.We have a model unit in Kerala which produces very fine strands of thread from banana fibre. We also want to bring banana fibre into use for hand-made paper. It is of very high quality and has good demand in European countries. Cost-wise, it may be on the higher side, but the lifespan of this hand-made paper is 700 years. The commission will soon have an ancillary unit of banana fibre. It also has plans to extract nutritious powder from raw banana which could be distributed in Anganwadi centres. Extraction of herbal ingredients from the dense Nallamalla forest in Khammam-Warangal border is yet another proposalKhadi and Village Industries Commission wants to add value to farm produce"

For this, the government machinery need to change its outlook towards agriculture. They have to get into consultation with farmers bodies and disseminate the demand potential of every crop both in the domestic and export market in advance, pointed out C. Nallasami, secretary of Federation of Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Associations.K. C. M. Balasubramanian, a retired agriculture economist, too is of the opinion that due to lack of macro planning, many farmers blindly tend to raise a crop which is giving good dividends to some other farmers in the respective regions.The farmers across the district will also be demanding the candidates to give an assurance that exact acreage of crops will be carried out in the coming years to get the correct position of the crop yield."

This sparked panic among people living in villages in Bangarpet taluk, bordering forests in Tamil Nadu, on Tuesday.Though no one said they saw the animals, the widespread assumption was that only elephants could have wreaked such damage to the water pipe.People believe the tuskers could have entered Bathlahalli under Kamasamaudram State Forest area in Bangarpet taluk. Its not uncommon for tuskers to enter Karnataka from adjacent Krishnagiri forests in Tamil Nadu.We are making all efforts to trace the elephants that might have strayed in to the forests on our side, Bangarpet Range Forest Officer H. Chinnappaiah said.The panic isnt entirely out of place, as tuskers have entered the fields and caused extensive damage to crops in Bangarpet and Malur taluks in the last few years.

While over a decade ago, orders used to be placed almost for 1,000 people, there has been a precipitous fall in demand. About 50-100 packets are ordered now.The reason?There isnt a clear answer. Some say it is because the party representatives in charge of campaigning in each locality distribute the cadre tokens that can be used at select hotels, while some say the parties find buying food packets from nearby eateries more feasible. Very few go for cooking on a large scale anymore.The volume and variety of food also varies depending on the political party and the candidate in question.Changing preferencesIn the 1950s, parties used to serve upma and coffee. It slowly changed to biriyani, recollects a sitting MLA in the district.Though the order volume goes up for some caterers during the polls, it constitutes a meagre two to three per cent of their business, adds a catering service provider here.On an average, an election official here says, 20 per cent to 23 per cent of a candidates expenditure is on food.On an average, candidates spend 20 to 23 per cent of their moneyon food"
