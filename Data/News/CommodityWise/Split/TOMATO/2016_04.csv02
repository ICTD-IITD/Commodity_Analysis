This has affected the production of particularly vegetables in the local farms.Due to this, there has been a steep fall in the arrival of vegetables particularly to the 11 uzhavar santhais in the district.The santhai sources said that the local tomato season has already come to an end and local tomatoes are not at all arriving in the santhais. At present farmers are bringing the tomatoes procured from Rayakottai, and Krishnagiri to the uzhavar santhais.The price of tomatoes which remained at Rs. 15 a kg last week, has risen to Rs. 26 in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 30 in the open markets.Similarly the price of brinjal has gone up from Rs. 10  Rs. 14 last week to Rs. 18 in uzhavar santhais and Rs. 25 in the open markets.The small onion season has also come to an end. The onion arriving at the santhais are from areas such as Udumalpet, and Mysore.The small onion was selling at Rs. 20  Rs. 25 a kg last week, and it has gone up to Rs. 32 a kg in the uzhavar santhais and Rs. 35 in the open markets. The season of drumsticks is also over.There is a fall in the arrival of Bengaluru beans too, due to which its price has shot up to Rs. 70 a kg from Rs. 50, uzhavar santhai sources said.With mercury continue to soar high, there is no hope of improvement in the arrival of local vegetables to the uzhavar santhais. Hence the price of vegetables is expected to increase further in the days to come, causing much anxiety to both the farmers and consumers."

PHOTO: SANTOSH SAGARRaghu, a young farmer from Koravihal village in Raichur taluk, was in for a shock on Wednesday morning when he reached the wholesale market at 4.00 a.m. with a load of vegetables. The prices of vegetables that had begun to fall a few weeks ago continued to show a downward trend. As taking the perishable produce back home would require spending a few more thousands, Raghu had no choice but to slash his prices. He ended up selling ridge gourd at Rs. 80 for a 20 kg bag, bitter gourd at Rs. 25 for a 15 kg bag and green brinjal at Rs. 60 for a 10 kg bag. He earned only about Rs. 1,500 which was almost equal to the money he spent on harvesting and transportation.I have spent Rs. 35,000 on cultivating vegetables on two acres of land. I received only Rs. 8,000 by selling the crop so far and may get another Rs. 7,000 by harvesting the remaining crop. At the end, I will incur a loss of around Rs. 20,000, he said.Other vegetable farmers had similar tales of woe. When this reporter observed the auction of different vegetables held between 5.00 a.m. to 5.30 a.m, it was found that the prices of all vegetables were down: tomato was priced at Rs. 80 for a 25 kg bag, cucumber at Rs. 100 for a 20kg bag, cauliflower at Rs.100 a bag of 10 pieces and green chilli at Rs. 100 for 10 kg bag.I have stopped harvesting green brinjal as it did not fetch m even the transportation costs last week when I had to sell it for Rs. 30 for a bag of 10 kg, Venkatesh, a farmer from Ele Bichhali village, said.Traders attribute the price fall to glut. Vegetables arrive from Shanti Nagar in Andhra Pradesh, Aija, Gadwall and Hyderabad in Telangana, and Chintamani and Belagavi in Karnataka, apart from the villages along the banks of the Tungabhadra and the Krishna in the district.Green chilli was sold at Rs. 600 for a bag of 10 kg a few weeks ago. Now, the price has dropped to Rs. 100 due to excess, Aarif Hussein, a trader, said.No benefitsWhen this reporter visited the only retail market two hours after the wholesale trading, it was found that the vegetables were being sold at much higher prices: ridge gourd at Rs. 40 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 4), bitter gourd at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs.1.60 a kg), green brinjal at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 6). tomato at Rs.10 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 3.20), cucumber at Rs. 30 a kg (wholesale price: Rs. 5), cauliflower at Rs. 40 a piece (wholesale price: Rs. 10) and green chilli at Rs. 20 a kg (wholesale price: Rs.10).No regulationIn the absence of a statutory body to regulate the prices of perishable crops, the district authorities are exploring the possibility of safeguarding the interests of farmers and consumers by eliminating all the middlemen involved.Opening farmers markets where common people too can purchase vegetables directly from farmers is one option. It has been successful in Tamil Nadu and we are thinking of opening similar markets in Raichur, S. Sasikanth Senthil, told The Hindu."

The increasing number of survivors say that the success is owing to early detection and treatment. In spite of that, with a million new cases being reported every year, cancer seems to be tightening its grip on India. Nearly 7 lakh Indians die of cancer every year, while over 10 lakh are newly diagnosed with some form of the disease. The greater part of the diseases in India are diagnosed when the disease has spread and has become either untreatable or hard.A new development offers hope for potentially increasing detection rates and enhancing the probability that those in need get treatment, and also lessening risk through nourishment and right dietary approaches. By some estimates, lifestyle factors, for example diet and exercise, assume a major role in cancer prevention. Dietary habits are assessed to be a causal factor in 30 per cent of all cancers. Combined with smoking, obesity, food chemicals (e.g. pesticides, additives and hormones), lack of exercise, air and water pollution, and the over-consumption of alcohol or certain pharmaceutical drugs (like, Estrogen, Metronidazole (Flagyl), Lindane (Kwell), or Griseofulvin), 70% per cent of all cancers can be connected to lifestyle.Cancer and the treatment of cancer are often connected with inflammation. Despite the fact that the inflammatory process may have a role in healing, if it goes on too long or if there is too much of it, it can damage cells and their DNA. Beside damage there are different components adding to perpetual inflammation, such as stress, obesity, chemical exposures, and such.The good news is that diet can altogether diminish inflammation. Here are a few things we can do.Lower fat intake - A low-fat diet is associated with reduced risk of cancer. Lower your fat intake to about 20 per cent of total calories. A minimum of 65 grams of fat per day is suggested; 50 grams is better. More of the fats should be mono and polyunsaturated types with a reduction of saturated fat intake and little or no consumption of refined and heated oils.Increase dietary fiber - Fiber has a protective effect against cancer, so a high-fiber diet is suggested to improve colon function, mainly by increasing carbohydrates in the form of whole grains and lots of vegetables, along with some fruits, all of which contain high amounts of many of the important nutrients.Maintain ideal weight and avoid obesity - Be as lean as possible, without becoming underweight.Exercise: for adults at least 30 minutes most days; for children 60 minutes most days.Avoid smoking - The best way for smokers to reduce their risk of cancer, and improve their overall health, is to stop smoking completely.Avoid smoked, salted, pickled and barbecued foods. Prepare meat, poultry and fish by baking, broiling or poaching. Low alcohol consumption - The less alcohol you drink, the lower the risk of cancer. To help prevent cancer, leading experts advise not drinking alcohol at all. Include foods rich in vitamin A and Vitamin C - Vitamin A is a powerful antioxidant. Most dietary requirements of vitamin A comes from leafy green vegetables, orange and yellow vegetables, tomato products, fruits, and some vegetable oils.Vitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. All fruits and vegetables contain some amount of vitamin C. Citrus fruits such as orange, grapefruit, lime, and lemon are excellent sources of vitamin C, and so are non-citrus fruits such as papaya, strawberries, pineapple.It is best to discuss your nutrition plans with qualified health & wellness coach.Expert- Preeti Rao,CEO & Founder, Total Wellness Management, & Consultant-Health & Wellness, Max Healthcare."

Surprisingly, when farmers all over the State have been screaming hard over failure of monsoons and water scarcity, tomato farmers here face a different situation where monsoon failure has resulted in a bumper harvest, resulting in steep price drop.Tomato farmers say that due to monsoon showers, the normal damage to crops would be high in terms of withering of flowers and fruit rot, but now, without the showers there was a rich flowering in the crops, and in turn a bountiful harvest of fruits.According to current market conditions, a container of 15 kg of tomatoes is sold at `20. Due to the drastic fall in prices, tomato farmers in the district are not even interested in plucking them and are leaving the fruit to rot in the plant itself.I have cultivated tomatoes in three acres of land, and have spent `3 lakh in raising the crops. But due the fall in procurement prices, I could not recover even `2 lakh, said Valukkuparai Balu, president, Farmers Association, Coimbatore. According to him, a farmer needs to spend `200 per farm hand a day for plucking tomatoes and he has to meet other expenditure like transporting the produce to markets.Similarly affected are shallot farmers. Following the fall in price, most of the farmers have created huts in their farms, and are storing the produce. According to farmers, the procurement price of shallots is `6 to `8 per kg, and hence, they are storing them in huts, expecting the price to rise.Farmers pointed out that the Economic Department of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) would normally indicate the price of every crop before the season. But this time, the university has failed to predict tomato prices. They demanded that utilising the excess production, a value addition industry for tomato should be started in the district.Meanwhile, Deputy Director of Horticulture Department, A Ramakrishnan, said, Tomato is being cultivated in around 400 hectares in the district. Excess production has resulted in price loss. Practically, we cannot develop value-added industry due to the gap in production."

The kitchen also pans a non-vegetarian version of the dish, with a chicken stuffing, which complimented the ensemble well.The kitchen borrows tools from the science laboratory to create an ensemble that exploits every ingredient as a hero on the plate.The fluffy crunch and chowy substance of Spanakopita - a spinach pie wins the appetizer spread. It is a spinach and feta cheese mixture folded in phyllo sheets and baked. The pie is presented well in shot glasses with sauces.Kolokithokeftedes, which are fried zucchini fritters taste of a feta cheese and red onion mix and serves as a good bar food.The chicken souvlaki, which was served with pita bread delivered a smoky flavour with Greek spices on a lemon-based marinate.With the main course, veg moussaka scores high presentation and flavour. The dish has the crunch of fried potato grills, spun in a ball that sits atop an oven baked composition of layers of eggplant, potatoes, zucchini, feta and briami. The baked stuffing is delicious and melts in the mouth exuding flavours of the eggplant and spices.A non-vegetarian version of the dish was served with a well cooked lamb.Chef Shendre also serves this refreshing blend of hibiscus scoured vodka with tea foam as part of his experimental cuisine. Each mouthful of the drink is a fresh mix of the soothing tea and the calming hibiscus abstract - two elements extracted through molecular gastronomy techniques.The Greek desserts at the eatery score a whopper with the chef presenting each element on the dish artistically.While Belgian chocolate and black pepper panna cotta, both deliver visually and please the sweet tooth, baklava with caramel foam and nougat definitely beats them all. This shiny presentation that lays the Greek pastry structurally, one top of another, complimented with honey and caramel froth can definitely be touted to earn fans in the city.The cocktail menu has a spread of mixes that compliments the chefs delights.Of the colourful sips served are Blue Hawaii, Litchi Martin, Blonde, Litchi Passion and Lick my peach.The curry-based vodka punch - Litchi passion, which is the bartenders special and Orange Blossom - orange bitters, peels and gin is a must-try if you visit Kipos.If you are someone who is tired of the usual and are looking for a spread that accentuates each flavour and element on the dish, this place is for you."

The ongoing Italian food festival at Prego, The Westin Hyderabad Mindspace (which is on till October 29) boasts of a menu hand-crafted by chef Roberto Boggio that has all of above. He has been flown down from Le Meridien Pune and the full-course meal served by him and his team has already found favour with the Italian food enthusiasts in the city. It also helps that the Chef can make you fall in love a little bit more with his cuisine with his dramatic storytelling. My life is my job, says Roberto after giving a lively presentation about and dishing out some trivias about the fare on the table.The full-course meal rustled up by the team comprised starters, soup, pizza, pasta course and dessert. The Saturday afternoon feast begun with Tartara di asparagi con salsa di taleggio which is pudding comprising asparagus, a hint of egg and taleggio cheese sauce. The minestrone made with vegetables and pesto sauce was warm and comforting. The pizza with tuna, squid, prawn, crab, with a generous layer of pesto and tomato sauce sums up an ideal brunch food. However, the Cotoletta impanata, classic chicken pane served with rosemary potatoes stole the show before the desserts arrived. The coffee dust sprinkled tiramisu was the perfect way to end the meal."

The secret behind the delectable spread of paya, nihari and marag served fresh with hot dil naan is that there really is no short-cut. Itminan or patience is the byword followed by the chefs who make it. The launch of a new Hyderabadi Irani menu, as a tribute to the Nizami traditions atSodaBottleOpenerWala, Hyderabad was another reminder of this fact. You cant cook this fare by a recipe book, it takes painstaking hours of cooking and a whole lot of love to put these delicacies on the table, says Shaaz Mehmood, partner, SBOW.From this week onwards, the Jubilee Hills-based Irani Cafe has been serving two kinds of cuisines-the usual Parsi Bombay fare and the Hyderabadi delicacies along with liquor. If this strikes a chord with the food lovers in the city, the plan is to replicate it in the other outlets through out the country. It took three months and copious hours in the kitchen for us to train our chefs. My mother, my partner Shirazs mother, my grand-mothers cooks, my fiancs grand mothers cooks, over six households got together to come up with the dishes, informs Shaaz.For starters we tried the mutton varqi luqmi with mint and tomato chutney; this could be the perfect companion for your cuppa of your signature Irani chai. The baked Irani specialties also include Osmania biscuits, macrom, badam biskoot, naan khataais.What came next at the sampling session was the paya, nihari and marag with dil naan and zabaan. The spice level was muted but it allowed us to savour the flavour even better. The talihuwi arbi and talahuwa gosht, would go well with your baghara khana and khatti dal. One must pair the kaddu ka dalcha (a warm and wholesome variant of dal with gourd) with steamed rice. The Irani haleem, somewhat different from the characteristic preparation that you get almost every nook and corner in Hyderabad during Ramazan. Served with chopped mint leaves, a squeeze of lemon, fried onions, and green chillies, this dish had a fresh taste. The biryani, both mutton and vegetarian were not the usual spicy variation but stayed true to the authentic Hyderabadi taste. The dum ka murg was distinctly smokey as this dish is meant to be. The meal ended on a sweet note with khubani ka meetha and kulfi-falooda that was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth.The new menu lives up to the promise of serving food that is truly Hyderabadi in every morsel. For your next relaxed meal with conversations that go on for hours, this could be an apt bet."

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

I want people to experiment with new flavours. If you are a South Indian, Ill suggest you to try Gujarati, Kolhapuri, Bengali, Marathi cusines. Theres an array of flavours in Indian cuisine and with this restaurant, my goal is to encourage people to try different flavours of India, he says.Doi Rui Tawa Fry sets off the delightful mustard based spread, with pleasing favlours marked by the curd and ginger garlic marinate. The fish is well cooked and compliments well with the colourful presentation of sliced onions and beetroot.The main course sees a bountiful variation of the Illish fish, with brand chef at the Indian Kitchen presenting a range of authentic recipes from the Bengali kitchen.Machar Kalia was a sweet and spicy combination of onion, tomato paste cooked with potatoes that set the sauce for the fish that was cooked in raw mustard and spices. The dish definitely is one of the must-try curries in the main course spread.On the other hand Lonka Bhapa Illish, sets a milder tone with subtle flavours of the sauce that is a blend of mustard, coconut milk, coconut paste and green chillis.Kosha Mangsho, a traditional mutton dish served at the restaurant, while lacking on presentation, was well cooked in mustard oil, complimented with a onion-ginger-garlic gravy.The Murd Deem Biriyani is not too spicy and will appeal to those who appreciate subtle flavours in their biriyani.

Chilli and other vegetables grown in the region have a good market in Tamil Nadu.Thousands of farmers who have grown varieties of vegetables using underground water and by judicious water management have also given up harvesting as the prices have crashed.The farmers have grown bullet chilli, beans, cabbage, potato, brinjal and flowers in hundreds of acres expecting good prices in Tamil Nadu market during Navaratri season.Farmers in Bommanahalli, Attigulipura, Siddaiahnapura, Chikkahalli, Chatra, Ankashettypura, Ramasamudra and other villages depend on Tamil Nadu markets particularly Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Mettuplayam and Madurai. They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court. He said about 55 farmers in his village are served notices and are told to appear before the court on August 29. How can I attend court spending `500-1,000 when I have no money to buy fodder for my cows? he said.He said banks have claimed `500 more for serving notice and alleged that these pressure tactics would only force farmers to take extreme steps.The stir has hit transportation of textile products to Mysuru during the Dasara festivities and it has delayed moving of black granite to ports in Tamil Nadu for the last two weeks."

Shut out of banks and starved of cash for inputs like fertilizer, seeds and pesticides, farmers across the south have slashed their rabi sowing, at some places by more than half the normal acreage.In Ballari, farmers who had already sown crops when Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were withdrawn from the market on November 8 are not much better off and face the risk of losing the investment they had already made. One farmer, Lepakshi Naidu in Hosapete taluk, Karnataka, said he had sown 30 acres of chilli prior to November 8 and now with banks allowing him to withdraw no more than Rs 2000 per day, he was unable to pay workers. The loss of crop over 30 acres could cripple his hopes, he said.Pesticide dealers confirmed that rabi sowing is down by 80 per cent in Ballari and by at least 40 per cent in Telangana, where a fertilizer trader said he would normally do business of Rs 20-25 lakh per day, but had not sold a single bag of fertilizer all week. Farmers across the peninsula said they would trade their produce for a deep discount if only they would be paid in low-denomination bills. But with no one having small notes, that was a remote possibility.For tomato farmers in Odisha, prices have fallen so low (Rs 2 per kg in Bargarh) that it was not even worthwhile to transport it to the market. Traders have been absent from auctions in the vegetable markets, and the only consignments moving are those that had been paid for before November 8. Not that such farmers are happier.Most have put their money in the bank and are now effectively shut out of any access to it. All told, its been a vicious cycle for farmers be it in Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Telangana. If in Kerala farmers are unable to repay their loans because their procurement incomes have been delayed, cultivators in Nalgonda, Telangana, said the loans from moneylenders and deposits in banks are out of reach as well while they pay interest on loans."

It had cabbage, onions, pepper, tomato ketchup sauce and garnished with a fried egg. Wouldnt you love to try that? I remember being the happiest little kid when my mom would cook her amazing meals for the family. I began to cook too. Actually, I wanted to join armed forces because I always admired their dedication and discipline. But I could not pursue it further; so I decided to be a chef, which also requires equally high levels of dedication and discipline. No regrets at all!Sujit MukherjeeThe first professional kitchen experience I had was peeling onions for a large banquet and I grew to cooking food for 2,800 people. I started my career in an Indian kitchen. The blend of spices and the union of flavours with exotic spices fascinate me. A lot of young people have no idea what this kind of job requires. Its tough; so try not to take this as an easy way out. Nowadays, chefs are in serious demand all over the world.Recently, we did a complete themed brunch which was based on molecular cuisine using techniques like sous vide, nitrogen cooking, gelling and spherification. Of course, certain experiments dont work out. I tried making a pizza pie with a twist but it didnt come out the way I wanted it too. Food is not just about cooking; I educate myself on flavour, taste and seasonality.You should try Spaghetti Aglio Olio with grilled chicken, which has a nice charcoal aroma of the chicken, caramelised garlic and extra virgin olive oil for that additional flavour. Its my favourite! Always use garlic and herbs in your dishes. While the former helps in controlling cholesterol, the latter helps in reduction of heart diseases.Ive got a good understanding of food and cuisines from other countries. A tip to aspiring chefs: eat a wide range of food and experiment with things; its the only way to update yourself in the present market. So start at the bottom and work your way up, learn and absorb as much as possible. Assisting in kitchens is essential to understand the industry on a deeper level. If you have that passion and youre willing to work hard, youll do well. And fast.As for me, Ive been in the kitchen for a long time and I soon want to travel to various places and try the local flavours there.Also, cook under the open sky and indulge in a nice warm chocolate souffl."

I started with simple plants such as chilly, tomato, brinjal, palak, pudina I also have a lemon tree, bryophyllum and curry leaves that attract lovely butterflies.I enjoy gifting saplings, exchanging seeds and tips about gardening, there is so much one can learn from Mother Nature.The experience of gardening is not complete without composting.You can put your kitchen waste in a container with holes ,with some browns (dry leaves or cocopeat), microbes (sour buttermilk). Keep covered, protected from the sun and the rain. Mix every 4 to 5 days.Once your container is full your compost will be ready in a month's time. The garden waste can be stored in a gunny bag and after breaking down, use it to mulch your plants. Mulching will help the soil stay moist then you will need less water.

One day, a foreign guest approached us demanding organic food. He wanted items that were fresh and reliable. The thought was healthy which is what I have transformed into a full-fledged dining experience, says Michael. According to him, the amount of pesticides that are being sprayed on vegetables, fruits and growth hormones being injected into chicken and other products is affecting the health of the public.Whats cookingFor starters, one can order Tandoori Batera, which is local quail marinated with Punjabi spices and cooked in tandoor to perfection. The fish egg is the local chickens product brought fresh from the farm and cooked in naadan style.The Eel fish curry, which is part of the main course is brought to the table in a small clay pot.

In fact, the historic Bangalore Club proudly claims this butterfly obsessed officer still owes the club `13 from an unpaid bill during one of his visits. The young Lieutenant was a frequent visitor of the Waverly Inn at Whitefield, where he is believed to have stayed on occasion. Rumour has it that during his visits, Churchill courted Rose Hamilton, the daughter of James Hamilton, who was the then owner of the Inn. The Waverly Inn still stands today, though it is now a private residence.Whitefield Arms incorporates this history with colonial themed wooden furniture and outdoor seating that makes for a quiet date night place.The microbrewery fuses Indian with British culinary skills in a menu that serves soups, burgers, salad, dessert and cocktails.The famed Madras pepper borth cooked presented in an Anglicised version is basically dal with an Angrezi tadka served as Mulligatawny soup that keeps it mild and easy on the throat.Their Cheddar Onion Soup is officially the best soup I have had ever, and I have had quite a few good ones. But this rich carmelised onion soup served with a gratinated cheese crouton absolutely won me over. To anyone visiting the place, forget the drinks, this soup is all you need to warm and please you up on a gloomy day. With the starters, while I enjoyed the crispy fried onion, the TWA Chips, Cheese and Gravy, which is basically fries topped with dal makhani, cheese, chopped jalapenos, green chillis and onions isnt exactly the kind of fusion cuisine Id vote for.To the pea lover, the chef does bake a mean Filo Parcel with peas and corn that is served with tomato fenugreek sauce and stir fried vegetables. The filo is buttery and flakes in melting into your mouth, with peas and corn to compliment the creamy crunch. The tomato fenugreek sauce is also used as a base for Pan Seared Vegetable and Yogurt Cakes. The dish is a combination of stuffed grilled galettes with hung curd served with a tomato fenugreek sauce, stir fried vegetables and truffle mushroom rice.Loved the mushroom rice, but the acidity of the yogurt cake and the tomato fenugreek sauce wasnt a pleasing combination, probably a basic potato substance would have lifted this dish. The mini burger is cuteness overload with the size and the miniature stuffing, the taste? Well, still dreaming about the onion soup here.But then, desserts happened. And oh my, all my dreams of an Eclairs fantasy came true. The Sticky Toffee Pudding is a rich cake soaked with a thick sticky toffee sauce topped with vanilla ice cream.The Lemon Meringue Pie is a classic citrus dessert done right, with a creamy toasted meringue.Among cocktails, along with a rather cheery bartender, the Lavelle, Air Mail, Mountbatten and Colonial. Each cocktail has a story to tell, with few in the memory of World War II heroes.My favourite? The Air Mail, this sparkling wine based cocktail wisely mixes Old Monk with honey and lime to make a soothy drink.Two things Id definitely recommend with Whitefield Arms is the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Cheddar Onion Soup and the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Oh, and also the outside sitting area that resembles the restaurants you come across on a walk through the streets of Paris.(Approximate cost for two people `1,500. Place: Whitefield Arms)"

Insects which feed on plants are called as pests. In nature, these pests are consumed by the predator insects, that are garden friendly or farmer friendly. However, chemical farming has collapsed this balancing system in nature. Chemical pesticides kill predators and pests resistance towards these chemicals as well. In natural farming, pest management is based on the principle of 'prevention is better than cure'. Weaker plants are easily susceptible to pest attacks while healthy plants don't get affected by pests and thrive best if they grow in good quality soil. Humus is the best way to create healthy soil. Humus could be created by adding biomass and beneficial micro organisms to the soil. Desi cow dung and cow urine are the best sources of beneficial micro organisms. Creating healthy soil as well as the following simple gardening tips will help you to make your garden absolutely healthy.Plant protection tips for your gardenSeeds should be treated with a microbial culture before sowing, which gives protection from all fungal diseases.Providing proper space between plants will facilitate aeration and avoid spreading of disease between the plants.Marigold can be grown around the garden, as a trap crop. The yellow flower attracts pests and secures the main vegetable plants.Grow companion plants. When vegetables are grown with herbs, the herbs act as a repellent plant for pests. Tomato and tulsi can be grown in the same pot.Crop rotation should be followed. Grow different plants instead of same plants in each container. For example tomato - beans - onion can be grown consecutively in one year.Grow maize and cow pea in between vegetable plants. The maize and cow pea foliage attracts pests and prevent other vegetable crops from getting affected.If any plant or plant part gets affected by insects, remove the affected pant or plant part manually and use it for composting.Growing marigold and castor plants once in a while in the pot which will give protection from root nematodes.Have lights in the garden during night hours. The nocturnal pests, which are active during night time will get attracted by lights and does not affect the plants.Take a piece of yellow colour chart paper and apply castor oil on both sides and tie it on the plant. Adult pest insects get attracted by the yellow colour and acts as a sticky trap.Nursery trays could be covered with a mesh/net to avoid the fly attackAdd neem cake with the potting mixture to give protection from root diseases.All the above prevention measures give maximum control over pests. In case any further pest incidence to be observed in the garden then go for a repellent spray, which will not kill the pest but give a repellent effect to the pests.These tips will help you to get rid of the pests from the garden. If you still find any pest infestation then use a neem based spray on weekly intervals until it is controlled.For more information on urban farming or any other related queries contact author at nalini@artyplantz.com"
58fd5dde7be9e06c9371a7fa,Pellets or grains for furry friends?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2016/sep/21/Pellets-or-grains-for-furry-friends-1521949.html,2016-09-21,"CHENNAI: A nutritious and balanced diet is essential for your furry friends, but how can you pick the right one? You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

She enlightens the kids about five things Madras is famous for  the Marina beach, hot idlis with a variety of chutney, the Vandaloor zoo, Sem Mozhi Poonga and the Rajni craze. As she finishes, Banu jumps onto the stage and narrates the story of Thiruverkaadu Amman temple.The trio has been associated with storytelling for many years, and now has learnt new tricks to ensure kids can relate to what they say. Well, a few kids grasp immediately, while a few look at our actions and pick it up slowly. For some others, it is the rhyming words and songs that help them understand what is told. So when it comes to Madras Day stories, we try and incorporate all of these so that they can relate it to, says Sharanya.Today, Chennai has many heritage buildings and sites. How important is it for kids to know about these historic structures? I personally feel its very important for all of us who stay/live in this city to know about its history and heritage, says Banu. Of all the places that have become history, Asha says she misses the Moore Market complex most. Well, I treasure the hours I spent shopping there. I still remember buying books for 90 paisa, a basket for 25 paisa and I miss that place a lot.As she finishes, Sharanya drifts her thoughts to the days when Drive-in Woodlands was a happening-spot in the city. The bread and peas that used to be served there for breakfast used to be my favourite. The bread would be toasted with butter on plain tawa with the onion, tomato and green peas curry. Even today I pine for it, she laughed."

Thus making women the torch-bearers of development.The other day the prestigious Haritha Keralam project was launched across the state for a clean and green Kerala through waste management, organic farming and conservation of water resources. Most of the Kudumbasree units are already engaged in organic farming in their respective areas.The programme has been titled as Harvest in three cents (Moonu centil veetham polivu). As part of the project all Kudumabsree members will also grow vegetables at their houses, utilising available space.Those who are interested in farming will be supplied with seeds and saplings through panchayats. For students, the same will be supplied through schools. Organic manure will be supplied on a subsidised rates to those who take up farming.Meanwhile, most of the local bodies have launched various initiatives as part of Haritha Keralam.At Amballoor panchyat, organic cultivation was launched on nearly two and a half acres of land. The vegetables being grown here include long beans, ladys finger, spinach, tomato and plantain.With this initiative, we are planning to carry out the ward level plans for organic farming to another level, said Amballoor panchayat president Jalaja Mohan.The two and a half acres at Poyyattithazham will be used for the cultivation. A group of farmers from the panchayath has already agreed to carry out the work. The vegetables will be cultivated organically by using compost and cow dung as the main manures, she added."

This green inititative comes from a group of women under the banner of Women Entrepreneur Belagavi (WEB) Association.They have launched these idols made of natural clay, in association with a Bengaluru-based organisation. These idols, instead of creating pollution after Visarjan (immersion), grow into plants.What is interesting is that you dont have to take the idol to any water body for immersion. It can be done at your home itself without creating any kind of pollution.Sonia Netalkar of WEB said the height of the statue is 10 inches and the base tub about 8 inches. The total weight of the set is about 5 kg, she added.Explaining the concept of a green Ganesha, she said the statue is placed at the base filled with organic coco peat.She said: Coco peat is very light, highly compressible and readily absorbs and retains moisture. All of these factors make it perfect for horticultural applications.Sonia said the idol is filled with Tulsi and tomato seeds. During the immersion, the devotee will just have to place the set in a gallery or terrace or garden and pour water on it.In about three days, the idol dissolves and seven days later, one can find a sapling of tomato or tulsi grown in that same base, she said.As this is a novel concept, we need to spread awareness. This year we want to sell 108 idols, each costing `1,151. Already more than 60 idols have been booked, she said.Rasika Kadolkar of WEB said these green idols will make the festival pollution-free without diluting the spirit of the celebrations.According to the pollution control board officials, Plaster of Paris idols may take several months to years to fully dissolve. This material also reduces the oxygen level in the water, killing fish and other aquatic organisms, they added."

Later in the day, Dhakis from Bengal played Dhak (drums) to mark the festival. The drum beats are an integral part of Durga Puja here.The rhythmic beats of the special variety of the drum from the day of Sasthi is a special attraction, said Sidharth Sarkar, secretary of Town Durga Puja Committee.The most common form of offering on Durga Puja is Khichdi, served with semi dry vegetable preparation, sweet tomato chutney and rice pudding, said Ramchandra Panigrahi, the priest of the Station Chowk Durga temple.While `25 lakh was spent by Mangalbazar Shivasakti Puja Committee, `20.2 lakh has been spent by Om Sri Puja Committee.

An auction takes place there. Traders from a wide area come to pick up huge volumes of vegetables. Its a unique market. The bids begin past midnight and the deals last through the wee hours. Prahallad Sahu hasnt been there in more than a week. Its 10 km from his village of Kalangapali but whats the point?There have been good years for Prahallad there but 2016 has been different. Tomato was going for a measly Rs 2 a kg, so he decided not to hire labour and made his family harvest the crop. Some of this seasons produce was picked up for that paltry price but the traders came to the village to pick it up. The rest is rotting in field.Vegetables had been a fetching crop for farmers in Bargarh block in previous years. This year too the yields had been bumper but then demonetisation drove the traders away. The only traders turning up in the market are those who had buy-back deals with farmers and had paid in advance. They got by the challenge of procuring fertilizers and seedlings by arranging credit, but paying for labour has no such solution. Many of the farmers have money in the bank but there are limits on how much you can withdraw.Winter is when vegetable prices soar. So theres hope when this demonetisation thing ends on Dec 30. When this crisis is over and we can sell vegetables for some profit again, said Uddhaba Deep, a farmer in Jamurda village. No one in Bargarh has read Shaktikanta Dass latest time horizon for that.Farmers who had already sold their produce before Narendra Modis bombshell on Nov. 8 ought to be happier, but they arent. Bipin Biswal is a cabbage farmer who sold his harvest before Nov. 8 and put his money in the bank. Now its locked and he cant pay his labourers. Really, the only lucky ones have been those who engaged local labourers. Villagers here have revived an age-old to cope with demonetization: they pay them in rice and vegetables. Farmers who employed migrant workers dont the luxury or barter.Bidyadhar Pradhan owes his labour contractor Rs 43,000. He can withdraw a maximum of Rs 24,000 per week from the bank. If he chooses to pay off the labourers as they are breathing down his neck, he has to forego preparing his field for the rabi rice. Hes got some tight management to do: he feeds his labourers twice a day and plies them with tea so they will a bit longer. Or, if the stars will it, his kharif crop will be sold and there will be money to pay them off.Some farmers said the heck with it and sold to any trader who will pay them in cash at whatever price, profit or loss, throwaway or handsome. Vegetable grower Shatrughan Mallick got rid of his entire lot of ladies fingers at one go. At least I got some money, he said.Take away the gnawing demonetization worries, villages in Bargarh have been sent back in time to days when apparently -- like in the Desh ki Dharti movies of the 1950s and 1960s -- kind neighbours helped out in each others fields and sang songs when the rain came. Since everybody is in the same boat, the merchants and traders of Bargarh are being sympathetic to the farmers, offering fertilizer and pesticides on credit.The villagers are ignorant but they never cheat and are very conscious of their prestige in the village. So they repay immediately after receiving the proceeds of their harvest, said a local merchant.Funny how the cashless economy has put rural India in the warm embrace of feudal practices."

The buffet will be at offer for guests and visitors on December 24 and 25 and is likely to feature close to 20 desserts, he adds.The roasted pumpkin soup was a warm and traditional start to the dinner. The soup is soothing, with the pulp mashed to a puree, leaves a hint of garlic and thyme taste. The pine nuts adds a crunchy bite to the soups.The Chicken Consomme looks like green tea with shreds of coriander leaves. The soup is thinner than the usual chicken broths, the consomme is carved into the shape of a rose and is stuffed with minced chicken.The Eggplant Parmigiani won the festive spread, with the vegetables spiced circlular slices baked well, with a smoky skin on, aligned over each other.The tomato sauce tastes of a pure extract and garlic. Although not a fan of cheese layered over eggplant, here the whole ensemble just melts in the mouth and the acidity of the tomato sauce strikes the right balance for deliciousness.The mushroom lasagna too is a tomato puree based vegetarian preparation. The tiny button mushroom chops are layered between the lasagna sheets and served with the garlic-tomato sauce and topped with basil. Enjoyed the dish, but my mind still wanders around how tasty the parmigiani was.Despite being a dessert person, this ensemble was a bit of a disappointment for me.The plum cake in a star cutout was just a regular tasting one and nothing extraordinary and same goes for the most desserts on my table.The pumpkin pie would be my best bet if you wish to end your meal on a sweet and satisfactory note."

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments. As for those investors who want to set up something, we provide the expertise.Meanwhile, Mariem is looking forward to coming back to Kochi in the future. I love the place, she says."

However, the free food is being wasted by some pilgrims leaving others hungry.Owing to a heavy rush during Krishna Pushkaralu, around 55 voluntary organisations and philanthropists have set up stalls in the 20 Pushkar Nagars to feed the pilgrims. Vegetable biryani, lemon rice, curd rice, tomato rice and sambar rice are being offered to the pilgrims at many makeshift tents. In the wake of consecutive holidays during the weekend, voluntary organisations made elaborate arrangements to feed as many as pilgrims they can.But the situation was different at many Pushkar Nagars as many dumper bins were seen filled with the excess food thrown away by the pilgrims. Pilgrims who arrived late at the Pushkar Nagars, were forced to return with empty stomachs as the food packets were exhausted.Karanam Jogayya, pilgrim from Lakkavarapu Kota in Vizianagaram district, expressed his dissatisfaction over the officials for their failure in monitoring the food supply near the Pushkar Nagars. I cant afford the food at roadside eateries which were being sold out at an exorbitant prices. The voluntary organisations should not confine themselves to particular area, they should spread their activity to other places to feed the hungry, he said.Most of the pilgrims at Pushkar Nagar near Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) and city railway station had bitter experience and left the place with hunger. We have prepared estimations to supply lemon rice and sambar rice for 30,000 pilgrims per day, said D Chalapathi Rao, an NGO volunteer at PNBS.From Day One of Krishna Pushkarams, Chalapathi Rao said that they have noticed that most of the pilgrims were taking excess food as a precautionary measure but throwing it away after all of them ate. To reduce wastage, we deployed additional volunteers near the queue lines to control the food wastage. Every pilgrim should feel responsible and extend their support in controlling the food wastage, he maintained.Meanwhile, the roadside eateries and hotels dotting the main stretches increased the rates of eatables and were fleecing the pilgrims. Pilgrims complained that the roadside eateries and hotels were charging anywhere around `10-20 per dish in excess of the prices mentioned in the menu. If opposed, many hotel staff were asking the pilgrims to leave. Some hotels have adopted a clever tactic. Though prices were not changed, they have reduced the quantity per each dish, said Raghavendra, a kirana shop owner."

Despite a repeat of the situation year after year, concrete steps are yet to be taken by the State Government to redress the woes of the vegetable growers.Vegetable farmers in Bargarh district, cotton growers of Balangir, Kalahandi and Nuapada districts, onion cultivators of Titilagarh in Balangir district and maize farmers of Nabarangpur district continue to suffer heavy losses due to Government apathy.Lack of basic infrastructure to store their produce too has hit them hard with farmers in several areas getting returns much less than the cost of production. With no other option to earn a livelihood, they toil hard in the fields only to earn peanuts. While the middlemen and traders reap benefits, the farmers continue to suffer and the State Government prefer to close its eyes to their problem.To add to their woes, demonetisation has eaten into their small market scope and farmers have decided not to harvest their crop as it would propel them into penury from poverty. Take for instance, while people in the State may find vegetable cheaper during the winter, in Bargarh cauliflower, cabbage, flat beans, French beans, cucumber and brinjal are sold at Rs 10 a kg, bitter gourd is priced at Rs 15, tomato Rs 5 a kg, chilly and snake bean at Rs 20, green peas at Rs 30, melon, radish and potato at Rs 5 a kg, while onion is priced at Rs 8.The only two costly vegetables are ladies finger sold at Rs 20 and potol which is priced at Rs 30. If vegetable farmers are to be believed they get 40 per cent of the market rate of vegetables.Since harvesting involves much more cost than the price they are offered for the produce, farmers prefer not to harvest it. Sushil Sahu of Sirigida village in Sohela block of Bargarh district had cultivated tomato over seven acres of land and had spent Rs 2 lakh on seeds, pesticide and fertiliser besides labour. Though his tomato crop has ripped it is left to rot in the field as neither harvesting is financially feasible nor the price offered is lucrative enough to help him recover the cost of production.Similar is the story of Rajendra Barik and Sachi Barik of the village. There is no buyer for tomato even at Rs 1 per kg, they said. The tomato farmers are more worried over repayment of their loans. Recalling that they had sold tomato at 0.25 paise in past, they said the situation has not improved. Cauliflower, cabbage and brinjal too are likely to meet the same fate when harvesting peaks.Chilli harvesting has already gone the tomato way and farmer Faguni Biswal of Balijuri village under Bargarh block has allowed the crop to ripen than invest on harvesting it which would entail more cost. Deputy Director, Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said more than bumper crop, it is demonetisation which has pushed farmers to the brink.Demonetisation has been creating a transactional problem and keeping traders away. While the only cold storage in the district at Barpali is lying defunct, proposal is in the pipeline for developing two cold storages, one in Bargarh and another in Padampur. He hoped that things would improve after it gets operational.Meanwhile, farmers said the availability of a cold storage, food processing industries, development of mandi and marketing system would have helped them get right price for their produce."

The booths with long tables and high chairs are perfect to hang out with friends and family, and make a new friend or two.Start off with the Jameson Sperm, a classic blend of Jameson whiskey, orange juice and grape juice. Even those who are not whiskey lovers will like the cocktail. The citrusy taste of orange and grapes make it mildly bitter and tangy.The Cajun Sweet Potato Fries is unique. Unlike the regular potato fries, these are fries of sweet potatoes, sprinkled with seasoning. They are crisp and delicious.The Minced Up Fries was a delight. The fries topped with chicken bolognese has chopped hard boiled eggs garnished with crispy onions. The raw taste of the hard-boiled eggs stands out.The grilled and spicy cottage cheese and baby corn skewers in Skewed Cottage Cheese is topped with chunky pineapple butter sauce. The pineapple butter sauce adds a sweetness to the perfect marinated cottage cheese.The hot fondue served with the veggies lends The Melting Pot its name. Also called Beer Fondue, the platter has mushrooms, roasted potatoes, tomato wedges, toasted foccacia crouton breads and mini foccocia bites. Dip them in the fondue and have a bite for a creamy and rich taste.Served with crispy fries, the Chicken Ghost Crunch Burger comes with panko-crusted chicken tenders. The dish has bits that are crisp and others that are crunchy. It is topped with jalapenos, ghost peppers, assorted lettuce and a cheddar melt.The dessert menu reads Forget love, Id rather fall in chocolate and they are right. The chocolate desserts will make you forget all else. The Dual Chocolate Torte is a treat for all the chocolate lovers. The mousse cake with the layers of both dark and white chocolate is smooth and cheesy. The bitterness of dark chocolate blends well with the milky white chocolate.A meal for two with alcohol would cost around Rs. 2,000."
