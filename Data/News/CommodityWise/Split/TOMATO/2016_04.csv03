In the last five days price of potato has gone up by Rs two to touch Rs 22. While cucumber costs Rs 40 a kg, onion is up by Rs four to cost Rs 22, tomato is priced at Rs 35 from the earlier Rs 30 and ladyfinger is selling for Rs 40 and cauliflower is priced between Rs 20 and Rs 25.Banking in on the religious sentiments of the people are dalals who have started hoarding. A farmer of Sankarpur Basanta Sahoo alleged that they earn little as dalals detain them on way to Dhenkanal markets and buy the produce from them at cheaper prices. Farmers from Sankarpur, Tarava, Gondia and Dinabandhupur and other pockets of Sadar block bring their produce to the towns market while potato is imported from West Bengal and Onions from Nasik.Civil Supply Officer Hadibandhu Sethy said, We have conducted a meeting with traders and asked them to keep price of onion and potato stable in daily sample study. We have started conducting survey from Tuesday. The department, however, has no hold or authority in enforcing price of vegetables except potato, onion and dal, he added.During Laxmi Puja, the demand for potato and onion increases manifold as more fast food stalls come up at this time. As many as 200 gupchup vendors from Bihar have opened their stalls and each vendor purchases a minimum of 50 kg potato a day, informed one of the kiosk owners in Ganesh Bazaar. Locals have demanded the intervention of the Government or district administration to check the prices from going beyond the reach of common man."

The marketing department of the state government has decided to ensure that the farmers get a fair deal. Marketing minister T Harish Rao asked the department officials to procure tomatoes for Rs 5 a kilo through the Mana Kuragayalu (Our Vegetables) scheme of the state government. The marketing department has also decided to set up special counters for the farmers who want to sell tomatoes at Rythu Bazaars, where the tomatoes will be available at Rs 7 per kilo. The marketing department has conducted a survey of the tomato produce available in the state and has already procured 300 quintals of the produce through the 16 procurement centres.Tomatoes are predominantly grown on the outskirts of Hyderabad,in Medak district and also in Mominpet, Nawabpet, Chevella and Yacharam areas in Rangareddy district.Potatoes to be procured tooThe government has also decided to procure potatoes directly from farmers as the rates of the vegetable have fallen drastically.""While the wholesale price is around `500 per quintal, the marketing department will procure a quintal of potatoes for `800 directly from the fields of the farmers,"" an official release said.The move is aimed at ensuring that the farmers save them the trouble of investing in transportation, hamali charges and commissions to agents."

Growers were getting only Rs 5 for 10 kg tomatoes which translates to 50 paise per kilogram.Tomatoes were grown in 492 hectares in the taluk. While some farmers threw their yield on roads, others left the crop in their fields.Harapanahalli tomato is normally sent to Davangere, Sindhanur, Hospet and surrounding areas for sale. Since the yield was high this year, the price fell sharply. We cannot even pay the wages of labourers who pluck tomatoes.

But it continues to be sold to the consumer at Rs 20.I sell it for Rs 20 a kilo, said a vegetable vendor at Panjagutta. I bought it for Rs 10 a kilo from the wholesale market. I have a family to feed. Hence I sell it at Rs 20, he explained when asked about why he has not brought the price down despite the fall in market price.The same reason was given by other vegetable sellers as well.We are getting supplies from Anantapur in Andhra and from Karnataka. The production of tomato was high there which has brought the prices down, said Laxmi Bai, additional director of marketing, Telangana Agricultural Marketing Committee.There would always be situations in which farmers overproduce or underproduce. In both the cases, the farmers suffer. Now the situation in Telangana today is similar to the price crash that occurred in other states in the past. Again the reason cited is oversupply. We do not have a system whereby we can assure minimum price to the farmer. What we need to do is announce a minimum base price and the government must step in to buy, said Devinder Sharma, a food and trade policy analyst."

The ginger and garlic flavoured soya chunks, steamed in a bamboo were quite easily forgetabble. The chicken however, with a similar treatment was flavourful and well emulsified with the spices.The drumstick soup is thick, with palak and dal adding consistency to its texture. The soup stands by its name, tastes of dumstrick extract, dal and leaves a pepper hit in the end.The corn fried with til, served with garlic sauce leaves an oily after taste and the primary falvour you get is of the batter and cooked corn.The fixed vegetarian meal is soothing, filling and definitely my best take away from the place.The dal is took thick in consistency, for those who like it a little thinner and liquid-y, give this one a miss.The sambar and rasam is much like it is cooked in any South Indian household, same goes for the vermicelli paysam, which wasnt warm. However, paysam is served cold at some places, I learnt later.My recommendation from the place is the tomato chutney - a very simple mash of the vegetable with no mixing of sorts, the ginger pickle and the gongura - a traditional Andhra chutney.Experiment with the non vegetarian cuisine, if you are a meat lover, but if like me, you favour the greens, keep it simple and fixed meals order maadi!Nandhana Palace has inaugurated Amarvathi Foods Special at Shakaranagar."

The dossier addressed key areas that the Central, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments must concentrate on to ensure for the smooth enforcement of the much awaited bill.The central government had on June 14 released a model law comprising 169 sections. We have gone through those sections and we are recommending a set of aspects which need to be clarified, said co-chairman of FTAPCCI JS Kasunendra.The recommendations are a set of aspects which need to be clarified. FTAPCCI has already submitted the recommendations to the Centre on the business module consisting of registration, payment, return and refund, said Ravindra Modi, President of FTAPCCI. We are going to submit the same to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and also to the empowered committee of state finance minister on GST, he added.The Telangana state government had on Tuesday ratified the Bill, thus becoming the tenth state to do so. After fulfilling the requirement of ratification from 15 states the bill is now at the table of the President of India for his approval.Speaking on the key sectors that will need careful intervention from the central government, Ravindra Modi said We have identified some key areas that need to be discussed, the food processing industry is one of them. Take an example of food processing industry where the farmer who sells tomato or mango do not pay tax but the converted products like ketchup and mango pulps need to be pay taxes,. There is no input credit from those products. The consumer is bearing the tax of those products. So we recommend the government to extend the deemed input tax credit to the food processing industry. Similarly the subsidy in the fertilizer industry will also have to pay GST so subsidy should be excluded from the preview of GST, he added.One of the important issues is dual control. The GST will be controlled by both central and state governments. We recommend to have a single control and it should be a rotating method, said S Tirumalai, advisor of FTAPCCI.We want the Central government to provide an educational guide about the GST. Majority of the industries and businesses are not clear about the GST law. We intend to help the business and industrial sectors to get a clear idea about the law, he added."

We have enough tomato and other vegetables stocks, which we import from India only in case of shortages in the domestic market,"" he said.The reason behind the ""suspension"" of cotton imports from India was, nevertheless, different, he said.""No. We have not stopped cotton imports from India. It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions. We're looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong,"" Shami said.He said only those cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes where importers had already secured permits from his department and carried phyto-sanitary certificates.""Our cotton consignments are not being allowed to enter Pakistan through Wagah and Karachi for reasons known to the ministry but cheaper, subsidised Indian yarn is being brought in without any let or hindrance. At least 11 trucks of Indian yarn entered Pakistan on Thursday when the department stopped cotton consignments from coming to this side of the border,"" a textile factory owner told Dawn.He said the suspension of cotton import from India would create a huge problem for the textile exporters as the truncated domestic crop target of 11.25 million bales for this year appeared difficult if not impossible to meet.""The industry requires 14 million bales. We will still be short by three million bales of cotton even if the crop target is achieved,"" he said.He said cotton shortages after the ban on Indian imports would make domestic prices shoot up at the expense of exports.Pakistan had imported 2.7 million bales of cotton (1 baleis 170 kgs) - about 40 per cent of India's total cotton exports in 2015-16 - due to crop failure that wiped off 0.5 per cent of GDP growth. The industry is expecting to import 2 million bales this year."

Here veggies and meat are cooked with authentic Chettinad spices.You can start your meal with the chef recommended soups. Try the Murunga Keerai Thakkali Rasam. Cooked to perfect thick consistency, the tomato flavour drumstick leaf soup is creamy and delectable. The drumstick leaves lace the spicy soup with a bitter taste.The Chettinad cuisine served here offers a wide variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. For starters, there are Palkatti Chukka, Kaikari Kola Urundai, Chettinadu Egg Roast, Chicken Leg Roast and Kuvepoo Kara Varuval.Palkatti Chukka is batter-fried paneer cubes tossed in Chettinad masala. The crunchy cubes are served along with generous amount of lightly fried curry leaves and shallots. The Kaikari Kola Urundai are fried balls of minced vegetables coated with bread crumbs. They are laced with Chettinad spices. Boiled egg is fried crispy for Chettinadu Egg Roast. They taste zesty.The Chicken Leg Roast is tawa roasted. The sounf-flavoured chicken drumsticks are juicy. Marinated with spices, the drumsticks are pan fried. This crunchy appetiser has a blend of ground masala and curry leaves. The Kuvepoo Kara Varuval has some crispy fried cauliflower florets tossed in Chettinad spices. Though the name suggests Kara, meaning spicy, it is not spicy at all.All the preparations are garnished with curry leaves lending them a strong aroma and flavour to the food. Though the Chettinad cuisines are believed to be spicy and rich, these food preparations are made less spicy, customised to the taste of the Bengalureans. Though, towards the end, everything tastes the same.For the main course, there is the Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryani. Both look appetising and colourful but, on tasting, the dish is mediocre. The chicken pieces in the biryani are bland. The Kothu Parota is a better option with tangy and moist tomatoes and caramelised onions.The desserts are the best. The uniqueness of every dessert surprises you and The Attipaza Halwa, prepared with fig, is served warm. It has a mild sweetness and the jelly-like fig halwa leaves you craving for more.The Jil Jil Jigarthanda reminds you of falooda. The cold sweetened-milk is served with nannari syrup, basil seeds and ice cream. The Paruthi Pal, made of jaggery is like the jack fruit payasam, but it is milk prepared with cotton seeds, spices and herbs. The Chakkara Appam is shallow fried dumplings dipped in ghee and soaked in sugar syrup. It is an answer to every sugar craving.The Pal Kozakattai is steamed rice dumplings served in sweet milk and with shredded pista and badam"

I could draw parallels between the spicy chunky tomato salsa to Indian tomato chutney grinded at home as the Mexican cuisine festival was made more Indian by the chefs at My Caf restaurant in My Fortune. Had it not been for the texture and cheese I would have easily been mistaken. The Tex-Mex festival which has been on-going since November 23 will host its final round this weekend.First we had Cheese Quesadillas, which is in fact Tortillas, a traditional bread of Mexico made either from corn or wheat and rolled in circles, just like roti. Grilled bell pepper and goat cheese was sandwiched between the tortillas. Salsa sauce and sour cream was served along with boiled veggies that made the plate a visual relish.Next came the Enchiladas, which was another version of tortilla cuisine. Filled with goat cheese and veggies and coated with shredded cheese, the hint of spicy Enchilada sauce was a mild zing. The salty and mild cheese balanced the hotness of sauces.Fish cakes, served after the Enchiladas was the show stealer. As a lover of seafood, I savoured the juicy fish meat. The fish fillet was shallow fried and kept tangy with the essence of lime. The first bite was like a drizzle in my mouth.Then Tacos abounding in jalepenos, tomatoes, yellow capsicum, chicken pieces, lettuce and pineapples followed, which was refreshing to taste. The tacos were soft and cunchy. The sour cream was in harmony with the outpouring and moist goat cheese.The food was kept true to its a la carte nature and it is ideal if you want to grab some Indian-Mexican bites with some chilled beer. But I did expect a bit more variety especially with the sauces. Salsa and sour cream is almost overrated for all Mexican cuisine. Where are my Guacamole Taquero and Chiltomate at?"

The Chef Armando Di Filippo says that if there are no breads, theres no tables in Italy.To serve a global favourite  pizza  Movenpick has crafted Italy on your Platter. There are Italian herbs and flavours, luscious cheese and array of toppings to spoil your choice.The Italian chef says that the charm of a pizza doesnt only lie in the myriad toppings but starts with the dough and the base.Chef Aramando says, Pizza is also considered a bread in Italy. Several decades ago, with no bakeries, families in Italy used to bake breads at home. Bread is a must on the menu.The dining begins with a welcome watermelon drink. The starters consist of Bread Sticks, Baked Zucchini, Aranchini and Bruschetta. The platter is simple yet appealing.The round Aranchini, made of rice is crunchy outside and creamy inside. There are breads in different shapes and sizes too. The Bruschetta is said to complement many dishes. The bread is topped with fresh chopped tomatoes and sprinkled with salt and pepper which helps draw out the tomato juice. The sweet and tart flavours magically blend in your mouth. Even people who dont care much for tomatoes will be tempted to have a bite.The slice of Zucchini is baked with ricotta cheese and mixed with veggies, lending it a fresh flavour and creamy texture. The pizzas on the menu are with a thin crust and named after different places in Rome. The Trinita Dei Monti is named after the church in Italy. The velvety ricotta cheese lends it a sweetness. The asparagus topped on the light pizza base is crunchy.The Colosseo Pizza is topped with cheese and crushed black pepper. More the black pepper, better the taste. In Quirinale, cream of broccoli, you can get the raw and bitter taste of the florets.The Pincio is unique. Topped with thin slices of ham, decorated with figs, they are perfect to romance with this monsoon. These pizzas pair well with the beer, which is also served.The Aventino  Allarrabbiata is served with penne pasta. The arrabbiata sauce makes it spicy. The base is as usual crispy topped with fine cheese. It is a treat for the pasta lovers.No menu is complete without a dessert. Pannacotta, the cooked cream topped with berries, tastes like custard.The best bit is that the pizzas dont stuff you. They are light and you can taste the toppings, unlike the others that are usually smothered with cheese."

Barbequed Pudina Ananas Ke Tikke  a grilled pineapple roast with mint flavour  and Dhelvi Paneer Teh Pe Teh  barbequed cottage cheese coated in mint, besan, etc  steal our hearts.I am a yoghurt fan and so enjoy the next, Dahi ke kebab, which is yogurt-based and vermicelli-coated. The dahi oozes out of the kebab, which is to be had with mint chutney with curd and amchur powder and khajoor ki chatni.Fish used in Surkh Fish Tikka in non-vegetarian starters is fresh. But Tandoori Murgh Akbari is a disappointment.Nimoda Tandoori Zinga, as the name suggests, has lemon marination. The dish with fresh prawn was the best among the starters, with its mix of lemon and spice.Dehlvi Shahi Chaap, a single bone strip of mutton chaap (chop) seasoned with Indian spices, is dry and powdery. Fathepuri Ka Fry Chicken, seasoned with spices could have been juicier.I make sure to hit the chaats live counter before moving on to the main course.Pani Puri comes first, with its aloo sabji and diced onions. The pani is just the right amount of tangy, sweet and spicy.The buffet has a wide variety of dishes.Sarai Ki Muglai Dum Biryani and Ballimaran Ka Gosht Pulao taste the same until we bite into chicken in the former and mutton into later. We recommend Ballimaran Ka Gosht Pulao because the spices are perfect and the mutton is fresh.The vegetarians are treated to Makhmali Paneer, the cottage cheese is as makhmali as the name promises. The tangy tomato flavour in the gravy makes it a treat.Dunkaar Anjeer Kofta Curry is artistically prepared with anjeer wrapped inside cottage cheese. The soft cottage cheese complements the crunchy anjeer seeds.Kache Paneer Ka Biryani and Chandni Chowk Ki Subz Briyani stand out with their cottage cheese and vegetables cooked to perfection.In desserts, Tiramisu is the best for its creamy texture and Dark Cheesy Brownie lives up to its name. Jama Masjid Ka Shahi Tukda, which is bread dipped in milkmaid, resembles Double Ka Meetha. Pan Kulfi does not make us miss paan.

""This year, they had a scheduling conflict. Actually, they just couldn't take my jokes anymore,"" the president said.His nephews, Austin and Aaron Robinson, filled in admirably. Obama joked they had not yet been turned cynical by Washington. ""They still believe in bad puns. They still believe in the grandeur of this occasion,"" Obama said. ""They still have hope.""The White House asked people on Twitter to vote for which turkey will receive the pardon, though both will get a reprieve. The White House even provided a biography for each bird to help voters with their decision. For example, Tater's favorite snack is worms. Tot prefers tomato slices. Each 18-week-old bird weighed in at about 40 pounds.While only one could be named the ""National Thanksgiving Turkey,"" the White House said that both birds will be sent to their new home at Virginia Tech's ""Gobblers Rest"" where they will be cared for by veterinarians and students.The ceremony also gave Obama a chance to reflect on the spirit of Thanksgiving. Obama said it's a time to remember that ""we have a lot more in common than divides us."" He also challenged Americans to show the world that the United States is a generous and giving country, and to make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving.After the ceremony, the president and first family served Thanksgiving meals to residents of the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington. The campus is home to 405 previously enlisted service members, who represent every campaign since World War I. Obama served the turkey and gravy and briefly chatted with veterans and workers as they went through the line.First lady Michelle Obama served beans and spinach, while Sasha provided the mashed potatoes, dressing and cranberry sauce.The pardoning ceremony brings levity to the endless list of serious issues the president faces daily. It inevitably also leads to several bad jokes that will leave the audience responding with ""oohs"" instead of laughs. A baby began crying after one of the jokes, prompting the president to reply: ""Oh, it's not that bad. Now, come on.""Obama was not deterred by the groans or the crying saying he hopes that when somebody at the Thanksgiving dinner table says you can't have any more food, you'll respond: ""Yes, we cran.""The National Turkey Federation began bringing live turkeys to the White House when President Harry S. Truman was in office. The White House Historical Association said Truman remarked they would ""come in handy"" for Christmas dinner. President John Kennedy spared the turkey presented to him in 1963, saying ""let's keep him going."" And President George H.W. Bush is credited with beginning the formal pardon tradition saying that year's bird was ""granted a presidential pardon as of right now."""

Civil protection officials were working to find alternate routes, since the bridge is crucial for emergency crews moving in and out of town.The aftershock was preceded by more than 50 overnight and was followed by another nine in the next hour  part of the nearly 1,000 aftershocks that have rocked Italy's central Apennine Mountains since the original 6.2-magnitude quake early Wednesday.Premier Matteo Renzi has declared a state of emergency and authorized 50 million euros for immediate quake relief.Rescue efforts continued through the night and into Friday, but more than a day and a half had passed since the last person was extracted alive from the rubble. While Renzi hailed the fact that 215 people had been rescued after the quake, authorities reported a steadily rising death toll that had hit 267 by Friday morning.Civil protection operations chief Immacolata Postiglione still insisted Friday that the rescue effort hadn't yet switched to a recovery mission. Rescue workers have noted that a person was pulled out alive 72 hours (three days) after the 2009 earthquake in the Italian town of L'Aquila.""I confirm, once again as we have from the start, that the units that are doing the searches and rescues, including with dogs looking for other people trapped in the rubble, are absolutely fully active,"" she said Friday.On the ground, authorities were still struggling to account for all the missing, since that number is still uncertain given the large number of visitors for summer holidays and an annual food festival.""There is still hope to find survivors under the rubble, even in these hours,"" Walter Milan, a mountain rescue worker, said Friday. But he conceded: ""Certainly, it will be very unlikely.""The vast majority of the dead were found in Amatrice, the medieval hilltop town famous for its bacon and tomato pasta sauce that was leveled by the quake. The other dead hailed from nearby Accumoli and Arcquarta del Tronto.Flags will fly at half-staff Saturday on all public offices and a state funeral will be celebrated by a bishop in a gym in Ascoli Piceno for the victims of nearby Arquata del Tronto  to date, 49 of the dead have come from the tiny town and its hamlet Pescara del Tronto.Across the area, thousands have been forced to abandon their homes, either because they were destroyed or they were determined to be too unsafe. Overnight some 2,100 slept in tent camps, nearly 1,000 more than the first night after Wednesday's quake, in a sign that a significant number had found nowhere else to go.""I have no idea what I'm going to do now, because I had renovated the house two years ago,"" survivor Umberto Palaferri said, showing a photo of his collapsed home on his phone. ""It was all new and now I don't know what to do. I'm 76 and don't know if I can rebuild it."""

No, it's not,"" he said.He also said there was no need to ""smash"" the Sakharov Centre exhibition -- while condemning it for ""glorifying"" Ukrainian troops.- 'Powerful supporters' -Such protesters remain on the fringes but they have powerful supporters, said Sergei Lukashevsky, director of the Sakharov Centre.""These radical marginal people -- the government condones their activities,"" he said.""There are people in power who protect them or even directly support them.""After Belikov defaced the images of Ukrainian forces at the Sakharov Centre -- part of a documentary photo exhibition -- the centre decided to reopen.But the next day, some 40 protesters arrived -- among them Cossacks and a local lawmaker -- carrying a jar of tomato juice labelled ""blood of the children of eastern Ukraine.""Entering the building, some tore down signs.But when the police arrived, they questioned staff about the exhibition's content, not about the protesters' actions, said Lukashevsky, who said the centre would not press charges.The photos by Sergei Loiko for the Los Angeles Times and Belarusian Alexander Vasukovich were ""war reportage -- they did not glorify or condemn anyone,"" he explained, saying the protests were the result of ""the general atmosphere being whipped up by government propaganda.""Yet the latest protests will affect the centre's decisions about future events, he acknowledged.""We will undoubtedly weigh this up,"" he said.""Our doors are open, so I have to worry about the safety of staff and visitors."""

(Photo | AP)KASHIWA: At a public bath in a Yokohama slum in the 1950s, a red-haired girl scrubs her skin with a pumice stone, hard, to try to get the white out.Other kids sometimes taunt her. ""American, American."" She yells back, ""I'm Japanese!""There are more hints that she is different. Once a year she's taken to a grave in the cemetery for foreigners. Once she is made to listen to a record of people singing ""Happy Birthday"" in English. The reasons are as unknown to her as the Western-looking couple she sees in photos hidden in a brown leather suitcase in the closet.She is told she was abandoned. Only much later would she learn that her family had been a casualty of anti-Asian immigration policy in the United States. Her American father got Congress to pass a special bill that would have allowed her to enter the US, yet she would go most of her life without knowing that.Her life became headline fodder in two countries  Japan and Sweden  as a custody battle waged, yet she would be the one to sort out her own fractured identity. It took decades, and the last piece was put into place only this year.""So many coincidences happened in my life,"" she said in an interview at her house outside Tokyo, reflecting on her 67 years. ""But altogether, you know, I managed to put the whole story, that now I'm settled, and I have peace of mind. Thank goodness that I don't have to live with two people anymore.""Those two people are Mary Ann Vaughn, the girl she was born as, and Marianne Wilson, the girl that fate made her.Texas-born James Vaughn arrived in Japan in early 1946, a 20-year-old civilian assigned to a U.S. military base in Yokohama. Photos show a handsome lad with a bit of a James Dean look.He met 16-year-old Vivienne Wilson working in the PX to help support her family. It was an ill-fated romance. Overseas U.S. personnel needed permission from the military to get married, and Vaughn was denied because Wilson was half-Japanese. U.S. law at the time barred Japanese from becoming citizens or even immigrating to the country.Vaughn and Wilson didn't give up. They tied the knot at a Japanese shrine in May 1948. But U.S. military police harassed the couple, and Vaughn returned to the U.S. that August. Wilson gave birth to Mary Ann Vaughn in a Yokohama hospital on April 17, 1949.James Vaughn wrote to Congress, which passed a law exempting Wilson from immigration restrictions so she and her daughter could enter the U.S. It was dated Aug. 5, 1950.That very day Vivienne Wilson died of tuberculosis. Mary Ann was 16 months old.Wilson's family was struggling financially, and asked Mary Ann's nanny to take care of the baby until her father returned to get her. He never did.And so Mary Ann ended up trying to peel her whiteness off in a public bath. ""I was wondering what kind of disease I had,"" she said. She hoped she would wake up transformed, her red hair gone to black.She became Mary Ann Kizawa, taking the surname of her nanny's first husband. She called him ""Papa."" They lived in a one-room shack in Yokohama, got water from a shared pump and cooked outside.The young girl didn't know she was American  she was taught to be terrified of Americans. She wasn't sure who or what they were, but would jump into a covered wooden tea crate whenever they came to the neighborhood. They will make you into sausage and eat you, she was told.Ultimately, an organization set up to help ""GI babies,"" orphans left behind by American soldiers, found her. In letters to the Swedish consul in Tokyo in 1955, the group reported that Mary Ann's nanny wanted to adopt her, but questioned whether that was advisable, given her impoverished circumstances. Sweden decided it should find a home for her, and a custody battle ensued.The media descended on the first-grader. Magazine photo spreads from 1956 show a smiling, pig-tailed girl at school or eating at home. Behind the sometimes impish smiles was a child who didn't understand what was happening to her.Her nanny, Fumi, took Mary Ann every Aug. 5 to Vivienne's grave in a mosquito-infested cemetery, without telling her it was her mother. The child couldn't read the English on the tombstone.Fumi once took her to the beauty parlor where she worked, so she could use the record player. Mary Ann listened to a recording of ""Happy Birthday"" and ""Mary had a Little Lamb"" without realizing it was her father and his family in America singing.The nanny did lay out what was happening after a court ruled in Sweden's favor in 1958. ""I'm going to tell you something very important,"" she told her. ""Sit here and just listen. You're going to quit this school. From September you're going to go to a new school on the bluff where all the A-B-C kids are living. And from now on, your name is going to be Marianne Wilson.""It was a name she hated. Marianne is the Swedish version of Mary Ann, and in her 9-year-old mind, it was the source of all her troubles.With no English, she was sent back to second grade at the ""A-B-C school""  the international school in Yokohama. It was a blow to her ego. She couldn't stomach the strange food  ham sandwiches and tomato juice  and threw it away.""I just couldn't understand a single word the teacher was saying,"" she said. ""I couldn't even write my own name.""An excerpt from a recent email captures her confusion:""On my first day, we took the bus to the bluff. To my big surprise came a little boy who looked like me accompanied by a Japanese woman. When I heard the boy addressing a Japanese lady 'Mommy,' my mind just spun with great joy. I had found the same species!""Her joy was dashed when she discovered the father of a similar girl was a tall white man.""Oh my goodness, I was totally confused,"" she wrote. "" ... I expected a little girl who looked like me to have a Japanese mommy and a Japanese daddy! My little head at that time had no idea about mixed-race, and just left me with the great grief that there is no planet for me to live in. I searched for Krypton, a planet which Superman came from, for there might be some aliens existing like me on that planet.""Under a compromise with the Swedish Embassy, Marianne would live with a foreign host family during the week, and stay with her nanny, now remarried as Fumi Yamaguchi, on the weekends. A Swedish company moved them out of the slums and into a house in Tokyo with new wonders for Marianne, from a refrigerator to a vacuum cleaner.She transferred to the American School in Japan, and rotated through about half a dozen families during her school years. Now, when she visited that gravestone, she could read ""Vivienne Wilson"" on the marker, and realized it was the same last name as hers. She peeked at the photos in the suitcase. A young man, a young woman. A little boy. How were they a part of her life?After high school, she was sent to Sweden, speaking no Swedish. She worked for SAS, the Scandinavian airline, but returned to Japan in 1974, after five years.On her deathbed in 1975, Fumi finally told her everything. James Vaughn was her father, and he hadn't abandoned her, but had tried to find her. It was him on the record, singing to her. She gave her the photos, and told her, these are your parents.Marianne was not ready to try to track down her father until the 1990s, after she got married and had a son. The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo gave her a list of agencies to try.""Every time an envelope came from America, I thought, 'Yay, they found him,'"" she said. ""Then I would start crying. It didn't work.""An acquaintance suggested the Japanese Red Cross. The answer came by phone in 2004: We found James Vaughn, but unfortunately he died 11 months ago. There is a short obituary. And you have a younger brother in America.Marianne Wilson Kuroda was drinking her coffee and shaking, waiting in the kitchen for the phone to ring. It was Steve Vaughn, the son of the father she never got to meet.At first she didn't know what to say. ""What was father's favorite color?"" she asked. Then the emotions overflowed.""I thought, 'Gosh, I wish I would have taken care of you,'"" she said. ""I missed him so much as a baby. I could have been big sister to him ... changed his diaper, given him milk. I guess that's what you call family.""Three months later, she was flying to New Mexico. Vaughn, 56, is a doctor at a Veterans Administration clinic outside of Albuquerque.""She got off the plane. I could not look her in the eyes,"" he wrote in response to questions. ""Her father's eyes scrutinized me, stared at me.""It's not clear whether James Vaughn attempted to contact his daughter after the death of Vivienne Wilson in 1950, but his family kept an envelope on which his mother had written, ""May be important some day.""Inside were some photos and a note: ""The baby in these pictures was named Mary Ann. The last time (I) heard about them was 1958. The mother had died, and baby or girl Mary Ann was adopted in Tokyo, Japan, by unknown parents.""Steve Vaughn, whose mother had married James Vaughn in 1956, wasn't told about his half-sister.He and Marianne compared photos, and found they had similar ones of their father as a little boy. They visited the grave of their father, who had died on Feb. 3, 2003, at the age of 77.""I had to give him respect, you know. But, um, hmm, it was like, you know, 'Why did you die 11 months ago?'"" Marianne said, her laughter mixed with pangs of regret. ""You could have lived a little bit longer after all these years.""The puzzle was coming together. An uncle remembered something about a law related to her story. Steve Vaughn wrote to the U.S. National Archives and found under Private Laws, Chapter 596, ""An Act, for the relief of Vivienne Joy Wilson and minor daughter Mary Ann Vaughn.""Marianne was stunned.""I saw the name Mary Ann Vaughn, which I was called in my very early childhood, and was shocked that she really existed, and my father was truly an American,"" she said.And so was she  or at least should have been. She decided that she should make it official and claim her citizenship, in his honor.It would take 12 years.A U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo asked her why she wanted citizenship when she didn't intend to move to the U.S. He gave her a long list of requirements.""He even said it is almost impossible,"" Marianne said. ""He raised my anger to fight for anything to get justice.""She got help, in a way, from her grandmother. Vivienne's mother. She, amazingly, had gone through very much the same struggle.To get the bill passed, James Vaughn had written Nevada Sen. Pat McCarran letters pleading for help. Steve Vaughn obtained those letters through the McCarran archives.A 1949 letter said that Vivienne Wilson's mother, Helene, had divorced and gotten remarried to a man named John Bouiss and was living in Portland, Oregon. That was something she never knew.Searching the internet in 2012, Marianne happened upon a 78-page paper on Helene Bouiss in the New York University Law Review. Half-Japanese and half-German, she had been denied entry on arrival in Seattle and detained because of her ethnicity. She only was admitted after Congress amended the War Brides Act to allow in spouses like her.It boggled Marianne's mind. She sought help from the author of the paper, professor Rose Cuison Villazor from the Immigration Law Clinic at the University of California, Davis.""Her case is a consequence of this history of discrimination from immigration law and citizenship law that I thought really needed to be corrected,"" Cuison Villazor said in a telephone interview. ""There was ... this awful history that I felt needed to be addressed as a matter of justice.""Kevin Brosnahan, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs, said that consular officers are required to determine whether a person meets the legal requirements for citizenship that were in effect on her birthdate.For Marianne, born in 1949, that meant she had to have established that Vaughn was her father by the age of 21. A later U.S. law allows a qualified person to take an oath to restore her citizenship, Brosnahan said.Cuison Villazor, in a submission to the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, argued that the 1949-era requirements are unconstitutional, but that either way, Marianne had met them.The U.S. ultimately agreed. A photo posted this June on Facebook shows a smiling Marianne standing outside the embassy holding up the oath of allegiance she had just signed.She has one more task before that mission feels complete. She wants to visit a cemetery in the west Texas city of Spur, population 1,300, where her paternal grandparents are buried.""I want to show them my American passport and say, 'Grandpa, Grandma. I'm home.'"""

If reports coming in from Technopark and the incident which occurred at the Infopark in Kochi are any indications then it can be said, Yes, they are. Three days ago, techies at the Infopark were shocked to find a millipede in a snack served by a cafeteria attached to one of the blocks in the park.The situation is not so different at Technopark! For years, the techies have been complaining about the poor quality of food and also the unhygienic conditions in which they are being prepared at the several cafeterias inside the campus.Techies point out that several cafeterias have been serving stale food even after being served notices by the Food and Safety Department threatening closure if conditions arent improved. At present, 22 cafeterias are functioning inside the park at various blocks. Apart from branded food outlets, several cafeterias serve local cuisine to attract Kerala-based techies. In fact, it is these cafeterias which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. Two weeks back the Food and Safety Department raided the cafeterias inside the park after receiving large number of complaints from techies. Food and Safety officials issued warning and penalised many of these restaurants for serving stale food and that too in unhygienic conditions. They also slapped closure notice on a restaurant functioning in Bhavani building.Techies said that they have been at the receiving end for years. Though Technopark exudes glamour, the condition of the eateries inside the campus will put off people from food for a long time. For how long should we suffer unhygienic food ? a techie asked.Harrowing experienceOn August 4, a group of techies spent a harrowing night after having food from one of the restaurants functioning on the ground floor of Nila building. A software developer who didnt wish to disclose his identity told TPuram Express that he was served tomato rice which was two-days-old and spent half of his day puking. When they complained to the owner, he tried to return their money. We dont want the money back. What we want is hygienic food. Ours is not an isolated incident. Others too have been complaining about the poor quality of food here, a Senior operations manager with a multi-national company said.The records with the nearby hospitals indicate that there has been a rise in food poisoning cases from Technopark. Sources said that the hospital authorities cited a case wherein the chef of a restaurant came to them seeking treatment for allergic eruptions on his hands.Strict actionWhen contacted, A Satheesh Kumar, Assistant Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram in-charge, Food and Safety department, said that strict action has been taken against such restaurants inside the park. He also added that this is the third incident being reported from the park.We have formed two special squads to keep a check on the food inside the park. Two weeks ago, we raid all the cafeterias and found that eight to nine restaurants have been serving stale food and that too in an unhygienic environment. This is a serious issue. We have penalised some restaurants functioning at Nila and Bhavani buildings. We have also issued a closure notice to one working at Bhavani building. They were also directed to replace all the unhygienic plates and bowls. However, the raids dont end here. It will be continued in the coming days. The restaurants outside the park will be also under our surveillance, Satheesh said."

In a way, he was right.Twelve months from the deadly accident at an iron ore mine in Minas Gerais state, the Samarco company and its giant owners BHP-Billiton and Vale say they are putting the pieces back together.Yet the way of life Pascual has known all his 76 years in the village of Paracatu de Baixo shattered beyond repair that day.The disaster began in the afternoon of November 5, 2015, when a dam holding mining waste burst without warning about 17 miles (27 kilometers) up a small river from Paracatu.Thirty two million cubic meters (42 million cubic yards) of sludge rushed down the valley, killing 19 people unable to get out of the way and smashing anything in the flood's path, starting with the adjacent village of Bento Rodrigues.A helicopter reached Paracatu in time to warn villagers before their turn came.""I was in the garden and my wife was putting clothes out to dry when they came,"" recalled Pascual, a lean, strong man, whose snowy hair was hidden under a battered Stetson. ""They said: 'Get out of here!'""Running uphill with the rest of his neighbors, Pascual heard the disaster before he saw it.""It was the noise of a runaway train. Then we looked at what was coming,"" he said. ""It was the color of the clay. There wasn't even water, just clay coming and this strong wind.""The sliding wall of mud tore apart or submerged orchards, houses, roads, cars, animals, trees.""It was like the end of the world,"" Pascual said. ""The lights went out.""- Neck deep in mud -Pascual and his wife, whose 12 children live in other towns, were safe and their small house and plot of land, located on a slight rise, were spared.But Paracatu was finished. A year later mud still clogs the main street. Mud sits heaped in roofless houses. Mud stains walls of the ruined church.Pascual is hardly the quitting type, recounting how he waded back home through the mud to retrieve his wife's forgotten documents. ""It was up to here,"" he said, pointing to his neck.Even today, he tends his crops of manioc, onion, tomato and maize. Ever resourceful, he has grown his own tobacco for cigarettes that he rolls in dried maize leafs.Yet the clock is running down.Samarco says it will build a new Paracatu in a different location, with each inhabitant receiving a house equal to the one that was lost. A majority of residents have agreed to take the deal, although it means abandoning their ancestral home -- and Pascual is with them.His house and crops may be intact, but too much else has been spoiled.The river where he used to fish now runs red with mining waste. His two best cows were killed and so his production of round, white cheeses depends on two skinny survivors that he herds around the ruins. Income is down 75 percent.Samarco says it could take until March 2019 before the new Paracatu is built.In the meantime, Pascual tends the farm alone, making a journey of about an hour on weekends to see his wife. It's a lonely, sometimes spooky existence.""Sometimes I spend the whole night awake. Any noise will wake me,"" he says.And even if he could somehow hang on in the village, community life was always about more than mere survival.""We've ended up without a bar where you can go to get a drink, just a tiny drink,"" he said mournfully.""Yes, I want to leave."""

With prices of most vegetables shooting through the roof, the domestic budget has taken a painful hit. Erratic rainfall in the past two months has jacked up vegetable prices in the state. The price of ladies finger, which was Rs 15 per kg at Unit-I market last week, has shot up to Rs 30 now. Even the price of potatoes, which was Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, has increased enough to stretch the household budget. Srimanta Jena, 32, a resident of Hanspal, said prices of tomato, ridge gourd and ladies finger had skyrocketed in the city. Beans that were already topping the charts at Rs 70 per kg a few days ago now cost Rs 80 per kg. Brinjal, too, has become dearer at Rs 50 per kg. ""This time of year, the price of ladies finger comes down considerably. It had come down to Rs 10 per kg even a few weeks ago,"" Jena said. Though the price of tomato has fallen to Rs 30 per kg from Rs 60, it still remains one of the costliest vegetables in the city markets. General secretary of the Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, Sudhakar Panda said incessant rain in May and scarce showers in June have affected the growth of vegetables in the green basket of the state - Balasore, Jajpur, Mayurbhanj and Sambalpur. ""Though many vegetables are procured from other states, the situation there is also not bright. Rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has been similar to Odisha. Therefore the supply of vegetables such as brinjal and ridge gourd has been affected. However, the price will fall once there is adequate rainfall in July and August,"" said Panda. Ashalata Kar, 50, a homemaker and resident of GGP Colony, said: ""Though the traders blame monsoon for the rise in prices, lack of proper storage and failure to check practices of unscrupulous traders creates this situation."" Potato, which was sold at Rs 16 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is available at Rs 20 per kg. ""Potato is consumed in large quantities and even a slight increase in the price affects the middleclass budget,"" said Shyamali Kar, 35, a banker and resident of Saheed Nagar. Panda said potato prices might fall when fresh produce is sourced from Bengal. Onion prices, which is now Rs 18 per kg at Unit-I market, too, will fall, he said. ""Traders in Nashik are on an agitation that may end tomorrow. Once the stalemate ends, the price of onion will fall,"" he said. He said the price would come down to Rs 14-15 per kg. Panda said the state government should provide facilities to farmers so that Odisha does not have to depend on other states. ""Besides providing the farmers with better returns, incentives such as good quality seeds, fertilizer and irrigation can keep the price of vegetables in check,"" he said. The state agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja said the phenomenon was ""seasonal and nationwide"". He added that the prices of vegetables would come down once procurement was streamlined."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160728/jsp/nation/story_99226.jsp,2016-07-28,"New Delhi, July 27: Food minister Ram Vilas Paswan today cited the example of bank interest to justify the rise in prices of food items over the past year while making it clear that middlemen and hoarders were the main problem. Paswan claimed the only increase had been in the price of dal, as he replied to a short-duration discussion in the Rajya Sabha. ""Only dal price has increased. The states have to take action against the middlemen and traders,"" he said. Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the prices of all food items had skyrocketed and Paswan could face a ""privilege motion"" for misleading the House. ""The minister says only dal price has increased. This is incorrect."" But Paswan came up with the bank interest analogy. ""If the price of something was Rs 29 last year and increased to Rs 32 this year, what is the increase? Don't you get interest benefit of Rs 2/3?"" he asked. The link between ""interest benefit"" and price rise was not clear. Unhappy with the reply, Congress MPs walked out. Paswan said the price of arhar dal and urad dal had increased because of a fall in production. The international production of arhar has declined from 75 million tonnes in 2012 to 71 million tonnes this year. In India, 171 lakh tonnes of arhar dal was produced in 2014-15 against a demand for 236 lakh tonnes. In 2015-16, the production remained almost stable at 170 lakh tonnes, whereas the demand increased to 246 lakh tonnes. Therefore dal is being imported, he said. ""If the price is high, why cannot the states relax tax on dal, why cannot they take action against the hoarders, why cannot they directly import?"" Paswan said. Initially, however, Paswan had mentioned some items whose prices had increased. The price of sugar, for example, was Rs 29 a kilo this time last year but had increased to Rs 40, while tomato prices had gone up from Rs 29 to Rs 39. Earlier, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the Centre was responsible to a large extent for the rise in prices of essential commodities, a major reason being the high price of fuel that increases the transport cost of goods. While the international price of crude oil has fallen from $110 a barrel in May 2014 to around $40 now, the government has increased the excise duty on petroleum products by ""nine times"", he said. Trinamul Congress leader Derek O'Brien asked the government to introduce air-conditioned vehicles to transport vegetables to stop them from rotting in transit."

The retail price of the tomato has breached the Rs 60-a-kg mark in local markets and, if sources are to be believed, the tag won't change at least for the next few weeks. ""Extreme temperatures, which crossed 45C this summer, has adversely affected tomato production in vegetable bowls of Jharkhand. This has led to short supply and hence, the price has doubled over the past fortnight,"" said A. Wadood, an agriculture scientist at Birsa Agricultural University in Kanke, Ranchi. Gopal Kumar, a vendor at Bistupur vegetable market, said against a daily consignment of two trucks of tomatoes, they weren't receiving any for the past week. ""Stocks in cold storage are getting exhausted while there are no supply of tomatoes locally (from Patamda),"" he said, adding that tomatoes were available for Rs 40-50 a kg, depending on quality, in the wholesale markets of Bistupur and Sakchi. If the berry-type fruit is troubling kitchen budgets, so are vegetables. Beans, which were available at Rs 70-80 a kilo in local markets until a few days ago, sold at Rs 120 a kg on Wednesday. Carrots are selling at Rs 70 a kg against Rs 50 last week and capsicums are a costly Rs 80 per kilo against Rs 40 earlier. ""The price surge has been triggered by inadequate supply. We are keeping our fingers crossed because the situation is unlikely to change for another few weeks,"" said Arun Mandal, a vegetable vendor in Sakchi. A vegetable seller from Patamda, Panchanan said poor production because of harsh temperatures had resulted in the wide supply-demand gap. ""We are hopeful that the situation will become normal with the advent of monsoon."" A survey of the twin markets in Bistupur and Sakchi revealed that prices of vegetables like bottle gourd, pumpkin and bitter gourd are also on the rise. ""We are left with little choice but to buy at increased rates. I think the rise in demand of vegetables in summer has also led wholesalers and retailers to hike prices,"" said a buyer. Bistupur homemaker Shalini Rao said no vegetable was available below Rs 40 a kilo. ""The price punch is taking a toll on our monthly budget,"" Rao rued. Catering staff Amar Babu added, ""Tomatoes are doing a vanishing act from salads because of its shooting price."""
58fedd797be9e0420db28b3a,Brainstorming on banana,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160603/jsp/northeast/story_89070.jsp,2016-06-03,"Jorhat, June 2: Researchers from different parts of the country congregated at the Assam Agricultural University here for a two-day brainstorming session on bananas and to find strategies for increasing productivity in the region. In the inaugural session, the vice-chancellor of the university, K.M. Bujarbaruah, said the strategies should take into consideration an increase in productivity by linking it with biotechnology and agro-climatic conditions of the regions, treating each state differently. ""The area under banana cultivation, 1.03 lakh hectares, is good but the low production of bananas - only 13.5 tonnes per hectare compared to the all-India average of 37 tonnes per hectare - is a matter of concern. We have to devise strategies to increase productivity and this research can be linked with bio-technology,"" he said. The vice-chancellor added that for bananas, the temperature suitable for growth was 27 degrees Celsius to 37 degrees Celsius. Hence, in states like Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, where temperatures fall below 10 degrees Celsius, the productivity of bananas per hectare was lowest - two tonnes and three tonnes respectively. Productivity of Assam was the highest at 16 tonnes, followed by Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur. ""While devising the strategies, we have to consider whether Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh should be brought in at all or whether the strategy should be different for these states and find varieties suited to that climate propagated there,"" he said. He also stressed that biotechnology would help prevent diseases and increase shelf life of a perishable crop like banana as it had been done for tomato by switching off the ripening enzyme. Bujarbaruah said it should be considered that different varieties of bananas should be cultivated according to requirement as is done in Mizoram where a particular banana is cultivated for fibre. Bananas should be cultivated for fibre, processing and consumption after studying the market. S.K. Mukherjee, the senior consultant, department of biotechnology, New Delhi, said while preparing the roadmap, there was a need to find ways to value add nutrition as bananas are deficient in vitamin A. B. Padmanabhan, the director in-charge, National Research Centre on Bananas, Tiruchirappalli, stressed ways in which bananas could be made disease free, as there was great loss from the production to the consumption stage. Scientists from the fruit science department, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, Coimbatore, National Research Centre on Bananas, Tiruchirappalli, microbiology department, Sardar Patel University Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat, PGP College of Agricultural Sciences, Namakkal, Tamil Nadu, and The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) participated in the meet. The session has been organised by the department of biotechnology, Assam Agricultural University, and sponsored by the central department."

(Gautam Dey) The hands which handled machines three years ago are now sowing seeds and reaping fresh vegetables. From the world of machines to the lap of mother earth, it is a huge leap for 36-year-old Santosh Yadav. Yadav, a senior manager with Electrosteel Steels, Bokaro, till three years ago, is now an organic farmer at his hometown Barmasia on the fringes of Dhanbad. So, what provoked this mechanical engineering graduate from BIT, Sindri, to follow the reverse trend at a time when most people leave their roots and migrate to big cities for the rat race? The ""24/7 work culture at private companies"" leaves almost no time for one's family, friends, hobbies and social obligations, said Yadav. ""I wanted to give my wife and two children time and do something for society. So, I decided to leave my 13-year-old career and come back to my roots. I wanted to show that if farming is done scientifically using modern techniques, it is as profitable an industry as any other. At a time when farmers are committing suicide or migrating to bigger cities, I want to prove that farming can be fruitful if proper techniques are used,"" he said. ""This year, I earned a profit of around Rs 1.5 lakh in three months from April to June,"" said Yadav, adding that though his income at present was not commensurate with his earlier jobs, he was confident of increasing it. He said he followed organic vegetable farming on his 5-acre family plot near his house. ""Education is never wasted. Every day, I apply my years of learning and experience on fields. I use drip irrigation to save water, and mulching, which is rarely used, to protect soil from weeds,"" said the BTech graduate who prefers doing most of the work himself but employs labourers during sowing and harvesting. Admitting that farming had uncertainties, Yadav, said he also suffered losses in tomato last year but soon learnt from his mistakes. ""I always use organic fertilisers to cultivate seasonal vegetables like tomato, cabbage, capsicum, chilly, brinjal and lady's finger.? His wife Amrita Kumari (32) is his greatest strength, Yadav admits. A CA who prefers the role of a homemaker, Amrita encouraged her husband to do whatever he wanted, though the couple have two children, Priyansh, a Class V student and Kavya, who is in UKG at St Xaviers International School, Dhanbad. About the reaction of relatives and friends, Yadav said they at first laughed at him. ""Now, after three years, when I'm planning to expand my business and launch a packaged drinking water plant on a portion of my land with my savings I have, they seem to appreciate me,"" he said. His eyes gleamed speaking about his new endeavour: ""Clearances from irrigation and pollution departments have come. I'm waiting for machines to arrive. I'm positive about starting construction in the next two months. I'm looking forward to train local jobless youths who can join me."" He also keeps his Sundays for the poor children. He takes free classes at the Jharia and Dhanbad Bank More centres of NGO Samadhan. ""He lives life to the fullest,"" said Samadhan founder Chandan Singh."
58fef5217be9e0420db2a12a,Caterpillar cloud on tomatoes,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160616/jsp/nation/story_91510.jsp,2016-06-16,"UNDER SCANNER New Delhi, June 15: Government scientists have called for nationwide surveillance to look for a caterpillar native to South America that has slipped into at least four Indian states and could threaten the country's tomato growers and the ketchup-and-puree industries. The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year. ""The United States is taking it so seriously we haven't even given permits to do research (in laboratories) in order to prevent any possibility of the insect's escape (from the labs into farms)."""
