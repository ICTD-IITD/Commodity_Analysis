58fef9a77be9e0420db2a861,"Rain whips up tomato, potato price",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160709/jsp/jharkhand/story_95578.jsp,2016-07-09,,Telegraph,"A vendor sells precious tomatoes in Lalpur, Ranchi, on Friday. Picture by Hardeep Singh This week, Ranchi vegetable customers are moving around markets with long faces and half-empty bags. Reason? Heavy rains of last weekend have damaged a bulk of local potato and tomato crops, hiking their retail prices to Rs 24 and Rs 50 per kilo, respectively. Members of Pandra Bazar Samiti, the wholesale hub in Ranchi, said wholesale prices of potato and tomato are Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kilo. ""Water-logging in farms has destroyed both crops,"" said horticulture scientist of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) K.K. Jha. Explaining why, he said: ""The recent heavy rains led to water-logging in poorly drained farms. So, potatoes rotted underground. Heavy downpour tore tomato skins and lack of sunlight led to their getting fungus."" Bhuidih, Mandar and Itki in Ranchi district, Gumla, Simdega and Hazaribagh are the state's tomato bowls. A bulk of potatoes are brought from Bengal, but the tuber also grows in Ratu, Ormanjhi, Pithoria, Namkum and other places in Ranchi. Imports from Bengal had also reduced drastically since monsoon picked up steam, rued a Ranchi wholesale trader Naresh Sahu, saying compared to last week's two trucks, only one came this week. BAU scientist Jha stressed it was possible to save tomatoes from tearing or fungus. ""Growing tomatoes in polyhouses in a controlled environment will enable them to survive heavy monsoon, but then, only a fraction of Jharkhand's tomatoes are grown that way. More farmers need to adapt to progressive ways,"" he stressed. Raj Kumar, MD of Jharkhand State Agriculture Marketing Board, added another valid point. ""We need cold storage for perishable items so that the produce we get is kept properly. So far, a few private ones have come up at Bero, Ormanjhi and other places, but we can't monitor them. The situation will improve when our 5,000 metric tonne cold storage comes up in Pandra,"" he said. But for now, the scene at Lalpur vegetable market, one of Ranchi's largest retail hubs, is dismal. A vendor had stocked 5kg of tomatoes against the 20kg. ""Due to heavy rain, the local tomato crop is damaged,"" rued Munna Oraon, when asked why there were so few tomatoes. ""I brought 5kg tomatoes from Bero farmers but that too is of poor quality,"" he admitted. Potato vendor Lokesh in Lalpur said he was selling them for Rs 24 a kilo. ""Last week, it was Rs 18 per kilo. But, what to do when supply is so poor? Our margins are thin."" Homemakers are feeling the pinch. ""I'm substituting fresh tomatoes with ketchup and using less potatoes in subzi,"" Lalpur homemaker Anju Saxena said. ""French fries are out of the menu for the time being."" But, scientist Jha had a word of hope. ""New cropping is on at tomato and potato hubs. By September, Ranchi customers can expect the duo at affordable prices,"" he said."
58fefa957be9e0420db2a9df,The ambush on the tongue,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/opinion/story_91990.jsp,2016-06-19,,Telegraph,"Reading about the huge variety of international food now hitting Calcutta makes me imagine the city as a planet which, having placidly circled around its star for billions of years, is suddenly being peppered by rain-waves of asteroids. It's not true, of course: if there was one place in the subcontinent that was a smorgasbord, or rather a khichuri, or perhaps actually a bhelpuri of cosmopolitan foodings, it was this colonial town, soon after its establishment. Besides the massive variety of local food, in its early years the city hosted cuisines from Portugal, France, Britain, Burma, south-east Asia and China, while African, Middle Eastern and Afghan food would also not have been unknown here. Looking back over the last half-century one realizes that the city was in fact provincialized only after the departure of its international citizens. From the mid-1960s to the late 1990s, at the higher price range there was not much available besides the standard, ho-hum five-star fare. Likewise, while the streets retained their great local culinary chutzpah, nothing during those years was particularly exciting or ground-breaking at the lower end of the dining scale either. The city had its cuisine pillars of course, what one could call the Calcutta-Wajid Ali-Lucknow cookery, the most authentic Chinese food in India, and a small cluster of restaurants working the vein of raj Anglo-European cooking. Ringed around Burrabazar and Bhowanipur were also the street foods of north India, Marwar and Gujarat-Bombay, not to mention the South Indian joints near the enclave of Lake Market. Growing up as a doubly local-yokeled kid - south Cal and non-Bong vegetarian - life had in wait a lot of taste surprises for someone like me. I still remember the taste of the first non-Amul cheese, in a sandwich at a French-American couple's house on Pretoria street, some hard cheese, probably Emmental because it had holes, like in the foreign comics, with - I now realize - a thin scrape of Dijon mustard; the first taste of proper French red wine in Delhi as a teenager; the shock of a proper pizza while visiting America; the first taste of Guinness with the tangle of extreme bitter and subtle sweet that could compete with any karela sabzi. Across life, one got to learn that, just as it's possible for many people to be at home anywhere, everybody but almost everybody is a provincial, a local-yokel, during their first years, no matter whether those years are spent in a floating market on the Mekong or a chateau in Mdoc. In this regard, a sudden memory pops up. My mother was a fine cook of Gujarati food and many non-Gujju friends became devotees of the various, classic snack items she'd make. In the mid-1990s, one such friend was working in Dhaka when I travelled to meet her. The loud and repeated request was for me to bring a stack of my mother's much sought after theplas (spiced paratha-type flatbread). I duly took along a box packed with theplas and, since it was Ramazan, a few of these were placed alongside the several other items where the iftar feast was laid out. The thepla fan burst into effusive excitement when she saw the discs loaded with methi leaves and all sorts of spices, and immediately grabbed one. Our host, a sophisticated, upper-class Bangladeshi woman, much travelled and widely exposed to the different foods of the world, also picked up one. As I watched, she took a bite and her head snapped back in shock and revulsion. She quickly put down the offending thing and put distance between herself and the ecstatically mumbling thepla fan. At first I was deeply offended - it was as if my Bangladeshi friend had insulted my mom. But then I thought back at all the electrified rejections and ejections I had made of alien tasting food across my life, not least all sorts of supposedly great Bengali fish, and I calmed down. Like me, my mother, too, couldn't stand any smell of fish, uncooked or cooked. But she would have had equal if not greater revulsion for some of the things I've grown to love, from mutton curry and roast pork to finely sliced carpaccio of raw beef and bresaola. Thinking back, what offended me about my Bangladeshi friend's reaction was that, in my mind, she was after all a desi and not some bland-palate foreigner, and one who wasn't inexperienced in eating spicy subcontinental vegetable preparations, nor desi breads including, I imagine, rotis, luchis and dhakai parathas. Again, another neutralizing memory collides with this one, of when I first went to non-Bombay, proper Maharashtra in my mid-twenties. It was in Pune, one morning, that I asked for a cup of tea at a roadside stall. By now I'd had 'Indian-style tea' in many parts of northern and eastern India; I knew the taste of the thin Bengali chaa in the maatir bhaand, I'd bitten into thick, milky chaay at many Sikh dhabas, I knew well the differently highly sweet and masala loaded chaah in Ahmedabad; I just wasn't prepared for the particular masala they use in Maharashtra (or, at least in Pune) in their roadside tsahaa. Like my future Bangladeshi friend, I almost threw up at the first sip of that stuff and had to really control myself so as not to offend all the slurping Ghaatis around me. It's akin to what a friend, an aficionado of Hindustani classical, said, as he confessed that he couldn't stand Carnatic music, ""Of course you can recognize some of the the same raags as in Hindustani music, the notes are all in the right order, but the spicing is just wrong! I can't bear that!"" I suppose it's about what one is used to, also about what one is expecting to land on one's ear or tongue, and about being unevenly open- and close-minded about different things. For instance, in my rejection of all things piscatory, I remember throwing a fit when I discovered a friend had used (precious) fish sauce in a Thai meal she had lovingly made for my birthday. That was about 20 years ago; now I stock the (readily available) fish sauce in my own cupboard for any visiting culinary artist who wants to use it to cook in my kitchen. Similarly, I've seen other people change their food prejudices, some gradually beginning to like stinky cheese, or the taste of hiing or karela, some having a sudden epiphany about gin, or about the beautiful power of the bhut jolokia chilli. Equally, as time passes, one has witnessed people's tastes (and sometimes world views) shrink, chilli-champions of yore being unable to take even the slightest mirchi-heat, hard-core drinkards of wine rejecting allergy-causing red wine for 'safe' whisky, tomato-phobists actually beginning to use the emperor of fruit-vegetables in their cooking and so on. I think it's great that Calcutta is receiving all these different cuisines, albeit at the moneyed end. I think the ionic exchange between Calcutta the local yokel and world food, and simultaneously between Calcutta the sophisticated food town and the ignorant world, should increase exponentially. In terms of Calcutta as a food-discerning city, I find myself hoping our tastes continue to expand, and not just in some snobbish, money-driven way. It would be great if we were to have different innovative food vans a la so many cities, not just in Europe and America, but all over the globe. It would be extremely desirable (and I know this is a whole different Pandora's box, but it's not unconnected) if we were to avoid the knee-jerk reactions of Bihar (and, previously, Kerala) in following Gujarat into declaring foolish prohibition and decided to really work on changing our drink culture. It would be wonderful to take a leaf out of Bangkok's book and make sure our numerous street food stalls were strictly hygienic and spankingly clean. All of this would (forgive the pun) feed into making Calcutta a different kind of 'food capital' or 'food hub' from what it once used to be. As someone, I forget who exactly, once said, if you change a society's food habits you transform that society itself. This change, if it can be effected, would be a good ambush to face."
58fefbf17be9e0420db2abdb,To counter the violence within,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160809/jsp/opinion/story_101309.jsp,2016-08-09,,Telegraph,"Irom Chanu Sharmila may be calling off her hunger-strike after 16 years of force-feeding, but the attention she has managed to attract to her cause is substantial. That her breaking the fast, her decision to marry and join politics have attracted international media attention is not only because of her unique method of protest, but also because of the seriousness of the cause she campaigned for. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act that Irom Sharmila wanted repealed is indeed a draconian law inconsistent with the spirit of Indian democracy. It tarnishes India's global image at a time when its prime minister, Narendra Modi, is making an effort to secure a place for the country on the global high table. But, more important, the AFSPA should be shelved because it encourages lazy, incompetent soldiering - why make an effort to find a militant by going over available intelligence when one has a law that gives powers to line up a whole village for scrutiny at day or night? Indian army and paramilitary forces have fought a counter-insurgency campaign in the Northeast for six decades now and in other 'disturbed areas' of India like Kashmir for three to four decades. But India does not have a counter-insurgency doctrine - all it offers are clichs, such as the iron fist in a velvet glove. It is high time the country develops a doctrine based on its long experience and one that focuses more on political persuasion and smart internal security management rather than on the blatant use of force. Force often begets more force and surely more alienation. The AFSPA confers special powers on the armed forces to respond without restraint in ""disturbed areas"" to maintain law and order. In a ""disturbed area,"" a military officer can fire upon an unlawful assembly of five or more people if the need arises or for the illegal possession of firearms. The military is free to use force, even causing death to those suspected of possible violence. No arrest and search warrants are required for any operation as in the provisions of the law. Owing to the blanket powers it confers on soldiers, there is a lingering fear of its misuse. In 1990, an amendment bill was passed to include the state of Jammu and Kashmir under the purview of AFSPA. Manipur, however, withdrew the act from some parts of the state after a huge agitation following the mysterious death of Thangjam Manorama. The federal government in 2004 appointed a five-member committee under a former Supreme Court judge, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, to review the act and consider complete repeal or a possible replacement by a more humane legislation. On June 6, 2005, the committee recommended in its 147-page report the repealing of the act unanimously. Interestingly, among the five members of the commission was a former director-general (military operations) of the Indian army, Lieutenant-General (retired) V.R. Raghavan and a former home ministry bureaucrat, P.P. Shrivastava. Now why would such hard-core members of the security establishment advocate a repeal of AFSPA? This is a question that has rarely been asked. In fact, many a military officer with long years of experience in counter-insurgency in the Northeast and Kashmir has argued after retirement that it should be repealed as it serves no purpose. But the serving military establishment has fiercely stalled AFSPA's repeal. Senior officers even launched a Facebook campaign to ""save AFSPA"". The defence ministry has been pressured by the army top brass, so that the United Progressive Alliance government did not even dare place the Jeevan Reddy Commission's report for discussion in Parliament. But it is time India seriously considers a repeal of AFSPA - not merely out of a concern for human rights but also out of a desire to improve and refocus India's internal security regime. One has to remember that counter-insurgency is directed against one's own citizens and not against a foreign enemy. So, the primary focus of a counter-insurgency operation should be 'winning hearts and minds', and not liquidation or elimination. AFSPA lets troops get away with murder and its frequent misuse encourages a culture of impunity which is counterproductive to WHAM because it widens the disconnect between the forces and the local population. With AFSPA around, military or paramilitary units do not feel the need for restraint or fire control, leading to incidents like the one at Malom (Manipur) which led Irom Sharmila to start her hunger strike in 2000. It also leads to a sharp drop in professionalism and actually dehumanizes and corrupts the army and paramilitary forces. The extent to which AFSPA has encouraged a culture of impunity and a compromise of professionalism can be gauged from cases such as that of Colonel H.S. Kohli (the ""Ketchup Colonel"") who asked civilians to feign death, smeared them with tomato ketchup and claimed kills in an operation - all to score brownie points. It was later found that he had done all this in full knowledge (if not under explicit orders) of his immediate superior, Brigadier Suresh Rao of the 73rd Mountain Brigade. These mountain brigades are supposed to be our key units in the order of battle against China. If one were to lay emphasis on the primacy of WHAM in counter-insurgency, success in it should be judged not by body count in encounters or by 'area domination' but by how many rebels/militant groups have been compelled by an intelligent mix of persuasion, force, secret contact and psychological operations to abandon the path of armed struggle and return to normal life. AFSPA makes soldiers lazy, non-professional and is characterized by an absolute lack of focus and a conspicuous lack of a consistent doctrine of counter-insurgency. Operational action is rarely linked to clearly defined objectives - more kills rather than more surrenders from guerrilla ranks are likely to fetch better decorations and rewards but they also encourage gung-ho commanders to further alienate the force from the people in areas of operation. The former Manipur governor, Lt.Gen. V.K. Nayar, made this point rather strongly in an article in the Indian Defence Review in October 1992. In his book, A Soldier Recalls, Srinivas Kumar Sinha says that until the late 1960s, the Indian army did not even have training manuals for counter-insurgency. Even now, many military institutions like the Counter-Insurgency & Jungle Warfare School do not have appropriate campaign studies for units to be deployed for 'internal security duties' in a counter-insurgency environment. In his Fighting Like a Guerrilla, Rajesh Rajagopalan has aptly pointed out that the ""conventional war bias"" of the Indian army explains its failure in counter-insurgency like in the Jaffna peninsula during the Indian Peace Keeping Force operations in the late 1980s. Therefore, the argument made by the military top brass that its units will be ""crippled"" in counter-insurgency situations without AFSPA is untenable. Long use of AFSPA has not helped end insurgencies; political settlements have. The reason for the failure of Indian military units to effectively root out insurgent groups in Kashmir or the Northeast stems from its failure to evolve an appropriate doctrine for counter-insurgency even after fighting insurgents for 60 years. This not only reveals the ""learning failures"" of an unimaginative military leadership but actually ends up alienating populations. It is time the government realizes the dangers of unleashing a force with a conventional war bias on its own people. The repeal of AFSPA should be seen as the first step in an effort to create a smarter and more effective counter-insurgency capability that draws more on information technology, psychological operations, political persuasion and conflict resolution rather than on overkill and mindless indiscretion. The government will have to evolve a counter-insurgency doctrine which will not only seek to keep the army out of the ""internal security"" matrix to the extent possible and deploy other specifically trained and highly skilled forces that observe the principle of ""minimum force"", but also not insist on an AFSPA-type legislation as a prerequisite for their deployment and demonstrate a respect for human rights and accountability in keeping with the letter and spirit of the Constitution."

George W. Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. But Donald J. Trump is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation's fast food president. ""A 'fish delight,' sometimes, right?"" Trump told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town-hall-style meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald's. ""The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It's great stuff."" Trump's presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent. And so is his diet. In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Trump is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn't have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House. But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Trump has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation - devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal), feasting on a McDonald's burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters). He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (""It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,"" his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See's Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol. But his highbrow, lowbrow image - of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seatbelt buckles - is also a carefully crafted one. If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting ""a splash"" more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Trump's diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them. ""There's nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,"" said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"

Telegraph picture Darjeeling, June 16: A college student who had successfully climbed Mount Everest in May today spoke of five climbers she had seen battling for life on the slopes of the world's highest mountain during her expedition. Trishala Gurung, 23, from Southfield College was part of the first all-girl team of the National Cadet Corps that conquered Mount Everest. She, along with Sulaxchana Tamang, who studies at Ghoom Degree College in Darjeeling, climbed Mount Everest in two batches last month. While Sulaxchana was part of the first batch to climb Everest and had left the base camp on May 18, Trishala had started the climb, along with 13 other members of the NCC group, the next day. It was Trishala and her team that encountered the climbers who were battling for their lives. ""Around 11pm on May 21, when we were above South Col (26,000ft), we met a climber who was digging ice. It was on a slope of about 70 degrees and first, I thought why he was wasting energy at such a high altitude by digging ice, which seemed unnecessary. Now, I think he was suffering from altitude sickness,"" Trishala told the media. The team, which had set base at South Col, had started its trek for the final accent at 8.30pm on May 21. ""A little above, we found a Sherpa and a lady climber. The Sherpa asked for water but I couldn't give, as I was wearing a thick glove and the water was deep inside my bag so that it didn't get frozen. They said they were hungry and I managed to give them chocolates and dry fruits,"" said Trishala. Fifty meters above the Sherpa and the lady was another climber hanging on a rope. ""We didn't know whether he was climbing up or down and just above him was another man who was resting and moving his hands probably trying not to fall asleep,"" said Trishala. She reached the summit, along with three other NCC cadets, an army officer and six Sherpas, at 8.30am on May 22. ""Later, when we were descending, we found that the man who had been seen moving his hand had died. He had anchored himself safely so that he would not fall. We did not see the other man on the rope, or the lady and the Sherpa with her,"" said the Southfield College girl. However, Trishala and the army officer, Bishnu Rana, met the man who was digging ice. ""It seems he was moving in an opposite direction where the ropes were tied. He seemed to be suffering from snow blindness and had frostbite on the hands. He said he was from Calcutta and even though he said his name, I cannot recollect it now. When he said he was from Calcutta, it struck me that we were from the same state,"" said Trishala. Trishala and her team had by then been informed about some missing climbers. ""The description matched the man who said he was from Calcutta. We tried to get him down to South Col but we couldn't. The only way was to carry him and we could not despite our attempt,"" said Trishala. The team then reached South Col in about 20 minutes and immediately, Sherpas climbed up and brought the Calcutta man to the South Col. ""One of the Sherpas, Migma Dorjee, made tomato soup and he had it. We then gave him coffee but when the mug was handed over to him, he could not hold due to frost bites and the coffee spilled over the mat. It was so heartbreaking when he immediately kneeled and tried to lick the coffee from the mat,"" said Trishala. The Calcutta climber was kept in a tent which was abandoned by pervious climbers. When the Sherpas went to serve tea to him in the morning, the climber was found dead. Even though Trishala cannot recollect the names, her description suggests that the lady was Sunita Hazra of Barasat, who along with the Sherpa was rescued but Sunita suffered frost bite. Trishala's description also suggests that the three people they met were Subash Paul from Bankura, Goutam Ghosh of Barrackpore and Paresh Nath of Durgapur who were all part of the same expedition."

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Berhampur/Cuttack, July 15: Congress workers today clashed with police while staging a demonstration in front of the state police headquarters in Cuttack over shooting five innocent persons in the alleged crossfire between Maoists and the security forces in Kandhmal district on July 8. Tension prevailed after a 58-year-old woman Congress activist was injured in a tussle with security personnel during the protest. The injured activist, Basanti Tudu, suffered three cuts on her head after she was allegedly pushed by the police during the protest. Later, the Congress activists pelted tomatoes on police in protest against the ""inhuman treatment"" to one of their members. ""It is unfortunate that the police officials manhandled and pushed a woman activist of our party during the protest which is not accepted in a democracy,"" said Cuttack Nagar Congress president Mohammad Moquim. The police headquarters was fortified with the deployment of 15 platoons of force today. Condemning the ""violence"" by Congress workers, BJD spokesperson Samir Ranjan Dash said: ""Violence is a part of Congress culture."" In another development, Congress MLAs, led by leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra, today visited Gumudumaha village, the site of July 8 firing. Mishra said, ""Whatever measures have been taken by the state government following the killings of innocent tribals are all eye wash to dupe the people. We have come here to have a first hand assessment to find out who is responsible for the incident and how we can avoid repetition of such incidents in the future."" The Congress delegation alleged that the state government was solely responsible for the massacre and it was trying to shield the officials responsible for the killings of the innocent people in the name of anti-Naxal operations. Later during the day, a delegation of BJP MPs led by party's national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe arrived In Kandhamal. They are scheduled to visit the site tomorrow. ""The state government is not responsive to the killings of innocent tribals in Kandhamal. We have taken the incident seriously and have expressed our deep sorrow on the killing of innocent tribals in Kandhamal. We have come to have an on-the-spot assessment and will submit the report to our president Amit Shah,"" said Sahasrabuddhe. Earlier, a ten-member fact-finding team led by BJP state unit president Basant Panda had visited Gumudumaha village. A four-member team of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) had met the family members of the firing victims and injured persons at Gumudumaha on Tuesday. However, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who is now in Delhi, has stayed away from the entire episode. Additional director general of police in charge of State Human Rights Protection Cell Mahendra Pratap, who will supervise the investigation into the incident by a special investigation team, said the SIT would visit the site and speak to the affected villagers and the police personnel. ""The ballistic test of the guns used by the police officials will be conducted to ascertain as to who had fired at the tribals,"" he said."
58ff0a4d7be9e0420db2bb73,Spirits of the past haunt shops in new avatar,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160505/jsp/bihar/story_83828.jsp,2016-05-05,,Telegraph,"A person manages a liquor-turned-snacks store in Kankerbagh and (below) a similar store at R-Block. Pictures by Ashok Sinha Spirits of the past haunt Dhananjay Kumar's shop at R-Block. Inside it is largely the same, like it was over a month ago; the same shelves from which Scotch tickled a drinker's thirst for malt. Even the refrigerator is the same, which, till not long ago held in its belly enough chilled beer to draw endless customers holding empty mugs. But today, the shelves contain cold drinks, biscuits, chips, soan papdi and Maggi. Open the refrigerator and one can almost see the chilled beer before focus returns and ice creams and cold drinks come into view. It is like this at most other liquor shops now forced to sell cold drinks and snacks since total prohibition was implemented in the state a month ago. While most liquor shops have shut down altogether, others have metamorphosed this way to live another day. But the present is a poor reflection of the past when one compares revenue earned. Most shops are not sure they will earn enough to even get back the rent they are paying for their shops. ""I pay Rs 30,000 in rent for this place and we now earn Rs 1,500-2,000 a day,"" said Dhananjay. ""It is becoming very difficult to pay my staff and rent. Because it is summer, we are just about managing by selling cold drinks. But I am not sure we can sustain ourselves after this."" This correspondent spent around half an hour at the shop during which only one customer turned up. The shop-owner laughed when he caught this correspondent noting four CCTVs on the premises. ""Do you think anyone is going to steal cold drinks? The CCTVs are not functional, we have cut the power supply,"" he said. He went on to say: ""Nitish ji should not have banned foreign liquor. We were paying tax after all. He has no idea how many people have lost their livelihood. Ban of country-made liquor was a good decision but Indian made foreign liquor should have been allowed."" Another erstwhile liquor shop in front of Hotel Chanakya has been turned into an ice-cream parlour. It also sells milk shakes, chips, Frooti, Maaza and Haldiram's soan papdi. The interiors are still the same. They've just replaced liquor on the shelves with the new fare. ""We spent lakhs doing up the interiors. We are not fools to be spending more on redoing the interiors to sell cold drinks and ice creams now. Those days we used to earn Rs 1.25 lakh-2 lakh a day. We now earn Rs 1,000-1,500 a day. Is that a comparison? This is not fair. When the government failed to open shops on its own it put a blanket ban on liquor,"" said Kaushal Kunal, shop manager. The shop has just replaced the earlier signboard with one for ice cream and cold drinks. Most of these shops have opened just three to four days ago. The government had offered to help liquor shop owners open milk booths in their premises, but till date no one has taken help. Another liquor shop in the Kankerbagh area has turned into an ice cream parlour, also selling tomato sauce, vegetable patties, cold drinks, biscuits and chips. ""Earlier, I used to earn Rs 12,000 a month, as revenue was higher,"" said an employee at the shop. ""But now pay has dipped to Rs 3,000. Everyday, a fight ensues between my wife and me over how I will run the house or pay my children's school fees. We are not getting any customers. Why will anybody come here when there are so many established shops? Since morning, I have sold just two bottles of water, two patties and four ice creams. God only knows what we will earn by selling ice creams and cold drinks."" It remains to be seen how many liquor shops will start selling snacks and cold drinks in the coming days. There were 5,446 registered private liquor shops in Bihar, 2,471 selling country-made liquor and remaining 2,947 India-made foreign liquor. There were 424 liquor shops in just Patna district."

But harvesting the fruit on a small terrace in a grand manner is something special. The hard-work will always bear fruit. For Selvaraj Gowda it is sour and sweet as he took up the challenge and recently brought home the bacon of harvesting more than 300 kg grapes in a season on the terrace of his house at Pulliyampatti, a small village near Vedanchandhur Taluk in Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu.A tractor driver by profession, the 42-year-old god-fearing person Selvaraj hails from a poor family and his love for nature began at a tender age. His passion for growing vegetables started when he was in the fifth standard.However, the idea of growing grapes on the terrace was suggested by his wife, Soundeshwari, a couple of years back. My wife gave me a small bunch of grapes and asked me to taste it. She told me that the sweet grapes were grown in clay pots at her friend's place, Selvaraj, who also does voluntary work at temples, said.When I took interest in growing grapes in our place, we had constraints of space to make a grape garden around my house, he said. That made him almost drop the idea. However, his wife was not the one who was willing to give up easily. Soundeshwari promised full cooperation in developing a grape garden on his terrace and Selvaraj decided to take a plunge into grape cultivation and that too on his house rooftop.Initially, I spent Rs 15,000 to set up steel beams and other necessary equipment on my terrace, Selvaraj said. To mobilise additional funds for his new venture, he slogged and worked extra hours. That helped him in arranging the seed fund for the path-breaking initiative. He had about 900 sq feet available on the roof but decided to use only about 700 sq ft for the cultivation.Luckily, it clicked and he harvested good crop. As the terrace faces south, there is good sunshine throughout the day. I spent a few thousand rupees to ensure shade for roots of the plants. This was needed as continuous exposure to sunlight would have meant the plant would dry up, he said.Besides, the couple tied wire crisscross on the terrace to enable the plant to creep, spread and grow without hitches. They made grape cuttings and planted them in the tank constructed on the terrace.Selvaraj and his wife's hardwork was not in vain. The first harvest fetched him 50 kg good grapes. I and my wife were very happy when the flowers slowly turned into grapes, he said. He credited his wife for the achievement and stressed without Soundeshwari nothing could have been done.I used simple bio-fertilisers like cow dung and regular watering during summer as it is essential for healthy grape growing, he said. Natural tropical climate and regular wind and sun prevented pest attack on plants.There is a big advantage in our place, he said. We had options to regulate and make changes required for cultivation of grapes. Everything from water management to nutrient factor were under our control, he said.Selvaraj also efficiently undertook pest control measures. He says that the common pests of grape farming are flea beetles, thrips, mealy bugs and leaf hoppers. According to him, the sugar content in grapes determines when the fruit is ready to be harvested. The grapes are ready to harvest in about five to six months, he said. Selvaraj cleverly chose to grow Panneer Grapes, a popular fruit across the south India, by considering local growing conditions.Explaining about the second harvest, he said after the harvest is over, it is important to trim all green growth that you do not want to be part of the main trunk. Interestingly, the couple do not sell the grapes but give them to poor children in the area. We have decided not to sell even a single grape that is grown on our roof. Even if I grow one tonne, it will be given to children and poor people, Selvaraj asserted.Selvarajs efforts were recognised by the local farmers association, which pitched in to help him in the second harvest. After hearing about my success, local farmers helped me in giving organic fertiliser and equipment so that I could do better in the next harvest by getting 150 kg of grape, he said.My friends and neighbours came forward to help me. Some of them offered me steel poles, a few others natural fertilisers and even grape seeds, he said.Recently, Selvaraj cultivated 300 kg in his third harvest. He claims during the latest harvest, each bunch of grapes weighed about 250 grams. We are planning to achieve about 500 kg, he added.As per an expert's advice, Selvaraj allowed the grapes to grow freely in his latest cultivating season, without removing canes. He supported the vine with extra bamboo stake. Extra growth of leaves in this season will also make roots stronger and ensure that the plant gets a good start in the next season, he said.Keeping in mind the help from his friends and neighbours, Selvaraj shared the fruits. This time I had enough grapes to give to more people and children"", he said. Selvaraj adds that rooftop grape harvesting will also be a learning environment where kids from local schools, who love nature, could understand utilisation of space. Selvaraj also grows vegetables around his house. I have some space around my house to grow vegetables, he said.Selvaraj's daughter, who is in the ninth standard, helps her father.Brinjal, carrot, snake gourd, red pumpkin, cucumber, tomato and ladies finger are the latest entry to Selvaraj's garden."

And if that sounds judgmental and presumptuous, youre right. I was judgmental and presumptuous about the womenfolk in my family who laboured away in the kitchen to dish out tasty treats for foodies like me. Till one such day when reality hit me. And how?I was to get married and live alone with my husband, with no one to cook for us. Fortunately for me, I had no romantic notions about marriage that love-struck couples can survive on love and thin air alone. I knew we needed our three meals a day  fresh, tasty and healthy. But, cooking and me? A chit of a girl whod always treated cooking with disdain?Well, coming back to the problem, hiring a cook was not an option. What would my in-laws think? A crash course in cooking was out of the question, too. With the wedding just a month away, I was working, and shopping, and getting ready for the D-Day, all at once.So, the next best thing was to jot down all my moms recipes, to experiment later. I quickly grabbed a blue diary, dragged my mom out of the kitchen, and started noting down recipes for everything from simple chutneys to complicated biryanis.Along the way, I realised I was ignorant when it came to the names of dals. Painstakingly, I explained each dal with my own understanding of it. Toor dal was sambhar dal, green gram was kosambari dal, and so on. Once done, I felt like I had conquered the kitchen. The blue diary occupied the pride of place in my wedding trousseau, holding within its hallowed pages culinary secrets that promised to make me a great cook.Post-honeymoon, the first thing I did on entering the kitchen was to open my blue diary and look for the simplest of recipes. It was tomato bele saaru (rasam). Thus began my culinary journey, with the blue diary religiously by my side. I quickly graduated from saaru to gravy to pulao and biriyani. Of course, not without the blue diary by my side. Recipes from glossy books were not for me. Even if I saw an interesting recipe, I had to first note it down in my blue diary before trying it out. My strong belief was that only recipes that came out of my blue diary worked their magic.Over the years, the blue diary attracted more recipes, and oil splatter, too. Dog-ears and the fading colours of its pages notwithstanding, it continued to be my cooking bible. It was highly personalised, too, as only I could understand the recipes therein, what with my own notes in a nice combination of my mother tongue and English.Recently, post my week-long vacation, I opened the kitchen cabinet to pull my blue diary out, and what did I see? Horror of horrors, my sacred book had been feasted upon by termites. It was in tatters. Tears rolled down my cheeks. Out of frustration, out of anger. Of all the books at home, which are quite a few, termites had to target my blue diary. The same diary that had changed my attitude toward cooking, the same one that had given me the confidence to master culinary skills. And, most of all, the one that had marked my journey from ignorance to struggle to triumph.My dear blue diary, I miss you."

Evironmentalist in him spurred him to take up some green activity in his apartment. The result: he has more than 1,700 plants, including bamboo shoots and vegetable and medicinal plants. These give his house a garden look.Exnora founder Nirmal has nurtured thousands of plants in his 12th floor apartment. Garden can be created everywhere, including your home store room or even in the balcony, Nirmal says. Except his bedroom and a small portion of his kitchen, the entire space, including veranda and terrace, have plants. Since plant produces more oxygen, it is better to avoid that in your bedroom, he says.When I came to this apartment, neighbours initially challenged that plants will not grow as the place has high levels of pollution. However, I proved them that plants can be grown anywhere provided there is good sunlight, 74-year-old Nirmal, who started his house gardening a few years back, said.In his house, one can find plants in handmade jar carved out of thermocol, flowers in wooden bowls and freshly planted crotons in pots. Nirmal also uses bamboo poles for planting. Bamboo can be horizontally placed from a rod fixed to the wall. Now the poles can be filled with soil and with that we can grow small flowering plants in them, he said. His living room too has plenty of plants, including those with medicinal properties. My living room is an oxygen parlour for me, he said.Gardens help to cool the house, he claimed. Nirmal's garden venture could be classified into earthen pot garden, pipe garden, tray garden, bag garden, drum garden and tyre garden. Even canvas shoes could be seen filled with mud and saplings in them.According to him, sufficient sunlight and tailor-made space are necessary to start garden at home. Keep the plants near windows or in the balcony where some sunlight will fall on the plants during the course of the day, particularly in the morning or in the evening, he said.Right plantsHowever, he said that there are some plants that can grow even in shade. Handsome hosta will grow in shade areas, he said adding a few others need just little sunlight. Right plants have to be picked for the right spots, he said. For example shrubs or hedge plants should be planted on both sides of the entrance of the house, he added.Nirmal said if sufficient sunlight is not entering the house, most of the potted plants have to be kept outside (terrace).Highlighting the benefits of the terrace garden, Nirmal said it will keep the house cool. The electricity consumed for operating a fan and an air-conditioner will be reduced. It will also calm you down, he claimed. Whenever I see my terrace garden, my mind becomes calm, Nirmal said. Besides decorative plants, he has grown vegetables such as brinjal, ladys finger, tomatoes, chillies, greens and radish on his balcony.The environmentalist claimed that his flat is zero water waste flat. Even the water we use to wash our rice and vegetables go into the plants, because they are full of nutrients, he said. We also prepare our own organic fertiliser to feed the plants. For Nirmal, water is the most precious commodity and the second basic necessity after air. It should not be wasted and plants do not ask you for potable water, he said.Advising people to use sky space even if they live in a small apartment, he said that waste milk trays, which can he hanged, can be transformed into plant growing area. Disposable tyres can be stacked up to hold enough soil to grow plants, he said. Nirmal's 900 sq ft sky farm has over 50 medicinal plants, which he calls green pharmacy.We want people, especially youngsters to know that techniques like these exist and implement them in their houses, he said. More than 200 houses in the city have already taken up the activity.People from other states too have evinced interest in doing this, he claimed. On the advantages of sky gardening, he said people will tend to use the kitchen waste for compost and slowly sewage treatment will also be brought about for water supply. Nirmal's another advice is that greening the outside walls and compound will serve as a barrier against dust and polluted air.Now, Nirmal's garden has turned into a small tourist spot with students from various schools visiting every day. Young students are very much interested in knowing about each and every plant. They are spending almost two to three hours during their visit, he said.Exnora, which was founded by Nirmal, is a broad-based non-governmental organisation focusing on mobilising and empowering communities to participate in preserving nature and preventing environmental degradation, thereby improving the quality of life.The 16-year-old movement has spread and covered many parts of India. There are about 5,000 such Civic Exnoras in Chennai city and in the various Districts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala and a few other states, covering about 30,000 streets and settlements."

I am also unaware of any demands that the agitators may have. The incident is politically motivatedSanjay Das Burmaskill development and technical education minister Bhubaneswar, Sept. 19: Minister Sanjay Das Burma today escaped unhurt after students of Alaranath Vocational College hurled a chair at him during a programme at the institute. The skill development and technical education minister faced stiff opposition upon his arrival at the college, which is located 65km away from here. Though the chair missed him by a whisker, the incident sparked a confrontation between the supporters of the minister and the agitating students. The clash also forced the police present at the location to resort to mild lathicharge to bring the situation under control. The incident took place when Das Burma, who is also the local MLA, was about to take his place on the dais during the 38th foundation day celebrations of the college. Though the cops remained tight-lipped about the reason behind the incident, sources said that the attackers were backed by Opposition parties. Alaranath Vocational College principal Khageswar Jena said the attackers were former students who had also been invited to the programme. ""The former students had an argument with the present group over some issue and both groups threw chairs at each other during the meeting,"" he said. Das Burma, on the other hand, pleaded ignorance about the incident. ""Protests are a part and parcel of politics but, it should be done in a decent manner. I don't know the reason behind their anger. I am also unaware of any demands that the agitators may have. The incident is politically motivated,"" the minister said. Brahmagiri police station inspector in-charge Umakanta Singh said the police had detained one student in this connection. ""The minister is safe and we are interrogating the student to ascertain the reason behind the incident,"" said Singh. This is not the first time that Das Burma has found himself in the line of fire of Opposition ""missiles"". Earlier this year, Das Burma, who is also the food supplies and consumer welfare minister, faced stiff resistance from youth and student wings of the Congress over alleged irregularities in the distribution of ration cards under the National Food Security Act. On January 4, activists of the Youth Congress had hurled eggs at Das Burma's car at Puri Circuit House. They were staging a protest against the irregularities in the preparing ration card beneficiaries' list. The cops in Puri had arrested five members of the Youth Congress in connection with the incident. The following day, activists of the Youth Congress again targeted the minister, hurling eggs and rotten tomatoes at his car near Chhatrapur Science College during another protest. The minister was on his way to Berhampur University to attend its golden jubilee function."

(AP) Amatrice, Aug. 25: The chaos came in the middle of the night. People were screaming and dying in the darkness across Amatrice, a summer getaway in central Italy famous as the birthplace of a pasta dish made with tomatoes and pork cheeks. It was 3:36am when the 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit, followed by a succession of strong aftershocks - including one nearly as strong an hour later - that flattened houses and buried residents in the rubble. Amatrice was the worst hit by the quake, which also damaged surrounding towns. As of this morning, the deaths totalled at least 247, officials said. ""Half the town no longer exists,"" mayor Sergio Pirozzi of Amatrice had told reporters yesterday morning. He might have been too optimistic. By midday Amatrice, a quiet mountain town about 100 miles northeast of Rome, felt more like a ghost town. Ambulances raced along windy roads clogged with traffic and rubble as rescue teams searched for survivors. Using picks, shovels and hands, they scrabbled through the dust and debris of crumbled homes. They brought in dogs to sniff for the dead and injured. A soft white dust was still swirling about the rubble piled waist-high in Amatrice. Stunned survivors - some with tear-streaked cheeks, others still wearing pyjamas - wandered through the streets, unsure what to do. A father, holding a small child, pushed a wobbly stroller piled with plastic bags of clothing over a rocky path. A young girl sobbed into her mobile phone. ""It's all gone, the bar, the house, everything,"" she said. The initial quake was comparable in intensity to one in 2009 in the central Abruzzo region that killed more than 300 people. ""The number of missing people is undefined at the moment,"" Immacolata Postiglione, the head of the emergency unit at Italy's civil protection agency, said at a news conference in Rome. With a permanent population of about 2,000, Amatrice is a place where people know one another. Many had ties to Rome in one way or another, working there in the winter, running restaurants, bars and hotels, as food has always been part of the town's culture. ""If you closed the restaurants in Rome run by Amatriciani, you'd close half the restaurants,"" said Maria Prassede Perilli, a resident who had been visiting her sister in Rome when the quake struck. Perilli said she had rushed back after her husband, Giacomo, called in the middle of the night in a frightened voice, telling her, ""There's been a terrible earthquake, you can't even imagine."" Her husband survived, she said, but his sisters and niece did not. The couple's house was crushed. ""It's flat, like a book,"" she said. For many residents who worked in Rome, August was the traditional month of rest and relaxation. ""You had dinners in the piazza, long tables with lots of people, someone would bring out a guitar to sing,"" Perilli said. ""It's the mountain, it's a good place to be."" Women at a rescue camp in Amatrice on Thursday. (Reuters) ""Will they ever be able to rebuild this?"" Perilli said. ""It seems like the end of an era."" Rescue teams representing a spectrum of police and armed forces, civil protection agencies from around the country, as well as medical staff members worked through the day searching for survivors, but more often finding the dead. ""This is positive; as soon as the earthquake struck, people came from all over to help,"" said Riza Sinani, a nurse from the nearby town of Rieti. ""That doesn't happen in every country, this outpouring of humanity and good will."" Several people in Amatrice said the town had been full of tourists who came for the coming weekend's annual Sagra dell'Amatriciana festival, which celebrates Amatrice's native pasta sauce, using cured pork cheek known as guanciale, and grated pecorino cheese. The festival has been cancelled. As sympathy and offers of support poured in from around the world, Pope Francis led pilgrims at St. Peter's Square in praying for the victims, clutching a rosary in his right hand, and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi went to Rieti. Renzi praised rescue workers and volunteers and vowed to rebuild - a promise particularly important for Italians still furious about the long delays in reconstruction after the 2009 quake. The area's most significant monument, the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi, was unharmed, as were monuments in the city of Perugia. ""We were saved by a miracle,"" said Stefania Proietti, the mayor of Assisi, where in 1997 a devastating earthquake caused casualties and extensive damage to the city, destroying frescoes by Giotto and Cimabue in the basilica. For those in Amatrice, the immediate focus was on essentials: who was alive, and who was dead, or missing. New York Times News Service"
58ff1f2b7be9e0420db2cfea,River of discontent where 'cusec' is a call for war,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160913/jsp/nation/story_107927.jsp,2016-09-13,,Telegraph,"A woman takes her child from a Karnataka Sangha school in Chennaion Monday. (PTI) Chennai, Sept. 12: Just say ""Cauvery"", and you could end up hitting a raw nerve in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The two states have been fighting for centuries for their share of water from the river, which feeds the rice bowls of both. While less water has been flowing down the river - for both climatic and man-made reasons - the size of the area it irrigates has been increasing in both states, particularly in Karnataka. A tribunal award in 2007 that instructed Karnataka to release 192 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year has aggravated the dispute (it's not yet settled how much the release should be in distress years). When Karnataka has a poor southwest monsoon, like this year, things turn especially tricky as the water stored in its reservoirs is just enough for drinking and not for irrigation. So when the Supreme Court on September 5 directed the state to release 15,000 cusec water every day till September 15 to Tamil Nadu (about 1.3tmcft per day), furious farmers and pro-Kannada outfits in Karnataka directed their anger against the rulers of both states. Today, the top court revised the award to 12,000 cusec a day till September 20. In Tamil Nadu, every small legal victory on the Cauvery (or Mullaperiyar, in the case of Kerala) is flaunted by the ruling AIADMK as yet another feather in Amma's cap. This further provokes the pro-Kannada groups in Karnataka, who see their government as the loser in the duel in spite of controlling all the dams that store the Cauvery's waters. So the easy targets of their anger are vehicles from Tamil Nadu, Tamil films, eateries with distinct Tamil names and the Tamils living in large numbers in Bangalore and Kolar district. As interstate road transport grinds to a halt, trade and the movement of people are hit. While the arrival of tomatoes and onions in Tamil Nadu dwindle, the farmers growing them in Karnataka stare at losses because of the consequent glut. Similarly, milk and eggs from Tamil Nadu stop moving to Karnataka, the tensions thus hitting both states economically. In Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery dispute feeds into the rivalry between the two Dravidian parties to prove which of them is the greater protector of Tamil interests. So the verbal duel between the DMK and the AIADMK grows to its shrillest, with each accusing the other of not doing enough to get Tamil Nadu its share of the water. The two parties often send separate delegations to Delhi to fight the state's case, in contrast to the unity displayed by Karnataka parties. It is in this context that fringe Tamil groups try to grab their brief moments of fame by attacking vehicles from Karnataka or businesses run by Kannadigas. Although they claim that their attacks are aimed at deterring violence against Tamilians, such incidents in these days of 24-hour television news have exactly the opposite effect. ""It was only after New Woodlands (a hotel owned by a family with Karnataka roots) was attacked in Chennai early today that the Adayar Ananda Bhavan in Bangalore (part of a chain of restaurants with Chennai-based owners) got vandalised,"" a senior police officer said. Even when the monsoon is not playing truant, the Cauvery remains a sore spot as Karnataka wants to build one more dam at Mekadattu, 110km from Bangalore, to feed its capital's growing drinking water needs. Tamil Nadu sees it as another plea to deprive it of its tribunal-stipulated share of water. One solution mooted to decrease the two states' dependence on the Cauvery is to link the peninsular rivers starting from Mahanadi in Odisha down to the Vaigai in southern Tamil Nadu. With Tamil Nadu already locked in water wars with three neighbouring states - including Andhra Pradesh -however, that proposal may never take off. Farmers in the Cauvery delta have been slowly resorting to alternative crops that need less water compared with rice. This could create another kind of dependence on other states - for rice - by lowering rice production in Tamil Nadu. ""Even in a good year, the water flow along the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu is hampered by the huge pits created on the riverbed by reckless sand mining. The irrigation channels are not desilted, either, to take the water to the tail-end areas,"" an agricultural scientist said. ""We should address these issues with greater sincerity, too, while we demand our share of the water."""

After allowing Durga, Ganesh, Saraswati and Kartik to soak in the river for a couple of hours, the debris will have to be cleared. The Durga idol at Hounslow and (right) pushpanjali petals being distributed Hounslow believes it has the biggest Durga in the country. Designs for even bigger replacement idols have already gone out to craftsman Proshanto Pal of Kumartuli. No one quite knows how many Pujas are held in the UK though the consensus is that the figure is around 40, with around a dozen or so taking place in London. For years the main Puja has been in Camden Town in north London, but Hounslow is now apparently a Bengali hub, populated mainly by IT specialists who have come to the UK in the last 10 years or so. Without saying so, Hounslow reckons it has become a rival to Camden. The Bengalis in Camden ""said why don't you join us,"" according to Debabrata Das of Hounslow, ""but we said we can manage on our own, thank you. Then they said they will give us a prize for our Puja. We said no need, we can give you a prize!"" ""We are about 47 families who belong to Probashi,"" said Atrayee Chaudhury, who was very proud she had worn her bright red sari in Bengali fashion. Acting Purohit Biraja Ghoshal, (right) the Probashi women create a bit of Calcutta in Hounslow Atrayee, who works in financial PR - her husband Shankar Chaudhury works in IT - explained: ""We are first-generation (migrants). We want to pass on the Bengali culture to our children."" On Saptami evening, the children had lined up a Bollywood show. The Hounslow Puja has become a magnet for non-Bengalis and Bangladeshi Muslims too. ""I have become practically Bengali,"" admitted Probashi's current president, Chetan Kashyap, a Bihari who remembers Durga Puja from his days in Patna. He has been in Britain for 12 years and, like most of the others, works in IT. ""Everyone here feels 'this is my Puja',"" he said. Last year, some 7,000 people had to be fed. Two cooks are on duty. But everyone contributes by bringing in home-cooked items which have to be ""pure veg"". The job of the purohit (priest) was performed expertly on Saptami by Biraja Ghoshal, who said he knew all the right prayers and rituals ""because I grew up in a Ramakrishna Mission"". Ghoshal, who works for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said he had been able to access everything that he needed except, in the first year, the lotus. ""Then someone came along and put something in my hand - it was a lotus flower."" Marigolds of the kind needed for pushpanjali are grown at home by Hounslow Bengalis. One of them, Dr Ajit Kumar Basak, told of how disaster struck his allotment last year. ""I had between 3,000 and 4,000 marigolds. I went one morning and found the whole lot had been killed off by a nine-degree drop in temperature and a sharp frost."" Basak, who works as a scientist in the field of ""animal and human biology"", has a crucial role to play in the Hounslow Puja - he supplies the banana tree. ""They are the ornamental variety - not tall like the kind you get in Calcutta - and I have three which I keep inside my home where the temperature is 24 degrees Celsius,"" he said. ""One I give to Hounslow, another to the Puja in Ealing where I have a student and the third stays at home."" The Goddess Durga perhaps noticed one change compared with previous generations - ladies were taking selfies with Mother in the background."

""I have sown only that much of paddy which will sustain me for the year and grow tomato and capsicum on the rest of my land,"" said Nuagaon resident Budhun Ekka, who owns three acres. Ekka's income has increased substantially since he began cultivating these crops instead of paddy. Last year, he had made a profit of more than Rs 60,000. This trend is not only confined to Nuagaon. Kutra resident Sandip Majhi, who has completed his BA from Sambalpur, has returned to help his father in vegetable farming. This December, the plan is to produce tomato and capsicum on a large scale. ""The desi or indigenous variety of tomato and capsicum have good market all over the country,"" said agricultural equipment manufacturer J.K. Patra, who has an industrial unit in Kalunga industrial estate. Patra is in talks with some landowners at Nuagaon and near Rajgangpur to avail himself of land on lease. ""I want to produce drumsticks on permanent basis, along with tomato and capsicum,"" he said. These vegetables are in demand right from Bangalore to Punjab. ""These produces have more demand than the local ones,"" he said. A woman carries capsicum in Nuagaon. Rajendra Agarwal and his brother had been producing watermelon with seeds imported from Thailand. However, they are now planning to concentrate on tomato and capsicum. ""We found the demand for the two in many places, even in Bengal,"" said Agarwal. Patra, who plans to cultivate drumstick, said: ""This is a very cash-rich product, and one can grow other vegetables along with this as I have seen in Tamil Nadu. So, I will try to do that as well."" Over the years, Nuagaon and its nearby areas have come to be known as the land of capsicum. ""We take the best ones and the inferior ones go to you,"" said Narayana Krishna Reddy from Trisur with a smile. Reddy comes twice or thrice a year to this area and keep his supply chain network healthy back in Hyderabad and Bangalore. Now, he is planning to go to other areas of the district where these two crops are produced on a large scale. This year's monsoon, which has been moderate, has encouraged the farmers. ""I am satisfied with the rainfall, and there will be enough water for us everywhere, including the bore wells and rivers,"" said Bimal Lakra of Titrerkela. The only problem other than an efficient irrigation system is the absence of cold storages. There is only one private cold storage which is of small size and only let out to store fruits. ""We need cold storages, so that we can also sell our products locally when the demand goes up,"" said Amit Pradhan, who stays near Riun. He has completed his MBA and now plans to devote his full time to agriculture. ""I did agriculture marketing during my internship and gained some basic knowledge about it,"" said Pradhan. In Rourkela, the indigenous variety of tomato sells between Rs 25 and Rs 40 a kilogram while capsicum sells between Rs 60 and Rs 80 a kilogram."

(File Photo) BJPs Ashish Shelar said CM Fadnavis will be first such Chief Minister who wanted to connect with commoners over a dinner with their traditional food. (File Photo)In a bid to connect with North Indian voters ahead of BMC elections slated next year, ruling BJP has organised a public dinner with a traditional menu at suburban Goregaon on September 2 which will be attended by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. BJP city unit, which has organised the function, said 5,000 invitations have been sent out for the function, to be held in the western suburb.We are elated to announce that our chief minister would be having quality time with the people of North India over Baati-Chokha wherein he would interact with the intellectuals as well as commoners invited from all walks of life, BJP city unit president Ashish Shelar said on Thursday. He said Fadnavis will be first such CM who wanted to connect with commoners over a dinner with their traditional food.While baati consists of wheat and sattu (powdered roasted blackgrams) formed into balls with spices, and then dipped in ghee (clarified butter) chokha is a dip prepared by mashing boiled potatoes, tomatoes and eggplant together with some spices. It is no surprise that the BJP is aggressively trying to woo Uttar Bhartiyas as they form 28 per cent vote share in countrys financial capital. The outreach has another objective with forthcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, due next year.BMC has been ruled by Shiv Sena, which plays its agenda of sons-of-soil vs outsiders, with the BJP as a junior partner for over two decades. On the choice of venue, as Shiv Sena recently held a function to mark its golden jubilee at the same spot, Shelar said, We are organising this programme at same place where one party had recently celebrated its 50 years without connecting with the commoner, but our case it different. Our all top leaders of state, including Fadnavis ji, would have a direct interaction with the invitees.Mumbai BJP general secretary Amarjeet Mishra, who often organises such functions for North Indians, said, the work that chief minister of Uttar Pradesh didnt and couldnt do here in Mumbai (to connect with the North Indians), is being done by Devendraji.Mishra, who recently organised a music festival dedicated to Kajri form of singing which is popular in Northern belt, said, Our CM is connecting with North Indians very fast and this was very much visible when he instantly donned gamachha during a programme when he came to know that it was a typical a traditional cotton towel used in North India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The market is more than a century old and as years passed by, the condition of this biggest commercial hub has deteriorated. Except ""sweet promises"" from those at the helm of affairs, the marketplace has been in an unhygienic condition and left unattended to without any change for many decades now. Like others in the past who had visited the marketplace, today too, it got fresh attention from the Meghalaya government as chief minister Mukul Sangma, urban affairs minister Ronnie V. Lyngdoh, health minister Roshan Warjri and officials went there. The market is under the control of Hima Mylliem, one of the Khasi traditional administrative units. Acting syiem (chief) of Hima Mylliem, Ricky N. Syiem, and his traditional myntris (ministers) were also present. Though Hima Mylliem falls under the administrative control of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, not a single official or member from the council was present. The hourlong inspection began from a place where tomato sellers used to assemble every day. Sangma and his team explained to the vendors the intention of the government to revamp the market by working together with Hima Mylliem that proposed to develop a first-of-its-kind women's market complex at the venue. They inspected items ranging from perishable goods to garments. At the fish market, Sangma - under whose initiative an aquaculture mission was launched with a target to make Meghalaya self-sufficient in fish production - got an unpleasant reply to a query when one of the sellers told him that most the fish sold at Iewduhwere brought from Andhra Pradesh. The chief minister interacted with local shopkeepers and even took photographs with some of them. Amid the stench that emanated from the tomato-selling venue, he made a brief but ""promising speech"" before the crowd. According to Sangma, Iewduhneeds to be converted into the ""most-talked-about"" marketplace, given its legacy. The chief minister, who recalled his days as a medical student in Manipur, said there he saw the thriving Ima (women's) market. He vouched to work out a plan to have such a market complex at Iewduhtoo. ""If the Iewduhcan attract people, hoteliers and taxi drivers will get money and the state government will get tax,"" he said. Meghalaya has been also generating revenue from luxury tax from hotels, and the fund was utilized for development of the state. In a lighter vein, Sangma said once the marketplace had been the meeting point for many people, including youths who also used it as a place for dating. Stating that visitors, including tourists, must be tempted to visit Iewduh, Sangma underlined the need to make the market clean and attractive. He said his government was committed to making Meghalaya a clean and green state and design a programme where markets would compete for an award for being the cleanest. ""The most challenging is removing garbage which is the enemy number one. We came here as a team that is tasked with the responsibility of supporting Hima Mylliem in its plan to improve the market with additional infrastructure. We will sit together and design our investment and find a solution to the challenges,"" Sangma assured. Lyngdoh said: ""It is no longer a market, but a slum"". He warned that if a natural disaster strikes, the marketplace will suffer huge damages and massive casualties as it is congested with numerous unplanned buildings."
58ff3c177be9e0420db2eebc,Modified crop irks CM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161008/jsp/bihar/story_112525.jsp,2016-10-08,,Telegraph,"Nitish Kumar Patna, Oct. 7: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate cancellation of a clearance given to genetically modified (GM) mustard by a technical sub-committee of the central Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The committee's clearance certifies genetically modified mustard as ""safe for human and animal consumption"". Nitish requested the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and ensure that attempts towards its commercial release are not taken without prior consultation and the state government's consent. ""I strongly urge you that GM mustard application which has been cleared by a sub-committee to GEAC must be overruled instantaneously,"" he wrote to Modi. ""Further, no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, as it can harm the interests of the farmers and the people of India at large."" In the missive dispatched on October 6 - a copy of which is with The Telegraph - Nitish has also pointed out that ""interested parties"" were trying to push in an unproven technology and the states must have a decisive say in its use. Narendra Modi ""We strongly feel that as per existing policy, Government of India should consult and seek no objections from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop. The states must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on farmers,"" Nitish wrote. The chief minister's opposition to GM seeds and crops is well known. He had been at the forefront, opposing field trials of transgenic Bt brinjal (brinjal with a gene inserted from bacillus thuringiensis to make it pest-resistant) and genetically modified maize, mustard and other crops. He has documented the Bihar government's opposition to GM crops and expressed dismay that ""the unscientific push for GM mustard"" was continuing despite previous communication in the matter. Nitish said that if transgenic mustard gets final approval it will become the gateway to a host of other GM food crops, including maize, rice, brinjal, wheat and tomato among others. The chief minister's worry stems from the fact that mustard is an important crop for Bihar and its oil is used for cooking, seeds as condiments in dishes, leaves consumed as a winter delicacy and cakes (residue after pressing seeds to extract oil) as animal feed. Its yellow flowers serve as food for honeybees during winter. ""Mustard is an important crop for states like Bihar and we'll not be able to escape the consequences of the technology,"" Nitish said on the use of transgenic mustard. ""When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out."" So far, the only GM crop granted final approval is Bt Cotton; cultivated in cotton-growing areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat and elsewhere since 2002. Nitish argued that the case of Bt Cotton amply demonstrates that GM is a failed technology, as bollworm, a cotton pest for which it was brought, has developed resistance against the Bt toxin and is wreaking havoc on cotton crops causing heavy losses to thousands of farmers across the country. He also questioned why GM mustard is seeking to promote itself as a hybrid technology when non-GM hybrids are available. ""I had written to the Union minister of environment and forests in January saying that interested parties who failed to win the confidence of farmers (on transgenic crops) are now pushing the technology through public institutions,"" Nitish said. ""There have been conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard and there is ample proof provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and civil society that the tests were misled to obtain favourable results. This particular GM mustard variety was tested against 40-year old varieties,"" Nitish added. He said GM mustard is similar in yield to latest hybrid varieties of mustard available in public and private sectors. He reiterated that agriculture was a state subject and urged Modi, who has been emphasising on cooperative federalism, to demonstrate by cancelling the nod to GM mustard. GM crops have come under severe opposition from advocacy groups and non-government organisations, who say its risks have not been adequately examined and sufficient testing not possible, as the regulatory authorities and scientific bodies in various countries are too closely tied to private sector industry. Some studies claim genetically modified crops could harm consumers."

The quantity of rainfall is also declining with each passing day. The groundwater levels have also fallen and borewells have to be dug deep to find water at 1,500 to 1,800 feet.Farmers work very hard and use the available water to grow crops, vegetables and mulberry for sericulture. New agricultural methods are being developed. Progressive farmers have now adopted the use of polyhouses (greenhouses) for growing vegetables.It is the experience of these farmers that the polyhouse is a boon. Polyhouses can be constructed in land measuring five guntas to one acre. Capsicum, chilly, tomato, cucumber, beans and other vegetables; watermelon, musk melon and other fruits; rose, chrysanthemum, marigold, Gerbera, carnation and other flowers can be grown in polyhouses.They can be also be utilised to start nurseries to grow saplings of mango, cashew, sapota, guava, lemon, custard apple, jamun and other horticultural crops. The plants grown in polyhouses are of a good quality and have a high yield. Not only do they use less water, they also are relatively free of weeds.Control of diseases and menace of pests is also easier in a polyhouse. Good quality vegetables can be grown in any season of the year and this can increase the profits. Polyhouses also offer protection from unseasonal rain, winds and hail.Farmers can also save 30% to 40% on fertilisers and water. The yield of vegetables and the ensuing profit can go up by 30%, says Shivaprasad, senior additional director of the department of Horticulture.With an increase in the number of farmers growing vegetables, the demand for vegetable saplings has also grown. Saplings grown in trays can easily be transported. Nearly 90% of saplings grown in polyhouses survive transplantation.An advantage of a polyhouse is the option of controlling the growth conditions. Vegetables grown in polyhouses are in greater demand and fetch better prices in the market.As per the regulations of the Horticulture department, construction of a one-acre polyhouse costs Rs 33 lakh. The National Horticultural Mission and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana give a subsidy of 75% to farmers of general category and 90% subsidy to farmers belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes for the construction of polyhouses.Boon for progressPolyhouses are a boon to progressive farmers. Those interested can contact the Horticulture department. Nearly 50 farmers of the taluk have already constructed polyhouses.Polyhouses can also be built on 5-10 guntas. A polyhouse built on 10 guntas can cost Rs 9-10 lakh. Maintenance of the polyhouse after its construction is utmost important, said Sunil, an official of the Horticulture department."

The process of drying helps lengthen the shelf life of the vegetables. There has been a growing demand for the quality and value-added horticultural crops and we have been marketing the same to a number of foreign countries particularly Dubai and Gulf countries, says Manikutti Subramanian, Managing Director of the Group.Dheenadhayalan, working partner, said that what started on an experimental basis with banana has given a new dimension to the company. The company was marketing these products through an agent. We do not have license or permit for exporting these products to foreign countries and we rely on the agent, he said.Mr. Manikutti Subramanian said that the solar drying of the horticultural crops is adopted when prices of vegetables are less. ""For example, when the price of tomato is less, we make a bulk purchase of the produce and dry it, he said. The dried produce is sold when the price appreciates.In fact a large number of hotel owners and restaurant managers rely on us to when prices of the vegetables shoots up, he said."

The Centre should fix uniform prices for vegetables across the country, to bail the growers from crisis situation. The farmers should be able to determine the prices for their produces, he said. He also urged the state government to strengthen Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing Society (HOPCOMS) across the state.Farmers produce 250 million tonnes of food grains and vegetables, every year. But, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to introduce appropriate food security policy, he alleged.Puttannaiah set a deadline of one month to the government to address the problems faced by the farming community at APMCs. Tomato growers expressed their anguish over crash in prices and irregularities at APMC. The farmers alleged that if a box of tomato weighs 30 kg, the brokers calculate for only 26 kg.Shadakshari, a farmer from Duggahalli, Nanjangud taluk ,complained that the brokers ignore them if they question the fraud."

Scientists should strive for value addition to agriculture produce to make the agrarian activity profitable. So, lab to land and land to lab cycle should be initiated. Research outcomes should reach the farmers and they should be tested on farmlands and the problems should be again fixed in the labs, he said.Pointing out that online trading of agriculture produce has been introduced in around 30 APMCs in the State to minimise the role of middlemen and make farming profitable, Siddaramaiah claimed that it was a first-of-its-kind experiment in the nation and was being replicated in other States.Citing the election code of conduct in view of the Zilla and Taluk Panchayat polls, he diverted to beliefs, culture and traditions and slightly towards spirituality.Customs and traditions should be followed for the benefit of humankind and the society and they should not be followed blindly. Since my student days, I am against superstition, but not against customs and traditions. My only concern is that beliefs should not harm the society. I strongly believe in Basavannas preachings and Sharana Samskruthi. Ones birth is not in ones control, but one should die as a human being  irrespective of caste, creed and religion, he said.Stating that the crux of Hinduism is tolerance, he said caste system was stagnant and was a hindrance in promoting humanity. Recalling his childhood, he said, during holidays to school, when he went home, he would not get food if he did not do household and farm chores. It was not because of poverty, but, because my parents regarded work as worship. Kayaka should be actually translated as production. The society will progress only when all the members become productive, Siddaramaiah added.Code of conductSpeaking about the election code of conduct, he said, it is actually a hindrance to development. Since I assumed office as the chief minister, the State has been facing elections continously. So, many development works are lagging behind, he said.Making a mockery of the eroding human values, the chief minister said it reflected even in sports and games. As children we used to play a lot of desi games and stayed heathy, now cards game is a favourite pastime among many people, he quipped.Member of Parliament from Chamarajanagar R Dhruvanarayan presented prizes to six farmers, who have achieved higher yields in paddy, tomatoes and plantains."

Reason: most of the veggie prices have been slashed to half.Good rain in July have cheered up the farming community. It has resulted in the reduction of vegetable prices, which had skyrocketed a month ago.Except a few unseasonal vegetables, most of them are being sold at for Rs 20 per kg. With hardly any weddings or ceremonies held during Ashada, there was also less demand for vegetables . Hence, there was a sudden drop in the prices of veggies, said Anand, Managing Director, Horticultural Produce Cooperative Marketing Society (HOPCOMS).While Tuesday marks the end of Ashada and the beginning of the festival season, slight fluctuation in the prices of vegetables is expected, he adds.Just a couple of months ago, the price of beans was Rs 120 per kg. It was hovering around Rs 70 a fortnight ago. It is sold being at Rs 15 and Rs 20 per kg presently. Even the price of tomatoes had sharply risen. Presently, it is being sold at Rs 7 per kg and hybrid variety is being sold at Rs 10 per kg.Says Anand, With onset of monsoon, small farmers had sown vegetables which are being harvested now. With rise in production, a large quantity of vegetables has arrived in the market, hence the reduction in price.On August 2nd, beans, carrot, brinjals, cabbage, ridge gourd, bottle gourd were being sold at Rs 20 per kg. Knol khol, beet root, ladys finger is being sold at Rs 30 per kg, capsicum Rs 50 per kg and drumstick is being sold at Rs 70 per kg, which is highest amongst all.Coriander, mint, methi and other greens, which earlier being sold at Rs 10 per bunch.

Today, he feels proud of his garden with a variety of fruits and vegetables, including exotic ones.The passion for growing vegetables and fruits motivated him to set up a garden on an area of 1,200 sq ft on the terrace of his house.Initially when I planted ivy gourd, I used to get around 150 kg of ivy gourd per month and there was a good demand in the market. Along with ivy gourd, I started looking for different vegetables and fruits. We have not bought vegetables from market for the last seven years, he said.Along with vegetables, he has also experimented with jackfruit and grapes in his garden. This year, DSouza tasted success by nurturing a two-year-old grafted Kantakali Pink variety of jackfruit bought from a nursery. The jackfruit weighed about one kg and had 15 bulbs. This is probably the first time that a jackfruit has been grown in a terrace garden, he said proudly.After working in the Gulf for a few years, he came to Mangaluru and converted his terrace into an organic garden.The garden has black mango from Brazil, China orange, Israel orange (which is consumed along with its peel), Thailand mango, wood apple, apple bore, water apple, Kabul grapes, grafted avocado, butter fruit, varieties of guava, cocoa, peach, cashew, coffee, star fruit, cap fruit, milky fruit, sweet tamarind, Jabuticaba (a kind of grape), sapota, sweet lime, Bombay Bore (each fruit weighs 150 g), strawberry, fig, pomegranate, seedless lemon, passion fruit, gumless jackfruit and varieties of mangoes like Mallika, Mundappa, Neelam, Badami, Alphonso, Kesar and also all-season mangoes.Apart from this, ivy gourd, snake gourd, bitter gourd, brinjal, drumstick, ridge gourd, tomato, winged beans, broad beans, hog plum, basale (both green and red variety), ladies finger (both red and whitish), mint, Harive, black pepper, bush pepper, green chillies, bottle gourd, Brahmi from Australia, Sri Lanka and also native variety and betel leaves can also seen growing in his garden.I dont use any chemical fertilisers for any of the plants including those of vegetables. Kitchen waste and dried leaves of the plants are manure for the plants. A neem mixture is sprayed to control the pests, he said.DSouza added that Tulasi, which he has planted, acts as a repellent for insects attacking the plants. A small olive plant also finds its place on the terrace. The plant was brought from Israel by one of his friends.Looking at my passion for vegetables and fruits, my friends get me the plants from different countries of the world, he said.Stating that the grape vine was planted accidentally, DSouza said it was nearly four years ago that a nursery in the city got two grape vines in a lorry load.As I was in constant touch with the nursery, the owner asked whether I was interested in planting the grape vine. I planted two vines and allowed them to spread on the terrace. After one and half years of planting the vines, it bore fruit from April to July, he said with a smile on his face.He also helps people set up terrace gardens and supports them with assistance. Over a period of time, he has set up 75 terrace gardens in and around Mangaluru.DSouza also delivers lectures in schools and colleges on cultivation of vegetables and fruits. A number of students visit his house to get a glimpse of the variety of fruits and vegetables grown by him. He said he had learnt gardening techniques through trial and error method.Terrace gardens keep the surroundings cool. For plant lovers who do not have space, terrace gardens give an aesthetic value to a house. It is a satisfying and invigorating experience. Moreover, its important to talk to plants to nurture them well. Hard work and patience is all what matters in terrace gardening, he explained."

This had made them to sow seeds of commercial crops.However the eluding of rains even after completion of one month of rainy season has made the growers to worry over the future of the crops. If rain fails, farmers will incur huge loss this year as well, said an onion grower.To cultivate onion on one acre land, the growers have to spend at least Rs 45,000 including sowing, removing weeds and applying fertilisers. A good yield can fetch at least 80 quintals of onion from one acre land. The lack of rainfall will, however, affect the yield per hectare.At present, the onion growers are dependent on borewell for irrigating the farm land. Onion plants have grown well in Nagenahalli, Biluvala, Maccheri, Chikkabasoor and other areas. Onion has been sown on 1,894 hectares in the taluk.According to horticulture department statistics, tomato is cultivated on 211 hectares land in Sakharayapattana hobli.

The price of tomato has shot up to Rs 70 per kg.The tomato is not cultivated in the district in a large scale to meet the demand of the district. As a result, the merchants purchase tomatoes from outside the district. This is also one of the reason for rise in price of tomatoes, said one of the consumer.The price of tomato has been raising since the last 20 days. From Rs 40 per kg, the price has increased to Rs 50 per kg and Rs 70 per kg. The price of beans (Rs 60 per kg), cauliflower (Rs 60 per kg), green peas (Rs 160 per kg), carrot (Rs 60 per kg), okra (Rs 40 per kg), capsicum (Rs 80 per kg), potato (Rs 40 per kg) too have increased. The prices of methi, pudina, corriander leaves and sabsige too have doubled.APMC Secretary Chandrashekar said, Owing to lack of rainfall, the tomato production has declined in the last three months. As a result, the arrival of vegetables to the APMC has reduced drastically. The onions arrive from plateau and Maharashtra and accordingly, the price of onions are under control.Lakhya, Sakharayapattana, Kadur, Kalasapura, Ambale where tomato, beans and other vegetables are grown in the district faced 1acute shortage of water in the last three months. This had an affect on the cultivation of vegetables. The region has been receiving rainfall in the last few weeks and the farmers have started cultivating vegetables. The harvest will reach within a month, said APMC former president S T Chandre Gowda.The price of vegetables have increased drastically. Instead of vegetables it is better to purchase one kg of chicken, said Jagadish, a resident of Market Road.The price of green chillies were Rs 100 to Rs 120 last week. However, the chillies have started coming to the markets in Chikkamagaluru from Hassan, Arakalagoodu, and Ramanathapura. As a result, the prices have come down to Rs 40 per kg this week, said vegetable vendor Jafar Saab."

Both the central and the state governments must seek reports from the horticultural and agricultural departments to rush to the rescue of the growers, the Raitha Sangha member demanded.Coconut trees have also been affected by diseases, causing a great loss to the growers and, hence, the government must initiate research towards finding a solution to the problem and providing compensation to the formers, the members said and demanded a compensation of Rs 35,000 for each dried up coconut tree.Speaking further on the matter, the farmers said, A coconut and areca board must be formed. The import of areca from Indonesia and Malaysia must be stopped. A support price of Rs 30 to Rs 40 must be provided to a coconut. A support price of Rs 20,000 should be fixed for per quintal of copra.They said that the central government itself must provide the premium towards Phasal Bima Yojana.

It may increase further, if there is any delay in pre-monsoon rains, fear vegetable vendors.

Except cucumber, many veggies witnessed 30 per cent hike.HOPCOMS authorities said, city receives vegetables from parts of Mysuru, Mandya, Hassan, Ramanagar and Chamarajanagar districts. As vegetables are in great demand in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, many major farmers transport their produce to the neighbouring states, they said.According to a vegetable vendor Kumar at Devaraja Market, drop in supply of vegetables is also one of the reasons for price hike. He said that in spite of high prices, there was demand for fruits like watermelon and muskmelon as people prefer their juice to beat soaring mercury levels.According to farmers, even though prices are almost double, they are not getting handsome returns owing to crop loss and unaffordable transportation charges.Ramesh, a farmer, who had brought a tempo load of tomato for sale at a ground near exhibition grounds in the city said, even though the prices are touching sky, farmers are not making windfall, owing to obvious crop loss and other expenses.

The vagaries of nature have already taken their toll.Earlier, farmers in the hinterland had struggled to save their crops. Now, they are struggling to sell the available crops, with the crash in price of farm produce.The price of vegetables have fallen in the region. Bhadravathi was the main market for the vegetables grown in Kadur till recently. Now, the vegetables are sold at Kadur APMC till 2 pm. Okra, brinjal, tomato, avarekai, cucumber and others are sold at wholesale price only.With the demonetisation of high value denomination currency, the farmers have faced inconvenience to some extent. Vegetable price varies if the farmers accept scrapped notes during the sale of crops or if they accept new currency. In spite of it, the price of crops received by the farmers is not even sufficient for the transportation of crops to the APMC.Farmers cultivating leafy vegetables like coriander, fenugreek and spinach, seem to have been left in the lurch as prices have crashed. The women in surrounding villages wake up at 3 am and pluck leafy vegetables and visit Kadur to sell them at KLV Circle.Instead of selling leafy vegetables in wholesale, it is better to sell them by visiting various streets, said the women engaged in selling vegetables. Though farmers get a meagre amount, the price of vegetables in vegetable shops are high.In the absence of a statutory body to regulate the prices of perishable crops, there is a need to explore the possibility of safeguarding the interests of farmers and consumers by eliminating the middlemen involved, said a farmer.On the other hand, there was a huge demand for the sale of watermelon in Kadur. Watermelon was sold for Rs 30 per kg."

They are in grave peril of losing their lives, he said.The delivery of food packages, which included rice, lentils and oil, came amid a growing international outcry over the increasing number of deaths from malnutrition in Madaya, which along with neighbouring Zabadani, is besieged by pro-government forces, including the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.The aid shipment there was being coordinated with a similar delivery to the northern Syrian towns of Fouaa and Kfarya in Idlib province, which are surrounded by Syrian insurgent groups.After a last-minute flurry of negotiations as the convoys idled at the entrances to the towns, trucks and sport utility vehicles began rolling in, Pawel Krzysiek, a spokesman for the Syria branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said by text message from Madaya. Unloading was expected to last through the night, he said on Twitter.Aid workers continued to unload the trucks in the dark, using flashlights and cellphone lights, since the town had no electricity.Crowds of hungry kids around, Sajjad Malik, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative for Syria said in a text message released by the agency. Its heartbreaking to see so many hungry people. Its cold and raining but there is excitement because we are here with food and blankets.Um Majid, a nurse at a field hospital, said the mother of a desperately ill 8-year-old girl begged relief workers to take her to a hospital in Damascus, but they said they could not.Khaled Mohammad, a nurse anesthetist working in a clinic in Madaya supported by Doctors Without Borders, said weak and collapsing patients had continued to pour in to the health centre as people gathered to receive the aid, which he said included fava beans, sugar, hummus and canned tomatoes.OBrien said that getting the 400 people out of Madaya could be as complicated as getting the aid in. Negotiations would be conducted with the government of President Bashar Assad and other armed groups for guarantees that ambulances would become targets.Despite the arrival of the aid, and plans for new peace talks on January 25 in Geneva, spasms of violence continued on Monday, with an airstrike on a school killing at least a dozen children.UN diplomats and international aid officials welcomed news of the delivery, but coupled it with a plea for unimpeded access as international law requires. One convoy will not solve the problem, said Stphane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.For months, aid to Madaya and Zabadani has been the subject of delicate negotiations toward an agreement known as the four-towns pact. Under the agreement, some aid was delivered in October, and last month, several hundred wounded fighters and their families were evacuated.Since then, plans for more aid and evacuations have stalled, and malnutrition has worsened in Madaya, where, according to interviews with a dozen residents as well as with humanitarian workers assisting a clinic there, people have been collapsing of hunger as they try to subsist on things like grass soup.Madaya is controlled by Syrian insurgents, mainly affiliated with an Islamist group called Ahrar al-Sham, which has been the main interlocutor with Hezbollah and its patron Iran in talks to reach cease-fires to help the towns.Five people died of suspected malnutrition in Madaya on Sunday alone, bringing the total since the beginning of December to 28, according to medics at the Doctors Without Borders clinic.Nisrine, a schoolteacher trapped in Madaya who for safety reasons asked that her surname not be used, said she and her son, Abdullah, 10, were waiting eagerly for the aid but that she was sure it would not last long.Nisrine said two people, an adult and a child, died there Monday even as the convoy was approaching. Samer Rajab, an activist helping in the aid effort said three people had died in Madaya and a third in Zabadani. People are exhausted, Nisrine said. They cant even go to wait for the trucks. Theres not much time. The food should be distributed today.The siege of Madaya, which is surrounded by land mines, snipers and barbed wire, is only the latest that Syrians have endured  despite Security Council resolutions insisting on the unconditional delivery of aid across front lines.Cut off from the worldThe UN says that 400,000 Syrians are in besieged areas or in areas that are hard to reach, with the largest number, 200,000, trapped by Islamic State militants in the east. Nearly 200,000 are penned in by the government and allied forces and several thousand more by Syrian insurgent groups, mainly in Fouaa and Kfarya.The convoys on Monday included deliveries from UNICEF and the World Food Program-me, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the local Red Cross affiliate that takes part in all international aid convoys in Syria. The World Food Programme has said it planned to bring enough food to feed 40,000 in Madaya and 20,000 in Fouaa and Kfarya for a month.Hezbollah, in statements last week, accused insurgent forces in Madaya of hoarding food. The statements also accused the insurgents of not allowing civilians to leave. And on Monday afternoon, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jaafari denounced what he called efforts to defame his government with reports of starvation deaths in Madaya.He offered two seemingly contradictory explanations. He said the images were fabricated, citing a photograph of one child who he said was Lebanese, not Syrian. He also said aid delivered to Madaya had been stolen by terrorist groups and sold to civilians at prices they could not afford.Terrorists are stealing humanitarian assistance, al-Jaafari told reporters outside the Security Council chambers.OBrien, however, said UN officials could see for themselves the extent of hunger. There has been very severe malnourishment. Theres severe shortage of food and we have reports of people who are either starving or indeed have starved and died, he said. As for Abdullah, Nisrine said that he fell asleep before he received any food: He got tired and disappointed while waiting, the trucks arrived so late."

One of the largest vegetable markets in Sector 26, wears a deserted look as the number of customers has come down drastically. There is a big fall in the price of green vegetables because off-take by vendors has come down substantially. Due to this reason, vegetable growers (farmers) have been hit hard. The price of cauliflower in the wholesale market has come down to Rs 200-250 per quintal from Rs 1,500-2,000 a quintal during the past 10 days, says Paramjit Singh, a vegetable grower from Jangpura village.WATCH VIDEO: How Demonetisation Impacts Rural PopulationThe business has taken a serious hit since the announcement of the decision to invalidate Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Customers have virtually vanished from the market. The business in the market has come down to 20 per cent as of now. There is no money in the market with the people and with me as well to do business, said Hari Om, a commission agent in the market.Similarly, small vendors say the sales have gone down.Consumers have cut down on buying vegetables and other stuff. The price of green coriander was around Rs 20 per small packet but now 2 packets of coriander fetch Rs 10, said a seller, Ravi.Tomato, which used to be around Rs 40 per kg, is now Rs 20 per kg, spinach which used to be Rs 20 per bundle now costs Rs 10 for two bundles and mustard leaves have come down from Rs 20 to Rs 25 per bundle to Rs 10. Another small vendor, Ashok said, Today, we are seeing some customers, perhaps because it is Sunday. Otherwise, for the past 5-6 days there were no buyers. Before the demonetisation, Ashok used to sell fruits worth Rs 8,000 daily but now the sale has come down toRs 2,000.

The procurement price of cabbage which was Rs.15 per kg last month was down to Rs. 5 per kg on Friday while beans, which had a purchase price of Rs. 40 per kg, crashed to be sold at Rs. 8 per kg. R. Chandrappa, a wholesale dealer at the APMC yard in Mysuru, said that the bulk of tomatoes used to be procured by buyers in Maharashtra and other places for use in food processing units for preparation of jams or sauce but the demand was low since the last 30 days. Consequently it has resulted in supply exceeding demand and the prices have crashed, he said.Tomato is widely cultivated in and around Mysuru but mainly in Jayapura hobli of Mysuru district besides H.D. Kote, Hullahalli, Yelwal, and K.R. Nagar while Nagamangala is another tomato growing centre according to Raitha Sangha leader Badagalapura Nagendra.The crop is also cultivated in Gundlupet and surrounding areas but the farmers there are insulated from local glut in production and price crash as the bulk of their produce is sourced by traders in bordering Kerala.Failure to develop cold storage facilities for perishable commodities and lack of access to market in distant places due to poor connectivity besides absence of market information was hampering the farmers from getting a good price for their produce, said Mr. Nagendra.He and other farmers demanded support price for horticultural produce to help bail out the cultivators in times of crisis."

My niece sounds excited when she calls me in the morning. We havent seen each other in months and have a lot of catching up to do. The coffee house in my neighbourhood across a womens college is a favourite haunt for students. I do not know if it is the loud music or the avant-garde artwork on the walls thats the draw, but within a week of its opening, the place was packed with perky young people.As I wait for my niece at the coffee house, I remember the first time I brought my parents here. My dad placed his walking stick near the vacant table at the entrance and looked around. There was a hint of a smile on his face and then he sat down. Dad was a man of few words while mom made up for the lack of them. This doesnt seem very... Moms voice trailed into a whisper as she caught my eye. And this was before we saw the prices on the menu. The parents wondered aloud why I was paying so much for a cup of coffee.Shortly, a sullen waiter served us some snacks along with coffee that tasted like sawdust. The darshini down the road serves better coffee and costs nearly a third less, the parents grumbled. I fervently prayed that no one had heard their comments. Later, when I paid the bill, my dad decried, This is the last time Im setting foot in this place!The darshini down the road from my house holds its own as it caters to different age groups. Its a family favourite. Often the dosas made at home get vetoed down in its favour. For the uninitiated, the place is a hole in the wall  nothing fancy yet it gives a homely feeling once you walk in. The dilapidated walls and the standing-room only space do not deter the regulars or even newbies from venturing in.The aroma of freshly-made decoction coffee vies with the smell of butter emanating from the benne dosa. The slice of tomato served as a dressing on top of the khara bath is waived off as an eccentricity as the dish itself stirs up the senses with its texture, colour and taste. The servers greet the customers with a smile. While the regulars are given a familiar nod, the absentees are given an earful for not frequenting the place.As I nurse my bitter coffee now, I notice my niece step inside the coffee house. She heads my way after exchanging a brief smile with the person behind the counter. The moment she sits down, shes on a rant about fickle friends, absent-minded professors and difficult parents. Please dont give me advice  I just need you to listen, she insists. I am hard-pressed not to retort, How on earth can I hear the words coming out of your lips in this din?The rock music playing in the background has become louder and I feel the remnants of a headache coming on. But I continue to smile at her, secretly yearning for that cup of coffee and benne dosa at the good old darshini a few blocks away. Ah, the things we do for familial affection."

They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."

The evening was free so we went to the Vadakkanathan Temple. After that we sat on a stone bench under a large and spreading tree. The gentle breeze and the serene atmosphere did much to soothe the spirit.Lakshmi was in a mood to reminisce. She spoke at length about the good old school, where she was a boarder and didnt have a care in the world. She recalled the ruses she and her friends used to wrangle permission from the warden to go shopping or watch a movie always escorted by a senior boarder, of course. Sometimes, the senior turned out to be stricter than the warden! After a lengthy pause in the conversation, Lakshmi slid off the bench and said, You know what? I am hungry. She sounded as if she had made a major discovery. So we flagged an auto and returned to the hotel we were staying at. We headed straight to the restaurant where an attentive waiter seated us and stood by to take our order. I placed my order and so did Lakashmi. As an afterthought, she asked for salad as well. The pleasant-mannered, cheerful youth was only too eager to oblige. With the air of a magician producing a rabbit out of a hat, he put the plate of salad on the table. It looked impressive with slices of tomato, cucumber and carrot artistically arranged on a lettuce base with a mound of shredded cabbage in the centre. Looks tempting, doesnt it? asked Lakshmi. If you insist, I smiled. (I never touch salad outside the home.) She turned to the waiter.Dont you have onion? she enquired. He blinked in puzzlement. So Lakshmi repeated the question. He still looked uncomprehending. Lakshmi hails from Kerala so I suggested she speak in Malayalam. She saw the sense of that and asked, Onion undoe? Enlightenment dawned and pat came the answer. Illa. (No) was the very short and very sweet answer.Why? demanded Lakshmi, lapsing into English. Her voice held a hint of irritation. The waiter literally wrung his hands in confusion. Ari illa. (Dont know.)Then, as if inspired, he added, Chechi undu. (Have an older sister.) Aniyan pronounced like onion means younger brother in Malayalam. I had a tough time keeping a straight face. Malayalam, Lakshmi, I prompted. She did switch to her mother tongue then. And bingo! The waiter nodded and hastened away to bring the smelly bulb!"
59042b017be9e02646bdca3b,Being Buddha,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584908/being-buddha.html,2016-12-05,,Deccan Herald,"LEELA RAMASWAMY, Dec 05, 2016: 9:43 ISTA man, trying to uncover the mystique surrounding Buddha, asked him, 'Are you a god?' 'No,' he answered. 'Are you an angel or a prophet?' he went on. 'I am neither' came the answer. 'Then what are you?' And the Buddha replied, 'I am awake.'Buddha's answer may sound simple and even trite, but the word 'awake' stands for much more than its opposite, 'asleep'. It has a significance, which is both penetrating and profound.In our ordinary waking state, we may well be engaged in some daytime activity and yet fail to be fully awake. This happens when we lack command over our thoughts, words and actions. We then function much like automatons.Feelings of fear, anger, depression and even love can so overwhelm us as to make us slaves of our emotions. There are many examples and here are a few.Children often tell lies for fear of punishment. If the problem is not handled and solved wisely, they can turn into habitual liars. Anger can stoke unreasonable behaviour. Handled inappropriately, it can lead to fruitless arguments, physical fights that can result in death. Many murders are committed in a fit of fury. When anger is turned inwards, it becomes depression.A depressed person can turn away from all activity, whether good or bad. The person may even need medical help in order to emerge out of it. Even love, when bestowed wrongly, is harmful. A common example is the mother who pampers and indulges her child making him an unpleasant and demanding individual. We see now the great need to be fully awake and aware. It is only then that we can control the powerful impulses human nature is heir to.There is another important reason why we ought to be alert and aware. We think with our conscious minds. Whatever we habitually think of sinks down into the subconscious, the seat of creativity. If we think of good, then good will follow.If one thinks of evil, then evil is what will follow. The mind, we must remember, is a sacred enclosure into which nothing enters without permission. To quote Buddha again, ' A wise person is one who has a calm and steady mind, who is alert and who is free from fear.'"

At that instant, my mind subliminally started juxtaposing yet another lunch experience, to find a stark contrast, wherein I was invited sometime back with few others.So on that day, as I stepped in there, I saw the invitees, sunk in some soft conversations, skimming through sundry topics. The hostess, oblivious to the happenings around, was ambidextrously knitting a woollen sweater. And, the host was poring over the display screen of his sleek mobile phone, spewing out the comments for his latest updates on FB. The fact that the house was decked out in exquisite wall-hangings, exotic objets-d'art, enchanting faux flowers, all faded into utter insignificance amidst this uber inhospitality. None of the invitees seemed to enjoy the seemingly scrumptious food, sumptuously laid on the table.Apparently, with people today being inextricably caught in an immensely busy life, we are turning more and more like automatons, mechanically executing our everyday mundane tasks.No wonder, with severe time drought, the spirit of hospitality seems to be slowly losing its significance. Interestingly, even the invites for social functions, at times, are sent in a rather clinical/ frosty manner via SMS, (unlike in the earlier times, wherein people invited guests with the intent of genuinely wanting/valuing their presence).But today, at some of the family get-togethers, leave alone making guests feel important/ special, the hosts even fail to acknowledge their presence. And, once the guests are seated, often we see the host launching on a self-aggrandisement drive, expatiating on his/her recent achievements or acquisitions, without realising the guests would care two hoots to these insipid, mindless info.Still worse is when the host thrusts on your lap that family photo album, giving graphic description of each picture clamped in it. Equally worse is when the host holds horrendous monologues, dishing out dreary details about deadly exploits of their dear grand/kids. And, after all these ordeal endured by you, the time you are bidding adieu to the host, leave alone waiting near their house gate till you are out of eyeshot, the moment you cross the threshold, the door is slammed shut.Indeed, 'good hospitality' is synonymous with high comfort levels that we offer to the guests to the extent of making them forget whether they are at their place or ours. It also reflects on the host's upbringing, since it speaks a ton about how much the host is refined, polished and cultured in his/her attitude/ manners. These apart, speaking spiritually, it's believed, when the guests leave our home precincts with happy hearts, our punya quotient too would escalate exponentially. Yes, ""Athithi devo bhava!"""

But the many perversions of a Soviet-style economy fed by inefficient cooperatives and state-owned farms mean that the record arrival of visitors seems to have literally snatched the staples off ordinary Cubans plates. Once the collapse of the Soviet Union left the country ill-equipped to purchase fertilisers, animal feed, machinery, etc, a situation worsened by the US trade embargo, the Cuban government focused on organic agriculture. That has been greener but not more profitable, appetizing or plentiful.Azam Ahmed reports in NYT that, Tourists are quite literally eating Cubas lunch. Thanks in part to the United States embargo, but also to poor planning by the islands government, goods that Cubans have long relied on are going to well-heeled tourists and the hundreds of private restaurants that cater to them, leading to soaring prices and empty shelves.As onions, peppers, tomatoes, pineapples, limes, beer and soda rise beyond ordinary Cubans reach President Ral Castro has moved to capping agricultural prices. But as Ahmed points out, scapegoating middlemen does little to provide good, affordable produce for Cubans. Scapegoating the restaurants that have mushroomed to cater to tourists would be similarly wrongheaded. Its a supply side problem which can only be solved by encouraging not discouraging enterprise. Socialist policies discouraging profit have already taken a terrible toll on the economy; more of the same shall only worsen the countrys food insecurity.Meanwhile Irina Pino writes in the Havana Times, A psychological state has been created in poor people in Cuba so that they can do without so many things and hate consumerism like they would an infernal machine. In a mind game that demonetization has made so familiar here too, the act of queuing up for hours for food and basic items has been elevated as a virtue. But the grip of the mind game is loosening. Scarcity cannot remain a convincing virtue forever."

Today, the Air Quality Index is 310 and it states, Avoid outdoor activity. So I merrily unlace my shoes and collapse on the couch.7am: The prodigal son is heading off to school and asks, You are still here, what about your run? We had a deal! Munching on the leftovers from the babys breakfast, I add, I invoke the Force Majeure clause that clearly states a party is not liable to perform its obligations as a result of Acts of God including fire or other natural disaster. Not having decent air to breathe counts as a man-made disaster if not quite a natural one. And my foot is also aching a bit!Anyway, I just read an article in Time magazine about how even injured people can burn calories. Chewing, they say, also counts as exercise  15 calories an hour if you keep at it!He sniggers, Mom your foot only hurts because you constantly keep putting it in your mouth! And have you figured how many calories you will end up consuming in an hour?I snap, What am I, Aryabhata to do all these calculations early in the morning? Mind your business and go to school.10.30am: Scrolling through my phone on the way to the office, I stumble on the news that to instill committed patriotism and nationalism, the Supreme Court has now ordered all cinema halls to play the national anthem and folks are obliged to stand up and show respect to the same.Now, I am admittedly one of those barmy women who get teary-eyed during our national anthem and bellow it out as loudly as we can, much to the embarrassment of our children.I have even gone on a tour to the Wagah border where, along with the 200 people sitting beside me, I too screamed myself hoarse with Jai Hind and Bharat Mata Ki Jai competing vigorously with the Pakistanis raising their slogans across the border, because not having variable parameters to judge nationalism, we seem to simply define it by volume, hoping the loudest wins.But I still cant wrap my head around how and why I am obliged to feel patriotic when I have merely booked tickets for Befikre, and am about to see Ranveer Singh in his tight red underwear.2pm: Tucking into some biryani with an old friend, I tell her about the Supreme Courts order and she sighs, This nationalism fever is contagious. My husband has suddenly become so patriotic that whenever the national anthem plays, even on television, he drops everything and immediately stands up.I giggle, Perhaps you should count yourself lucky. Now, you wont have to dress up as a nurse or a skanky French maid, just get into your bedroom, and play Jana Gana Mana on your iPhone.She squeals, You have such a twisted mind, gross!I reply, Everyone is mixing nationalism and sex. Im just making jokes but Shree Maruti Herbal is advertising its Stay On pill with a tagline that says: Think demonetization, think Stay OnIts not a bitter pill. Its a power capsule. Watch with pride the emergence of Super Power- the India!She laughs, Yuck, I prefer the anthem idea.I reply,  Err..On second thought, the anthem only lasts for 52 seconds. I have another suggestion  swallow the bitter pill called demonetization, forget about cash on delivery to conceal evidence of your purchase and just buy a vibrator with your credit card.6pm: A straw hat perched jauntily on my head, I am helping the baby dig holes to plant sweet pepper and tomato seeds. We have begun working on our little vegetable patch and kitchen compost, though getting my building society to agree to composting seems a slightly trickier proposition.My phone pings with an email from the friend who is helping us set up, You convinced your building to go ahead? Dont know why composting isnt mandatory! It turns 200 kg of waste into 20 kg of rich compost which means less landfill waste and incineration, significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They should at least give municipal tax benefits to societies who shift to composting. Everyone will switch once the government dangles this carrot.I type back using a rather unoriginal veggie pun, I am trying and perhaps you are right about this carrot incentive because as things stand right now, most of my neighbours dont carrot all.And wondering why respecting our national anthem seems so much more important than respecting our land, I put my phone away and go back to planting a few more seeds before the sun sets."

Money doesnt make you laugh when you are lonely, or make you full of contentment on a New Year. But wherever you are, you have to work for your living, she added.So, do you think that a lottery win would make you happy forever? No, a big payout wont make that much of a difference. Winning the lottery isnt a ticket to true happiness, however enticing it might be to imagine never working again and being able to afford anything you want.It seems that as long as you cannot afford to avoid the basic miseries of life, having loads of spare cash doesnt make you very much happier.Our happiness depends on how we feel relative to our peers.Lottery win may make you feel richer than your neighbours. You may move to a new mansion in a new locality, which may make you feel happy. But, sooner, you will realize that all your new friends are living in bigger mansions.Happiness isnt a quality like height, weight or income that can be easily measured. It is a complex, nebulous state that is fed by transient simple pleasures, as well as the more sustained rewards of activities.Actually, happiness is having satisfaction and meaning in your life. Its the propensity to feel positive emotions, and holding a sense of purpose. Happiness is not having a lot of privilege or money. Its not a constant pleasure. Its a broader thing: Our ability to connect with others, to have meaningful relationships, to have a better community. People who say theyre happy have strong connections and communications with other people  that is a sort of recipe for happiness. Money increases happiness until about a certain level of earning, and after that our emotional well-being doesnt increase with income.Close circle of friends and family is most important for happiness. The material possessions like iPhones, computers, being wealthy and owning a sports car will not provide the same level of contentment.So, to sum up, true happiness lies in rewarding relationships, and not in material wealth and money."

Of baguettes and bistros,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ooh-la-la-of-baguettes-and-bistros/,2016-07-27,,The Times Of India,"It is a perfect summer day in Paris. The sky is a perfect cerulean blue, the trees are a vibrant green and the streets are full of happy people dressed in a symphony of colour. As I stride down the Avenue des Champs-lyses, I joyously break out into an old Maurice Chevalier song from the movie Can Can, I love Paris every moment. After one horrified look at me yodelling away, the family nimbly hops it over to the other side of the road, keeping a safe distance from the warbler with the non-musical prowess.We have been in France for the last few weeks for the Euro Cup tournament and now that it is over, we can finally get down to business: the art of fine dining in Paris. However, this time I am discovering something entirely different: While Paris may not be the melting pot that its sister cities New York and London are, what makes this city so special is the outdoor cafes which come alive in spring and summer. Between casual strolls along the river Seine and visits to the numerous cultural offerings in the City of Light, a good way to soak in the local scenery and sun is to eat at one of the thousands of pavement cafes across the city.As the temperature rises into the pleasant 70s, Parisians head to their favourite cafes to while away the day on a sunny pavement terrace. These cafes can range from a landmark locale to a small hole-in-the-wall noshery. Tiny rows of tables facing the street under gaily patterned umbrellas are overflowing with chattering, smoking Parisians, all occupying every corner in every square. With an astonishing number of cafs at which to park yourself and enjoy the City Of Lights anything-but-pedestrian (couldnt help that pun!) culinary offerings, the hangouts du jour are those with bustling crowds, and the best vantage points for scoping the latest Parisian trends.And these outdoor cafes serve everything, from the ubiquitous croissant to more elaborate culinary meals like ducks filet candied in cider and served with a side of grated potatoes. As we roam around the city, I eat a number of meals at these cafes. A staple food on the menu is the croquet-monsieur, a deliciously oozy and crisp grilled ham and cheese sandwich splashed with just a touch of Bchamel sauce. If you are an egg-lover, get the croque-madame, which adds a fried egg on top. Or there is the Jambon beurre, which is a fresh half-baguette, lavishly smeared with cool butter and garnished with jambon de Paris, a pink-hued cooked ham, served with optional cornichons or pickled cucumbers.As we settle down at a caf on a beautiful spot overlooking the Notre Dame and the River Seine near the Latin Quarter, I decide to show-off by ordering my meal in French. Je voudrai une glace deau avec une salade Caesar, I say primly in my best college-level French. After a moments hesitation, the hostess, a pretty French girl, says kindly, Madame, you just ordered an ice cream of water. I think you mean un verre deau. As the rest of the table collapses into titters, I say with as much dignity as I can muster, Oui oui, cest vrai glowering at my fluent Spanish-speaking boys.Another day, tired after fighting the hordes inside the massive Louvre and a bit miffed at Mona Lisas know-it-all smirk, we decide to re-energize at the nearby Caf Ruc on the Rue Rivoli. The H has ordered a layered fruit and veggie salad combined with a yogurt dressing and served beautifully in a jar. The older son is savouring his Blanc de Volaille Provenale (or chicken breast marinated in a thick sauce of tomatoes, garlic and olive oil) served on a bed of fresh tagliatelle pasta and the Foodie is about to launch into an artfully constructed club sandwich with homemade frites or fries. As for me, I sip on my glass of Merlot and do what Parisians do best on a lovely summers day: unabashedly eavesdrop on conversations around the cafe, while watching the world go by!"

We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."
5904751e7be9e04154df7311,The culture of continental breakfast in Delhi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/priyali-prakash-blog/the-culture-of-continental-breakfast-in-delhi/,2016-06-06,,The Times Of India,"Lets face the truth  majority of Delhiites are not known to be early-risers, especially during the weekends. However, the concept of meeting friends over breakfast instead of evening coffee or a round of drinks or late dinners is fast-catching up.While a place like the All American Diner is a front-runner when it comes to breaking fast early in the morning, a lot of new places, like the quaint little Tonnino or the student-friendly Big Yellow Door are coming up with quirky ways to attract customers and are quite successful too. And now, we have a new player in the fray in the form of our good ol Hard Rock Cafe.While the idea of a place, dedicated to jamming to rock music on evenings, serving breakfast sounds a little queer, HRC has tried hard to break out of its stereotyped image to diversify into something as challenging as a breakfast buffet.The factor that sets HRC buffet apart from others is that this is not a regular feature for the cafe, and has been conceptualised to be a speciality for days that have international sporting events, the telecast time of which coincides with the local breakfast time.The inclusion of parathas as the only Indian option seems more like an attempt to fit into the breakfast for all bracket, particularly for the Indian crowd, when the chef claims to have hand-picked an otherwise continental array of choices.Chef Brijesh tells us that the menu, which mostly comprises continental items, was designed keeping in mind the kind of crowd HRC generally attracts based on its brand value.The eggs-on-order live station was perhaps the best part of the HRC breakfast buffet. A choice of omelettes, fried eggs, scrambled eggs and akuri cooked to perfection, with add-on vegetables including onions and tomatoes as well as bacon, is just what was needed to lift up the spirits of this buffet.Coming to the continental choices too, the menu is pretty plain and simple. Bacon and sausages, baked beans, pancakes with maple syrup and honey and hash browns, along with choices of cereals, breads and fruits are the regulars on most breakfast buffets these days.While bacon and sausages were processed foods and tasted like they would at any regular eatery, pancakes were made in-house. The bite-sized pancakes were airy but dry and a tad bit too salty.Sauted vegetables were a good option for the vegetarians. A mix of bell peppers and broccoli tossed in olive oil and flavoured with oregano and a hint of basil was refreshing.Talking of refreshing, while the assorted fruits included beautifully cut water melons, musk melons and papayas, canned juices were a bit of a let-down since one would generally expect a breakfast buffet to be serving fresh juices.All in all, the breakfast buffet at HRC for Rs 899(AI) seems like a good deal but one would generally picture himself or herself having breakfast in a more naturally well-lit setting that is synonymous with the freshness and spirit of mornings rather than the dimly-lit Hard Rock Cafe that plays loud music and has an ever-persistent alcohol-infused air."
590494677be9e04154df8c94,The babble about bagels,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/the-babble-about-bagels/,2016-06-17,,The Times Of India,"Whats round, has a hole, is packed full of carbs and can be had at any time of the day or night? If you answered a donut, you just landed yourself a lemon!The answer is the Bagel, that chewy crusty bread, with dollops of cream cheese inside, making it a carb-laden delicious mouthful in every bite. Both the donut and the bagel are best-selling comfort foods but while the sweet donut is essentially a breakfast item, its savory cousin bagel is an all-day comfort food, especially if there are plenty of great toppings to go along with the soft and doughy inside.So now I am back in New York where the locals pride on two things: their pizza and their bagels. So familiar is this food to New Yorkers that a number of episodes of the popular series Suits revolve around conversations that the two protagonists Harvey Specter and Michael Ross have around bagel carts.What is this wonder bread anyway? According to popular belief, bagels date back to 1783, when they were created to honor King John III Sobieski of Poland, after he protected Austrias people from an attack by Turkish invaders. As the story goes, an Austrian baker created the bagel in the shape of a stirrup to honor the horseman king, and named it a beugel (the Austrian word for stirrup). The beugel quickly gained popularity throughout Eastern Europe, and, over time, the bagel evolved into a circular shape with a hole in the middle. The round bread first came to the US with immigrants through the portals of Ellis Island in the late 1800s. And even now, most of the popular bagel shops are on the Lower East Side where the early immigrants made their tenement homes.My New York morning usually starts with an early morning sprint to my favorite bagel shop to catch the first batch of freshly baked bagels. Baked did I say? Wrong! Because the bagel is the only bread that is boiled before baking it. Once the bagel dough is shaped into a circle, it is dipped in boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. After that, the bread is drained and baked for about 10 minutes. And that hole in the center is not just for looks! The bagel hole comes in handy to thread multiple bagels onto a dowel, making it very convenient for street vendors transporting and selling the doughy delights.Over the years the bagel has moved from its humble plain doughy self to the most designer bagels that the mind can possibly conceive. So there are the onion, garlic, rye , poppy seed bagels which are jostling for space in bagel shops with their more exotic versions ranging from cinnamon raisin bagel to the pumpernickel to the sun-dried tomato bagel. For those with more adventurous palates there are flavors like blueberry and the French Toast. I have tried these flavors and sworn never to go near these wannabes again. Some mash-ups are fun like the pumpernickel or the sesame bagel. But while French toasts are yum and bagels are awesome, marrying those two together is like The Odd Couple!New York is famous for its bagels, but there is something about the way they are served that annoys many New Yorkers. Bagel shops in the city often slather enormous amount of cream cheese on each bagel they serve, making it a royal gooey mess to eat. Most bagel lovers, including me, find that amount of cream cheese overwhelming and feel that it detracts from the taste of the bagel itself. So my first instinct when I buy my bagel: scrape off that excess.The traditionally accepted amount of cream cheese that is appropriate for a bagel is a schmear. That is a relatively small amount that is just enough to enhance the flavor and texture of a bagel. The cream cheese is meant to complement the taste of the bagel, not to overpower it. Like bagel, cream cheese has matured over the years to complement the bread. So even the most ordinary bagel shop will boast a plethora of cream cheese offerings from the plain-Jane Philadelphia cream cheese to more exotic ones like jalapeno asado, tofu cream cheese, horseradish and pickle, and all the combinations in between.So here I am on my first day in New York, sprinting down to my favorite bagel shop only to discover dozens of patrons already in line ahead of me. I am accompanied by my older son, The Health Nut, who is a big advocate of Bagel-on-the-go, the New Yorkers attempt to assuage a guilty conscience at eating so many carbs at breakfast. It is essentially a plain bagel with bacon, eggs and your choice of cream cheese. When its my turn, I ask for a sesame seed bagel with wasabi cream cheese on the side.As my son and I stroll back to our apartment clutching our prizes, I wonder how long before I am asking for a garlic naan bagel with tandoori masala cream cheese!"
590494a57be9e04154df8ceb,Why are Bengalis so crazy about the Durga puja?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-n-style/why-are-bengalis-so-crazy-about-the-durga-puja/,2016-10-03,,The Times Of India,"A north Indian friend asked me recently,  why are all Bongs so crazy about Durga Puja? Yes its so obvious that Bongs are crazy about Durga Puja. As a Bengali I can say Durga Puja is just awesome. So there are ample reasons to be crazy about it.It isnt just an event that brings the city of Kolkata to a halt. Durga Puja is a festival that brings people together all across India. The fun, food and the fervour that Durga Puja brings is something that cant be replicated. The entire city turns into a beautiful dreamland of joy and togetherness.Its no secret that Bengalis are foodies. And Durga Puja is a prime example. While other people celebrate Navratra by fasting every day, Bengalis totally have the time of their lives, eating fish fries, mutton rolls and mughlai paratha. And also fish curry is a must. Fasting is restricted to daytime, till pushpanjali. Our Gods are pretty adjusting about this stuff.Food stalls at literally every corner serving a variety of mouthwatering dishes right from cutlet to rosogolla and people gorging on them like theres no tomorrow.Perhaps one of the best thing about Durga Puja is the bhog that is being served. It usually consists of khichudi, alur dom, papad, tomato chutney and rosogolla.Then comes dhaak and dhunuchi dance. This is just not a ritual dance, it is more of a merriment. As a part of everyday aarti, men and women with dhaaks create an ambience of celebration and sheer happiness. Adults and kids alike can be seen dancing with the perfect rhythm and enthusiasm which is almost infectious.Undoubtedly the most emotional moment for all in Durga Puja is bhasan or immersion when every Bong bid adieu to maa Durga and chant asche bochor abar hobe, which means ma Durga will visit us next year as well. Dashami or the tenth day is marked with a ceremony known as shidur khela (playing with sindur) where married women apply vermilion to each others faces as also to Goddess Durga dressed in the traditional Bengali attire.Last but not the least, immersion or bisarjan at the end of the Durga Puja festival is like parting with a member of the family after five days of praying, feasting and merry-making. Actually, Durga puja isnt just about taking part in the rituals, but more about feeling the pulse of the celebration."
590495167be9e04154df8d94,Food prices will keep interest rates sticky,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/food-prices-will-keep-interest-rates-sticky/,2016-06-17,,The Times Of India,"The recent increase in the prices of basic food items such as tomato and pulses will influence the interest rates of banks. Banks are now unlikely to lower interest rates on their loans in a meaningful way. And this will happen regardless of what Reserve Bank of India might want.Since February, food inflation has been increasing which, in turn, has pushed up the overall level of inflation.Food inflation in terms of retail prices, or CPI, was 5.4% in February. By end May, it had increased to 7.5%. Consequently, the overall level of inflation increased from 4.9% to 6.1%.During this period, RBI has taken steps to lower the interest rates banks charge on loans. RBI has tried to achieve it through a combination of a cut in rates and liquidity measures, or by making more money available to banks. Even now, RBIs policy is in an accommodative phase.However, accommodation may not help banks beyond a point. They rely mainly on deposits to raise money for onward lending. This means that the key to reducing interest rate on loans is to first bring down the deposit rates.In an interview to Mint, State Bank of Indias Chief Arundhati Bhattacharya explained this point.On bank lending rates, there are 3-4 reasons why there is a problem. In India, 97% of the sourcing is from deposits. So, when a repo rate (rate at which RBI lends money to banks) change happens, only 3% is impacted by the cost of funds reduction.As long as deposit holders feel the rate at which prices of everyday consumption items such as food is rising fast, they are unlikely to settle for lower deposit rates. Over the last year, banks have been able to lower deposit rates faster than lending rates. Interest rates offered by banks on fixed deposits of more than one year duration has been brought down by one percentage point, while the base rate for loans has come down by less than half the amount.Therefore, given the extent of decrease in deposit rates over the last year, banks might not find too many takers if they try to reduce deposit rates in the present environment.You cannot take bank interest rates very sharply down, you will lose your deposit franchise, said Bhattacharya.Had banks been profitable, they may have been in a position to push down lending rates. But the large extent of bad loans on their books rules out the possibility.We are in for a spell of sticky interest rates."

Those words, however, were uttered in Jaipur and not in Delhi.Speaking to NRIs during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in Jaipur on January 8, 2012, the then PM was talking about global recession and how India managed to steer through it. He was trying to reassure the NRIs (potential investors) that India was facing difficult times but its economic fundamentals were strong and constitutional institutions were robust.From global issues he moved on to domestic ones and spoke about soaring inflation that had dampened the image of his government. Speaking all through in English, he said, Latest data shows food inflation turned negative for the first time in six years fuelling expectations that it would help in moderating overall inflation which currently stands over 9%.To further emphasize his point, Manmohan Singh enthusiastically uttered those golden words, Ab acche din aaney waley hain. While saying so, little did he know that Gujarat CM Narendra Modi would pick his words and turn the tables on him the next day.On January 9, Modi addressed the NRIs that included steel tycoon LN Mittal. The hall was overcrowded and security forces had to forcefully close the gates. Modi in his usual style started off with unverified examples on how he made Gujarat a template of success. Pointing to Mittal, loquacious Modi even went on to mention that tomatoes and ladyfinger that he eats in London were produced in Gujarat.Intention of Modi, however, was not solely to impress the global Indians. With general elections that were scheduled in April 2014, he wanted to box the UPA-II government at every possible platform.Speaking of the then upcoming Lok Sabha polls, Modi said Yesterday our PM told you that acche din anney waley hain and then took a pause. With making perfect pitch he dropped his googly and with trademark smirk he added, haan mein bhi kehta hoon ki ab jald hi acche din anney waley hain.Amid feverish chanting of Modi Modi, the then Gujarat CM had made a remark which Gadkari now feels has stuck in BJPs throat.That very moment Modi must have realized that he has got one of the election punchlines that captures the mood of the nation. Clinging on it and presenting it as his own, Modi revolved his speeches with promises on bringing acche din. Gadkari only showed the reality when he said acche din kabhi nahi attey."
59049f1f7be9e04154df96ec,"Umrikan vs Angrezi: Why Donald Trump has trouble understanding us, and vice versa",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/umrikan-vs-angrezi-why-donald-trump-has-trouble-understanding-us-and-vice-versa/,2016-05-06,,The Times Of India,"Referring to Indian call centres which respond to queries from customers in the US, Americas would-be president Donald Trump has said that he has trouble understanding Indians when they speak. This is understandable.Because we Indians, call centre workers or others, speak English, or Angrezi. Whereas Donald, like his fellow citizens, speaks Americanese, or Umrikan, as we call it. It is this language barrier which makes it difficult for Americans to understand us, and for us to understand them.So when Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to the US next month  his fourth visit since assuming office  hed do well to take a refresher course in Umrikan boli.For instance, when he meets someone who says Howdy to him, he should not address that person as Howdyji, assuming that to be his  or her  name. In Umrikan, Howdy is not a persons name, but a greeting, like our Namaste, and is an abbreviated version of the Angrezi How do you do?Similarly, the phrase So long expressed by someone taking your leave is not an enquiry of measurement as to the length of an unspecified object  nor even the breadth measurement of anything, including a 56-inch chest  but the Umrikan equivalent of Bye, bye.On being offered a termayter sandwich, the PM should not suspect that he is being induced to eat some taboo non-veggie substance, possibly the flesh of gau mata, but is being asked to tuck into an innocuous preparation involving the use of a harmless vegetable which in Angrezi is called tomato (toe-mah-toe) and in Umrikan is called termayter (ter-may-ter).On being asked if he wishes to use the rest room, the PM shouldnt reply that he isnt tired and doesnt need to take a nap right now, and in any case hasnt brought his night suit with him. In Umrikan, a rest room is not a place where people go to catch forty winks but where they go to perform what we call our ablutions, ab-loo-shuns, from which we get the Angrezi word loo.And if Donald does become US prez and visits India in his official capacity he needs to mug up only one sentence to make him understood by one and all here, his Umrikan pronunciation notwithstanding: Barrat matter key jay!"
5904b4b17be9e04154dfac45,Who will bell the cat – aka the rich farmer?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/law-street/who-will-bell-the-cat-aka-the-rich-farmer/,2016-04-05,,The Times Of India,"Rich shareholders in India (individuals, firms or Hindu undivided families) earning a dividend income of more than Rs. 10 lakh in a year, will on passing of the Finance Bill, 2016 be paying a flat rate of income-tax of 10%. Contrast this with agricultural income, which even if it is a crore or more, remains exempt from income-tax in the hands of the farmer.Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, recently announced in the Parliament that a probe was on by tax sleuths of some prominent people who were evading taxes in the garb of agricultural income.However, he hastened to add that there is no proposal or move to tax farmers (in other words, genuine agricultural income, no matter what the quantum of earnings in an individuals hands would not be taxed).During the three year period beginning April 1, 2010 itself, there were more than a thousand cases where agricultural income of Rs. one crore or more had been declared.India is predominantly an agrarian economy, producing more than 250 million tonnes of food grain annually. Nearly 60% of the rural population depends on agriculture as its primary source of income. As per estimates by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the share of agriculture and allied sectors (including agriculture, livestock, forestry and fishery) was 16.1 per cent of the Gross Value Added (GVA) during 201415 at 201112 prices.While majority of the farmers belong to the small and marginal holding categories, characterised by household labour, production chiefly for consumption and low productivity, there are others who are earning more than the income-tax exemption limit of Rs. 2.5 lakh. While the FM took courage to tax dividend income in hands of rich shareholders, there is a hesitation to tax agricultural income in the hands of rich farmers, as his statement in the Parliament proves.Decades ago the argument for not taxing farm income was that the terms of trade were biased against the farm sector as food-grain prices were kept dismally low. Today, farming is also undergoing a gradual change. At one end of the spectrum are those small farmers who have been badly hit by drought and are reeling under debt. On the other hand, contract farming, where the farmer cultivates a certain crop (say tomatoes for a ketchup manufacturing company) for a pre-determined price with technical inputs and equipment duly provided by the company is no longer a rare instance. Corporate farming also exists, where the land is owned by a company and leased out for farming.Invariably, when income-tax collections fall short, the powers that be toot the horn: our tax collection ratio to GDP is dismal. Direct taxes (both corporate and individual tax) during financial year 2013-14 represented just 5.6% of the GDP. Come March, instructions are invariably issued to tax authorities to pull up their socks, the end result  refunds are withheld or tax demands hurriedly issued. This year has been no different.Such tax harassment (one may not want to use the stronger word  tax terrorism) continues, despite various remedial measures taken by the government, such as setting up grievance committees, which can be approached by taxpayers in case of high-pitched demands. Or reforming the basis of performance appraisal for tax officials, which will no longer be based on revenue collection targets.Statistics, as per a report tabled by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) show that the number of non-corporate taxpayers is on the decline, decreasing to 3.04 crore in financial year (FY) 2013-14, a drop of 17.4% from the previous year. At the same time, income tax collections from non-corporate tax payers has increased from Rs. 1.97 lakh crore in FY 2012-13 to Rs. 2.38 crore in FY 2013-14. As tax rates have only been tinkered with, one can say that it is the existing taxpayers who are paying more. There is no widening of the tax base in terms of the number of taxpayers.Realizing that the political powers would never bite the bullet and impose a tax on farm incomes, the Raja J Chelliah headed committee, in 1992-93 had suggested that the agricultural incomes of non-agriculturists if it was more than Rs 25,000 per annum should be taxed in aggregate.As under the Indian Constitution, agricultural income cannot be taxed by the Central government, but only by the States, the former should obtain the consent of States to enact a suitable enabling provision. The entire tax attributable to the agricultural component of income, should be distributed to the States on the basis of origin.More recently, Tax Administration Reforms Commission, led by Dr Shome has said: Large farmers should be brought into the tax net. Against a tax free limit of Rs.5 lakhs on agricultural income, farmers having income above much higher threshold income, such as Rs 50 lakh, could be taxed. This will broaden the taxpayer base.Even a large number of rich farmers, who earn more than salaried employees in the cities, get away with paying no tax at all in view of the governments lack of will to consider an agricultural income tax. Agricultural income of non-agriculturists is being increasingly used as a conduit to avoid tax and for laundering funds, resulting in leakage to the tune of crores in revenues annually, the report had added.TARCs committee had also pointed out that an across the board political consensus needs to develop, and be followed by appropriate amendments, laws and collection procedures to ensure effective implementation of such an important change. But it will certainly bring about a much improved tax culture and performance.There seems to be a valid case for taxing rich farmers. These should pay taxes the same way as any salaried employee or business man does. But will any government bell the cat (aka the rich farmers)."

The idea of Chef Couture, a food promo where the plate played the runway for some seriously glamorous Italian haute cuisine, inspired by fashion trends globally including Milan, got going.The opening sequence choreographed by Chef Rahul on my tasting menu lunch was Suede, wild quinoa & barley with asparagus cream, and it could easily pass off as a light and not too sweet salad or dessert, depending on how you would look at it, delightfully fresh and smooth as its name. Quinoa is one of the highest sources of protein, and many of the models follow the high protein-low carbs funda, and quinoa is quite the rage globally, says Rahul. Fuschia pink is apparently back on the runway so we have a pumpking soup with parmesan foam named after it.Next up was Chic, (slow cooked chicken with barley & Parmesan crisps), which was again a work of artful glamour. The sequences Pallazo (Pecorino ravioli with fennel cream) and Offshoulder (lemon fettucini with pepper butter emulsion and chevre) were good enough, but the showstoppers were the main course and dessert.Cowl (seafood risotto in a beautiful tomato-roasted bell pepper sauce was the best of the meal and Boho Chic (vanilla mousse with blue berry cream centre, with the meringues on top crafted to resemble the retro hairstyle bouffant, were couture cuisine at their best.Some more names on the menu?

When they finally got on one, they missed a connection in Abu Dhabi because weather conditions delayed their landing. Diverted to Sharjah for refuelling, a four-hour leg stretched to seven hours. Through a combination of open source flight trackers and internet video telephony, i shared their frustration and misery over every mile and every moment of their journey sitting at home and office in the US.They have now caught the next connecting flight, currently flying over Newfoundland in Canada, some three hours from Washington DC, as i write this. Wife has plugged into the Wi-Fi connection on board ($21.95 for the length of the 14-hour flight) and over video i can see the children dozing quietly over the roar of the airplane as it whistles home at 900 kms per hour. What do you want for dinner? i ask her. Can you make some palak paneer and daal? she replies exhaustedly from 36,000 feet up.It is not just air travel that is changing, but life and living itself is transforming in ways that are profound, exciting and, to some, dystopian. In as little as five years, perhaps less, I wish I was there to help will become a reality.Augmented reality will allow us to project ourselves into the seat next to a struggling spouse or frail parent on a flight or a train ride, offering virtual presence and support when children have a meltdown, or comforting words, even handholding, during a mothers painful journey. In turn, you would be able to monitor from air, or from anywhere, your childrens homework or an underlings handiwork by projecting yourself to the ground.Such advances are already being rolled out in geeky conclaves such as TED, where Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, Al Gore and A R Rahman were among those who last month tried some of these breathtaking new technologies that make computer screens seem archaic.Demonstrating the augmented-reality glasses that let the wearer see and interact with holograms, Microsofts ubergeek Alex Kipman teleported a NASA scientist on to the stage. In this instance, a precise holographic replica of the Martian landscape was projected on stage from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover. The scientist was in three places at once: On Mars and on stage in virtual form, in a room across the street in reality.Put it another way: When mankind steps on Mars, you almost certainly could be walking lockstep with the astronaut  and experiencing everything he is on the Martian surface, while sitting in your living room  in ways that were unimaginable during the Moon landing. You could travel to the Pyramids of Egypt or Niagara Falls or Taj Mahal without leaving your digs.The technologies will not just help explore and learn, but also help conquer fear and phobia, address hunger and disease. From growing body parts in a petri dish to 3D printing to discerning hereditary illnesses through genomes, humankinds advances are becoming more creative than those the industrial revolution engendered.Of what use is all this in a country that is in the throes of unrest and poverty you might ask. The same questions were asked of computers and smartphones, advances now being used by the poorest in India. The touchscreen, so ubiquitous now, was first rolled out at TED nearly a decade ago. In the same way i yearned to teleport myself to Abu Dhabi to pacify my children, imagine the overworked Uber driver in India  who said he had to tear himself away from his wailing daughter each morning to work the 7am to midnight shift to earn the Rs 50,000 he needs to put her through college  being able to do the same.These are not terribly expensive technologies, and where they are, they will, like computers and smartphones, soon arrive at a sweet spot where much of the world can afford them. Already, some basic drones now cost as little as $20 apiece. In that sense, the Rs 251 smartphone that is ringing (alarm) bells in India is not all that inconceivable. The pricing is only ahead of its time.But what these technologies will do is disrupt and sometimes destroy some aspects of growth while galvanising others. Watching a swarm of programmed drones (some of which are already delivering parcels) put together a brick wall, one cant help fear for the fate of jobs in construction, in manufacturing, in agriculture. In fact, self-driven cars, for which the US government only last month began drawing up a regulatory framework, will destroy the livelihood of millions of young men who have begun driving app-driven cabs in the shared economy space, the same way they disrupted yellow cabs and taxis.Indias go-to mantra for growth and job creation is its Make in India campaign, based on its so-called youth bulge and demographic dividend. But what if manufacturing is largely over-run by ever-cheaper drones, robots and automatons? After a brief glimpse of the future last month, the Indian formula is not something i would want to bet on even though the future is electrifying. There has to be a life beyond mere manufacturing. Just Make in India wont cut it; it needs fine-tuning. Create in India might be a better mantra."

Working as executive chef at Park Hyatt, Chennai, Greg (call me Greg, he offered after seeing me struggle with his name) oversees the kitchens of the all-day dining, The Dining Room and the iconic specialty restaurant, The Flying Elephant built over five levels. He considers Mediterranean and Thai cuisine as his forte, as well as his favourites.For Saulo Bacchilega, executive chef of Park Hyatt Goa Resort and Spa, Italian food is home turf and also his best-honed cuisine, (in his near-three-decades old career), despite his expertise at Asian cuisine and his overseeing operations at their in-house epic Goan restaurant Casa Sarita. Saulo, with a quirky sense of humour and multi lingual skills (English, French, Spanish and Italian, of course) just feels Italian food is simplest to make and good to eat!For Lars Windfuhr, executive chef Park Hyatt Hyderabad and German by birth, it is food cooked with freshest seasonal produce which matters. While Continental cuisine would be his most specialized skill, Murgh Makhni, as he would prefer calling Butter chicken, is his all time favourite carry away memory from India. Lars also confesses his wife and daughter love to snack on the ubiquitous Chindian Veg Manchurian.Three chefs from three different countries ruling the kitchens of different corners of India. Now if that isnt true blue globalization of the F&B industry!As part of the first season of Park Hyatts Chefs on Tour (under the umbrella of their Masters of Food & Wine initiative), a chefs table was set up recently at Tre-Forni, the in-house Italian specialty restaurant of Park Hyatt Hyderabad, which also saw the chefs in animated conversation on a range of food-related topics, with a select few bloggers and journalists.While we were looking forward to Chefs Greg and Saulo dishing out their signature stuff, their flight schedules put those plans to rest, and we settled down to a fabulous, nonetheless Italian meal. On the menu was Asparagus Tart, Seared Scallops & Prawns (with mashed apple, rucola pesto, sundried cherry tomato), Ravioli (provolone cheese and porcini sauce), Herb Crusted Lamb rack with rosemary roasted potatoes (magnifique!) , a delightful green apple sorbet as well as a perfectly bitter-sweet tiramisu.The chefs on tour included a cooking class showcasing Park Hyatt classics and unique home-grown recipes like Chef Gregs Polish Pierogi, dumplings served with mushrooms and sauerkraut.In the end, it was a chefs table which had a lot of takeaways, especially in terms of perspectives on global food trends and what good chefs want."

It later became the cornerstone of welfare policies in Tamil Nadu. For politicians it was a shrewd populist move by MGR to retain his vote bank; for nutritionists it ensured at least a third of the required nutrition for children; for educationists it was a strategy to increase enrolment in school; for some economists it was a waste of public money; and for teachers it was an added administrative burden. But for MGR it was a moment of satisfaction for having ensured the feeding of hungry children.This scheme is the outcome of my experience of extreme starvation at an age when I knew only to cry when I was hungry . But for the munificence of a woman next door who extended a bowl of rice gruel to us and saved us from the cruel hand of death, we would have departed this world long ago. Such merciful women folk, having great faith in me, elected me as chief minister of Tamil Nadu To picture lakhs and lakhs of poor children who gather to take up nutritious meals in thousands of hamlets and villages all over TN and blessing us in their childish prattle, will be a glorious event, said MGR about the noon meal scheme.Providing noon meal in schools was not new to Tamil Nadu as it had existed in various forms since the early 1900s. The sporadic events of providing noon meal in schools were outcomes of the philanthropic efforts of a few. But it was left to K Kamaraj to conceive it as a public policy so that government could provide it.Yet due to the lack of adequate finances and weak administrative machinery , the scheme was implemented only in rural primary schools and was dependent on contributions from local governments. In 1982 the allocation towards the noon meal scheme was less than 6 crore.The emotion of MGR behind the initiation of the scheme was truly captured in terms of its mammoth size and his determination to implement it against all odds. The total outlay for this scheme in 1982 was 120 crore that was later revised to 140 crore in late 1982 and 220 crore in 1983. Increasing the outlay by 20 times in a year shows the importance it received in the state. The scheme initially benefited 5.6 million children in rural schools in the age group of 5 to 10 years and within two months it was extended to children in urban areas, increasing the number of beneficiaries to 6.5 million. In addition, the balwadis (child care centres) were roped in to provide meals for children in the age group of 2 to 5 years. Subsequently, the elderly, widows and destitutes were also covered by this programme. Nearly 56,000 noon meal kitchens were opened, of which 35,000 were in schools. The average cost of a meal for children was 45 paisa and for adults, 90 paisa.To ensure its smooth implementation, the scheme was reviewed every month at the secretariat during the initial days by a committee headed by the CM and senior ministers, officials and important political leaders.Though the opposition described the expenditure a waste and a political stunt, MGR was aware that those who criticised the scheme would be shunned by the people. Journalist Ragavendra Rao, while recalling his experience during a field survey , had said that even a few pieces of carrot and tomato in the sambhar rice was a delicacy in the interiors of the districts of TN. This showed there were many hungry MGRs in the state, who were a meal or two away from death at that time."
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,,The Times Of India,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."
5904ea987be9e04154dfdb02,What the ponkh?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/what-the-phonk/,2016-02-15,,The Times Of India,"It is a lazy winter morning in Mumbai and finally for what it is worth, there is a nip in the air and the urge to have frequent cups of garam-garam chai. I am sitting all toasty and warm in my favorite recliner when the doorbell rings and a friend sashays in, radiating bonhomie and good cheer. I have just come from Surat and look what I have for you, she exults. Diamonds? I breathe hopefully. No silly, she giggles, waving a bejeweled hand towards a box she is carrying. Its ponkh!Ponkh? I squeak.Spoiler alert: for those of you who are hardcore carnivores, there is no meat in this story!What she has got back from her recent soujourn to Surat is a Gujarati delicacy called ponkh which is the local name given to tender jowar seeds or white millets. During a brief period in the winter months, the jowar grain is juicy and very tender and the seeds are just right to be harvested and eaten roasted. It is generally picked from fields and cooked there and then, with parties thrown to celebrate this young edible seed.My friends box reveals a bunch of packets neatly packed together: the green jowar seeds, three types of sev (fried gram flour noodles) and tiny sugar granules also known as sakkar-danna. The three sevs spread out in front of me are variously colored: a yellow one which is mildly spicy, a tomato-flavored red one, and the brown one which is hot and spicy and enticingly called limbu-mari (lime and pepper). The three flavors of the sev and their sharpness offset the slightly bland and sweetish taste of the ponkh. And I guess the sakkar-danas are provided to counteract the smoke-in -the-ears spiciness of the limbu-mari. Ponkh is sometimes eaten raw and sometimes slightly roasted and Gujaratis often wash it down with glasses of chhaas or lassi. My friend informs me that die-hard lovers of this delicacy even attend ponkh picnics in Surat.In Maharashtra, ponkh is known as hurda. As a child, I remember my mother talking about the hurda parties she used to attend on her visits to her hometown of Amalner, Maharashtra. During the season, the local farmers would throw a party in the middle of the fields where the young tender jowar was being roasted and eaten directly when it was still hot and tender. To accompany the hurda, the farmers wives would provide jaggery (gud), shengdana-lassun chutney (groundnut-garlic chutney), dry khobra chutney (dry coconut chutney), wangya chi bhaji (a brinjal preparation)and taak (butter milk).So now I am sitting with this big fat packet of ponkh and after diligently mixing the three sevs and a bit of the sugar granules with the green seeds, I carefully plate it on a salad dish and serve it to the family. Unfortunately, it does not set anyone on fire. The husband grimaces, the foodie wrinkles his nose and I stoically plod through the helping I have served myself. The next day, I decide to spice up the ponkh by serving it as a bhel. I add finely chopped onions, tomatoes, green chillies, coriander leaves, rock salt, a dash of chaat masala, and a few drops of lemon juice. On top, I add the rainbow colored sev, and serve it in the evening as an appetizer before dinner. The foodie son looks at it and exclaims, That thing again!My cook, the Garwahli genius, comes in from the kitchen to see what the fuss is all about. He takes a look at the ponkh offering, tastes it and then saunters off to the kitchen with something suspiciously sounding like Not on my table wafting on the breeze. With sarson ka saag and makke di roti on the menu, the poor ponkh is not getting its day under the sun in our house.Desperate to finish the huge mound of ponkh sitting forlornly in my kitchen, I call a few Gujarati friends and ask if they would want ponkh. Chokkas! Tarat mukaljo! (Of course, send at once) is the ardent response. And now, just as I am sitting back with a contented sigh that the ponkh has finally gone to places where it is being appreciated, my friend calls and asks how I liked the ponkh. Loved it, I squawk and cross my fingers for lying. Great, she chirps happily. Next year I will send you three kilos, and hangs up."
5904f8b27be9e04154dfe8d1,Bread-Poha or things like that,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sweet-n-sour/bread-poha-or-things-like-that/,2016-02-05,,The Times Of India,"Youve had a heavy lunch or a late one and if youre fitness (or thinness) freak you might forego dinner but if youre like me, who need their three-squares (and some intermediates), bread-poha is our salvation. Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

Among Jains scroll of breakthrough technologies, laid out in hundreds of papers and thousands of citations, are his developing the delivery of molecular and nano-medicine to solid tumors in ways that have fundamentally changed the thinking of scientists and clinicians about drug release.Jain is among nearly a dozen highminded brainiacs from India, now settled in America, who have been recognised by successive White House administrations over the past decade for revolutionary scientific and technical advances. Among previous National Medal winners of Indian-origin are Rangaswamy Srinivasan, whose work in ablative photodecomposition led to the development of Lasik eye surgery; Praveen Chaudhari, whose work in materials science resulted in developing the optical disk industry; and B Jayant Baliga, whose invention of the insulated gate bipolar transistor forms the basis of the smart energy grid.The work of each of them has resulted in development of industries worth billions and even trillions of dollars across the world, starting in the United States. It has kept the US well ahead in the technology sweepstakes, where occasionally there are pretender countries purportedly snapping at American heels. In this season of automotive agony one recalls that the late Haren Gandhi of Ford, the first Indian-American to win the National Medal in 2003, was recognised for his work in automotive catalysts and emissions control  long before it became such a hot button issue.Why is it that these scientists and technologists, all of whom finished their schooling and early college in India, made their breakthroughs in the United States and not in their country of origin? The short answer is that they have all migrated to the US. But why arent their contemporaries and peers in India or China making similar breakthroughs?What path breaking technologies or universally acclaimed products have China and India produced in recent decades? How does the US remain the birthplace of Apple, Google, Tesla and other cutting edge companies, while China and India only provide the grunt work and back offices for America to rake in the lolly?To understand this, lets rewind to socialist India of the 1960s and 1970s. Remember the big transistor radio that was the centrepiece of the living room, whose knobs father would not even allow you to touch, forget about letting you open the back and dismantle the whole contraption? Remember the fountain pen that you were not allowed to use, let alone taking it apart? Or the few other dont-touch-it devices that were wheeled out only for special occasions?Indigent, insular and insecure, we lived in an experimentally arid India, bereft of the spirit of academic adventure.Compounding this fear of exploration caused by our penurious existence was the stigma of failure, painfully brought home even now by the epidemic of student suicides under academic pressure  30 last year alone in the coaching crucible of Kota, Rajasthan, but thousands across the country year after year. All this was underscored by a system that prized mental calisthenics over physical labour or manual skills which, by Brahminical injunctions, were better left to lesser people or lower castes. High-minded Indians didnt get their hands dirty.The result is an annual assembly line of academic automatons, particularly in engineering. According to a recent report, 80% of Indias engineering graduates are unemployable.Yet when the same Indians come to the US and go through the American ecosystem, it is as if they have been let loose in a vast amusement park of discovery and exploration. Freed from the rigours of rote learning that constitute the rite of passage in India, they produce a staggering output of inventions and innovations.Consider this: In the list of some 200 Fellows for 2015 named by the US National Academy of Inventors there are at least 20 of Indian origin, a strike rate of 10% for an ethnic group which constitutes less than 1% of the national population. Last week, 13 of the 40 finalists at the Intel Science Talent were Indian-American kids.How to fire up this spirit of innovation and invention in India, beyond invoking dubious ancient glories? Three things are central to American dominance in this sphere: an ecosystem that encourages risk-taking, a market that provides capital and funding, and a social ethos that does not stigmatise failure.Recent initiatives promise to address the first two, but the third is a societal slur that no government can fix. America is a country of second chances, even third and fourth chances. India: no chance.The repair work then has to begin in the schools. Mere slogans or late-stage government intervention will not result in Make in India and Start Up India. Despite knowing where the problem lies through many reports and recommendations, India is yet to free itself from the stranglehold of textbook mastery, in an education system that remains depressingly moribund.The day you visit a school and find children hunched over devices and contraptions, equipment and appliances, rather than just textbooks and notebooks, is the day Make in India would have started up."
590592937be9e04154e0015c,Finding me,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/shweshwe/finding-me/,2016-01-18,,The Times Of India,"Just let go, and relax, my yoga teacher said soothingly, as we lie in Shav Asan in class this morning, having been given three minutes to cut off from the world. There is silence all around except for the occasional chirping of a bird or a distant car horn. As much as I try to focus on my breathing, my mind keeps going back to my busy schedule for the day. I open one eye and look at the girl lying next to me. She is snoring slightly. How can she do it? I shut my eyes tight, and try again. Do I over-think?I did not make a resolution this New Year. It is the first time in maybe fifteen years, that I did not say, This year I am going to lose weight! Though I could hear that line pop up at the back of my head all through New Years eve, I drowned it out with a few glasses of Mot! After all these years of following a somewhat repetitive routine the brain tells you what to do, even if you do not want it to. Its called muscle memory! So instead, I have made up my mind that this year, I am going to give myself ME. Find myself, the real and inner me. Pull myself out from the depths of a space where I have been comfortably hiding. Under layers of conditioning and practise. This is not a resolution as I tend to break those by the third week of January, which is about now! This a decision. Do I have the courage?Hmm So it must be around 9am already. I have to rush back home, as the hubby has an early meeting, and I need to be around while he leaves. Four egg whites with mushrooms, tomatoes and onions, very fluffy, no oil. The cook has been serving it to him for the past thirteen years! So what can go wrong with that if Im not around? Well invariably something does! I have to make sure that his shirt is pressed crisp with zero creases, and that he is wearing blue, his lucky colour, as he has an important buyer today! OhI almost forgot. I need to finalise with him the guest list for the dinner party we are having next week, as I have to send out a save the date today! I was supposed to ask him last night but then I didnt get the chance to as I had to accompany him for a business dinner, where I was busy entertaining three Chinese wifeys with stories on our Bollywood Badshah Shahrukh Khan! It always works! Do I try too hard to be the perfect-wifey?As I sit down with my chai, the staff will then attack me with the problems for the day! Bhabhi I have to go on leave today as my chachas son-in-law is going to the village, or bhabhi the washing machine has broken down, again! Each day there is a new issue, and it drives me up the wall! Also I have to give them instructions to start polishing the silveware for our party! It must sparkle like it is brand new. And tell them what to make as a snack when the kids get home from school. Mexican Tacos maybe? Do I sound like a typical bhabhiji?I must quickly escape to the salon to get my hair and nails done, as I have to go for a very social lunch! Now this is going to be an afternoon of complimenting on the face, talking behind each others back, and then discussing travel plans for the long Easter weekend. None of this really appeals to me, but not showing up is not really an option in this city! If you dont go once it is okay, maybe they will believe that you genuinely have the flu! But if you dont go twice, it is over! Your favourite aunt can be in the ICU, but you better not cancel twice! Its social murder or rather suicide. I mentally put together my outfit for this glamourous affair. Do I want to be part of this air-kissing society?Once Im done, I have to rush home cause the tween girl has her assessments going on! Anyone who has a child this age will agree with me that it is better to get home in time to hear their high-pitched complains on everything wrong that is happening in their lives! My best friend had a fight with me, she is so mean!, or then something else as earth shattering! This is always accompanied by water works, as in free flowing tears, and the mom you just dont get it dialogue! After the tweeny outburst we will have to study together for at least an hour! She must revise again. I mean whats wrong with trying to get perfect grades right? I must take the lil boy for his running practice as he has his school sports day in a couple of days. He is all excited but needs my constant cheering. It makes me go faster, he says, smiling! That reminds me that we have junior football league this Sunday, where full-on adrenalin and energy is required by us moms, to make sure their sons score! Im sure even Messi is not as driven to win, as our young boys are! Do I behave like an over-protective and pushy mom?Oh oh! I forgot to call my mother-in-law to check whether we are going to the Mata ki Chowki tomorrow? Being a non-Punju it is sometimes overwhelming the number of festivals and customs there are! All I know is that I attend them all, by putting on a blingy salwar-kameez, do parey paina'(touch feet and get blessings) to many Auntyjis, and eat yummy channa-kulcha and malai-phirni! Of course, vigorously moving to the beats of the dhol. I also better start my research on hotels and flights for our next family holiday. Golden Temple or Goa? Do I fit the part of a dutiful daughter-in-law?My legs are still killing me from my high impact Zumba class yesterday. I got a bit carried away and overdid the sexy hip rotations while squatting! I do try to keep myself in good shape, externally! Regular workouts, facials, tonnes of makeup, and not to forget carb-deprivation! Can you believe that I was actually dreaming of a divine molten chocolate fondant last night? But I cannot touch it until my cousins wedding next month. I have to wear a gorgeous sari, so I am working towards flat abs. Do I focus too much on my outward appearance?The soreness, coupled with the pain thanks to the stilettos I wore to the business dinner last night, are making me realize that my legs are not as young as they used to be! Im thinking of this, and cringing, because I have to get back on those damn heels tonight. We have to attend a friends 40th birthday dinner! Again, no excuses will work right. I mean its not like I dont want to go after all, its just a bunch of close buddies! A few beers down the hubbies will start to discuss the bad economy and who is surviving in these markets! We wifeys, taking big gulps of wine, will discuss our maids ( gods gift to womankind), or our kids achievements! My darling daughter came first in her elocution! Do I like hanging out with these friends?So it is going to be quite a hectic day, or rather week as usual! Am I complaining? Not really. But do you also sometimes feel that while you are struggling to juggle all your responsibilities, in the process, somewhere down the line, you lose yourself? Do we allow our inner self to take a backseat in our own life, while we go around making others happy, or perform our never ending duties? What about all the questions in my head? I realize now that they have one common simple answer, which is YES. These are all the roles I play, and I give it my best, every single moment. Also I actually enjoy this routine and value each bond I have. But am I putting in too much? Where is my own identity? Is this who I really am? No. I need to look deeper. And I know I will find myself.What is it that I want? For myself, and not anyone else! I have already made progress towards my decision for the year. I have found my voice, which comes straight from the heart and reaches you, through my writing. I will continue to discover who I am, and slowly rise to the surface. Hmm Suddenly I hear my yoga teachers voice,Open your eyes gently. I might not have been able to relax, as she asked us to, but at the end of the three minutes I have definitely decided to let go, so that I can find ME."

More than four million children have lost at least one parent in Congo over the past two decades. (AP Photo/Jerome Delay)More than 4 million children have lost at least one parent in Congo over the past two decades, the silent victims of continuous cycles of violence. And more than 26 million orphans live in West and Central Africa, where Congo is located  the second highest number in the world behind South Asia, according to the United Nations.Watch what else is in the newsThese children have grown up amid conflict fueled by ethnic strife and the fight over valuable minerals.The violence and displacement are eroding the tradition of families caring for their own. The breakdown in family means some orphans are forced to look after themselves and their younger siblings.Some are vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups. And many also face sexual exploitation, in a country where rape has become commonplace on the streets.They are the orphans with a story of violence since 1994  its a generation of victims that continues, says Francisca Ichimpaye, a senior monitor at the En Avant Les Enfants INUKA center. And the children lose their story in the violence.As Congo falls once again into violence in the face of a delayed election, here are profiles of some orphans in Goma.ALPHA MELEKI, 6Alpha Meleki was found in a pile of bodies after an attack by rebels on his village in Congos eastern Beni earlier this year. He had been shot and left for dead with his parents in the bush. The bullet wounds and the vine-like surgery scar on the 6-year-olds pudgy belly have only recently healed. He hobbles around, pulling his loose shorts up on his tiny body.The emotional scars are still fresh. When held by someone new, Alpha sits limply. His large eyes glaze over, and sometimes glare with angry distrust. He saves his smiles for those he trusts, often seeking the hands of adults he knows.He cannot stand to see others suffer. Whenever another child at the INUKA center needs medical attention, Alpha cries and screams. In a quiet moment, he touches a short, wide scar on his head. He lets others touch it.They hit me with a machete, he recalls. The center says it could take years to find any family members, as attacks persist in the northeast.JEANNETTE UMUTSI, 17At 17, Jeannette Umutsi has become the caregiver for her little brother, whom she hopes to protect from the horrors she has seen. At first she recounts her story stoically and with distance. She was born only a few years after Rwandas 1994 genocide spilled into Congo. Armed fighters stormed her home, hit her in the leg with a shovel and nearly killed her sister.She and her family fled her hometown of Kirolarwe in 2008 to escape the violence. In the next village, she hid in a toilet enclosure with wooden plank floors for three days to save herself from another attack. Alone, she would sneak out to grab tomatoes that grew nearby. For days, she heard gunshots and saw dead bodies, including that of her uncle. As she continues to talk of violence, she breaks down into tears and gasps.I have so many nightmares now. So many nightmares, she says. Her mother returned to save her. But she later died after giving birth to her brother Shukuru, now 5.Her father used to be a fighter, she says. Once, he threatened to kill her with a machete. As she talks about him, she folds over herself, head in her skirt, and the fear is palpable in her eyes.Finally she fled the family. She wrapped Shukuru up, put him on her back, and walked for days, struggling to breathe, on the way to Camp Mugunga in Goma. She is now an older sister to more than a dozen other children at the INUKA center, where she helps cook the fish and rice for lunch and rounds the kids up for naps.MOISE, 7, AND AGATA MUNOKA, 5Moise Munoka, 7, sits still, looks down and speaks in a near whisper when he recounts the loss of his mother.She died in 2013 after health complications from rapes left her quite sick. Rape is a constant in Congo, where it has become a weapon of war. At the Childrens Voice Virunga Centre in Goma, where Moise and his sister Agata gather during the day, at least 30 children were born of rape.Though Moise never knew his own father, he knows that he was probably a fighter who raped his mother. When asked if he wants to meet him one day, he scrunches his nose up and shakes his head in disgust, No! He is happy to have left his war torn village of Massissi.Its a bad place because theres war, trouble, people dont like each other, they like to kill, he says. Theres always dead people, and blood.He lights up as he explains that he and his sister are now being cared for by a widow, Arlette Kabuo Malimewa, 45. She has three children of her own and also cares for a third foster child. Agata sleeps in the living room, which has several posters of Jesus Christ lining the walls. Moise has his own room, where his two book bags hang from nails on the wooden planks.Malimewa sells bed covers in bright pinks and whites that hang over her black lava rock gate, and makes about $5 a week. I love them, but it is difficult, she says. I want to keep them until my death  because who would they go to?ANUARITA MAHORO, 12Anuarita Mahoro, 12, has been ostracized because she was born with a right hand problem that leaves her too weak to do hard labor. She lived with her father until he was asked to chop wood for armed men who then killed him in 2014. Her mother lived with the men of the forests, as she refers to the fighters. They eventually killed her mother, too, and left.Anuarita fled to her grandparents in Kiwanja. When her grandfather died, she was forced to leave her grandmother to find work to eat. Starving and sick, she was eventually taken in by a center for orphans. Here, her right hand tucked between her legs and leaning on her left elbow, she apologizes.I have suffered so much so I might sound confused, she says. She hopes to return to her village and reclaim her grandmothers land, showing those in the community her worth.After the death of my parents, the community discussed who would take this child. And no one was prepared to take me on as a parent. So since no one wanted me, when I grow up they better not come and ask me for any help, she said, grinning widely, and then covering her face and laughing.She would like one day to set up a center for orphans. And if she ever got the conversation she wants with the men who killed her parents, she solemnly reveals the one thought that wont leave her mind.I would ask why they killed my father and my mother and didnt kill me?DAMIEN MATATA BIZI, 22Damien Matata Bizi looks down, his shoulders heavy, when he hesitantly recounts his past as an orphan who became a child soldier.Many of the thousands of other former child soldiers in Congo over years made a similar choice, or had none at all. Rwandas 1994 genocide pushed fighters into Congo, and multiple rebel groups now fight over the mineral-rich region.Matata Bizi became a rebel after his father, also an armed fighter, died. He was only 10 years old.I was angry when I learned of my fathers death. So I wanted to avenge my father, so I entered into the rebellion to fight, he said. My mother could never pay for school, and we could never find money to pay for food so I thought this was best. Matata Bizi says he was treated well, but others werent.The life that vulnerable children have is hard, he says. They dont have education, they dont have clothes, so it may be better to be in an armed group with the ability to find food and clothes than to be at a loss.When asked about having to kill people, his eyes narrow and he impatiently takes a deep breath, visibly angry.Theres a difference between the militants and child soldiers, he says. The adults have the occasion to reflect on what theyve done. But for a child, we can only execute an order we are given. We dont think of things, we do what we are ordered to do. Matata Bizi was found, rehabilitated by the United Nations and integrated into the army in 2009. He signed papers that say he is no longer a child soldier. He carries the dirtied, crumbling pages around in his shirt pocket. They brand him now.He came to Goma in 2013. He was trained as a mechanic at the Don Bosco center in Goma but has no work. He says its easier to make more money and move up in rebel groups than in the army.War I know isnt good, and neither is violence. Its not good or normal, he says. But the armed groups exist because the country is badly organized. Theres no work. Theres no occupation for the young.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Nashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra.Kehav Kakad, a farmer from Girnare in Nashik district, received a newly minted Rs 2,000 note on Friday for the 20 quintal of tomatoes he had gone to the Girnare market with. In December last year, Kakad had got Rs 30,400 for the same quantity in the same market.Last year, I received Rs 30,400. Also, the payment was done in notes that I could spend. This year, not only has the price dipped, I am being paid in currency that not many people are willing to take, says Kakad.He is one of the many farmers in Nashik district who have been hit hard by the slump in tomato prices. The overproduction of tomatoes in the country, coupled with the demonetisation effect, has meant that at places such as Girnare, farmers have been forced to sell their produce for as less as Re 1 per kg. The average price for tomatoes in Nashik district for this entire month was a measly Rs 2.76 per kg. Last year during the same period, it was close to Rs 15.5 per kg.Watch What Else is Making NewsNashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra. Over the past three years, tomato production has seen a major surge across the country, including in Maharashtra. In 2014, APMCs across Maharashtra saw a total of 3.90 lakh tonne tomatoes coming into the market, with Nashik accounting for over 30 per cent at 1.24 lakh tonne. The production has, however, spiked to nearly double at 8.59 lakh tonne this year, with Nashik accounting for 3.82 lakh tonnes.While the increased production has played a role in bringing prices down, farmers say demonetisation is to blame too. Before the move, farmers were on an average getting Rs 5.2 per kg for tomatoes. Post November 8, when the decision was announced, the prices in Nashik dipped to Rs 2.76 per kg.This is the last stage of the tomato crop. It cant survive in winter and farmers are desperate to dispose of their produce. The traders know this and are squeezing farmers, citing the effects of demonetisation. They say you either sell at this price or go home with your produce, says Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Palse in Nashik.Traders claim the oversupply of the crop is deciding the price.There is no manipulation by traders. There is an oversupply in the market. The total produce that came in this month is almost double of what was seen during the same period last year. The overproduction across the country has caused the price drop, says a trader from Girnare, not wishing to be named.However, despite the low prices farmers are being offered, there has not been much fall in retail prices of tomatoes, which continue to be sold at Rs 10-15 per kg across the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8e77be9e033b96e95d4,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,,Indian Express,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo) People collect tokens from an IDFC counter that will allow them to buy vegetables at the Rythu bazaar. (Source: Express photo)Anyone who has an Aadhar-linked bank account can now buy vegetables without currency at Rythu bazaars (government-sanctioned farmers markets) in Telangana. With smaller denomination notes hard to come by post demonetisation, the Telangana State Marketing Department has begun an experiment to replace cash with tokens that can be used at the vegetable markets.The tokens, in denominations of Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 20, are available at mobile counters being set up by the Industrial Development Financial Corporation (IDFC) at various markets and other locations. The IDFC counters have hand-held machines connected to servers of all banks, and a small mobile ATM machine that can hold up to Rs 25,000 in cash.Those seeking the tokens have to provide their Aadhar numbers, which are fed into the hand-held machines, which then authenticates credentials and the bank account linked to that number through a fingerprint scan. Once cleared, a customer can take tokens worth a maximum of Rs 500, which would be deducted from the bank account. Customers will receive a text message on their mobile phones from their banks, notifying them of the transaction.Farmers, vegetable sellers or vendors who accept the tokens in lieu of cash can deposit them at IDFC counters at the end of the day, which will then credit their bank accounts with an equal amount.The IDFC mobile ATMs linked to the hand-held machines can also dispense cash to those depositing the tokens. For instance, if a farmer or vendor wants some of the amount in cash and the rest to be deposited in the bank account, it can be done, Telangana Marketing and Irrigation Minister T Harish Rao said. The IDFC agents facilitating these transactions receive a commission from the banks.The experiment was started at the Kukatpally Rythu Bazar Friday afternoon but the response was initially slack as many buyers and vendors could not remember their Aadhar numbers. It has since picked up.Due to lack of awareness, only 85 transactions happened Friday but today, over a 100 people availed coupons within an hour. Buyers are happy and farmers, who were suffering from a slump in sales and lack of cash in hand, are ecstatic. We are fine-tuning it now, director of agriculture marketing G Lakshmi said.With hundreds queued up to buy the tokens, stocks of fruits and vegetables that had been lying unsold for several days, were finally seeing buyers.I did not have any sales the whole of last week. We threw away a lot of tomatoes and cabbage. Since morning, I have been accepting the tokens after my son brought our Aadhar numbers and they linked it at the counter. We have some 40 tokens so far and so it is good. I will encash them in the evening, said Nalla Sriramulu, a farmer from Sangareddy.Health Minister C Laxma Reddy has requested the IDFC to start their counters at government hospitals immediately. The counters are expected to be operational at the hospitals from Wednesday.Officials said that due to uncertainty over when the cash crisis will ease, the Telangana government has decided to start the token payment system. It will be introduced at various places in the coming days to help businessmen, contractors and others to pay daily wagers, labourers, and staff, an official said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But with currency crunch, both procurement at APMCs and the ability of farmers to purchase seeds have been badly affected. Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes. The farmers are also facing problem in buying seeds for the forthcoming Rabi season which is likely to go up manifold in Vidarbha and Marathwada. We have thought of some measures to address these issues, Kishor Tiwari, director of the mission, told The Indian Express.Watch What Else Is making NewsHe said they had requested the state government to approach the Centre with request to allow use of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 for purchase of seeds at government and registered private centres. We also want the banks to make enough new currency notes available to APMCs to tide over the payment problem. If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named. We are planning to provide transporters of at least onion, potato and tomato with some cash to enable them to continue plying. It will require expenditure of a few crore rupees, which is not a big deal, added the official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Sahay, a former Union Minister of State for Home, said Jharkhand was a horticulture-based state and the marginalized and small farmers were solely depended on producing vegetables.Former Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahay on Friday hit out at Jharkhand government, saying it did not consider ground reality and feel the pulse of tribal community when it decided to amend the decades-old Chhotanagpur and Santal Paragana Tenancy Act (CNT and SPT). The Raghubar Das-led government says the amendments will allow acquisition of tribal land, while keeping the landholders ownership intact, for building infrastructure such as roads, hospitals and educational institutions, but the opposition parties have decried it.Watch what else is making news:The Chief Minister Raghubar Das is not a son of soil, so he neither worked on the ground reality nor could feel the pulses of tribal community while bringing about an amendment in the CNT and SPT, which was drafted haphazardly only to favour corporate and big businessmen, Sahay, a senior Congress leader, alleged. The amendment has changed the nature of land from being an agriculture land to commercial land, he told a press meet alleging that the government had overlooked the provisions of Land Acquisition Act introduced by the UPA government.CNT and SPT were framed to protect the interests of the tribal community, which was very much apprehensive of losing their land despite state governemnts assurance that tribals will not lose ownership over their land, Sahay said. Sahay, a former Union Minister of State for Home, said Jharkhand was a horticulture-based state and the marginalized and small farmers were solely depended on producing vegetables.He claimed the tribal community was apprehensive that their cultural identity and livelihood will be lost. Apart from CNT and SPT, the government was also displacing people settled on non-government and forest land to benefit the corporate and big businessmen, he claimed. An all-party delegation of opposition including JMM had recently met President Pranab Mukherjee to apprise him of the prevailing situation in the state, he added.Referring to demonetisation, Sahay claimed that the farmer community was hit hard owing to demonetization. The poor and small farmers were unable to take their produce to market and were selling foodgrains and vegetables at throw away prices, he said, adding many were dumping tomatoes at roadside. He threatened to launch an agitation on the issue of amendment in the CNT and SPT and said the entire opposition was now united.Sahay said the opposition parties have also demanded a judicial enquiry in police firing at Barkagaon (Hazaribagh), Golla (Ramgarh) and Khunti districts, which claimed seven lives and injured many during protest against alleged forcible land acquisition of agriculture land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Congress leaders are expecting a good turnout of people from the north Gujarat region, where the party had won five district panchayats and 27 taluka panchayats in the local body election held a year ago. Congress had wrested all these panchayat bodies from BJP. Besides, one-fourth of the partys MLAs or 15 to be exact, hail from six districts of the region.Party leaders feel that they can politically cash in on the resentment among the Patidars against BJP and its leaders who, according to the Patidar leaders, have not stood with them in their agitation for seeking reservation in government jobs and admission in higher educational and professional courses.In a way, the rally is likely to become a test of strength for the party, especially at a time when the assembly elections are just a year ahead and leaders of all the major political parties have begun mobilisation programmes in the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a farmers rally at Deesa, just 100 km from Mehsana, Saturday last.Party spokesperson Manish Doshi said that farmers in the north Gujarat region have suffered the most since the NDA came to power at the Centre two and a half years ago. Congress wants to highlight plight of the farmers by inviting Rahul to address them in Mehsana. Doshi said that export of cotton and tomatoes grown in the region has been hit badly due to wrong policies of the central government.Rahul was to earlier launch a yatra for the rights of tribals that was taken out by the party from temple town of Ambaji two months ago. But that did not happen. Now, Mehsana located at the centre of the state is the most suitable place for Rahulji to address the farmers and rural folks who have suffered the most due to wrong agriculture policies of the Modi government and also demonetisation, said Doshi. Mehsana is the home district of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former chief minister Anandiben Patel and currently Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel.Banaskantha district Congress president Zakir Chauhan said that as the party won the district panchayat polls in Patan, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Sabarkantha and Aravalli districts a year ago, it indicated that the rural population was in favour of the party. Congress had also won Banaskantha district panchayat, but lost to BJP due to a couple of elected members crossing over to BJP.State party president Bharatsinh Solanki and Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Shankersinh Vaghela held a meeting of the office-bearers of the six north Gujarat districts on Wednesday to plan how to mobilise people for the rally.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Crates carrying tomatoes at the Nashik agriculture produce market committee. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Suryabhan Kusare hasnt come to terms with the method of payments at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard thats barely a fortnight old. Earlier, we were getting hard cash. Now, the traders and commission agents pay us by cheque. The new system, were told, would ensure that buying will go on and our payments are on time. But effectively, it means standing for hours in front of banks, first to deposit these cheques and then withdraw whatever little we are allowed to, says this farmer from Sawargaon village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district.Soon after the Centres November 8 announcement, demonetising all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes, traders in all of Nashiks 17 wholesale produce mandis ceased operations, citing shortage of cash to pay farmers. On November 20, the district collector convened a meeting of stakeholders, wherein it was decided that farmers would henceforth be paid either by cheque or through electronic bank transfer. The markets have since opened  with most traders opting for payment through cheques.Watch What Else is Making NewsKusare, who had harvested around 100 quintals of late-kharif season onions from his 2.5 acres holding, isnt happy at all with the new arrangement. Only last week, he sold 25 quintals at the Pimpalgaon Baswant market, fetching him Rs 7,500 at Rs 300 per quintal. The trader wrote out a cheque for this amount drawn on ICICI Bank, which Kusare then took to deposit in his account at the Nashik District Central Cooperative Banks Sawargaon branch. Depositing the cheque took me four hours. The bank people told me it would be cleared only in 4-5 days. After five days, I stood in the queue again and, at the end of it, got just a Rs 2,000 note, complains Kusare.Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Pramod Kusare, a fellow-farmer from the same village, has a similar story to narrate. About eight days back, he took 50 crates of tomatoes (each of 20 kg) to Pimpalgaon Baswant and got a cheque of Rs 4,000 for it: I stood for three hours to deposit the cheque and queued up for another two hours after four days to collect a single Rs 2,000 note. I was informed that the banks cash position did not permit me to get more.For farmers like the Kusare, November-December happens to also be the peak planting time for rabi season crops  mainly onions, tomatoes, and wheat. For them, the move from instant cash to receiving cheque payments has translated into productive time in the fields getting diverted to standing for hours in serpentine bank queues.Just as Lasalgaon is for onions, Pimpalgaon Baswant  also in Nashik district  is known as the market that sets the price for tomatoes in the country. With an annual turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore, this APMC last year recorded total produce arrivals of over 76 lakh quintals, mostly tomatoes, onions and pomegranate. During the peak season, which is from November through the first week of December, daily tomato arrivals are in the range of 20,000-30,000 crates. Even now, 15,000-20,000 crates are arriving every day, with nearly 100 per cent payments to farmers being done though cheques issued by traders either on the same or following day.Somnath Nimse, one of the 557 traders/commission agents at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC, admits that clearing of cheques takes 5-6 days. We were willing to adopt electronic bank transfers, but the internet connectivity here isnt good to enable that, he notes. Tomato prices have crashed post-demonetisation; the average quoted rate, last Friday, at Nashiks primary produce markets was as low as Rs 20 per crate or Rs 1/kg. Its not just farmers. We ourselves are struggling to sell in other (terminal) markets, as the traders there are finding it difficult to arrange funds for making purchases, claims Nimse, who, in the past, has also exported tomatoes to Bangladesh. That trade has completely stopped after November 8. During the peak season, I myself make tomato purchases of Rs 25-30 lakh in cash per day. As against this, the government has specified a weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 for traders, which is a cruel joke, he adds.Traders at Lasalgaon, a market that is synonymous with onions and deals in some 40 lakh quintals of the bulb annually, have also moved almost entirely to cheque payments post-demonetisation. Right now, about 97 per cent of transactions are being done through cheques. We are quite happy having done away with cash payments. Our attempt would be next to go in for direct bank transfer, states Nitin Jain, a commission agent-cum-exporter based in this APMC that is 30 km from Pimpalgaon Baswant.Jagdish Apsunde, a trader and director at the APMC in Nashik  not far from the main city  has already taken the step of electronically transferring money into the accounts of farmers supplying to him. Ive got them to submit their bank account details along with a cancelled cheque to enable me to remit payments directly. This way, farmers are ensured of getting their money the very next day, saving them at least the trouble of having to deposit cheques, observes Apsunde, whose daily peak business in tomatoes and onions runs to over Rs 10 lakh.The Nashik APMC, which handles around 84 lakh quintals of produce annually, was closed for three working days after the demonetisation announcement. Since the meeting with the district collector, the bulk of the 1,300-odd traders here have adopted non-cash means to pay farmers. We are also in the process of getting a public sector bank to open a branch within our mandi premises, which should help farmers, informs KB Shevale, assistant secretary of the APMC.Arun Govindrao Wagh, chairman of the smaller APMC at Sinnar, isnt as enthusiastic about produce trading going cashless. Although we have moved to cheque payments, it doesnt help farmers, as they need cash for purchase of farm inputs and labour payments. How can one expect them to embrace debit or credit cards, leave alone internet banking? he points out.Farmers, on their part, seem resigned to accepting payments now largely through cheque. Pandit Gaikar recently sold 25 crates of cauliflower at the Nashik APMC, for which he received Rs 1,000. The nearest bank is 15 km away from my village. I couldnt possibly have gone all that distance to deposit a cheque for such a paltry amount, and further await payment. My trader was fortunately kind enough to agree and pay me Rs 1,000 in cash, remarks this farmer from Gangavhare near Nashik.Gaikar has harvested just a quarter of his cauliflower crop on one acre and has another two acres of brinjal almost ready to be picked and sold. I dont know what price I am going to get in todays cashless market. Even I get a price, will I be able to lay my hands on cash from the sale? Without cash, how am I going to fill diesel in my tractor and make labour payments for my next crop, within the little planting time available now? asks Gaikar. Thats a question bothering most farmers today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

They stay there until they are ready to join the bal sangham, Shankar said.Shankar  at that time of bal sangham age  was taken to Rajmeta, where he stayed with 15 boys of his age, under the tutelage of an area commander named Aashu. There they were conditioned for the life of a rebel.The children would wake up at 4 am and sit in silence till 6 am, or when the first light broke. This was when police movement is at its highest, so we were told to be awake and aware, Shankar said.Between 6 and 8 am, the children would work in the fields, some planting tomatoes, others rice. Then there would be lessons. In the bal sangham, we are considered almost ready to fight. So there isnt much theory. There was one book, which the commander taught us. It said that capitalists were taking away our jungles and peoples way of life, and we were fighting to protect them, Shankar said. With a premium on ammunition, all weapons training was done with bamboo poles fashioned into makeshift rifles.Carefree as they were, self-preservation was built in. Each child had a uniform akin to government schools, and civil clothes. If the police came, we were told to run in different directions to a village so we could blend in, he said.Shankar spent a year at the sangham. At 13 he joined the Rajmeta militia. Quick on the uptake, he was soon promoted to the National Park military company no. 9 in 2007, and handed a .303 rifle. But there was growing disenchantment, and a failed escape attempt. We got nothing. No money, no peace of mind, no regular food. I didnt know what I was fighting for, and didnt like killing. So I tried to escape with my gun and got caught. Then I got demoted to the Buri militia, Shankar said.One of the reasons for his disillusionment was the failure to meet his brother, he said. He made his way to Mundmal, but was told nobody could meet the children.DM Awasthi, Special DG Anti Naxal Operations and SIB, to which Shankar had surrendered, said, This surrender has given us much information about how the bal sangham and schools operate. He has been part of big incidents like the Murkinar camp attack, which left 11 dead, or the Ranibodli camp attack, which left 55 personnel dead. We now have information on how they were carried out.On Shankars right ankle, a linear scar runs deep. It was in the Ranibodli attack that he first fired his .303 in an encounter, and was shot in the leg. The stitches amateurish, the wound still hurts eight years later. It is this life he wants to pull his brother out of.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Gajendra Yadav) Vegetable sellers at Azadpur mandi had to turn down several customers. (Express Photo: Gajendra Yadav)Every day, 32-year-old Sanjeev Kumar Thakur, an aarthiya (middleman) who trades in tomatoes at Azadpur mandi, makes transactions worth about Rs 10 lakh with wholesellers from across Delhi-NCR. But on Wednesday, even after working an hour extra, and rejecting countless Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, he made less than 40 per cent of what he usually does.By 7.30 am on Wednesday, Thakur had already turned away four wholesellers. One of them, Ram Shankar, 35, owns a grocery store in northwest Delhis Adarsh Nagar. Shankar said he needed 20 kg tomatoes, but since he only had Rs 500 notes, he had to go back empty-handed.Pointing to a truck full of tomatoes, Thakur said, Since the announcement, there is confusion all around. I cant risk taking big notes, he said, adding that he doesnt want to give vegetables on credit because most buyers have previous dues.About 300 metres away, 40-year-old aarthiya Titu had a different problem. Two chilli farmers were refusing to leave until he paid them in notes of Rs 100 or less. How do I pay the farmers who have come from far? Some of them dont even have a bank account, Titu said.Chilli farmer Bhagat Singh, who arrived from Jafrabad at 3 am, said he was on his way to the mandi when he got a call from home. My wife told me not to take Rs 1,000 or Rs 500 notes. The aarthiya owes me Rs 20,000, said Singh, adding that he would wait until the end of the day for the cash.Like Titus and Singhs, most stalls in the mandi saw discussions and arguments on the same issue. In the absence of an alternative, most small retailers accepted Rs 500 notes from customers after bit of convincing.Agricultural Produce Market Committee deputy secretary Babu Lal said, Business was hit but we will be able to understand the impact only in a few days.Azadpur mandi is Asias largest wholesale fruits and vegetables market spanning 90 acres. In the 2015-16 fiscal, the mandi saw an annual transaction of more than Rs 9,000 crore, the APMC, which governs the mandi, said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It has just been halted over reports that the Indian exporters are not meeting our bio-security conditions.Were looking into these reports and will lift restriction on cotton imports if our apprehensions are proved wrong, Shami said.He said the cotton consignments would be allowed to enter Pakistan through surface or sea routes."

Thank you all, lets do business, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said. (source: PTI)Stressing that cyber warfare is a strategic challenge, the visiting Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Thursday said that his country and its defence industry were ready and committed to strengthening its cooperation with India to make a safer world.Introducing the heads of Israels defence industry, Rivlin said in a speech on Thursday, We did not seek to become experts in the field of defence, but through the struggle for our independence and our liberty, we learned how important it is to be able to defend ourselves, to fight our enemies, to fight terrorism. Today the battlefield is changing. Cyber warfare is no longer science fiction, it is a strategic challenge. In all these areas, Israel, and Israeli industry is ready and committed to strengthening this cooperation to make a safer world. Of course we are very grateful to our Indian partners for the way they work together with us in order to ensure a safe and secure world.He added, There is positive and growing cooperation between our countries in many areas of defence and security. We also face a common challenge in fighting terrorism and radicalism. I am here today to affirm our commitment to the fight against global terrorism. We are here today to carry the great potential of this partnership into reality.Rivlin is in India for an eight-day visit. After holding talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week, he visited Agra and is scheduled to travel to Karnal, Chandigarh and Mumbai.Regarding cooperation across diverse sectors, he said, Israel wants to play a part in the Four-Colours Revolution that Prime Minister Modi has set as Indias national goal, that brings together the colours of the Indian flag: saffron for solar power, green for agriculture, white for dairy produce and blue for water. In all these issues, Israel  little Israel  is a giant of knowledge and experience, as we have already had to overcome our own challenges. Our advanced solar power systems, irrigation systems, water treatment projects and the average milk production per cow are just a few examples.Todays innovations are almost unimaginable  and we now have companies working to make water out of air. We want to gather all these technologies, all the power of our Israeli innovations, as our motivation today: To make in India!! To make with India!! To be your partners!He said the two sides were cooperating to attain food security. We already have Israeli and Indian experts working together with local farmers to improve Indian produce and the lives of local families. We are very proud of all they are doing. Tomorrow, I will visit Karnal where Indians and Israelis are developing new kinds of cherry tomatoes (which is an Israeli invention). They are already making in India a future together.Our two nations have changed the world before; it is time to do it again, together.

Some middlemen said the situation has improved since November 8, but it is yet to reach normalcy. Middlemen dealing with tomatoes are facing an even tougher time  their business was first affected when exports were banned to Pakistan due to the ongoing tension between the two countries, and next by demonetisation.Watch what else is making news:Sanjeev Kumar Thakur, a middleman in Azadpur, said they get tomatoes from Bangalore and Nashik. A box of tomatoes, weighing 25 kg, now costs Rs 170-Rs 300. Weve been facing problems since exports to Pakistan were stopped. Demonetisation has dealt a double blow. The cash crunch is never-ending.He added that small farmers who come from nearby areas, mainly Agra, to sell their produce are facing huge problems. Sanjeev Yadav, who has come to the mandi to sell chillis, said that since November, the biggest challenge is getting the full amount in cash from traders.Sandeep Kapoor, owner of Om Sai Ram Traders, said he has seen a decline of nearly 50 per cent in his sales ever since demonetisation. After demonetisation, the volume of sales has also gone down. The market is moving at a snails pace.

590a30a77be9e033b96ebace,Halting desertification,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/581090/halting-desertification.html,2016-11-14,,Deccan Herald,"Sriroop Chaudhuri and Mimi Roy, Nov 15, 2016 23:16 ISTFOOD, CLIMATE, MIGRATION : About 96.4 million hectares land area (29.3% of total landmass) of India is currently under land degradation/desertificatioIn the last couple of decades, land degr-adation/desertification has grown into an appalling menace to sustainable human development, affecting billions around the world including India, leaving the authorities reeling over dire resource depletion/inadequacy. A major reason for it has been a lack of consensus over a precise definition of desertification.As per the United Nations Convention for Combating Desertification (UNCCD), desertification is virtually any form of land degradation in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, resulting from a combination of climatic variations and unplanned human expansion. Desertification, by newer definitions, is no more just about sand dunes and oasis. Today it means the collective damage caused to the worlds dryland ecosystems.In India, combating land degradation/ desertification has emerged as a top environmental priority to the authorities concerned. India is signatory to the UNCCD and intends to achieve land degradation neutral status by 2030. On June 17, 2016, on the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification, the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC), and Arid Zone Forest Research Institute (AFRI), jointly released desertification maps of the country. These maps, compiled by the Space Application Centre, Isro along with 19 partner instit-utes, for the 2003-05 and 2011-13 periods, have brought up some disturbing facts.It appears that about 96.4 million hectares (Mha) land area (29.3% of total landmass) of the country is currently under land degradation/desertification, as compared to about 94.5 Mha (28.7%) during 2003-05. By far, Rajasthan appears to be the hot-seat of degradation/ desertification in the country followed by Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana. Cumulatively, these nine states account for about 23% of the total land area under degradation/desertification in India.But what bakes the cake really is the state-wise land area under degradation/ desertification. In Jharkhand (68.9%), Rajasthan (62.9%), Delhi (60.6%), Gujarat (52.2%) and Goa (52.1%), over half the land area is under intense threat of land degradation/desertification. To add further to the aggravation, in each on these states/UTs, land degradation/desertification has increased between 2003-05 and 2011-13 period with the worst scenario apparent in Delhi, registering about 11% increase.Desertification/degradation is on steep gradients in the Northeast as well. In Tri-pura, land degradation/desertification increased by about 10.4% between 2003-05 and 2011-13, in Nagaland by 8.7% and Mizoram 4.3%. Overall, in 25 states/UTs, desertification appears to be on the rise.But why the heck we care for desertification of the drylands? Here is what the drylands do: they constitute about 34% of worlds total landmass and are major source of food, especially for the poor. One in three crops cultivated today, including oats, barley, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage and saffron, originated from drylands. About half the worlds livestock is concentrated in the drylands.Recent UNCCD reports suggest that about 52% of worlds agricultural land area is moderate to severely degraded. About 12 Mha of productive land are turning barren annually resulting from desertification/drought, toppling cha-nces of about 20 mt of food grains which acutely exacerbates global food crises.As added vice, desertified areas are noted for their long-range adversities on climate. For example, reduction in vegetation (frequently associated with desertification) cover elevates atmospheric aerosol/dust levels which affect cloud formation and rainfall patterns, carbon cycle, and biodiversity.Visibility crises in Beijing, a well-known menace these days, is believed to have been caused by springtime dust storms originating in the Gobi Desert. Yellow Dust from China costs the Korean and Japanese economy a huge revenue each year. It is also taken for US air quality deterioration in recent times. In China itself, desertification, leading to recurrent droughts and massive crop-losses, takes a nice bite of the countrys annual GDP. Studies find that desertification can hugely magnify global warming in days ahead.But putting aside the tangible issues regarding food/water shortage, and climate, there are others that do not meet naked eye. One such is forced migration. Desertification is destabilising large communities globally, turning them into migrants and homeless refugees.Environmental migrationAn estimated mob of 60 million will migrate from desertified areas in sub-Saharan Africa to North Africa and/or Europe by 2020. By 2050, about 200 million people will turn up as perman-ently displaced environmental migrants. Governmental reports suggest that such displaced mob and forced migrants often take to radicalisation and extremism, inciting brutal resource-driven conflicts.Environmental migration is largely triggering political instability, terrorist disturbances, and food/water riots across desertified areas, ultimately spilling over to neighbouring lands. So what can we do to halt desertification? Or shall we do anything at all? Monitoring for causes of desertification should be central any action plan. Aberrant climatic shifts is of course the major impaling factor.But other than climate, unleashed human expansion contributes a great deal to desertification:a) Land cover change (due to urban sprawl): deforestation/logging beyond permissible limits; forest fires/encroachment into forest lands; conversion of native croplandsb) Land management protocol: inadequate soil conservation measures (soil erosion); improper crop rotation /shift in cultivation patterns; improper irrigation schemes (water-logging/leaching); indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals (soil salinisation)c) Overexploitation of natural resources (overpopulation/demand): overgrazing; unplanned groundwater extraction; inequitable sharingd) Lack of resources (tools/funds/ trained professionals) to: support innovative dryland agriculture; reclaim water-logged and/or saline soilsThese days, climate change also is a ramified effect of human expansion (urbanisation/carbon emission/freshwater abstraction) only. A disturbing fact about desertification is, it is largely irreversible. So, may be its time we seriously gave in to the UNs recent plea stop deserting the deserts. Other than building up holistic awareness among the common people, a major push should be to establish transnational partnerships to monitor, assess, re-assess and implement stringent actions plans.(The writers are assistant professors and assistant directors, Centre for Environment, O P Jindal Global University, Sonipat, Haryana)"

(Representational image) Wisdom is required to cap the gains of the winners and limit the losses of the losers. (Representational image)This week too, I must stay with the subject of demonetisation.When change takes place, there will be winners and losers. Wisdom is required to cap the gains of the winners and limit the losses of the losers. Greater wisdom is required to ensure that no one is utterly ruined. Such wisdom can only come from full information and knowledge.Piecing together bits of evidence that are freely available in Delhi  especially from the government and BJP sources  it is now absolutely clear that the Prime Minister was not told:1. That demonetising Rs 500  and Rs 1,000  notes will result in 86 per cent, by value, of all currency notes being withdrawn from circulation and use.2. That printing capacity is limited and replacing the demonetised notes (2,400 crore in number) will take seven months if every note is replaced by a note of the same denomination; more time if a note is replaced by smaller denomination notes; and less time if the notes are replaced by Rs 2,000 notes.3. That it will take a month or more to recalibrate the 2,15,000 ATMs and stack them with the new notes (if sufficient notes are supplied).Skeletons tumbling outWithout full information, and without asking the right questions, the Prime Minister unilaterally took the decision to demonetise high denomination notes (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000). His confident demeanour and rhetoric swayed the people. The vast majority believed him when he said that demonetisation will stamp out black money, corruption, fake currency notes and terrorist funding. They believed him when he said that the inconvenience will be short-lived (his Finance Minister even fixed the following Tuesday [15 November] as the day on which things will become normal!). They believed him when he asked for forbearance for 50 days. They stood patiently in long lines, for long hours, and did not protest too much even if they returned empty-handed.Until last week, the Prime Minister had the upper hand. Then, the skeletons started to tumble out of the cupboard. Every promise of the government turned out to be hollow and false. The myth around demonetisation began to unravel. The winners and losers were identified. And we found to our shock that the lives of millions had been utterly ruined.Winners and losersWho are the winners? The hoarders who laundered every note in their hoard. The launderers and brokers who earned huge commissions. The bank officers who converted the demonetised notes and handed over bundles of new Rs 2,000 notes to the tax-evaders and the corrupt officials. The petty government officials, including policemen, who cajoled or threatened bank officials to open a backdoor exchange counter to exchange old notes for new. Together, they have succeeded beyond imagination and practically ensured that every rupee of the Rs 15,44,000 crore will be returned to the banking system!Who are the losers?  The average person who was compelled to make several visits to the bank to withdraw money from his own account. The person with a few old notes who had no access to a bank branch (because of distance) and exchanged her notes at a discount. The homemaker who had to scrounge for money to provide at least one meal a day for her family. The patient who had to forego his treatment at a hospital because he did not have money in his hands. The student who got his meal at the langar in the neighbourhood gurdwara. The farmer who could not buy seeds or fertilisers or hire labour and took a hit on productivity.Those utterly ruinedWho are those who were utterly ruined?  The labourer who was laid off in industrial hubs like Tiruppur, Surat and Moradabad. The daily wage earner who could not find work in farms or mandis or on construction sites. The self-employed, selling flowers or fruit or pav-bhaji, whose customers vanished for several weeks. The artisan plying his trade (carpenter, electrician, plumber) who got no calls. The small businessman whose sales fell by as much as 80 per cent. The truck owner and truck driver whose trucks were idle for several weeks.Among the worst affected were the farmer-producers whose produce suffered a crash in prices, as will be seen from the table (right):In the case of tomatoes, carrots and spinach, seasonal factors may have caused a decline in prices. In other cases, it is undeniable that lack of money, and the consequent fall in demand, was a major driver. As far as the farmer-producer is concerned, the loss of income is brutal and final  and no one has come forward to compensate him. Eleven crore people, on average, standing in a queue before bank branches and ATMs every day; the promise of being allowed to withdraw up to Rs 24,000 every week dishonoured; loss of daily wages or daily income that cannot be recouped; fall in commodity prices for which there will be no compensation; tragic deaths, the number of which is nearing 100- not even a natural calamity could have wreaked such havoc across the country.Cry, my beloved country, because of an ill-conceived plan that turned into a catastrophe due to incompetent implementation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"

(Photo: Reuters )You can never please the fans: Gary Linekar keeps his word, hosts Match of the Day in undies after his old club Leicester Citys title win. Trolls say, they were shortchanged. #BoxersArentUndies trends.Rainbow now has black too: Finally apartheid ends. Temba Bavuma becomes first black African specialist batsman. Its taken long for South Africas batting line-up, crickets pampered and elitish top order, to get a rainbow hue.Scratch the surface: We do live in the post-truth era. India gets excited about Pranav Dhanawades 1,009 from 327 balls. The rider that mostly went unread: 30 yard boundary, 10-year-old pacers, 25 chances.Mid-career crisis: And you thought Manish Pandey had made it. In January 2016, he scores 104 in 81 balls as India chase down 330 at SCG. Soon it will be January 2017. Pandey still gets chance when stars rest.Sporting rebirth: If you fail as Raju Sharma in India, you can succeed as Raju Rijal in Nepal. Mystery of how within a span of 10 years, an under-15 Mumbai junior player emerged as a under-19 Nepal captain.Negi demonetised: Never trust IPL valuations. How Pawan Negis Rs 8.5 crore cookie crumbled? Mostly on bench during the IPL season, not in Delhis Ranji probables and, now in December, released by Delhi Daredevils.Role reversal: The Ferris wheel went around a circle earlier this year, as Australian journalist Samuel Ferris tried nudging India ODI skipper MS Dhoni on the touchy retirement question. Dhoni called the scribe to sit next to him and asked Do you think I can survive till the 2019 World Cup? You should, yes, sure, the scribe was forced to concede. What goes up, and all that.Defeat to die for: If you thought bad defeats dont hurt coaches, think again. It even turns some towards potential suicide.

You need a captain and coach with the right take on the Decision Review System (DRS) which BCCI snubbed for eight seasons. Fortune favoured the brave as Virat Kohli-Anil Kumbles India won 4-0.Trouble at the top: Openers were a happy headache for Virat Kohli at the start of this year with many batsmen in form. It turned into an actual headache as they contrived to get injured by the end of the 2016. It got so bad that Kohli was forced to open with Parthiv Patel in Mohali while the selectors plucked out Gautam Gambhir from the cold. In all, India used five openers, and six different combinations in just 11 Tests. Not an open and shut case still.No homely feeling: India went into the Mumbai Test against England for the first time without a single player who could call Wankhede home; the first such instance since 1933, when Bombay Gymkhana hosted Indias first-ever Test. No wonder you didnt hear a commentator say he knows it like the back of his hand.More added to the list: Throughout his career, Kiran More was made to regret the dropped catch of Graham Gooch at Lords in 1990. Reprieved on 36, he went on to make 333. Alastair Cook can nurse a regret of his own now: he spilled a difficult one of Karun Nair on 34, and the Indian struck a triple. He has company in Adil Rashid who twice dropped Virat Kohli, who went on to make hundreds of match-changing proportions.Redemption for the royal: Once a figure of ridicule, Ravindra Jadeja silenced detractors in Tests, no less. Not only as a left-arm spinner spinning out England on a blameless pitch in Chennai, but also as a reliable lower-order batsman who batted in a restrained manner when needed. Sir-prise !!!His best delivery: As if being ICC Cricketer of the Year and Test Cricketer of the Year wasnt enough, Ravi Ashwin turned even more adorable becoming daddy to Daughter No 2. I delivered carrom baby #2 on the 21st Ashwins better half Prithi tweeted.Cricket gone to the dogs: England tried relentlessly to stop Pujara and Kohlis onslaught at Vizag. But a pitch-invader was more successful than the visitors. The game was halted when the dog was chased away, only to see it return after a while. A mongrel more dogged than the Poms and their three lions. Move over 007s, our Vizag dog has 700 followers on Twitter.Adding (financial) injury to insult: The Poms came here and literally paid for their defeats. The BCCI made the England team pay their own expenses under the pretext of a court ruling. Interest on the Kohinoor in instalments?Lights, camerapink: Not many expected the Ranji Trophy to get the much needed facelift this season. First, zonal system was scrapped. Then a shiny, pink ball and fully-lit up flood-lights suddenly gave Duleep the leap.You cant see me: Smog had its desolation moment in cricket. With visibility affected, Bengal-Gujarat and Hyderabad-Tripura  played in Delhi, split points. Bengal players had updated from monkey caps this winter to vogmasks.Goose cooked: South Africa are known to trigger captaincy changes in England with Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss stepping down after home series defeats against the Proteas. India can lay claim to Alastair Cooks head though.Wheres the star: The great AB de Villiers couldnt bat in Australia. 2016 mustve been really rotten.Reality check: By not playing the Ranji Trophy this term, Harbhajan Singh might have scripted a silent version of farewell to Tests. Ashwin now has Jayant Yadav for company.Too spicy for everyone: Heard of too many cooks spoiling the broth? Well South Africa have kind of dissed that myth. They are yet to lose a Test when both Stephen Cook and Keshav Maharaj have played together.South America is not South Asia: Months before Rio, Indias South Asian games tally: Gold: 188, Silver: 90 silver, Bronze: 30. Post-truth again.Tongas topless man for all seasons: Pita Taufatofua, the Taekwondo athlete, walked carrying Tongas flag, topless, his ripping torso oiled at the Rio opening ceremony. Hes threatening to qualify for Pyeongchangs Winter Olympics in two years time in cross-country skiing. Hell need a few thermals there though.All bases covered: Standing on the Olympic podium, under the US flag, wearing a hijab. Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Muslim girl from Maplewood, picked fencing since that would mean wearing the mask, glove, jacket, pants on sporting arena.One for the upstart: Didnt see it, Cant believe it, sang Marc Antony. Neither did Puerto Ricans imagine it. But Monica Puig won Olympics gold in tennis singles. Strains of Ricky Martins Cup of Life rent the air, this time for his compatriot.China is never too far away: It was PV Sindhu in yellow vs Carolina Marin in red that finals day of womens singles at Rio, the two hues being Chinas predominant playing colours. Shockingly, no Chinese eventually made the podium.Diving into matrimony: The Chinese decided to turn cute this Olympics. He Zi, moments after receiving a silver medal for 3m springboarding, was offered another piece of silverware. An engagement ring this time. Fellow diver and boyfriend Qin Kai went down on his knee to say the magical words. Zis ji followed.None of the above: Indias Entry List for 74kg Freestle Wrestling (Mens): Option A: Narsingh Yadav; Option B: Sushil Kumar; Option C: Parveen Rana; Option D: No one. ANSWER: D for Duh. Dont. Get. Us. Started. On. This. One.Leap into history: Sachin didnt know there was no R in Karma(r)kar two years ago when he first met Dipa, the Tripura gymnast. But everyone agreed there could be an extra U in Pro(u)dunova after Indias sensational 4th place finish in Vault.Phelps schooled: Michael Phelps may have ended the year with a photo shoot that rivalled only the gold adorning the Reddy daughter at her wedding. But Joseph Schooling, literally an autograph-seeking school-boy when Phelps last visited his home Singapore, pipped the American to the 100m fly gold.Breaking down walls: Olympics was all about climbing podiums. Now its climbing walls. The webs sport weaves to welcome Spidermen.Down Under: The Kookaburras had won everything in the lead-up to Rio, before the Dutch ditched them out in quarters. They failed to score against Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands. Come to think of it, India couldve fancied its chances against Aussies, atoning all prior sins in the grand flowing Amazon.Fashioning heartbreaks, German Hockey Style: India beaten with 3 seconds to go; Argentina denied win with a goal 8 seconds from time; and Kiwis stunned with 1 second remaining on the clock.Rising to the occasion: They were boring. Didnt win a game in 90 minutes. Finished third in their group. Dont know if Portugal were good or others that bad at Euros. But then, Ronaldo now has what Messi doesnt  a major international title. 2016s settled the matter.Having England on ice: Icelands dream run, surely, was over. But they had it in them to score a goal more than England in the Round of 16 of Euro 2016. It wound up with Roy Hodgson resigning as England coach.Stay original: The Viking Clap celebration looked good on Iceland. France trying to do an Iceland after their Euro semifinal win over Germany, though, drew a lot of criticism for their lack of creativity.Friendly fire: Sania Mirza and Martina Hingis won the Australian Open, and then made a Grand Slam final at the French, but against each other in mixed doubles. Irony is the partnership would break before the Olympics, the only tournament they arent allowed to pair up together. Not with  nor without you.Everyone loves a winner: World number 1. Wimbledon champ. And Olympic gold. Andy Murrays British identity looks safe by the end of 2016. Until he starts losing and becomes Scottish again.Rivalry for the ages: Indias next Davis Cup captain will be younger than the oldest active player. If theres one thing we know about Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi, it is that never put them in a year-ending list with finality. 20 years down the line, theyll still be at it  whatever the it is; love, hate, intrigue.Show me the money: While the general public reeled under the governments demonetisation drive, Mahesh Bhupathis International Premier Tennis League came and went without much fanfare and organisers of the Pro Wrestling League had to postpone the second edition due to cash crunch. Even Ranji Trophy teams struggled with daily allowances. Nothing la la about these Ligas.On auto pilot: Its Team Principal and managing director is absconding and chairman and co-owner Subrata Roy is out of jail on parole. And yet, Force India left all off the track problems in their slipstream in their best year ever in Formula One. They notched up a fourth-place finish, ahead of Williams and the iconic McLaren.A Lion in winter: Tiger has mellowed with age, injuries and lack of success. He was seen babysitting his teammates kids during the Ryder Cup, ensuring their families were having a good time while Team USA was conquering Europe. Who Woodve thunk!Cubs become LIons: Chicago Cubs recorded a no-hitter (when a team is not able to record a single hit) on April 21. It sat nicely with their moniker Lovable Losers. Seven months later they ended a 108 year curse to be crowned World Series champions. Americas staple of fairytale wins.Paving the way: In combat sports, UFC superstar Conor McGregor of Ireland showed his lightning-fast hands to match that motormouth. But the real story was Stipe Miocic of Cleveland. The Ohio native, a huge underdog, upset Fabricio Werdum in his den in Curitiba, Brazil, in a first-round knockout breaking the states longstanding sports curse. The Cavs followed in the NBA finals.Rest in peace: Circa 2016 proved to be bad for sports revolutionaries. Muhammad Ali, Johan Cruyff, Arnold Palmer and our very own Amal Dutta were taken out.And finally, again: L, E, I, C, E, S, T, E, R.

591f0b537be9e025a5d49fe8,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migration",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560567/bihar-state-litti-chokha-migration.html,2016-07-27,,Deccan Herald,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migrationJustin Rowlatt, Jul 28, 2016, INYT: 23:29 ISTLitti are char-grilled flavour bombs, especially when freighted with chokha, the spicy stew of grilled aubergine, tomato and potato that traditionally accompanies one of my absolute favourite Indian street foods. They come originally from Bihar.Biharis absolutely love litti chokha, as  in truth  do most people who taste it. Put it like this, the first time I went to the Bihars capital, Patna, I had people in my office begging me to bring some back. I said Id do my best, but warned I was unlikely to be allowed any food through airport security checks.Nevertheless, I arrived for the return flight with two big bags full of the stuff. The security officers at Patna airport sniffed suspiciously, but, when I told them what and why, they broke into smiles and waved me right on through.Clearly, they judged it was more important to get a consignment of the states most celebrated street food to hungry fans than enforce a few petty restrictions and regulations.Litti are pastry balls, packed full of a spicy mash made with sattu  roasted chickpea flour. They are roasted in beds of charcoal  or, sadly a rarity these days, dried cow dung  and then dipped in salty melted ghee, clarified butter. A couple of these will be served with a decent dollop of chokha, as well as some yoghurt sauce and a scoop of hot, sour pickle. Yes, I thought that would get your mouth watering.You find litti wherever Biharis go, and since Biharis go almost everywhere in India, that means youve got a chance of tasting this delicious snack almost anywhere in the country. Youve got to keep your eyes peeled, though.Look out for the tell-tale pall of smoke from the charcoal and the queue of wiry, tough-looking men. Wiry men, because one of the few things Bihar is famous for in India  apart from litti  is migration.Historic cityThe state capital was once the greatest centre of learning and culture on the sub-continent. When the Greek ambassador Megasthenes visited in 302 BC  yes, it was a while back  he was stunned by Pataliputra, as Patna was then known. The city stretched for nearly 10 miles along the banks of the Ganges.It had, Megasthenes reported, 64 gates and 570 towers, not to mention gardens, palaces, temples and stables full of war elephants. I have seen the great cities of the east, he wrote, I have seen the Persian palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, but this is the greatest city in the world. No visitor would say that of Patna today.Buddha achieved enlightenment in Bihar, the state was home to worlds first residential university and was the powerbase from which Ashoka built the first pan-Indian empire, famous for its tolerance and pluralism. But sadly the capital has not  how shall I put this?  retained the elegance of the ancient city.Poverty-stricken stateTruth be told, modern Patna is a great sprawling, poverty-stricken megatropolis. Which should be no surprise because Bihar has a population of over 100 million people, larger than any western European country, and is one of the poorest states in India. It recorded an average per capita income of just $682 in 2015, less than half of the $1,627 average income nationally.Last year, I managed to get hold of a copy of a vast health survey carried out by the government with the UN agency for children, Unicef. The report had been due for publication in October 2014 but the government had decided to keep it secret.Flip through page after page of statistics and you can see why. Youll also discover why so many Biharis have decided to go in search of work elsewhere. The report shows that in 2013-14 half of children under the age of five in Bihar were stunted, a third were underweight and three quarters of households practised open defecation.Now comes the good news. A few years ago a new technocratic state government made tackling graft and promoting economic growth its priority, and Bihar  which had become a byword for caste division, crime and corruption  started scoring double-digit growth.Thats good news for the people of Bihar, but not for lovers of litti, like me. Because heres the rub: as a result, migration from the state has fallen dramatically.The fear is that the litti chokha stalls dotted across India that ensure that Bihari migrants still get a taste of the best of home will pack up shop and go home too. Then this wonderful street food snack will be even harder to find."

While a pizza is a treat for a shared occasion, largely consumed for lunch and dinner, we find that a burger is an all-day snacky item, mostly meant for individual consumption. While we are a pizza brand, we wanted to participate in the individual consumption occasion, and hence came out with a new product BurgerPizza responding to that trend.The BurgerPizza, as the name says, looks like a burger, but has a lot of pizza goodness packed within such as fresh tomatoes, veggies, and mozarella cheese, sandwiched in a pair of oven-made buns. The product has two variants each for vegetarian and non-vegetarian, priced from Rs 89.Explaining the strategy, Narayanaswamy said, There is a lot of opportunity to grow in the said trend. While we couldve launched a burger ouselves, we realise that were a pizza brand, and used our expertise to create a pizza in another form. BurgerPizza will allow the company to tap the burger occasion, and acquire a bigger pie of the QSR industry as a whole, while also establishing a new category.According to Euromonitor, the informal eating out (IEO) industry was valued at $121.7 billion in 2015, and is expected to grow by 8% in 2016. The QSR industry is valued at $18.9 billion of the total IEO market in India. The burger and pizza markets  which set a rage in India  are valued at around Rs 3,200 crore each.Talking about the QSR market in India, Narayanaswamy said that the industry has potential to grow. But the market contribution in QSR is still from the top 20 metros. Opportunities come by even in smaller tier II and III markets, which must be viewed differently from the metros. Yet, an aware consumer-base, with fair amount of exposure to global food, means that people know what to demand, he said, adding that Dominos has constantly made innovations in its products.Meanwhile, Dominos Pizza leads the chained pizza market in India, holding on to a 72% market share. The company added 150 new restaurants in FY16, taking the overall tally to 1,039 Dominos Pizza outlets across 240 cities, as of May 28.We are known as delivery and pizza experts. We are open to opportunities in the market. As concerns the BurgerPizza, the product has been developed in India for this market, Narayanaswamy hinted, not divulging further details."

Of them, 5,650 or 4.29 per cent, were farmers. Of these, 64.5 per cent were marginal and small farmers.The Bureau also reported that 25.6 per cent of farmers suicides were due to bankruptcy and indebtedness. According to the Niti Aayog head Arvind Panagaria, who conducted a survey in 2008, 20.35 per cent of these suicides were due to drinking and gambling, 16.81 per cent due to failure of crops, 2.65 per cent due to indebtedness and fall in agricultural prices each.The remaining 57.54 per cent were due to other reasons like discord in the family etc. In 2014, 4,400 farmers committed suicide due to drinking and gambling and 1,250 due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices while 3,672 farmers who committed suicide were marginal and small farmers.Suicides committed by farmers due to drinking, gambling and family discordsetc, cannot be termed as agriculture related though persons committing suicides were farmers. But suicides due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices are farmer-specific.Farmers are distressed because of three reasons: their landholdings are uneconomic and unviable; failure of crops due to floods and draughts; and fall in agricultural prices. After Independence, the number of marginal and small land holdings has increased due to land reforms. For example, when land reforms were implemented in Karnataka in 1971, the number of land holdings with less than two hectares was 29,22,000. By 2011, it was 59,87,000.According to the Department of Agriculture in Karnataka, the size of the land holding should be 2.56 hectares to be economically viable. The average size of land holdings of these marginal and small farmers also increased, though marginally, from 0.60 in 1971 to 0.81 in 2011, still leaving the holding economically unviable. It was quite natural that the number of suicides by these farmers also increased.To alleviate the problems of the marginal and small farmers, some people have suggested providing them with improved inputs. But the proper solution to the problem lies in encouraging cooperative farming. If farmers can pool their land by forming a cooperative, then the problem of unviability of the small holdings can be overcome as they will get the benefit of economies of scale. While a single small farmer cannot on his own dig a borewell or buy a tractor, a cooperative farm can easily do so. This may also to a great extent help the small farmers in overcoming the problem of fall in prices of agricultural produce.While a single small farmer may not have the capacity to store his produce and sell it only when he gets a better price and, hence, has to opt for distress sale, a farming cooperative can create such storing capacity and sustain itself when the agricultural prices fall. It is only then that a small land holding can become economically viable and prevent the losses.Since a farming cooperative with large tracts of land in its possession can go for multiple cropping, even if the prices of one or two of its produces fall, no member will be ruined because he will be sharing the profits earned by the cooperative from other produces.Agricultural pricesFailure of crops, which accounts for 16.81 per cent of the suicides committed by farmer, happens mostly due to floods or droughts which are natural phenomena. While crop insurance can be an answer to floods, irrigation could be the answer to droughts.The loss to farmers due to fall in agricultural prices is a man-made phenomenon. Since the demand for agricultural produce is by and large stable, the reason for the fall in agricultural prices is over-production.For example, if tomato fetches a good price in any one year, all farmers opt to grow tomatoes with the result that in the next year, there is over-production and the prices fall. There have been instances when farmers have thrown away their produce on the roads as they could not get a fair price.Some people have suggested solutions sans markets to this problem of fall in agricultural prices. They suggest that a floor price for agricultural produce should be fixed by law and no one should be allowed to sell his produce at a price lower than the statutory price. But then, the problem of fall in agricultural prices is not legal but an economic one and therefore, a legal solution to an economic problem will not ultimately work.Some have suggested the solution of a government intervention in the market by fixing support prices. But since the problem is one of over-production, this will only increase the financial burden on the government rather than solve the problem.The prices of agricultural produce in the markets fall when there is more supply than demand. The demand for agricultural produce, as compared to industrial produce, is more or less fixed. Hence, the demand cannot be reduced. But supply can be regulated to equalise with the demand. In the first instance, supply can be contained at the time of production itself. Since the demand is known, if the farmers can plan their supply, the fall in prices that happens due to over-production can be prevented.To achieve this, production will have to be meticulously planned at the national or at least at the state level. Secondly, if the far-mers can store their produce when the pri-ces fall and wait till the prices rise, they can overcome the problem of excessive supply.If large cooperative farms are encouraged and farming cooperatives can form a federation, it should be possible to plan what to produce and how much to produce depending on the demand. Only such solutions can solve the problems of the farmers and prevent them from committing suicides."

591f62b47be9e025a5d4dbcc,India set to go  on organic diet,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521019/india-set-go-organic-diet.html,2016-01-03,,Deccan Herald,"Mamta Bhardwaj Jan 04, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTOne of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under organic certification, India has an organic food market estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."
591fba827be9e025a5d51795,"FM hits back at Rahul, says NDA has brought down inflation",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560718/fm-hits-back-rahul-says.html,2016-07-28,,Deccan Herald,"New Delhi, Jul 28, 2016, PTI 20:16 ISTHitting back at Rahul Gandhi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today reeled out statistics in Lok Sabha to assert that the NDA government had brought down inflation and expressed hope that prices of essential commodites will come down further after a ""good"" monsoon.After Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and alleged that the government had failed to control prices, particularly of the essential commodities, Jaitley contended that the NDA government had inherited high inflation from the UPA dispensation.""Any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics,"" he told the Congress Vice President while intervening in a debate on price rise and asked him to compare the status of inflation during the UPA government and that prevailing now.Referring to Gandhi's attack on Modi for criticising the then Congress-led government over inflation in February 2014, Jaitley said, ""This is a topic of statistics and not sloganeering. The UPA had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if I come to power, I will try to bring inflation down. No one should have any objection to that.""Insisting that the Modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the Finance Minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon.He acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply.Noting that India has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes.The output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, Jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the Food Ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control.He also criticised Gandhi for asking the Prime Minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates.The government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and India is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said.""You are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts,"" Jaitley said.Jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked Rahul Gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought.""Even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of UPAs and not NDA... We have contained inflation despite having two years of drought. Good monsoon helps economy and with good monsoon this year, I expect that the prices of will come down,"" Jaitley said.He said the UPA had left the economy in a dire state, with Consumer Price Index (CPI) and food inflation at double digit, WPI inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited.He cautioned UPA against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"".Taking a jibe at Gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this House seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"".He said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of UPA regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim.The NDA government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative WPI inflation, the Finance Minister said.Giving reply to members' concerns on how the government has utilised the gains on account of drop in crude oil prices, Jaitley said the gains have been utilised in three ways -- to help oil PSUs to reduce their losses on account of subsidy, to invest in infrastructure and benefit common people by enabling them to shell out less money in buying petroleum products.He said 42 per cent of the gains due to fall in global crude oil prices is shared with the states with the Centre retaining 58 per cent of the share.""It is because of these policies to shore up public investment that for two years in a row that India has emerged as the fastest growing economy. It is mainly because of public inbvestment and foreign investment that we are growing at a respectable rate, but we are not satisfied as we have greater potential,"" Jaitley said.""When the going is good, economies grow, but it is only when the going is challenging then the real challenge arises,"" he said.Countering Gandhi's remark that the UPA government had waived off farm loans, Jaitley said the NDA government's policies are not one-time and are instead more sustainable towards building rural infrastructure, irrigation facility and sanitation for upliftment of poor.""All these steps taken by the government will propel India to better economy,"" he said.Jaitley said July is the month when, due to seasonal factors, food inflation usually sees an upward trend and after the new crop comes, prices would fall.Terming as ""new economic equation"" Gandhi's remarks that prices of pulses should come down when MSPs are hiked, Jaitley said inflation is a matter of demand-supply mismatch.""This equation I have heard for the first time. The situation is that MSP of pulses is raised but production did not increase and there was two consecutive years of rainfall shortage,"" he said, adding this year rain Gods have been kind enough.He said there is demand for 23 MT of pulses this year while the output is 17 MT. The remaining 6 MT would be procured from Myanmar, Mozambique and Tanzania.The acreage data for the new crop year shows that the output will go up to 20 million tonnes and the government is working towards increasing the buffer stock to 20 lakh tonnes.With regard to sugar prices, Jaitley said the current price is reeling around Rs 33-34/kg and the government is working to lower it by Rs 1-2/ kg to ensure right price to consumers and better returns to farmers.He said sugar price had come down to Rs 22-23/kg and farmers were not able to get their cost back and sugar mills were on the verge of closing down. The total dues of farmers from mills have been brought down from Rs 27,000 crore to Rs 1,800 crore.When prices started going up to Rs 40 per kg, the government brought in export restriction and that cooled prices, the Finance Minister said.As regards onion prices, Jaitley said prices were lower till 3-4 months back and the Centre had to purchase 20,000 tonnes extra produce from farmers.Tomato prices, he assured, will come down after the monsoon season.Jaitley said the UPA government policies had led to a situation where global publications were talking about policy paralysis and exit of 'I' from BRICS grouping.""Private investment was weak, the state of economy was such that banking system's ability to support growth had come down,"" he said, adding that back of envelop calculations not necessarily forms part of good economic policies.Defending the move to hike excise duty on petrol and diesel when global crude oil prices were falling, Jaitley said at a time when global growth was witnessing slowdown and banks had limited capacity to lend, the government had no other option than to garner as much resources as possible to stabilise the economy.When oil prices slumped in the second half of 2014 and 2015, the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel nine times to mop up additional revenues that helped it meet ts revenue and fiscal deficit targets. In all, it raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 11.77 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre.Participating in the debate, Saugata Ray (TMC) said the government's economic policies are based on two parameters-- windfall from crude prices and cess pool.He said the Finance Minister failed to provide a clear roadmap as to how it plans to bring down prices and instead he pinned his hope on good monsoon. He wanted to know why the government acts only after the prices have moved up.He said the Prime Minister, who had been meeting world leaders including US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, did not hold a single meeting on price rise.Hukmdev Narayan Yadav (BJP) said the opposition is frustrated with the government as it is taking several steps to bring back black money and hence they are trying to raise the matter of price rise in the House.B Mahtab (BJD) said both the Congress-led UPA and BJP-led NDA have failed to tame the demon of inflation.""Prise rise is symptom and inflation is disease"", he said, adding unless the government deals with inflation it would not be possible to contain inflation.Mahtab added that the government should deal with the supply side issues to contain inflation which has been adversely affecting the large section of population.Apparently referring to RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, he said the person who has been trying to deal with inflation is now going back to Chicago because someone in the ruling dispensation has asserted that he was not a nationalist.Tariq Anwar (NCP) said before coming to power NDA leaders promised to bring down inflation but have nothing to contain price rise.Describing Jaitley's intervention during the debate as ""disappointing"", Anwar said people have no choice but to bear the burden of rising prices.Taking a dig at Modi's initiative to provide cooking gas to poor, he said, now the people have gas but nothing to cook as essential kitchen items are beyond his reach.He wanted to know why the government always fails to take advance action to deal with rising prices.Jayadev Galla (TDP) suggested that central government should have a separate budget for agriculture sector though it could very well merge railway budget with the general budget.He further said that government should consider including pulses in the ambit of the Food Security Act and increase food subsidy to 10 per cent of the GDP from a little of two per cent presently.BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuvraj' (prince) did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014.She said one day Rahul is having tea here and another day at Kalavati's home, which she termed as ""political tourism"".Gandhi had visited the home of Kalavati Bandurkar, the Vidarbha farmer widow in 2008, and had also mentioned about her in Parliament.Mahajan described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 'Loh purush' (Iron Man)' and said the ""sleeping beauty who sleeps here is questioning the 'Iron Man',"" an apparent reference to the Congress Vice President.She said Congress had played politics with the slogan of 'Gharibi Hataao (eradicate poverty)' for a long time.Referring to her home state Maharashtra, she claimed that a large number of farmers committed suicide during the time of Congress governments.Shrirang Appa Barne (Shiv Sena) said the government has not been able to control the price situation even though efforts are being made. The government's priority should be to control price rise, which is affecting poor people the most, he added.Dharmendra Yadav (SP) said farmers have not received any benefit from price rise, adding that there does not seem to be much difference between Congress and BJP governments as under both of them farmers have been weakened.Jayprakash Narayan Yadav (RJD) cautioned that the ""tsunami of price rise"" is a bad signal for the government.Stating that mere use of sophisticated words cannot help in controlling price rise, A P Jithender Reddy (TRS) said lot of people are feeling the pinch. He also urged the government to ""bailout people"" from the clutches of inflation.M Rajamohan Reddy (YSR Cong) urged the government to put in place a comprehensive food pricing and management policy.Kaushalendra Kumar (JD-U), Riti Pathak and Uday Pratap Singh (both BJP) also spoke."

Urad and tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and 75 in February 2014, has gone up to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month.In a dig at the NDA government's second ""happy birthday"" celebrations, the Congress Vice President said the Prime Minister did not even utter a single word about rising prices during this event and sought to know why he did that.Accusing the government of waiving Rs 52,000 crore of the corporates, Gandhi asked what benefit the government has given to the farmers and housewives of the savings amounting Rs 2 lakh crore it has made from the slump in the crude prices.He also questioned the NDA's flagship programmes like Make in India, Stand Up India and said ""the 'Make in India' programme has not got given a single job to the youth.""Gandhi said the price of pulses and vegetables have gone over the roof after the NDA came to power and the farmers have not been able to get any benefit of the steep rise in the price of these commodities.Recalling Modi's speech at a poll rally in Himachal Pradesh in February 2014, Gandhi said while attacking the then UPA government over the issue, he had said said that 'ma- bachche raat raat rote hain, aasoon pee ke sote hain' (mother and child cry the whole night and sleep drinking the tears).""What a dialogue,"" Gandhi said thrice, taking a dig at Modi who was not present in the House.""I want to remind the Prime Minister of the promises he made to the people of the country during the poll campaign, which Modiji does not talk about now and has forgotten. He had also promised that when the BJP government comes to power, it will bring down the prices,"" Gandhi said.He said there was a gap between the minimum support price for tur dal given to the farmers was Rs 45 whereas its price in the market was Rs 75. Now, the MSP has risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulses was now Rs 180.""So, there is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government. Where is this Rs 100 going,"" Gandhi asked.""People in villages are chanting a new slogan, 'Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi"", Rahul said winding up his speech.Under the Modi government, Rahul said, dal prices have risen 120 per cent.""During the Congress government the difference between the MRP (Maximum Retail Price) and the market price was Rs 30, but today it is Rs 130,"" the Congress vice president said.Rahul declared that the Modi government should name a date when the prices of vegetable and dals will come back down to normal levels. ""This is a very serious matter and the truth is you can't make false promises about this,"" he added."

This is the geography of the 49 years old Kinathukadavu Assembly Constituency, which came to existence in 1967. Of course delimitations have taken place over the years.So far, only the All India Anna Dravida Munetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) have been successful in this constituency that has seen 11 assembly elections till 2011. AIADMK has been the most successful party as their candidates have been elected as MLA seven times including hat-trick victories by the sitting MLA S. Damodaran from 2001.But, over the years many woes of the people in this semi urban assembly segment has not seen a solution and in fact they seem to be on the rise.Dump yardThe key issue is dumping 850 tonnes of garbage that Coimbatore Corporation is dumping at the 650 acre Vellalore dump yard every day.It is affecting residents of that town panchayat and Podanur. Even water from borewells 1 km away is yellow and is not potable, says organiser of Vellalore Dump Yard Opposition Committee J. Daniel Jesudas.People suffer breathing difficulty and other ailments in this region.While it will take decades for repairing the damage caused by this dump yard both leading parties dont seem to have understood the magnitude of the issue and demands of the people here. AIADMK candidate A. Shanmugam said Amma has taken steps for redressing this grievance.DMK candidate Kurichi Prabakaran said that Kalaignar in his manifesto announced garbage segregation and electricity generation from the yard without affecting people.On the other hand, Marumalarchi Dravida Munetra Kazhagam candidate V. Eswaran has been fighting for the cause and has even filed a case before the Green Tribunal in 2012.The other important issue is the encroachment of revenue lands and areas close to the forest by educational institutions, agricultural lands and thousands of houses, affecting the course of canals. It has reflected with groundwater depletion and increase in man-animal conflicts.Sadly, candidates of leading parties are not taking up this issue as it would turn into negative votes.Proposal to lay the GAIL pipeline will affect nearly 1,500 farmers in the assembly. Petroleum companies are planning to lay more pipelines for other projects through a vast stretch of agricultural lands in this constituency. We want a representative who will raise his voice in the assembly. This has not happened in the last five years, P. Kandhasamy, State general secretary of farmers association said.Tomato cultivation is widely done at Kinathukadavu and nearby areas rain shadow regions.Farmers are dependent on rain-fed irrigation and expect steady viable price for their produce and units to be established to make value added products that will fetch them a good price.Improving ground water availability would make irrigation possible round the year.Thousands of people from Kinathukadavu worked in large numbers in the industrial units at Kurichi and Malumichampatti SIDCO industrial estates.But, many have lost their jobs due to various reasons that affected the industries there and want these units to be revived and to create more jobs.Speedy completion of the broad gauge conversion between Coimbatore and Pollachi, and establishing more railway stations on this stretch, mending damaged village roads and starting mini bus connectivity between the villages were other important demands of Kinathukadavu assembly segment."

Around six lakh people were affected by floods in Allahabad, reports said.As the floodwater entered thousands of houses trapping the inmates inside, the administration sought help of the IAF personnel to drop food packets and water bottles in the affected areas. In Varanasi, the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Ganga was flowing 121 cm above the danger mark and its water has entered many localities in the town. Its tributaries Varuna and Assi were also flowing above danger marks. Boats have been plying in dense localities in the town.Movement of vehicles on the Mirzapur-Allahabad highway came to a halt after floodwater damaged the roads at many places. Teams of National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in the flood-affected districts.Gives birth on boatIn Banda district of Bundelkhand region, a woman gave birth on a boat late on Monday while being taken to hospital. Shankarpurwa, the village which the woman belongs to, was marooned owing to floods.The state government has directed district magistrates to visit the flood-affected areas and monitor the relief and rescue operations.Officials have been asked to coordinate relief efforts with the IAF personnel.The toll in the flood related incidents has gone up to 30. Two people drowned in Ken river after their car was swept away in Banda district on Tuesday, sources said.Vegetable prices skyrocket after floodsEven though the Ganga and its tributariesSone and Punpunhave started showing a receding trend in the last 36 hours, vegetable prices in and around the state capital have skyrocketed, DHNS reports from Patna.The reason is that a large part of the diara areas (riverine belt) and surrounding villages in central Bihar, which grow huge quantity of vegetables, remain largely submerged due to swollen rivers. This has resulted in leafy vegetables going out of stock. The prices of those which are available like ladies finger, brinjal, tomato, parwal, green chillies and coriander have increased by 30 to 50%.The steep hike is primarily because the vegetable-producing areas like Fatuha, Bakhtiyarpur and Raghopur remain submerged due to the overflowing Ganga and its tributaries. Patna is like a saucer. It is surrounded by three rivers with Ganga/Gandak on the north, Sone in the west and Punpun in the south. With all the rivers in spate, most of thevegetable- producing areas are underwater, explained Suresh Kumar, a retailer."

However, not many state governments have evinced an interest as they are not keen to add to the list of items sold through the public distribution system. Only four states Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Maharashtra have lifted some quantity of pulses from the buffer stock.The Centre has offered to supply unmilled toor dal at Rs 66 per kg and urad at Rs 82 per kg to state governments with a directive against selling it beyond Rs 120 per kg."

""The rule on creamy layer is in place since UPA rule in 2004. You are painting a wrong picture...we are just following the same rule,"" he said, adding that the BJP and the NDA government are committed towards reservation for OBCs.Home Minister Rajnath Singh clarified that information is sought from OBC candidates about creamy layer to avoid court cases by other candidates. ""Their interests are not harmed. It is sought to avoid litigation,"" he said.Singh assured that he was ready to get the issue examined, even though there was no confusion.Some members claimed that following the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations, children of government employees working in the lower rung cannot make it to services like IAS and IPS as the income criteria in the creamy layer formula creates hindrances.Hukum Deo Narain Yadav (BJP) said the National Commission for Backwards should be granted constitutional status to give it more teeth in tackling cases of violation of OBC rights.K C Venugopal (Cong) raised the issue of price rise and said there is a ""general feeling"" that the ""government is not taking enough steps"" to curb inflation. While diesel, petrol and kerosene price are already high, prices of other essential commodities are set to go up during festival season, he said.Demanding a short duration discussion on price rise, he said prices of pulses to tomatoes have exceeded their average rates from 40 to 130 per cent.Gajendra Singh Shekhawat (BJP) said some academic institutions have done away with five per cent reservation for children of Kashmiri migrants and demanded action against such institutes by the HRD Ministry.Sanjay Jaiswal (BJP) lamented that Health Minister J P Nadda has not come up with a statement on reports that NEET paper were up for sale.Maintaining that there was a need to hold the entrance exams in a transparent way, he said ""If need be, they should be held again"" and claimed that students were being made to pay anything from Rs 10 lakh to 50 lakh for leaked question papers."

Their votes will go to the one local community leaders will suggest. We dont know which symbol stands for which party. Our village headman will advise us on whom to vote, admitted Jyotilal Hansda, a land tiller hailing from the Santhal community. He was speaking for his wife, Hela, and his son, Karmu, who will be voting for the first time this year. Jyotilal and his familys immediate concerns are four square meals. Their source of subsistence is a kind of gruel, made of steamed rice kept overnight in a bowl of water.The accompaniment is often one burnt tomato mashed in with chillies, both vegetables grown in the familys less than half an acre plot. As Jyotilal talked to Deccan Herald on a searing hot, summer afternoon, slurping in his share of the gruel from a plastic bowl, he said that things have always been like this for them.The village headmen instructed which symbol to cast their vote for and they pressed the button next to the suggested symbol, be it the twin flowers and a blade of grass, representing Trinamool Congress, the hammer-sickle-star of the Left or the Congresss upright palm. Jyotilal, however, finds the reigning government acceptable ever since Mamata started providing rice at Rs 2 a kg. Proper roads snaking through the village, an electricity connection, which keeps the two LED lamps, also a part of the governments largesse, and a deep tube-well that mostly provides clean water, have made him believe that this government is good. Now weve the things we need the most. The field provides us with basic vegetables and the nearby ration shop supplies us a monthly quota of 15 Kg rice at Rs 2, he said. Waving her arms around the singe-storey house, with two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, Hela pointed at the walls and talked of how the house with public funds have helped her family survive the extreme temperatures of Purulia, where on summer days the mercury often touches 47 degrees Celsius and in winters it dips down to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius.Even though the house has been built under Indira Awas Yojana, a Central government scheme, she and Jyotilal believe the present government is to be thanked.Baleshwar Majhi, a landless worker mostly dependent on 100 days work under MGNREGA, however, does not seem happy with Mamata.Although not sure who Mamata is, he does not believe she has done much for people like him. Theres hardly any work available. We wish the government arranged for more work, he said. Like most men from his community, he finds solace in drinking undistilled country liquor, made by fermenting day-old rice in water. Political developments mean nothing for him and he does not know of the changes around, he admitted.I have never even seen this man in my life, he said, pointing at a poster of Nepal Mahato, the sitting Congress MLA, who is fighting to retain his seat. When posed the question to him, he asked, Who should I vote for? The village headman, who did not want to be named, admitted that most voters in the area are like Jyotilal and Baleshwar. Affiliated to the Congress, he hopes the villagers will cast for the symbol of his choice and help his candidate regain the seat.DH News Service"

More than a dozen Congress MLAs and 25 former MLAs and Ministers took part in the march.Rohtak Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda was also present.The BJP government in Haryana has been facing major opposition to its recently-launched crop insurance scheme from the Opposition, including the Indian National Lok Dal. The scheme purportedly aimed at protecting the interests of the farmers is, ironically, being opposed by farmers as well at some places.Saying that the march on Saturday was just a warning to the BJP government to mend its anti-farmer ways, Mr. Hooda said, adding that the scheme was being imposed on the farmers without their consent and premium was being directly deducted from their accounts. The terms and conditions of the scheme are all anti-farmers. It is a scheme to benefit the private insurance agencies and not the farmers. The BJP government in Haryana is acting on the behalf of these companies instead of protecting the interests of the farmers. They cannot do this, said Mr. Hooda.The scheme treats a village as a unit, which puts the farmer at a disadvantage while the premium is being collected from all the farmers. If the government claims to be pro-farmer, it must pay the entire premium and insure the farmers, demanded Mr. Hooda.He said that farmers in the State were in a bad shape and not getting adequate price for their produce. Blaming the BJP government for their plight, Mr. Hooda said that though the prices of agricultural produce such as tomatoes, paddy, cotton and onion had nose-dived, the end consumers were not getting it at any cheaper rates.He said that all sections of the society had become fed up with the government and had lost all hopes. The BJP government came to power both at Centre and in State making a host of promises, but they have failed to deliver on them. But now the masses had no hope from them. They have lost all hopes, said Mr. Hooda.The Congress leaders later submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Governor, to the Karnal Deputy Commissioner demanding that the scheme be immediately withdrawn."

PTI photo Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha, Thursday. PTI photoTAKING ON Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the rise in the prices of pulses, vegetables and other essential commodities, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the government of having made false promises and sought a definite date for when inflation will be controlled.You may make as many shallow promises as you want but give us a date by when the prices of dal will come down, Rahul said in the Lok Sabha during a debate on price rise initiated by CPI(M) floor leader P Karunakaran. This was his first intervention in the current session. The Prime Minister was, however, not present in the House.The Modi government celebrated its second happy birthday a few days back. While addressing the people, he spoke about Make in India, Connect India, Digital India, but he does not talk about price rise. Not once did he talk about pulses, potatoes and tomatoes, Rahul said.He also referred to the BJP poll slogan  Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi  to take a dig at the Prime Minister. A new slogan is now getting popular in the villages: Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, he said.The Congress leader said that in 2014, a kilo of tomato cost Rs 18, which, he added, has now gone up to Rs 55. Urad and Tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and Rs 75 respectively in February 2014, have risen to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month, he added. Rahul further said that when the minimum support price (MSP) for Tur dal was Rs 45, its market value was Rs 75. MSP has now risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulse is 180. There is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government, he said, seeking to know were this over Rs 100 was going. He alleged that the government had waived off Rs 52,000 crore owed by corporates and wondered what it had given farmers and housewives from the Rs 2 lakh crore it had saved due to a slump in crude prices.Watch Video: Whats making newsHitting back, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said such issues are settled through policies and not by setting dates. You are talking about a government (UPA) which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. Any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. These are backed by hard facts. This is a matter of statistics and not sloganeering, he said.On Rahuls reference to prices of essential commodities, Jaitley said sarcastically, everybody seems to be going to market everyday. He claimed that the Modi Government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country had seen a negative WPI inflation.The finance minister asserted that the NDA government had brought down prices and expressed the hope that with a good monsoon this year, prices would further reduce. He acknowledged that high prices of pulses remained a matter of concern but pointed out that steps were afoot to reduce the gap between demand and supply. He said India produced the maximum amount of pulses, recorded their highest consumption and imported the maximum amount. While the demand was for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes. He said the production of pulses was expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5922dff97be9e01fd59ac29d,A tale of parched Maharashtra village: Each family in Shilatane village spends Rs 100 a day to buy water,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/waterless-maharashtra-pune-water-buy-expensive-parched-each-family-in-shilatane-village-spends-rs-100-a-day-to-buy-water-2814250/,2016-05-23,,Indian Express,"Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day. Shilatane villagers spend Rs 50 per barrel, which can store up to 200 litre of water. On an average, a family needs twobarrels a day.AS ONE enters the village Shilatane, around 50 kms from Pune, a prominent sight that meets ones eyes are large-size blue colour barrels placed outside each house. Since past three months, the dwellers of this village have been buying water, spending Rs 50 for each barrel that can store 200 litre of water. On an average, a family buys at least two barrels of water; the number varies if the members in the family are more.Ask Nanda Vilas Chavan, a housewife, whos busy pouring water into a small vessel from one of the barrels, about the water situation in her village, and she responds, Although we have been using water judiciously for last three months, we need at least two barrels of water every day, given that we have five members in the family. A barrel comes for Rs 50 and thus, we end up spending Rs 100 every day. The amount is not easy to shell out as our only source of income is agriculture, which is also badly affected by water shortage.Asha Vijay Bhanusghare, another woman says, Our entire monthly budget has got disturbed. We are spending Rs 3,000 to 4,000 every month only on water. Its a basic necessity for survival and one cannot cut costs here. And so even though we are reducing our expenses in other areas, we are keeping aside this amount every month.The village, which has a population of 2,500 people, is one of the 40 villages that are located around River Indrayani, which is currently completely dry. The river originates in Kurvande village, near Lonavala. The sarpanch of the village Shilatane, Hemant Shivaji Bhanusghare, informs that the rivers water dried in January itself and since then, the water condition has been bad.The villagers, he says, depend on Indrayani for water needed for agriculture and their cattle. It is not the first time that it has happened. This is a struggle we face every year. Hence, all the farmers have shifted to single crops, he says, adding, Theres nothing we can do after January. You can find barren farm lands across this area. The drinking water through water pipeline connected to Pavana Dam is supplied to all villages once in four days. Around 40,000 litre of water cannot last for four days in a village that has 2,500 people. The situation of houses that are situated on the higher side is worse because the water pressure is so low that it cannot reach them. People have no choice but to buy water from the tankers. The villagers are taking their cattle 2 km away from village for water. Even the milk production of cows and buffaloes has reduced due to shortage of fodder and water, he says.Chandrakant Andre, a farmer, shares that in comparison to previous years, when he grew potato, tomato, onion and sugarcane, now he grows just one crop in a year as there is no water for agriculture, which has reduced his annual income. Andre says he is waiting for rains, after which he will sow either jawar or chana.Prafull Kadam, a water activist who works in the area, cites that while Valvan Dam is just six kms from the village, the village gets water from Pavana Dam, which is 16-17 km away. Till 18-20 years ago, the Tata firm that owns the Valvan Dam would leave water in Indrayani river during summers. Later, they shifted focus to hydroelectricity and hence, stopped leaving water. And then began our sufferings. Its sad that people with limited income have to buy water especially when the state water policy GR states that drinking water should be given priority, says Kadam.Kadam says that though people suggest watershed as a possible solution, it doesnt have much scope at this time of the year for various reasons. Landholding capacity is less here; the area has hard rock; space for water structure treatment is not there; and instead of an even ground, the area has slopes.

Edna Pesis (left) and Susan Luria.After drip irrigation-cum-fertigation, tissue culture and protected cultivation of vegetables, fruits and flowers, dissemination of Israeli post-harvest know-how is the latest focus of the Indo-Israel Agricultural Project (IIAP).Value-addition in horticultural crops is not just about processing and selling juices. It is also about technologies to maintain the quality of fresh produce for delivering in that form to consumers in distant locations or to harvest, say, pomegranates in September for selling in the US or Europe during the Christmas and New Year season, points out Susan Lurie, professor emeritus at the Department of Postharvest Science of Fresh Produce in the Agricultural Research Organization of Israels Ministry of Agriculture.Israel, according to her, has lot to offer to India when it comes to preservation of quality  texture, appearance, colour, taste, aroma, and nutritional and health attributes  of fresh farm produce, especially for exports to foreign markets.Most of what we produce  from cherry tomatoes and capsicum to mangoes, bananas, pomegranates, lychees, guavas and papayas  is for selling outside Israel. Unlike us, India is big and more like the US, where they grow in California to sell in New York or Boston. Theres no reason you cannot do the same here, which is where we can help, adds Lurie.Edna Pesis, an expert from the same department that is said to be the worlds largest research centre for post-harvest management, illustrates this through the example of mangoes. Mangoes are susceptible to diseases after harvest and prolonged storage, as a result of psychological changes occurring in the fruits that enable fungal pathogen development.An effective means to address the problem is through hot water brushing treatment  spraying a jet of water at about 52 degrees Celsius for 15-20 seconds on the harvested fruits in packing lines. This is followed by drying and waxing or wrapping the fruits with a layer of organic/synthetic waxing material. Hot water brushing significantly reduces decay from fungal development, while waxing prevents water loss that leads to shrinkage and premature ripening of the fruits. Both together help improve the keeping quality and general appearance of the mangoes in supermarket shelves.These apart, there are also other technologies like modified atmosphere packaging that involves covering the fresh produce with special permeable plastic films to reduce humidity. Fruits and vegetables are naturally respiring products, resulting in the condensation of their vapours into water and lowering shelf life. The mistake many people do is to take the harvested fruits directly to the cold storage. Doing that can cause not only shrinkage, but also makes the fruits prone to scalding and chilling injury, explains Pesis.The two Israeli women scientist-experts are part of a visiting team under the IIAP, a programme currently operational in nine states: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. We are now extending this to six other states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Mizoram and Goa, says Dan Alluf, Counsellor (Science & Agriculture) with Mashav, Israels Agency for International Development Corporation.The IIAP, which is a joint collaboration between Mashav and the Indian governments Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture plus the participating states, is being implemented via centres of excellence.Currently, there are 14 such fully active centres: four in Maharashtra (for citrus, pomegranate, and Alphonso and Kesar mangoes), three in Haryana (vegetables, citrus, pomegranate and mango), two in Gujarat (Kesar mango and vegetables), two in Rajasthan (pomegranate and citrus), two in Punjab (vegetables and citrus) and one in Tamil Nadu (vegetables).The programme began in 2009. Our aim is to have 26 centres of excellence in all the participating states, which would act as the catalyst for showcasing Israeli agricultural technology/know-how and taking these to farmers fields. The new areas we are looking at are post-harvest management, water recycling for agricultural use, agricultural machinery and organic farming, informs Alluf.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
592312cf7be9e01fceefed9d,"There's no place like home, even in the Chernobyl disaster zone",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/542440/theres-no-place-like-home.html,2016-04-24,,Deccan Herald,"By Matthias Williams, CHERNOBYL, Ukraine, April 24, 2016, (Reuters): 14:58 ISTMaria Lozbin was one of tens of thousands of people to be evacuated from their homes after the Chernobyl accident in April 1986, but returned with her family six years ago, to live off the land inside a 30 km (19 mile) exclusion zone where the risk of radiation poisoning remains.A 69-year-old with a ready laugh and a green shawl wrapped round her, Lobzin said the village to which she had been evacuated was full of drunks and drug addicts.The house into which she was moved was so shoddily constructed, with a huge crack running from the roof to the basement, that she was afraid of being killed or maimed by a falling object.""Living there was like waiting for death,"" she said.Now she lives with her son and his family back in Chernobyl, in a zone that can only be reached by crossing a checkpoint and where guides accompany curious tourists with radiation meters.By contrast, a deathly silence hangs over the nearby abandoned town of Prypyat, where a rusting fairground wheel, and a kindergarten with toys, dolls and small beds are a grim testimony to the scale and speed of the disaster.Lozbin keeps chickens, geese and ducks, grows potatoes and tomatoes, and goes foraging for mushrooms in nearby woods.""There is no radiation here. I'm not afraid of anything,"" she said. ""And when it's time for me to die, it won't happen because of radiation.""BIRD SONGTuesday marks the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine, caused by a botched safety test in the fourth reactor of the atomic plant that sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe.The disaster and the government's handling of it -- the evacuation order only came 36 hours after the accident -- highlighted the shortcomings of the Soviet system with its unaccountable bureaucrats and entrenched culture of secrecy.Mikhail Gorbachev has since said he considered Chernobyl one of the main nails in the coffin of the Soviet Union which eventually collapsed in 1991.The accident killed 31 right away and forced tens of thousands to flee. The final death toll of those killed by radiation-related illnesses such as cancer is subject to debate.A Greenpeace report ahead of the anniversary cites a Belarusian study estimating the total cancer deaths from the disaster at 115,000, in contrast to the World Health Organisation's estimate of 9,000.The Greenpeace study also said people living in the area continue to eat and drink foods with dangerously high radiation levels.In particular, ""the 30 km exclusion zone around the Chernobyl reactor remains highly contaminated and unsuitable to live in,"" it said.But that matters little to Lozbin, one of around 160 people estimated to have returned to the zone. ""What's there to be afraid of?"" said Maria's daughter-in-law Oleksandra Lozbin.""I don't want to go to Kiev. Why would I leave such nature? Where could you hear cuckoos? Where could you hear the nightingale?""Oleksandra's husband, who grew up in a village 7 km away, started coming to Chernobyl in short bursts starting in 2008 and the family settled back there permanently in 2010.""My husband had wanted to come back to his homeland all his life,"" she said. ""He came back when it was all closed here, when it was prohibited to come here. He crossed through barbed wire.""Oleksandra said police initially tried to force them to leave, but the family refused.Oleksandra hopes to inspire others to move back. To remind people what life was like before the accident, the family has created a makeshift museum in a house across the street with objects collected from nearby abandoned cottages.There are books, a doll in a cot, a rusty wheel, an abacus, and a black-and-white photo of two people. One day, she hopes, someone might see it and recognize their great-grandparents.""We decided to save the history of Chernobyl,"" she said. ""We hope that people will come back here and will live here, and their children and grandchildren will see what life was like here, in what kind of cots people were raised here, in what kind of boxes people stored their personal belongings and books.""On a bench lies a Soviet newspaper from Jan. 24 1986, four months before the disaster. The front page headline reads: ""No to nuclear testing""."

Among other vegetables, beans that are sold at Rs 30 per kg went up to Rs 60 per kg, cauliflower that is generally Rs 40 per kg is now being sold at Rs 60 per kg in the market and cucumber is being sold at Rs 50 per kg instead of Rs 30 per kg.The shopkeepers have highlighted that the prices have shoot up owing to less rainfall in the hilly areas, from where most of the vegetables are supplied. Vegetables like tomatoes, cauliflowers, peas, beans, capsicums are supplied from hilly areas.Watch Video: Whats making newsRakesh Kumar, a trader at Sector 26 grain market, said: There was very less rainfall in May this year, due to which the vegetable crop was damaged. The best quality vegetables are from hilly areas and this time, the quality also suffered. Also, vegetables are supplied to many other parts in the region from here and with the increasing demand and short supply, the prices have gone up.Traders highlighted that they are expecting the price of tomato will not rise further because vegetables from Himachal Pradesh and J&K arrive at Chandigarh first and from there supplied to other markets.However, few others believe that there may be further price rise. If the weather remains dry, the prices of vegetables being supplied from the hilly areas will go up even more, said Bhupinder Singh, another trader from Sector 26 grain market.One of the city residents, Harinder Singh, who had come to the vegetable market said: The situation will improve only with the monsoon.

The Mumbai unit of the Congress had organised the Pol Khol rally with the purpose of exposing corruption in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), that is controlled by the Sena and the BJP.Over 300 people had gathered for the rally, where Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam was speaking.Police said more than 70 Shiv Sena supporters arrived at the venue to protest Nirupams remarks against Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday afternoon at Azad Maidan.Police claim that the Sena supporters attacked the attendants, mainly congress workers with eggs and tomatoes.Large stones were also flung at the stage. Nirupam however escaped unhurt. But at least four persons who were on stage with him were injured. We arrested about 20 party workers. But they were released on bail at around 1.30 am on Sunday, said a senior police officer attached with the Samta Nagar police station.The police claim that they are on the lookout for at least 50 more party workers, including seven women.Nirupam, meanwhile, said: They are getting aggressive because as they are afraid of what we are doing. They do not have any moral authority on this issue and therefore have resorted to violence. I will however not cow down. I would also want to say that the role of the police was highly suspicious during the entire incident. They behaved as if they were under pressure from the Shiv Sena and this government.The Shiv Sena, however, maintained that the Congress was unnecessarily creating such a hype over the issue.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREHe is unnecessarily blowing this issue out of proportion.

Express Avtar Singh with his cotton and cucumber crop. ExpressEven as concern over declining water table and over exploitation of water in Punjab for paddy continues to grow, some farmers in the state are adopting innovative techniques to save water.Avtar Singh, a farmer based in Pandwa village in Phagwara has inter-cropped cotton crop with cucumbers and is practicing capillary action irrigation which also helps in conserving water. Last year, he had inter cropped cotton with maize which, he claims, doubled the yield.He irrigates his fields after every two weeks, helping him save a lot of water which would otherwise have been used to flood the land.Cotton is deep rooted and a long duration crop. It does not need much water but Punjab farmers are in habit of flooding fields, he said. Judicious use of water never came to them naturally. We have inter cropped cotton with cucumber. We are not directly irrigating cotton but instead, focussing on cucumber. The water that seeps into the soil also reaches the cotton crop. Also, through bed plantation, more water is saved.Last year, he harvested 15quintal per acre of cotton compared to the 8 quintal per acre that most other farmers, who used conventional methods, got.This year picking would be even better. I have adopted concept of bio-diversity in agriculture. Farmers need to go the way nature wants and monoculture (growing single crop) is nowhere in nature. I have noticed that cotton balls are thicker if grown like this. Growing cucumber has also controlled pests and no whitefly or bollworms have infected my crop, he added.Paramjit Singh Gill from village Chungawan of Moga cultivated red garlic, a crop that is not familiar to Punjab, and has reaped profit of Rs 1 lakh per acre. Gill said, I got this variety from Jammu and Kashmir and is grown mostly in hilly areas. Punjab farmers are unaware of any garlic except white ones. This variety gives dark pinkish fruit commonly known as red garlic in J&K. Compared to Rs 25,000 per acre saved in paddy/wheat cultivation, I am saving Rs 1 lakh/acre.Another farmer, Sukhvir Singh from village Sampla in Fatehgarh Sahib has grown onions on seven acres, muskmelon on five acres, tomatoes on two acres, chillies on two acres and pumpkin (used for sweets) on one acre. It was always a risky decision to give up paddy farming but now my farm is giving me Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakh profit.Swaran Singh Mann, assistant director horticulture said, It is always advisable to grow two or more crops together. Farmers are now opting for strawberries, papaya, guavas, peaches etc which consume less water than paddy.Dr SS Kukal, additional director research (natural resources and plant health management), Punjab Agricultural University, said, It is absolutely right that inter-cropping cotton with vegetables is best way for natural farming and saving water. With capillary action, water that seeps inside soil will come up and replenish soil. Cotton will not need separate irrigation. It saves almost 90% water and higher yield.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Bengaluru woke up to the Independence Day Flower Show which began at Lalbagh Botanical Garden on Saturday.The Israeli mist technology only bettered the experience. On a rather sultry afternoon on the inaugural day, one could enjoy the cooling effect enabled by the technology. The mist not only ensures lower temperature inside the Glass House and keeps the flowers fresh for long but also prevents dust from rising in the air.The Parliament House, which has been replicated with over four lakh roses, is the primary attraction of the event. The first day saw professional photographers and hobbyists gather at the Glass House to click photographs. Visitors taking selfie was a common sight. Chrysanthemum flowers only brightened the charm of the place. Orchids, roses, anthurium, poinsettias, pentas carnea, gerbera, carnations, fuchsia, beginia... there were too many varieties of flowers to count.I have been coming to the flower show for four years now, and its getting better with each passing year. The creativity of these florists must be lauded, remarked Shylaja who had come with her five-year-old son.Right at the entrance is a dancing peacock made of capsicum and tomatoes with a glitter of gold on it. A walk on the side of the lawns gives a glimpse of petunia flowers. A huge flora cascade, right outside the Glass House, is another crowd-pleaser.If one thought radish would could be about the size of a palm, a visit to Lalbagh could change the perspective. A root, 1.6 feet long, weighing over a kilo and grown in Bengaluru, is on display at the exhibition hall. A bunch of plantains weighing 89 kg from Hulimavu is also on display.Students from the Horticulture Training Institute are lending a helping hand to those who want to grow what they eat. They have put on display a variety of vegetables that can be cultivated in pots. The students were guiding visitors on how to grow crops at home.This years show, organised by the Department of Horticulture and the Mysore Horticultural Society, is a tribute to Dr M H Marigowda, considered the Father of Horticulture in India, whose birth centenary falls on August 8. A sand sculpture of Dr Marigowda and an exclusive stall on his achievements have been set up.Horticulture Minister S S Mallikarjun, who inaugurated the flower show, said that Cubbon Park and Lalbagh would be beautified further. Four other botanical gardens have been planned in the state, he added.On the first day, nearly 13,000 people visited the flower show, including 8,750 adults, 243 children and 3,500 pass holders, said a senior official in the Horticulture Department."

But before those greens reached the markets, farmers had to grow them with all the attendant problems. Did that complex process involve irrigation with highly polluted water sourced from the citys lakes and river streams?It is a tough, but heavily loaded question. Loaded, because repeated studies by city-based universities and scientific institutions have clearly indicated heavy metal contamination in vegetables sold in big markets across Bengaluru.Irrigated by sewage-fed lake water on agricultural land, contamination of the greens has been proved beyond doubt. Analyzing samples of water, soil and crop plants, the tests have shown significant traces of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in the greens that directly influence our food chain.ContaminationTwelve years ago, when the Bellandur lakes pollution levels were high but not at todays alarming levels, a Bangalore University study had shown high heavy metal contamination in vegetables grown in the vicinity. The impact of the lakes polluted water on vegetation was found to be much more than soil.Incessant flow of untreated sewage from multiple inlets, encroachment and wide-spread development have effectively killed vegetable farming in Bellandur. Cultivation has gradually shifted to Varthur and Hoodi lakebeds on the downstream.But here lies the big problem: Highly polluted water from Bellandur flows into the downstream lakes, contaminating the ground water as well. It is mostly this water that is being drilled out through borewells by the farmers.As if this is not hazardous enough, the vegetables are also washed with the lake water before they are loaded onto distribution trucks.Their produce is supplied to vegetable markets in Marathahalli, KR Puram, Whitefield, HAL and other areas within a 20km radius. At the HAL market, for instance, supplies start at around 3 am. Enquiries reveal that most vegetables are sourced from farms in Hoodi, Kadugodi, Varthur and other areas.Customers unawareNot many customers are aware of this supply chain, although most retailers feign ignorance about the irrigation methods for fear of losing clients.Nirupam, a customer, says he has been buying vegetables from the HAL market for nearly a decade. But he admits he had never asked where the greens came from.In recent years, say the retailers, supplies from Varthur side have been declining as farms are being traded for real estate. Huge apartment blocks and malls have come up on once fertile lands. To compensate the shortfall, supplies often come from KR Market.Yet, that is not a safe bet. An ongoing study by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (Atree) has already indicated contamination in vegetables grown in the command area of the Byramangala tank on the Vrushabhavathi river.Vrushabhavathi pollutionOver the last three years, tests on water and soil samples collected from the area growing babycorn have shown accumulation of heavy metals, as Atree researcher Priyanka informs. Heavily polluted with industrial effluents and untreated domestic sewage, the Vrushabhavathi river feeds this water directly into the Byramangala tank.Babycorn cultivation has graduated to tomatoes and other vegetables in recent months. These greens make their way to the KR Market and Kalasipalyam outlets, eventually heading to other vegetable bazaars in the city interior.Heavy metal contamination of water can be effectively tracked only with 24-hour sampling, says Priyanka.For the study on Vrushabhavathi, the water was measured day and night. Heavy metal traces were found to peak during the night.This is a clear indication that industrial effluents are being discharged after dusk to hoodwink the agencies.Stringent quality testsThe message is clear: The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) needs to change its water quality monitoring protocol. Atree is now in talks with the Board to make the testing more scientific and stringent. Its data analysis on Vrishabhavathi and Byramangala tank is also being shared with KSPCB.But water quality monitoring is only a part of the mechanism to prevent health hazards of irrigation with sewage-fed water. Soil and plant quality are equally critical. The University study showed that the presence of cadmium in spinach (4 mg g-1) and radish (2.5 mg g-1) is way beyond the acceptable standards."

Traders warn of difficult days ahead if the vegetable stock continues to shrink.The supply of vegetables to KR Puram market, a major market in Bengaluru, has been declining for the last two weeks. If the market received 200-300 tonnes of vegetables per day earlier, the supply has come down to just 50-60 tonnes now, traders say.KR Puram Market Association president, Yele Srinivas, said the market received vegetables from Kolar, Mandya, Srinivasapur, Hosur, Krishnagiri and the surrounding places. Tomato supply has been particularly hit. Earlier, we would get 5,000 bags of tomatoes but now we get just 2,000, he said, urging the state government to use alternative options as the vegetable shortage was likely to persist.Kalasipalyam, one of the largest wholesale markets in the city, is also facing shortage of vegetables. Wholesale traders said the number of vegetable trucks making trips to the market had come down from 100 to just 25 in the last one week.Biggest supplierKolar is the biggest supplier of tomatoes to Bengaluru. There has been no supply from there for the last 20 days. We are procuring tomatoes from Maharashtra, said Vegetable Merchants Association president, R V Gopi. Fortunately, the supply of fruits has not been affected, he said.Anthony, a vegetable wholesaler from Bazaar Street, Yeshwantpur, said that he was procuring 100 kg of beans every day from Kalasipalyam, down from 200 kg earlier.Tomatoes, which cost Rs 10 per kg in wholesale markets earlier, are now priced at Rs 40. The prices of beans have gone up from Rs 35-40 to Rs 70 and carrots from Rs 20 to Rs 40. Radish costs Rs 25, up from Rs 15.G M Diwakar of KR Market Traders Association said the prices would continue to shoot up in the coming days. Even if it rains, it will take time for farmers to get the yield. With more demand and less supply, the prices will only increase, he said.Veggie pricesVegetables April 26 May 3Beans Rs 98 Rs 148Double Beans Rs 80 Rs 168Tomato Rs 29 Rs 48Carrot Rs 43 Rs 49Radish Rs 32 Rs 40Source: Hopcoms website; prices per kg"

Interactions with farmers, retailers and consumers indicate that a big chunk of vegetables arriving in markets across the City might show chemical contamination if tested.Puroshottam Gowda, a farmer from Ballari opines that the share of such vegetables could be as high as 75%. Most of the vegetables are grown near Kengeri and surrounding areas. The farmers grow greens, tomato, cabbage and other vegetables using water from a sewage treatment plant. The water is supposed to be purified but at most places, the plants do not work. This is unfortunate.""However, RV Gopi, President, Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Merchant Association, does not agree. According to him, drainage water was earlier being used by vegetable growers in Kengeri, Gollahalli and Varthur. But now, says he, most of the farmers have stopped vegetable farming there due to encroachment of lakes and rapid urbanisation.Sellers and middlemen at Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Yard, Yeshwantpur admit that the quality of fruits and vegetables has come down because of bad water quality and pollution.Yet, there are many others who deny using dirty water to grow greens. Suresh, a wholesale onion and potato merchant from APMC contends that most of his produce comes from Maharashtra and Chitradurga region. He says the farmers there depend on borewell water and tap water to grow vegetables and not drainage.Hoskote-based farmer Chandra Gowda claims he uses borewell water for vegetable farming. But he has seen a few farmers using water from polluted lakes in his locality.Environmentalists suggest that reducing pollution at water source points and increasing awareness among public on the dangers of consuming food with high heavy metal contamination could be helpful. But consumers say they are helpless. Despite knowing the harmful effects of chemical contamination, they have no choice but to buy the fruits and vegetables from the markets.Says Sheela Kumar, a resident of Hennur: Today, everything from water to air to soil is contaminated. I try washing fruits and vegetables with running water as many times as possible and boil them properly before consuming them. We cannot avoid consuming them. Taking precautionary measures is the best available option.Malini Parmar, a resident of Bellandur and an active member of Kasa Muktha Bellandur, informs that BBMP had conducted a drive in her locality to seize plastics. The Palike personnel confiscated boxes filled with artificial colouring content from vegetable farmers. These were used to add colour to peas.Parmar sees a way out in using organic vegetables. She explains, The best way to avoid consumption of harmful produce is by buying organic produce. Though it is expensive, it is worth as it keeps me and my family healthy. Apart from sewage effluents inside the lake, garbage is also being burnt and dumped there. I see ashes floating atop Bellandur lake due to burning of waste.Malleswaram resident Sampath Kumar agrees that organic vegetables could be an option only if people can afford them. Not everyone can buy organic stuff, he points out."

But surprisingly this time, veggie prices have fallen owing to increased production and arrivals in the markets.A kilogram of tomato is now priced at Rs 6 to Rs 8 in wholesale markets, while carrots, beans and brinjals cost about Rs 20-25. Capsicum and potatoes are priced at Rs 15 and Rs 20, respectively. Exactly a year ago, their prices during the same period had spiked, with tomato priced at Rs 20 and beans Rs 40 per kilo.Wholesale Vegetables and Fruits Traders Association president R V Gopi said carrots were priced at Rs 40 in March last year and the cost of other veggies too had increased by 10-20 per cent.This time, however, the prices have fallen, especially in the past week. Last week, one kilogram of tomato was priced at Rs 15, but now it is available at Rs 8 and even Rs 5 in the market.He said the main reason for the low prices was the increase in the arrival of vegetables.Last year, there was a decrease in the crop arrivals and hence the prices had gone up. For consumers, it is a good news this time, but for farmers it is a loss.G M Diwakar from SKR Market Traders Association said it was just the beginning of summer season and there were chances of veggie prices doubling in the next four months.Generally, the prices increase between April and July. Last year, there was no rainfall and hence the prices had increased. It takes three months for crop yield and this time, there has been sufficient rainfall. But when the actual summer sets in, then the prices may increase."

There was incessant rainfall in Mandya and surrounding areas in November and the farmers suffered crop loss. We procure brinjal and okra from Chennai mostly. But, the crop there too has been destroyed owing to recent floods.The short supply and increase in demand has triggered price hike, Akmal said.Along with vegetables, the price of coriander leaves too has gone up.According to the comparative report procured from Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (Hopcoms), a week ago,coriander leaves used to cost Rs 30 per kilo and on Friday, the price was fixed at Rs 38.Among greens, the prices of Sabakki and parsley have increased from Rs 38 to Rs 45 and Rs 180 to Rs 225 per kilo, respectively.Spiralling vegetable prices have upset the household budget.Shocking hikeSaritha Menon, a resident of Hennur, said that she was surprised on finding from a retailer that tomatoes cost Rs 60 per kilo.Already the hike of milk price has affected us and now yet another shock, she added."

5923bb327be9e01fcef057b4,RBI should go for low interest rates,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/537652/rbi-should-go-low-interest.html,2016-03-30,,Deccan Herald,"Upendra Goel Mar 31, 2016, 0:01 ISTOnly growth has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and boost Make In India programme too.Growth can waitseems to be the favourite refrain of RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan. Before the previous NDA government demitted office in 2004, it had been successful in bringing down the interest rates to low levels. The economy and business sentiments were also booming at that time.Later on, inexplicably, interest rates were increased by more than a dozen times during UPA-II, particularly when D Subba Rao was the RBI governor. It is no secret that high interest rates cripple business, especially industry. The good returns on fixed deposits and other savings instruments also encourage the public to put money into savings instead of trying to recycle earnings for some productive work.This way, on one hand you are incentivising people by providing higher returns for keeping the surplus funds dormant, while on the other hand the costly finance provided by financial institutions dampens the spirits of business as well as entrepreneurship.Both the anomalies can be rectified by a simple remedy of reducing the interest rates. The automobiles, housing, realty and so many allied sectors will witness a kick start towards growth immediately. Not for nothing the Central Bank of Japan has introduced a negative interest regime on earnings  if you want to keep money in the savings, you will have to give bank some amount as charges as a punishment for not putting it to some productive use. The European Banks have been practicing it for at least 10-11 years now.Naturally, when the new government took over on the plank of development, the first thing the business expected it to do was to reduce interest rates as one of the initial steps to spur growth. As the demand for softening the interest rates grew louder, the dampener came from Rajan: First, we have to tackle inflation, growth can wait. Now it is the 15th consecutive month the WPI (whole sale price index) is negative and the prices of crude have touched rock bottom. All industrial products and items have been seeing negative inflation. Still no signs of interest rate reduction.Edible itemsThe only thing which remains costly is the edible items. God alone knows how does one tackle inflation of agricultural products by controlling interest rates. One may not buy a car or a house for higher interest rates, but would anybody stop buying potato or tomato even if the interest rates were 100%? Whatever small decrease in interest rates during last one year or so is too little.As the clamour for interest rate reduction continued to grow and the inflation logic did not hold good any more, Rajan came up with another one: The government has to tackle the fiscal deficit first, only then interest rates can be lowered, the growth can wait.Then just a few days ago, he said: If you ask me what is more important, growth or cleaning of banks balance sheets, I would say cleaning of banks balance sheets has to take priority. Grow-th can wait. And his latest masterstroke: We will not devalue our currency for increasing exports, the way China, Japan and Korea did. Growth can wait.Seems growth is the last thing on the RBI governors agenda or perhaps it is not there in his priority list at all. One is at a loss to understand that the government which came to power with such a huge mandate on the plank of development and for bringing acche din, seems to be not bothered about the growth at all. All the gains in the sectors of power, defence, railways, highways etc will be lost if they are not backed with solid reforms in financial sector.Sadly, there have been hardly any positive or thoughtful steps taken by finance ministry in last 21 months. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also has to appreciate that Make in India would not happen by mere rhetoric. The windfall gains because of increase in excise duty on petroleum products, coal block auctions and 3G spectrum auctions are keeping the government coffers full, making it complacent, whereas the dismal performance in direct and indirect tax collections should have rung alarm bells.When the IIP (Industrial Production Index) is shrinking, WPI is negative, sensex is falling, NPAs (non productive assets) are mounting and the banks bad loans are increasing to staggering proportions  no amount of treatment will help.Neither bringing of black laws like Bankruptcy Code 2015, will help. Rajan should have been the one piloting the engine of growth while he was proving to be the one permanently red-flagging the growth. His hawkish approach to the economy has proved to be disastrous. It is to be understood that it is only growth which has the potential to cure our financial ailments, and the momentum thus gained will give boost Make In India programme as well.The juggernaut of growth, which when unleashed, automatically pulls all the parameters of the economy to their desired slots. No stone should be left unturned including reduction in interest rates, to spur gr-owth. Because, development or growth cant wait. The aspirati-ons of a billion people also cant.(The writer is a technocrat and a small-scale entrepreneur based in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh)"

The price of tomatoes at wholesale markets is Rs 4 to Rs 5 a kg, while in the retail outlets the cost fluctuates between Rs 8 and Rs 15, traders said. A month ago, the wholesale price of tomatoes was Rs 30 to Rs 40.The prices of green gram have also reduced in the city in the last two weeks.

In retail outlets, green gram is being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 90 per kg. Already, the rate is low and there is no chance that the prices will dip further. Green gram is outsourced to the city from Gadag, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Hubballi and other parts of North Karnataka, Shah said.Rajeev Reddy, a retailer, attributed the decrease in green gram prices to an increase in the crop yield.Beans, carrot dearerPrices of beans and carrot have increased in the last one week. President of the Wholesale Vegetable Merchants Association R V Gopi said that owing to the shortage in arrivals of beans and carrot, the prices have shot up. A kg of beans that used to cost Rs 20-25 at wholesale markets is now priced at Rs 45-Rs 50. The price of carrot has increased from Rs 30 to Rs 40 a kg."
