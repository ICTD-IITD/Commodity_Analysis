Picture by Hardeep Singh This week, Ranchi vegetable customers are moving around markets with long faces and half-empty bags. Reason? Heavy rains of last weekend have damaged a bulk of local potato and tomato crops, hiking their retail prices to Rs 24 and Rs 50 per kilo, respectively. Members of Pandra Bazar Samiti, the wholesale hub in Ranchi, said wholesale prices of potato and tomato are Rs 20 and Rs 30 a kilo. ""Water-logging in farms has destroyed both crops,"" said horticulture scientist of Birsa Agriculture University (BAU) K.K. Jha. Explaining why, he said: ""The recent heavy rains led to water-logging in poorly drained farms. So, potatoes rotted underground. Heavy downpour tore tomato skins and lack of sunlight led to their getting fungus."" Bhuidih, Mandar and Itki in Ranchi district, Gumla, Simdega and Hazaribagh are the state's tomato bowls. A bulk of potatoes are brought from Bengal, but the tuber also grows in Ratu, Ormanjhi, Pithoria, Namkum and other places in Ranchi. Imports from Bengal had also reduced drastically since monsoon picked up steam, rued a Ranchi wholesale trader Naresh Sahu, saying compared to last week's two trucks, only one came this week. BAU scientist Jha stressed it was possible to save tomatoes from tearing or fungus. ""Growing tomatoes in polyhouses in a controlled environment will enable them to survive heavy monsoon, but then, only a fraction of Jharkhand's tomatoes are grown that way. More farmers need to adapt to progressive ways,"" he stressed. Raj Kumar, MD of Jharkhand State Agriculture Marketing Board, added another valid point. ""We need cold storage for perishable items so that the produce we get is kept properly. So far, a few private ones have come up at Bero, Ormanjhi and other places, but we can't monitor them. The situation will improve when our 5,000 metric tonne cold storage comes up in Pandra,"" he said. But for now, the scene at Lalpur vegetable market, one of Ranchi's largest retail hubs, is dismal. A vendor had stocked 5kg of tomatoes against the 20kg. ""Due to heavy rain, the local tomato crop is damaged,"" rued Munna Oraon, when asked why there were so few tomatoes. ""I brought 5kg tomatoes from Bero farmers but that too is of poor quality,"" he admitted. Potato vendor Lokesh in Lalpur said he was selling them for Rs 24 a kilo. ""Last week, it was Rs 18 per kilo. But, what to do when supply is so poor? Our margins are thin."" Homemakers are feeling the pinch. ""I'm substituting fresh tomatoes with ketchup and using less potatoes in subzi,"" Lalpur homemaker Anju Saxena said. ""French fries are out of the menu for the time being."" But, scientist Jha had a word of hope. ""New cropping is on at tomato and potato hubs. By September, Ranchi customers can expect the duo at affordable prices,"" he said."
58fefbf17be9e0420db2abdb,To counter the violence within,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160809/jsp/opinion/story_101309.jsp,2016-08-09,"Irom Chanu Sharmila may be calling off her hunger-strike after 16 years of force-feeding, but the attention she has managed to attract to her cause is substantial. That her breaking the fast, her decision to marry and join politics have attracted international media attention is not only because of her unique method of protest, but also because of the seriousness of the cause she campaigned for. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act that Irom Sharmila wanted repealed is indeed a draconian law inconsistent with the spirit of Indian democracy. It tarnishes India's global image at a time when its prime minister, Narendra Modi, is making an effort to secure a place for the country on the global high table. But, more important, the AFSPA should be shelved because it encourages lazy, incompetent soldiering - why make an effort to find a militant by going over available intelligence when one has a law that gives powers to line up a whole village for scrutiny at day or night? Indian army and paramilitary forces have fought a counter-insurgency campaign in the Northeast for six decades now and in other 'disturbed areas' of India like Kashmir for three to four decades. But India does not have a counter-insurgency doctrine - all it offers are clichs, such as the iron fist in a velvet glove. It is high time the country develops a doctrine based on its long experience and one that focuses more on political persuasion and smart internal security management rather than on the blatant use of force. Force often begets more force and surely more alienation. The AFSPA confers special powers on the armed forces to respond without restraint in ""disturbed areas"" to maintain law and order. In a ""disturbed area,"" a military officer can fire upon an unlawful assembly of five or more people if the need arises or for the illegal possession of firearms. The military is free to use force, even causing death to those suspected of possible violence. No arrest and search warrants are required for any operation as in the provisions of the law. Owing to the blanket powers it confers on soldiers, there is a lingering fear of its misuse. In 1990, an amendment bill was passed to include the state of Jammu and Kashmir under the purview of AFSPA. Manipur, however, withdrew the act from some parts of the state after a huge agitation following the mysterious death of Thangjam Manorama. The federal government in 2004 appointed a five-member committee under a former Supreme Court judge, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, to review the act and consider complete repeal or a possible replacement by a more humane legislation. On June 6, 2005, the committee recommended in its 147-page report the repealing of the act unanimously. Interestingly, among the five members of the commission was a former director-general (military operations) of the Indian army, Lieutenant-General (retired) V.R. Raghavan and a former home ministry bureaucrat, P.P. Shrivastava. Now why would such hard-core members of the security establishment advocate a repeal of AFSPA? This is a question that has rarely been asked. In fact, many a military officer with long years of experience in counter-insurgency in the Northeast and Kashmir has argued after retirement that it should be repealed as it serves no purpose. But the serving military establishment has fiercely stalled AFSPA's repeal. Senior officers even launched a Facebook campaign to ""save AFSPA"". The defence ministry has been pressured by the army top brass, so that the United Progressive Alliance government did not even dare place the Jeevan Reddy Commission's report for discussion in Parliament. But it is time India seriously considers a repeal of AFSPA - not merely out of a concern for human rights but also out of a desire to improve and refocus India's internal security regime. One has to remember that counter-insurgency is directed against one's own citizens and not against a foreign enemy. So, the primary focus of a counter-insurgency operation should be 'winning hearts and minds', and not liquidation or elimination. AFSPA lets troops get away with murder and its frequent misuse encourages a culture of impunity which is counterproductive to WHAM because it widens the disconnect between the forces and the local population. With AFSPA around, military or paramilitary units do not feel the need for restraint or fire control, leading to incidents like the one at Malom (Manipur) which led Irom Sharmila to start her hunger strike in 2000. It also leads to a sharp drop in professionalism and actually dehumanizes and corrupts the army and paramilitary forces. The extent to which AFSPA has encouraged a culture of impunity and a compromise of professionalism can be gauged from cases such as that of Colonel H.S. Kohli (the ""Ketchup Colonel"") who asked civilians to feign death, smeared them with tomato ketchup and claimed kills in an operation - all to score brownie points. It was later found that he had done all this in full knowledge (if not under explicit orders) of his immediate superior, Brigadier Suresh Rao of the 73rd Mountain Brigade. These mountain brigades are supposed to be our key units in the order of battle against China. If one were to lay emphasis on the primacy of WHAM in counter-insurgency, success in it should be judged not by body count in encounters or by 'area domination' but by how many rebels/militant groups have been compelled by an intelligent mix of persuasion, force, secret contact and psychological operations to abandon the path of armed struggle and return to normal life. AFSPA makes soldiers lazy, non-professional and is characterized by an absolute lack of focus and a conspicuous lack of a consistent doctrine of counter-insurgency. Operational action is rarely linked to clearly defined objectives - more kills rather than more surrenders from guerrilla ranks are likely to fetch better decorations and rewards but they also encourage gung-ho commanders to further alienate the force from the people in areas of operation. The former Manipur governor, Lt.Gen. V.K. Nayar, made this point rather strongly in an article in the Indian Defence Review in October 1992. In his book, A Soldier Recalls, Srinivas Kumar Sinha says that until the late 1960s, the Indian army did not even have training manuals for counter-insurgency. Even now, many military institutions like the Counter-Insurgency & Jungle Warfare School do not have appropriate campaign studies for units to be deployed for 'internal security duties' in a counter-insurgency environment. In his Fighting Like a Guerrilla, Rajesh Rajagopalan has aptly pointed out that the ""conventional war bias"" of the Indian army explains its failure in counter-insurgency like in the Jaffna peninsula during the Indian Peace Keeping Force operations in the late 1980s. Therefore, the argument made by the military top brass that its units will be ""crippled"" in counter-insurgency situations without AFSPA is untenable. Long use of AFSPA has not helped end insurgencies; political settlements have. The reason for the failure of Indian military units to effectively root out insurgent groups in Kashmir or the Northeast stems from its failure to evolve an appropriate doctrine for counter-insurgency even after fighting insurgents for 60 years. This not only reveals the ""learning failures"" of an unimaginative military leadership but actually ends up alienating populations. It is time the government realizes the dangers of unleashing a force with a conventional war bias on its own people. The repeal of AFSPA should be seen as the first step in an effort to create a smarter and more effective counter-insurgency capability that draws more on information technology, psychological operations, political persuasion and conflict resolution rather than on overkill and mindless indiscretion. The government will have to evolve a counter-insurgency doctrine which will not only seek to keep the army out of the ""internal security"" matrix to the extent possible and deploy other specifically trained and highly skilled forces that observe the principle of ""minimum force"", but also not insist on an AFSPA-type legislation as a prerequisite for their deployment and demonstrate a respect for human rights and accountability in keeping with the letter and spirit of the Constitution."
58fefde77be9e0420db2aeec,Survival struggle at summit,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160617/jsp/siliguri/story_91662.jsp,2016-06-17,"The NCC team, of which Trishala Gurung was a member, on the slopes of Mount Everest. Telegraph picture Darjeeling, June 16: A college student who had successfully climbed Mount Everest in May today spoke of five climbers she had seen battling for life on the slopes of the world's highest mountain during her expedition. Trishala Gurung, 23, from Southfield College was part of the first all-girl team of the National Cadet Corps that conquered Mount Everest. She, along with Sulaxchana Tamang, who studies at Ghoom Degree College in Darjeeling, climbed Mount Everest in two batches last month. While Sulaxchana was part of the first batch to climb Everest and had left the base camp on May 18, Trishala had started the climb, along with 13 other members of the NCC group, the next day. It was Trishala and her team that encountered the climbers who were battling for their lives. ""Around 11pm on May 21, when we were above South Col (26,000ft), we met a climber who was digging ice. It was on a slope of about 70 degrees and first, I thought why he was wasting energy at such a high altitude by digging ice, which seemed unnecessary. Now, I think he was suffering from altitude sickness,"" Trishala told the media. The team, which had set base at South Col, had started its trek for the final accent at 8.30pm on May 21. ""A little above, we found a Sherpa and a lady climber. The Sherpa asked for water but I couldn't give, as I was wearing a thick glove and the water was deep inside my bag so that it didn't get frozen. They said they were hungry and I managed to give them chocolates and dry fruits,"" said Trishala. Fifty meters above the Sherpa and the lady was another climber hanging on a rope. ""We didn't know whether he was climbing up or down and just above him was another man who was resting and moving his hands probably trying not to fall asleep,"" said Trishala. She reached the summit, along with three other NCC cadets, an army officer and six Sherpas, at 8.30am on May 22. ""Later, when we were descending, we found that the man who had been seen moving his hand had died. He had anchored himself safely so that he would not fall. We did not see the other man on the rope, or the lady and the Sherpa with her,"" said the Southfield College girl. However, Trishala and the army officer, Bishnu Rana, met the man who was digging ice. ""It seems he was moving in an opposite direction where the ropes were tied. He seemed to be suffering from snow blindness and had frostbite on the hands. He said he was from Calcutta and even though he said his name, I cannot recollect it now. When he said he was from Calcutta, it struck me that we were from the same state,"" said Trishala. Trishala and her team had by then been informed about some missing climbers. ""The description matched the man who said he was from Calcutta. We tried to get him down to South Col but we couldn't. The only way was to carry him and we could not despite our attempt,"" said Trishala. The team then reached South Col in about 20 minutes and immediately, Sherpas climbed up and brought the Calcutta man to the South Col. ""One of the Sherpas, Migma Dorjee, made tomato soup and he had it. We then gave him coffee but when the mug was handed over to him, he could not hold due to frost bites and the coffee spilled over the mat. It was so heartbreaking when he immediately kneeled and tried to lick the coffee from the mat,"" said Trishala. The Calcutta climber was kept in a tent which was abandoned by pervious climbers. When the Sherpas went to serve tea to him in the morning, the climber was found dead. Even though Trishala cannot recollect the names, her description suggests that the lady was Sunita Hazra of Barasat, who along with the Sherpa was rescued but Sunita suffered frost bite. Trishala's description also suggests that the three people they met were Subash Paul from Bankura, Goutam Ghosh of Barrackpore and Paresh Nath of Durgapur who were all part of the same expedition."
58ff0a4d7be9e0420db2bb73,Spirits of the past haunt shops in new avatar,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160505/jsp/bihar/story_83828.jsp,2016-05-05,"A person manages a liquor-turned-snacks store in Kankerbagh and (below) a similar store at R-Block. Pictures by Ashok Sinha Spirits of the past haunt Dhananjay Kumar's shop at R-Block. Inside it is largely the same, like it was over a month ago; the same shelves from which Scotch tickled a drinker's thirst for malt. Even the refrigerator is the same, which, till not long ago held in its belly enough chilled beer to draw endless customers holding empty mugs. But today, the shelves contain cold drinks, biscuits, chips, soan papdi and Maggi. Open the refrigerator and one can almost see the chilled beer before focus returns and ice creams and cold drinks come into view. It is like this at most other liquor shops now forced to sell cold drinks and snacks since total prohibition was implemented in the state a month ago. While most liquor shops have shut down altogether, others have metamorphosed this way to live another day. But the present is a poor reflection of the past when one compares revenue earned. Most shops are not sure they will earn enough to even get back the rent they are paying for their shops. ""I pay Rs 30,000 in rent for this place and we now earn Rs 1,500-2,000 a day,"" said Dhananjay. ""It is becoming very difficult to pay my staff and rent. Because it is summer, we are just about managing by selling cold drinks. But I am not sure we can sustain ourselves after this."" This correspondent spent around half an hour at the shop during which only one customer turned up. The shop-owner laughed when he caught this correspondent noting four CCTVs on the premises. ""Do you think anyone is going to steal cold drinks? The CCTVs are not functional, we have cut the power supply,"" he said. He went on to say: ""Nitish ji should not have banned foreign liquor. We were paying tax after all. He has no idea how many people have lost their livelihood. Ban of country-made liquor was a good decision but Indian made foreign liquor should have been allowed."" Another erstwhile liquor shop in front of Hotel Chanakya has been turned into an ice-cream parlour. It also sells milk shakes, chips, Frooti, Maaza and Haldiram's soan papdi. The interiors are still the same. They've just replaced liquor on the shelves with the new fare. ""We spent lakhs doing up the interiors. We are not fools to be spending more on redoing the interiors to sell cold drinks and ice creams now. Those days we used to earn Rs 1.25 lakh-2 lakh a day. We now earn Rs 1,000-1,500 a day. Is that a comparison? This is not fair. When the government failed to open shops on its own it put a blanket ban on liquor,"" said Kaushal Kunal, shop manager. The shop has just replaced the earlier signboard with one for ice cream and cold drinks. Most of these shops have opened just three to four days ago. The government had offered to help liquor shop owners open milk booths in their premises, but till date no one has taken help. Another liquor shop in the Kankerbagh area has turned into an ice cream parlour, also selling tomato sauce, vegetable patties, cold drinks, biscuits and chips. ""Earlier, I used to earn Rs 12,000 a month, as revenue was higher,"" said an employee at the shop. ""But now pay has dipped to Rs 3,000. Everyday, a fight ensues between my wife and me over how I will run the house or pay my children's school fees. We are not getting any customers. Why will anybody come here when there are so many established shops? Since morning, I have sold just two bottles of water, two patties and four ice creams. God only knows what we will earn by selling ice creams and cold drinks."" It remains to be seen how many liquor shops will start selling snacks and cold drinks in the coming days. There were 5,446 registered private liquor shops in Bihar, 2,471 selling country-made liquor and remaining 2,947 India-made foreign liquor. There were 424 liquor shops in just Patna district."
58ff11897be9e041361622af,"They harvest grapes on rooftop, give them free",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/523451/they-harvest-grapes-rooftop-give.html,2016-01-16,"They harvest grapes on rooftop, give them freeR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, January 17, 2016 0:01 ISTSmall vines yielding grapes is nothing new. But harvesting the fruit on a small terrace in a grand manner is something special. The hard-work will always bear fruit. For Selvaraj Gowda it is sour and sweet as he took up the challenge and recently brought home the bacon of harvesting more than 300 kg grapes in a season on the terrace of his house at Pulliyampatti, a small village near Vedanchandhur Taluk in Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu.A tractor driver by profession, the 42-year-old god-fearing person Selvaraj hails from a poor family and his love for nature began at a tender age. His passion for growing vegetables started when he was in the fifth standard.However, the idea of growing grapes on the terrace was suggested by his wife, Soundeshwari, a couple of years back. My wife gave me a small bunch of grapes and asked me to taste it. She told me that the sweet grapes were grown in clay pots at her friend's place, Selvaraj, who also does voluntary work at temples, said.When I took interest in growing grapes in our place, we had constraints of space to make a grape garden around my house, he said. That made him almost drop the idea. However, his wife was not the one who was willing to give up easily. Soundeshwari promised full cooperation in developing a grape garden on his terrace and Selvaraj decided to take a plunge into grape cultivation and that too on his house rooftop.Initially, I spent Rs 15,000 to set up steel beams and other necessary equipment on my terrace, Selvaraj said. To mobilise additional funds for his new venture, he slogged and worked extra hours. That helped him in arranging the seed fund for the path-breaking initiative. He had about 900 sq feet available on the roof but decided to use only about 700 sq ft for the cultivation.Luckily, it clicked and he harvested good crop. As the terrace faces south, there is good sunshine throughout the day. I spent a few thousand rupees to ensure shade for roots of the plants. This was needed as continuous exposure to sunlight would have meant the plant would dry up, he said.Besides, the couple tied wire crisscross on the terrace to enable the plant to creep, spread and grow without hitches. They made grape cuttings and planted them in the tank constructed on the terrace.Selvaraj and his wife's hardwork was not in vain. The first harvest fetched him 50 kg good grapes. I and my wife were very happy when the flowers slowly turned into grapes, he said. He credited his wife for the achievement and stressed without Soundeshwari nothing could have been done.I used simple bio-fertilisers like cow dung and regular watering during summer as it is essential for healthy grape growing, he said. Natural tropical climate and regular wind and sun prevented pest attack on plants.There is a big advantage in our place, he said. We had options to regulate and make changes required for cultivation of grapes. Everything from water management to nutrient factor were under our control, he said.Selvaraj also efficiently undertook pest control measures. He says that the common pests of grape farming are flea beetles, thrips, mealy bugs and leaf hoppers. According to him, the sugar content in grapes determines when the fruit is ready to be harvested. The grapes are ready to harvest in about five to six months, he said. Selvaraj cleverly chose to grow Panneer Grapes, a popular fruit across the south India, by considering local growing conditions.Explaining about the second harvest, he said after the harvest is over, it is important to trim all green growth that you do not want to be part of the main trunk. Interestingly, the couple do not sell the grapes but give them to poor children in the area. We have decided not to sell even a single grape that is grown on our roof. Even if I grow one tonne, it will be given to children and poor people, Selvaraj asserted.Selvarajs efforts were recognised by the local farmers association, which pitched in to help him in the second harvest. After hearing about my success, local farmers helped me in giving organic fertiliser and equipment so that I could do better in the next harvest by getting 150 kg of grape, he said.My friends and neighbours came forward to help me. Some of them offered me steel poles, a few others natural fertilisers and even grape seeds, he said.Recently, Selvaraj cultivated 300 kg in his third harvest. He claims during the latest harvest, each bunch of grapes weighed about 250 grams. We are planning to achieve about 500 kg, he added.As per an expert's advice, Selvaraj allowed the grapes to grow freely in his latest cultivating season, without removing canes. He supported the vine with extra bamboo stake. Extra growth of leaves in this season will also make roots stronger and ensure that the plant gets a good start in the next season, he said.Keeping in mind the help from his friends and neighbours, Selvaraj shared the fruits. This time I had enough grapes to give to more people and children"", he said. Selvaraj adds that rooftop grape harvesting will also be a learning environment where kids from local schools, who love nature, could understand utilisation of space. Selvaraj also grows vegetables around his house. I have some space around my house to grow vegetables, he said.Selvaraj's daughter, who is in the ninth standard, helps her father.Brinjal, carrot, snake gourd, red pumpkin, cucumber, tomato and ladies finger are the latest entry to Selvaraj's garden."
58ff134c7be9e04136162376,Diary of culinary wonders,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/555110/diary-culinary-wonders.html,2016-06-29,"Diary of culinary wondersBy Chethana Dinesh, June 30, 2016, DHNS: 0:34 ISTThe blue diary held within its pages culinary secrets that could make me a great cook.Cooking is for aunties, mommies and grannies. And if that sounds judgmental and presumptuous, youre right. I was judgmental and presumptuous about the womenfolk in my family who laboured away in the kitchen to dish out tasty treats for foodies like me. Till one such day when reality hit me. And how?I was to get married and live alone with my husband, with no one to cook for us. Fortunately for me, I had no romantic notions about marriage that love-struck couples can survive on love and thin air alone. I knew we needed our three meals a day  fresh, tasty and healthy. But, cooking and me? A chit of a girl whod always treated cooking with disdain?Well, coming back to the problem, hiring a cook was not an option. What would my in-laws think? A crash course in cooking was out of the question, too. With the wedding just a month away, I was working, and shopping, and getting ready for the D-Day, all at once.So, the next best thing was to jot down all my moms recipes, to experiment later. I quickly grabbed a blue diary, dragged my mom out of the kitchen, and started noting down recipes for everything from simple chutneys to complicated biryanis.Along the way, I realised I was ignorant when it came to the names of dals. Painstakingly, I explained each dal with my own understanding of it. Toor dal was sambhar dal, green gram was kosambari dal, and so on. Once done, I felt like I had conquered the kitchen. The blue diary occupied the pride of place in my wedding trousseau, holding within its hallowed pages culinary secrets that promised to make me a great cook.Post-honeymoon, the first thing I did on entering the kitchen was to open my blue diary and look for the simplest of recipes. It was tomato bele saaru (rasam). Thus began my culinary journey, with the blue diary religiously by my side. I quickly graduated from saaru to gravy to pulao and biriyani. Of course, not without the blue diary by my side. Recipes from glossy books were not for me. Even if I saw an interesting recipe, I had to first note it down in my blue diary before trying it out. My strong belief was that only recipes that came out of my blue diary worked their magic.Over the years, the blue diary attracted more recipes, and oil splatter, too. Dog-ears and the fading colours of its pages notwithstanding, it continued to be my cooking bible. It was highly personalised, too, as only I could understand the recipes therein, what with my own notes in a nice combination of my mother tongue and English.Recently, post my week-long vacation, I opened the kitchen cabinet to pull my blue diary out, and what did I see? Horror of horrors, my sacred book had been feasted upon by termites. It was in tatters. Tears rolled down my cheeks. Out of frustration, out of anger. Of all the books at home, which are quite a few, termites had to target my blue diary. The same diary that had changed my attitude toward cooking, the same one that had given me the confidence to master culinary skills. And, most of all, the one that had marked my journey from ignorance to struggle to triumph.My dear blue diary, I miss you."

Designs for even bigger replacement idols have already gone out to craftsman Proshanto Pal of Kumartuli. No one quite knows how many Pujas are held in the UK though the consensus is that the figure is around 40, with around a dozen or so taking place in London. For years the main Puja has been in Camden Town in north London, but Hounslow is now apparently a Bengali hub, populated mainly by IT specialists who have come to the UK in the last 10 years or so. Without saying so, Hounslow reckons it has become a rival to Camden. The Bengalis in Camden ""said why don't you join us,"" according to Debabrata Das of Hounslow, ""but we said we can manage on our own, thank you. Then they said they will give us a prize for our Puja. We said no need, we can give you a prize!"" ""We are about 47 families who belong to Probashi,"" said Atrayee Chaudhury, who was very proud she had worn her bright red sari in Bengali fashion. Acting Purohit Biraja Ghoshal, (right) the Probashi women create a bit of Calcutta in Hounslow Atrayee, who works in financial PR - her husband Shankar Chaudhury works in IT - explained: ""We are first-generation (migrants). We want to pass on the Bengali culture to our children."" On Saptami evening, the children had lined up a Bollywood show. The Hounslow Puja has become a magnet for non-Bengalis and Bangladeshi Muslims too. ""I have become practically Bengali,"" admitted Probashi's current president, Chetan Kashyap, a Bihari who remembers Durga Puja from his days in Patna. He has been in Britain for 12 years and, like most of the others, works in IT. ""Everyone here feels 'this is my Puja',"" he said. Last year, some 7,000 people had to be fed. Two cooks are on duty. But everyone contributes by bringing in home-cooked items which have to be ""pure veg"". The job of the purohit (priest) was performed expertly on Saptami by Biraja Ghoshal, who said he knew all the right prayers and rituals ""because I grew up in a Ramakrishna Mission"". Ghoshal, who works for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said he had been able to access everything that he needed except, in the first year, the lotus. ""Then someone came along and put something in my hand - it was a lotus flower."" Marigolds of the kind needed for pushpanjali are grown at home by Hounslow Bengalis. One of them, Dr Ajit Kumar Basak, told of how disaster struck his allotment last year. ""I had between 3,000 and 4,000 marigolds. I went one morning and found the whole lot had been killed off by a nine-degree drop in temperature and a sharp frost."" Basak, who works as a scientist in the field of ""animal and human biology"", has a crucial role to play in the Hounslow Puja - he supplies the banana tree. ""They are the ornamental variety - not tall like the kind you get in Calcutta - and I have three which I keep inside my home where the temperature is 24 degrees Celsius,"" he said. ""One I give to Hounslow, another to the Puja in Ealing where I have a student and the third stays at home."" The Goddess Durga perhaps noticed one change compared with previous generations - ladies were taking selfies with Mother in the background."

""I have sown only that much of paddy which will sustain me for the year and grow tomato and capsicum on the rest of my land,"" said Nuagaon resident Budhun Ekka, who owns three acres. Ekka's income has increased substantially since he began cultivating these crops instead of paddy. Last year, he had made a profit of more than Rs 60,000. This trend is not only confined to Nuagaon. Kutra resident Sandip Majhi, who has completed his BA from Sambalpur, has returned to help his father in vegetable farming. This December, the plan is to produce tomato and capsicum on a large scale. ""The desi or indigenous variety of tomato and capsicum have good market all over the country,"" said agricultural equipment manufacturer J.K. Patra, who has an industrial unit in Kalunga industrial estate. Patra is in talks with some landowners at Nuagaon and near Rajgangpur to avail himself of land on lease. ""I want to produce drumsticks on permanent basis, along with tomato and capsicum,"" he said. These vegetables are in demand right from Bangalore to Punjab. ""These produces have more demand than the local ones,"" he said. A woman carries capsicum in Nuagaon. Rajendra Agarwal and his brother had been producing watermelon with seeds imported from Thailand. However, they are now planning to concentrate on tomato and capsicum. ""We found the demand for the two in many places, even in Bengal,"" said Agarwal. Patra, who plans to cultivate drumstick, said: ""This is a very cash-rich product, and one can grow other vegetables along with this as I have seen in Tamil Nadu. So, I will try to do that as well."" Over the years, Nuagaon and its nearby areas have come to be known as the land of capsicum. ""We take the best ones and the inferior ones go to you,"" said Narayana Krishna Reddy from Trisur with a smile. Reddy comes twice or thrice a year to this area and keep his supply chain network healthy back in Hyderabad and Bangalore. Now, he is planning to go to other areas of the district where these two crops are produced on a large scale. This year's monsoon, which has been moderate, has encouraged the farmers. ""I am satisfied with the rainfall, and there will be enough water for us everywhere, including the bore wells and rivers,"" said Bimal Lakra of Titrerkela. The only problem other than an efficient irrigation system is the absence of cold storages. There is only one private cold storage which is of small size and only let out to store fruits. ""We need cold storages, so that we can also sell our products locally when the demand goes up,"" said Amit Pradhan, who stays near Riun. He has completed his MBA and now plans to devote his full time to agriculture. ""I did agriculture marketing during my internship and gained some basic knowledge about it,"" said Pradhan. In Rourkela, the indigenous variety of tomato sells between Rs 25 and Rs 40 a kilogram while capsicum sells between Rs 60 and Rs 80 a kilogram."

However, the location and the price at which he was selling these tomatoes blew the lid on the crime.The incident came to light on Thursday evening when 32-year-old vegetable seller Nasim Quereshi came to Sion-Koliwada looking for more than two tonnes of tomatoes stolen from him earlier on Thursday.Watch Video: Whats making newsQuereshi, a resident of Dharavi, came to Sion-Koliwada looking for the stolen tomatoes.

58ff3b737be9e0420db2eddf,Clean-market promise,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160930/jsp/northeast/story_111010.jsp,2016-09-30,"Shillong, Sept. 29: Promises of putting disgusting stench to an end and revamp of the congested Iewduh, the oldest and the biggest traditional market here, have remained unfulfilled. The market is more than a century old and as years passed by, the condition of this biggest commercial hub has deteriorated. Except ""sweet promises"" from those at the helm of affairs, the marketplace has been in an unhygienic condition and left unattended to without any change for many decades now. Like others in the past who had visited the marketplace, today too, it got fresh attention from the Meghalaya government as chief minister Mukul Sangma, urban affairs minister Ronnie V. Lyngdoh, health minister Roshan Warjri and officials went there. The market is under the control of Hima Mylliem, one of the Khasi traditional administrative units. Acting syiem (chief) of Hima Mylliem, Ricky N. Syiem, and his traditional myntris (ministers) were also present. Though Hima Mylliem falls under the administrative control of the Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, not a single official or member from the council was present. The hourlong inspection began from a place where tomato sellers used to assemble every day. Sangma and his team explained to the vendors the intention of the government to revamp the market by working together with Hima Mylliem that proposed to develop a first-of-its-kind women's market complex at the venue. They inspected items ranging from perishable goods to garments. At the fish market, Sangma - under whose initiative an aquaculture mission was launched with a target to make Meghalaya self-sufficient in fish production - got an unpleasant reply to a query when one of the sellers told him that most the fish sold at Iewduhwere brought from Andhra Pradesh. The chief minister interacted with local shopkeepers and even took photographs with some of them. Amid the stench that emanated from the tomato-selling venue, he made a brief but ""promising speech"" before the crowd. According to Sangma, Iewduhneeds to be converted into the ""most-talked-about"" marketplace, given its legacy. The chief minister, who recalled his days as a medical student in Manipur, said there he saw the thriving Ima (women's) market. He vouched to work out a plan to have such a market complex at Iewduhtoo. ""If the Iewduhcan attract people, hoteliers and taxi drivers will get money and the state government will get tax,"" he said. Meghalaya has been also generating revenue from luxury tax from hotels, and the fund was utilized for development of the state. In a lighter vein, Sangma said once the marketplace had been the meeting point for many people, including youths who also used it as a place for dating. Stating that visitors, including tourists, must be tempted to visit Iewduh, Sangma underlined the need to make the market clean and attractive. He said his government was committed to making Meghalaya a clean and green state and design a programme where markets would compete for an award for being the cleanest. ""The most challenging is removing garbage which is the enemy number one. We came here as a team that is tasked with the responsibility of supporting Hima Mylliem in its plan to improve the market with additional infrastructure. We will sit together and design our investment and find a solution to the challenges,"" Sangma assured. Lyngdoh said: ""It is no longer a market, but a slum"". He warned that if a natural disaster strikes, the marketplace will suffer huge damages and massive casualties as it is congested with numerous unplanned buildings."
58ff3c177be9e0420db2eebc,Modified crop irks CM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161008/jsp/bihar/story_112525.jsp,2016-10-08,"Nitish Kumar Patna, Oct. 7: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate cancellation of a clearance given to genetically modified (GM) mustard by a technical sub-committee of the central Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The committee's clearance certifies genetically modified mustard as ""safe for human and animal consumption"". Nitish requested the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and ensure that attempts towards its commercial release are not taken without prior consultation and the state government's consent. ""I strongly urge you that GM mustard application which has been cleared by a sub-committee to GEAC must be overruled instantaneously,"" he wrote to Modi. ""Further, no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, as it can harm the interests of the farmers and the people of India at large."" In the missive dispatched on October 6 - a copy of which is with The Telegraph - Nitish has also pointed out that ""interested parties"" were trying to push in an unproven technology and the states must have a decisive say in its use. Narendra Modi ""We strongly feel that as per existing policy, Government of India should consult and seek no objections from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop. The states must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on farmers,"" Nitish wrote. The chief minister's opposition to GM seeds and crops is well known. He had been at the forefront, opposing field trials of transgenic Bt brinjal (brinjal with a gene inserted from bacillus thuringiensis to make it pest-resistant) and genetically modified maize, mustard and other crops. He has documented the Bihar government's opposition to GM crops and expressed dismay that ""the unscientific push for GM mustard"" was continuing despite previous communication in the matter. Nitish said that if transgenic mustard gets final approval it will become the gateway to a host of other GM food crops, including maize, rice, brinjal, wheat and tomato among others. The chief minister's worry stems from the fact that mustard is an important crop for Bihar and its oil is used for cooking, seeds as condiments in dishes, leaves consumed as a winter delicacy and cakes (residue after pressing seeds to extract oil) as animal feed. Its yellow flowers serve as food for honeybees during winter. ""Mustard is an important crop for states like Bihar and we'll not be able to escape the consequences of the technology,"" Nitish said on the use of transgenic mustard. ""When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out."" So far, the only GM crop granted final approval is Bt Cotton; cultivated in cotton-growing areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat and elsewhere since 2002. Nitish argued that the case of Bt Cotton amply demonstrates that GM is a failed technology, as bollworm, a cotton pest for which it was brought, has developed resistance against the Bt toxin and is wreaking havoc on cotton crops causing heavy losses to thousands of farmers across the country. He also questioned why GM mustard is seeking to promote itself as a hybrid technology when non-GM hybrids are available. ""I had written to the Union minister of environment and forests in January saying that interested parties who failed to win the confidence of farmers (on transgenic crops) are now pushing the technology through public institutions,"" Nitish said. ""There have been conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard and there is ample proof provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and civil society that the tests were misled to obtain favourable results. This particular GM mustard variety was tested against 40-year old varieties,"" Nitish added. He said GM mustard is similar in yield to latest hybrid varieties of mustard available in public and private sectors. He reiterated that agriculture was a state subject and urged Modi, who has been emphasising on cooperative federalism, to demonstrate by cancelling the nod to GM mustard. GM crops have come under severe opposition from advocacy groups and non-government organisations, who say its risks have not been adequately examined and sufficient testing not possible, as the regulatory authorities and scientific bodies in various countries are too closely tied to private sector industry. Some studies claim genetically modified crops could harm consumers."

The process of drying helps lengthen the shelf life of the vegetables. There has been a growing demand for the quality and value-added horticultural crops and we have been marketing the same to a number of foreign countries particularly Dubai and Gulf countries, says Manikutti Subramanian, Managing Director of the Group.Dheenadhayalan, working partner, said that what started on an experimental basis with banana has given a new dimension to the company. The company was marketing these products through an agent. We do not have license or permit for exporting these products to foreign countries and we rely on the agent, he said.Mr. Manikutti Subramanian said that the solar drying of the horticultural crops is adopted when prices of vegetables are less. ""For example, when the price of tomato is less, we make a bulk purchase of the produce and dry it, he said. The dried produce is sold when the price appreciates.In fact a large number of hotel owners and restaurant managers rely on us to when prices of the vegetables shoots up, he said."

If rain fails, farmers will incur huge loss this year as well, said an onion grower.To cultivate onion on one acre land, the growers have to spend at least Rs 45,000 including sowing, removing weeds and applying fertilisers. A good yield can fetch at least 80 quintals of onion from one acre land. The lack of rainfall will, however, affect the yield per hectare.At present, the onion growers are dependent on borewell for irrigating the farm land. Onion plants have grown well in Nagenahalli, Biluvala, Maccheri, Chikkabasoor and other areas. Onion has been sown on 1,894 hectares in the taluk.According to horticulture department statistics, tomato is cultivated on 211 hectares land in Sakharayapattana hobli.
