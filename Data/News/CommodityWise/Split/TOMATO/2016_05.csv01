The procurement price of cabbage which was Rs.15 per kg last month was down to Rs. 5 per kg on Friday while beans, which had a purchase price of Rs. 40 per kg, crashed to be sold at Rs. 8 per kg. R. Chandrappa, a wholesale dealer at the APMC yard in Mysuru, said that the bulk of tomatoes used to be procured by buyers in Maharashtra and other places for use in food processing units for preparation of jams or sauce but the demand was low since the last 30 days. Consequently it has resulted in supply exceeding demand and the prices have crashed, he said.Tomato is widely cultivated in and around Mysuru but mainly in Jayapura hobli of Mysuru district besides H.D. Kote, Hullahalli, Yelwal, and K.R. Nagar while Nagamangala is another tomato growing centre according to Raitha Sangha leader Badagalapura Nagendra.The crop is also cultivated in Gundlupet and surrounding areas but the farmers there are insulated from local glut in production and price crash as the bulk of their produce is sourced by traders in bordering Kerala.Failure to develop cold storage facilities for perishable commodities and lack of access to market in distant places due to poor connectivity besides absence of market information was hampering the farmers from getting a good price for their produce, said Mr. Nagendra.He and other farmers demanded support price for horticultural produce to help bail out the cultivators in times of crisis."
59041a537be9e02646bdbeb2,Familial affections,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575853/familial-affections.html,2016-10-14,"Chitra Srikrishna, Oct 15, 2016 23:08 ISTMeet me at the coffee house near your block. My niece sounds excited when she calls me in the morning. We havent seen each other in months and have a lot of catching up to do. The coffee house in my neighbourhood across a womens college is a favourite haunt for students. I do not know if it is the loud music or the avant-garde artwork on the walls thats the draw, but within a week of its opening, the place was packed with perky young people.As I wait for my niece at the coffee house, I remember the first time I brought my parents here. My dad placed his walking stick near the vacant table at the entrance and looked around. There was a hint of a smile on his face and then he sat down. Dad was a man of few words while mom made up for the lack of them. This doesnt seem very... Moms voice trailed into a whisper as she caught my eye. And this was before we saw the prices on the menu. The parents wondered aloud why I was paying so much for a cup of coffee.Shortly, a sullen waiter served us some snacks along with coffee that tasted like sawdust. The darshini down the road serves better coffee and costs nearly a third less, the parents grumbled. I fervently prayed that no one had heard their comments. Later, when I paid the bill, my dad decried, This is the last time Im setting foot in this place!The darshini down the road from my house holds its own as it caters to different age groups. Its a family favourite. Often the dosas made at home get vetoed down in its favour. For the uninitiated, the place is a hole in the wall  nothing fancy yet it gives a homely feeling once you walk in. The dilapidated walls and the standing-room only space do not deter the regulars or even newbies from venturing in.The aroma of freshly-made decoction coffee vies with the smell of butter emanating from the benne dosa. The slice of tomato served as a dressing on top of the khara bath is waived off as an eccentricity as the dish itself stirs up the senses with its texture, colour and taste. The servers greet the customers with a smile. While the regulars are given a familiar nod, the absentees are given an earful for not frequenting the place.As I nurse my bitter coffee now, I notice my niece step inside the coffee house. She heads my way after exchanging a brief smile with the person behind the counter. The moment she sits down, shes on a rant about fickle friends, absent-minded professors and difficult parents. Please dont give me advice  I just need you to listen, she insists. I am hard-pressed not to retort, How on earth can I hear the words coming out of your lips in this din?The rock music playing in the background has become louder and I feel the remnants of a headache coming on. But I continue to smile at her, secretly yearning for that cup of coffee and benne dosa at the good old darshini a few blocks away. Ah, the things we do for familial affection."

The then chief minister Narendra Modi had promised to bring down the prices within 90 days if his party came to power. But two years had passed since Modi became prime minister, the prices had not come down. Instead, prices had gone up.Raval said that even the farmers were not benefitting from high vegetable prices in markets. He said middlemen and commission agents benefitted the most. The state government, Raval said, was just overlooking and not doing anything to check price rise.The protests against rising prices of vegetables were also organised in major cities of Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Gandhinagar as well.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
590451be7be9e02646bde1dd,Inadequate production spikes prices of pulses: CEA,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/554471/inadequate-production-spikes-prices-pulses.html,2016-06-26,"Inadequate production spikes prices of pulses: CEAPatna, Jun 26, 2016, (PTI) 15:58 ISTChief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian today said under-cultivation of pulses and their inadequate production have led to spike in prices, but vegetable prices have more to do with market forces than production.Besides, there has been a shift in dietary habit in which pulses have become core of food habits among the Indian people, but there was inadequate production to meet the demand, Subramanian told an international conference here.Under the circumstances, cultivation of pulses has to be increased to meet growing domestic demand, he said, adding the Centre has taken note of this and incentivised pulses' cultivation by raising the Minimum Support Price (MSP), besides taking other measures to encourage the farmers to produce such crops on preferential basis.Technology should have been put to better use to enhance cultivation of pulses' crops, he said.In the backdrop of surge in tomato price, he said fluctuation in vegetable prices was linked to market forces rather than cultivation.The markets should be made better to stabilize vegetable prices, he said.Subramanian also spoke on the need for strengthening the State's role in bridging fiscal relations between the rich and poor people and regretted low fiscal capacity of the country due to unusually low base of tax payers.The ratio of voters to tax payers in the country stands at four per cent, but it should be 23 per cent for a country at its level of economic and political development, he said and suggested not increasing exemption limits could be a possible solution to augment fiscal capacity.As a legitimate tool to reduce gap between the rich and poor, the State should build a legitimate mechanism under which there should be delivery of public goods for all, but the bounties for well offs must be reduced and they should be taxed regardless of source of income, Subramanian said.Stating that the state is spending Rs 76,000 crore on the well offs by way of subsidy on kerosene (Rs 1,857 crore), railways (Rs 3,122 crore), electricity (Rs 26,370 crore), LPG (Rs 28,219 crore), gold (Rs 3,785 crore), aviation turbine fuel (Rs 762 crore), small savings (Rs 11,900 crore), he suggested such dole outs should be done away with.He also emphasised on spreading JAM, (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar- Mobile) for financial inclusion of the poor people and said the government is moving in the right direction by spreading Jan Dhan and Aadhaar by creating three lakh and five lakh accounts respectively per day in 2015.He said the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in LPG was a big success."

Today, the Air Quality Index is 310 and it states, Avoid outdoor activity. So I merrily unlace my shoes and collapse on the couch.7am: The prodigal son is heading off to school and asks, You are still here, what about your run? We had a deal! Munching on the leftovers from the babys breakfast, I add, I invoke the Force Majeure clause that clearly states a party is not liable to perform its obligations as a result of Acts of God including fire or other natural disaster. Not having decent air to breathe counts as a man-made disaster if not quite a natural one. And my foot is also aching a bit!Anyway, I just read an article in Time magazine about how even injured people can burn calories. Chewing, they say, also counts as exercise  15 calories an hour if you keep at it!He sniggers, Mom your foot only hurts because you constantly keep putting it in your mouth! And have you figured how many calories you will end up consuming in an hour?I snap, What am I, Aryabhata to do all these calculations early in the morning? Mind your business and go to school.10.30am: Scrolling through my phone on the way to the office, I stumble on the news that to instill committed patriotism and nationalism, the Supreme Court has now ordered all cinema halls to play the national anthem and folks are obliged to stand up and show respect to the same.Now, I am admittedly one of those barmy women who get teary-eyed during our national anthem and bellow it out as loudly as we can, much to the embarrassment of our children.I have even gone on a tour to the Wagah border where, along with the 200 people sitting beside me, I too screamed myself hoarse with Jai Hind and Bharat Mata Ki Jai competing vigorously with the Pakistanis raising their slogans across the border, because not having variable parameters to judge nationalism, we seem to simply define it by volume, hoping the loudest wins.But I still cant wrap my head around how and why I am obliged to feel patriotic when I have merely booked tickets for Befikre, and am about to see Ranveer Singh in his tight red underwear.2pm: Tucking into some biryani with an old friend, I tell her about the Supreme Courts order and she sighs, This nationalism fever is contagious. My husband has suddenly become so patriotic that whenever the national anthem plays, even on television, he drops everything and immediately stands up.I giggle, Perhaps you should count yourself lucky. Now, you wont have to dress up as a nurse or a skanky French maid, just get into your bedroom, and play Jana Gana Mana on your iPhone.She squeals, You have such a twisted mind, gross!I reply, Everyone is mixing nationalism and sex. Im just making jokes but Shree Maruti Herbal is advertising its Stay On pill with a tagline that says: Think demonetization, think Stay OnIts not a bitter pill. Its a power capsule. Watch with pride the emergence of Super Power- the India!She laughs, Yuck, I prefer the anthem idea.I reply,  Err..On second thought, the anthem only lasts for 52 seconds. I have another suggestion  swallow the bitter pill called demonetization, forget about cash on delivery to conceal evidence of your purchase and just buy a vibrator with your credit card.6pm: A straw hat perched jauntily on my head, I am helping the baby dig holes to plant sweet pepper and tomato seeds. We have begun working on our little vegetable patch and kitchen compost, though getting my building society to agree to composting seems a slightly trickier proposition.My phone pings with an email from the friend who is helping us set up, You convinced your building to go ahead? Dont know why composting isnt mandatory! It turns 200 kg of waste into 20 kg of rich compost which means less landfill waste and incineration, significantly reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They should at least give municipal tax benefits to societies who shift to composting. Everyone will switch once the government dangles this carrot.I type back using a rather unoriginal veggie pun, I am trying and perhaps you are right about this carrot incentive because as things stand right now, most of my neighbours dont carrot all.And wondering why respecting our national anthem seems so much more important than respecting our land, I put my phone away and go back to planting a few more seeds before the sun sets."
590494677be9e04154df8c94,The babble about bagels,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/the-babble-about-bagels/,2016-06-17,"Whats round, has a hole, is packed full of carbs and can be had at any time of the day or night? If you answered a donut, you just landed yourself a lemon!The answer is the Bagel, that chewy crusty bread, with dollops of cream cheese inside, making it a carb-laden delicious mouthful in every bite. Both the donut and the bagel are best-selling comfort foods but while the sweet donut is essentially a breakfast item, its savory cousin bagel is an all-day comfort food, especially if there are plenty of great toppings to go along with the soft and doughy inside.So now I am back in New York where the locals pride on two things: their pizza and their bagels. So familiar is this food to New Yorkers that a number of episodes of the popular series Suits revolve around conversations that the two protagonists Harvey Specter and Michael Ross have around bagel carts.What is this wonder bread anyway? According to popular belief, bagels date back to 1783, when they were created to honor King John III Sobieski of Poland, after he protected Austrias people from an attack by Turkish invaders. As the story goes, an Austrian baker created the bagel in the shape of a stirrup to honor the horseman king, and named it a beugel (the Austrian word for stirrup). The beugel quickly gained popularity throughout Eastern Europe, and, over time, the bagel evolved into a circular shape with a hole in the middle. The round bread first came to the US with immigrants through the portals of Ellis Island in the late 1800s. And even now, most of the popular bagel shops are on the Lower East Side where the early immigrants made their tenement homes.My New York morning usually starts with an early morning sprint to my favorite bagel shop to catch the first batch of freshly baked bagels. Baked did I say? Wrong! Because the bagel is the only bread that is boiled before baking it. Once the bagel dough is shaped into a circle, it is dipped in boiling water for 3 to 5 minutes on each side. After that, the bread is drained and baked for about 10 minutes. And that hole in the center is not just for looks! The bagel hole comes in handy to thread multiple bagels onto a dowel, making it very convenient for street vendors transporting and selling the doughy delights.Over the years the bagel has moved from its humble plain doughy self to the most designer bagels that the mind can possibly conceive. So there are the onion, garlic, rye , poppy seed bagels which are jostling for space in bagel shops with their more exotic versions ranging from cinnamon raisin bagel to the pumpernickel to the sun-dried tomato bagel. For those with more adventurous palates there are flavors like blueberry and the French Toast. I have tried these flavors and sworn never to go near these wannabes again. Some mash-ups are fun like the pumpernickel or the sesame bagel. But while French toasts are yum and bagels are awesome, marrying those two together is like The Odd Couple!New York is famous for its bagels, but there is something about the way they are served that annoys many New Yorkers. Bagel shops in the city often slather enormous amount of cream cheese on each bagel they serve, making it a royal gooey mess to eat. Most bagel lovers, including me, find that amount of cream cheese overwhelming and feel that it detracts from the taste of the bagel itself. So my first instinct when I buy my bagel: scrape off that excess.The traditionally accepted amount of cream cheese that is appropriate for a bagel is a schmear. That is a relatively small amount that is just enough to enhance the flavor and texture of a bagel. The cream cheese is meant to complement the taste of the bagel, not to overpower it. Like bagel, cream cheese has matured over the years to complement the bread. So even the most ordinary bagel shop will boast a plethora of cream cheese offerings from the plain-Jane Philadelphia cream cheese to more exotic ones like jalapeno asado, tofu cream cheese, horseradish and pickle, and all the combinations in between.So here I am on my first day in New York, sprinting down to my favorite bagel shop only to discover dozens of patrons already in line ahead of me. I am accompanied by my older son, The Health Nut, who is a big advocate of Bagel-on-the-go, the New Yorkers attempt to assuage a guilty conscience at eating so many carbs at breakfast. It is essentially a plain bagel with bacon, eggs and your choice of cream cheese. When its my turn, I ask for a sesame seed bagel with wasabi cream cheese on the side.As my son and I stroll back to our apartment clutching our prizes, I wonder how long before I am asking for a garlic naan bagel with tandoori masala cream cheese!"
590494a57be9e04154df8ceb,Why are Bengalis so crazy about the Durga puja?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-n-style/why-are-bengalis-so-crazy-about-the-durga-puja/,2016-10-03,"A north Indian friend asked me recently,  why are all Bongs so crazy about Durga Puja? Yes its so obvious that Bongs are crazy about Durga Puja. As a Bengali I can say Durga Puja is just awesome. So there are ample reasons to be crazy about it.It isnt just an event that brings the city of Kolkata to a halt. Durga Puja is a festival that brings people together all across India. The fun, food and the fervour that Durga Puja brings is something that cant be replicated. The entire city turns into a beautiful dreamland of joy and togetherness.Its no secret that Bengalis are foodies. And Durga Puja is a prime example. While other people celebrate Navratra by fasting every day, Bengalis totally have the time of their lives, eating fish fries, mutton rolls and mughlai paratha. And also fish curry is a must. Fasting is restricted to daytime, till pushpanjali. Our Gods are pretty adjusting about this stuff.Food stalls at literally every corner serving a variety of mouthwatering dishes right from cutlet to rosogolla and people gorging on them like theres no tomorrow.Perhaps one of the best thing about Durga Puja is the bhog that is being served. It usually consists of khichudi, alur dom, papad, tomato chutney and rosogolla.Then comes dhaak and dhunuchi dance. This is just not a ritual dance, it is more of a merriment. As a part of everyday aarti, men and women with dhaaks create an ambience of celebration and sheer happiness. Adults and kids alike can be seen dancing with the perfect rhythm and enthusiasm which is almost infectious.Undoubtedly the most emotional moment for all in Durga Puja is bhasan or immersion when every Bong bid adieu to maa Durga and chant asche bochor abar hobe, which means ma Durga will visit us next year as well. Dashami or the tenth day is marked with a ceremony known as shidur khela (playing with sindur) where married women apply vermilion to each others faces as also to Goddess Durga dressed in the traditional Bengali attire.Last but not the least, immersion or bisarjan at the end of the Durga Puja festival is like parting with a member of the family after five days of praying, feasting and merry-making. Actually, Durga puja isnt just about taking part in the rituals, but more about feeling the pulse of the celebration."
590495167be9e04154df8d94,Food prices will keep interest rates sticky,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/food-prices-will-keep-interest-rates-sticky/,2016-06-17,"The recent increase in the prices of basic food items such as tomato and pulses will influence the interest rates of banks. Banks are now unlikely to lower interest rates on their loans in a meaningful way. And this will happen regardless of what Reserve Bank of India might want.Since February, food inflation has been increasing which, in turn, has pushed up the overall level of inflation.Food inflation in terms of retail prices, or CPI, was 5.4% in February. By end May, it had increased to 7.5%. Consequently, the overall level of inflation increased from 4.9% to 6.1%.During this period, RBI has taken steps to lower the interest rates banks charge on loans. RBI has tried to achieve it through a combination of a cut in rates and liquidity measures, or by making more money available to banks. Even now, RBIs policy is in an accommodative phase.However, accommodation may not help banks beyond a point. They rely mainly on deposits to raise money for onward lending. This means that the key to reducing interest rate on loans is to first bring down the deposit rates.In an interview to Mint, State Bank of Indias Chief Arundhati Bhattacharya explained this point.On bank lending rates, there are 3-4 reasons why there is a problem. In India, 97% of the sourcing is from deposits. So, when a repo rate (rate at which RBI lends money to banks) change happens, only 3% is impacted by the cost of funds reduction.As long as deposit holders feel the rate at which prices of everyday consumption items such as food is rising fast, they are unlikely to settle for lower deposit rates. Over the last year, banks have been able to lower deposit rates faster than lending rates. Interest rates offered by banks on fixed deposits of more than one year duration has been brought down by one percentage point, while the base rate for loans has come down by less than half the amount.Therefore, given the extent of decrease in deposit rates over the last year, banks might not find too many takers if they try to reduce deposit rates in the present environment.You cannot take bank interest rates very sharply down, you will lose your deposit franchise, said Bhattacharya.Had banks been profitable, they may have been in a position to push down lending rates. But the large extent of bad loans on their books rules out the possibility.We are in for a spell of sticky interest rates."
59049f1f7be9e04154df96ec,"Umrikan vs Angrezi: Why Donald Trump has trouble understanding us, and vice versa",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/umrikan-vs-angrezi-why-donald-trump-has-trouble-understanding-us-and-vice-versa/,2016-05-06,"Referring to Indian call centres which respond to queries from customers in the US, Americas would-be president Donald Trump has said that he has trouble understanding Indians when they speak. This is understandable.Because we Indians, call centre workers or others, speak English, or Angrezi. Whereas Donald, like his fellow citizens, speaks Americanese, or Umrikan, as we call it. It is this language barrier which makes it difficult for Americans to understand us, and for us to understand them.So when Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to the US next month  his fourth visit since assuming office  hed do well to take a refresher course in Umrikan boli.For instance, when he meets someone who says Howdy to him, he should not address that person as Howdyji, assuming that to be his  or her  name. In Umrikan, Howdy is not a persons name, but a greeting, like our Namaste, and is an abbreviated version of the Angrezi How do you do?Similarly, the phrase So long expressed by someone taking your leave is not an enquiry of measurement as to the length of an unspecified object  nor even the breadth measurement of anything, including a 56-inch chest  but the Umrikan equivalent of Bye, bye.On being offered a termayter sandwich, the PM should not suspect that he is being induced to eat some taboo non-veggie substance, possibly the flesh of gau mata, but is being asked to tuck into an innocuous preparation involving the use of a harmless vegetable which in Angrezi is called tomato (toe-mah-toe) and in Umrikan is called termayter (ter-may-ter).On being asked if he wishes to use the rest room, the PM shouldnt reply that he isnt tired and doesnt need to take a nap right now, and in any case hasnt brought his night suit with him. In Umrikan, a rest room is not a place where people go to catch forty winks but where they go to perform what we call our ablutions, ab-loo-shuns, from which we get the Angrezi word loo.And if Donald does become US prez and visits India in his official capacity he needs to mug up only one sentence to make him understood by one and all here, his Umrikan pronunciation notwithstanding: Barrat matter key jay!"
5904d4617be9e04154dfc75a,Mid-day meals: High noon of welfare,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/mid-day-meals-high-noon-of-welfare-2/,2016-03-14,"Stepping Into 100th Birth Anniv Of MGR, We Recall How His Pathbreaking Nutritious Meal Project Was Conceived And ImplementedJuly 1, 1982 was a turning point in the political history of modern Tamil Nadu, when M G Ramachandran, the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, ate a meal with primary school children in Pappakurichi village in Trichy district, marking the beginning of the chief ministers nutritious noon meal scheme. It later became the cornerstone of welfare policies in Tamil Nadu. For politicians it was a shrewd populist move by MGR to retain his vote bank; for nutritionists it ensured at least a third of the required nutrition for children; for educationists it was a strategy to increase enrolment in school; for some economists it was a waste of public money; and for teachers it was an added administrative burden. But for MGR it was a moment of satisfaction for having ensured the feeding of hungry children.This scheme is the outcome of my experience of extreme starvation at an age when I knew only to cry when I was hungry . But for the munificence of a woman next door who extended a bowl of rice gruel to us and saved us from the cruel hand of death, we would have departed this world long ago. Such merciful women folk, having great faith in me, elected me as chief minister of Tamil Nadu To picture lakhs and lakhs of poor children who gather to take up nutritious meals in thousands of hamlets and villages all over TN and blessing us in their childish prattle, will be a glorious event, said MGR about the noon meal scheme.Providing noon meal in schools was not new to Tamil Nadu as it had existed in various forms since the early 1900s. The sporadic events of providing noon meal in schools were outcomes of the philanthropic efforts of a few. But it was left to K Kamaraj to conceive it as a public policy so that government could provide it.Yet due to the lack of adequate finances and weak administrative machinery , the scheme was implemented only in rural primary schools and was dependent on contributions from local governments. In 1982 the allocation towards the noon meal scheme was less than 6 crore.The emotion of MGR behind the initiation of the scheme was truly captured in terms of its mammoth size and his determination to implement it against all odds. The total outlay for this scheme in 1982 was 120 crore that was later revised to 140 crore in late 1982 and 220 crore in 1983. Increasing the outlay by 20 times in a year shows the importance it received in the state. The scheme initially benefited 5.6 million children in rural schools in the age group of 5 to 10 years and within two months it was extended to children in urban areas, increasing the number of beneficiaries to 6.5 million. In addition, the balwadis (child care centres) were roped in to provide meals for children in the age group of 2 to 5 years. Subsequently, the elderly, widows and destitutes were also covered by this programme. Nearly 56,000 noon meal kitchens were opened, of which 35,000 were in schools. The average cost of a meal for children was 45 paisa and for adults, 90 paisa.To ensure its smooth implementation, the scheme was reviewed every month at the secretariat during the initial days by a committee headed by the CM and senior ministers, officials and important political leaders.Though the opposition described the expenditure a waste and a political stunt, MGR was aware that those who criticised the scheme would be shunned by the people. Journalist Ragavendra Rao, while recalling his experience during a field survey , had said that even a few pieces of carrot and tomato in the sambhar rice was a delicacy in the interiors of the districts of TN. This showed there were many hungry MGRs in the state, who were a meal or two away from death at that time."
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

Nashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra.Kehav Kakad, a farmer from Girnare in Nashik district, received a newly minted Rs 2,000 note on Friday for the 20 quintal of tomatoes he had gone to the Girnare market with. In December last year, Kakad had got Rs 30,400 for the same quantity in the same market.Last year, I received Rs 30,400. Also, the payment was done in notes that I could spend. This year, not only has the price dipped, I am being paid in currency that not many people are willing to take, says Kakad.He is one of the many farmers in Nashik district who have been hit hard by the slump in tomato prices. The overproduction of tomatoes in the country, coupled with the demonetisation effect, has meant that at places such as Girnare, farmers have been forced to sell their produce for as less as Re 1 per kg. The average price for tomatoes in Nashik district for this entire month was a measly Rs 2.76 per kg. Last year during the same period, it was close to Rs 15.5 per kg.Watch What Else is Making NewsNashik district accounts for over 40 per cent of the total tomatoes produced in Maharashtra. Over the past three years, tomato production has seen a major surge across the country, including in Maharashtra. In 2014, APMCs across Maharashtra saw a total of 3.90 lakh tonne tomatoes coming into the market, with Nashik accounting for over 30 per cent at 1.24 lakh tonne. The production has, however, spiked to nearly double at 8.59 lakh tonne this year, with Nashik accounting for 3.82 lakh tonnes.While the increased production has played a role in bringing prices down, farmers say demonetisation is to blame too. Before the move, farmers were on an average getting Rs 5.2 per kg for tomatoes. Post November 8, when the decision was announced, the prices in Nashik dipped to Rs 2.76 per kg.This is the last stage of the tomato crop. It cant survive in winter and farmers are desperate to dispose of their produce. The traders know this and are squeezing farmers, citing the effects of demonetisation. They say you either sell at this price or go home with your produce, says Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Palse in Nashik.Traders claim the oversupply of the crop is deciding the price.There is no manipulation by traders. There is an oversupply in the market. The total produce that came in this month is almost double of what was seen during the same period last year. The overproduction across the country has caused the price drop, says a trader from Girnare, not wishing to be named.However, despite the low prices farmers are being offered, there has not been much fall in retail prices of tomatoes, which continue to be sold at Rs 10-15 per kg across the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8e77be9e033b96e95d4,Demonetisation’s short-term cost,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/demonetisations-short-term-cost-4395435/,2016-11-26,"(Illustration by C R Sasikumar) (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)It is now more than two weeks since 8/11 and the government has stopped exchanging notes for cash. Politicians and analysts alike are worried about the short-term costs to the economy, especially the effects on the poor and on the agricultural economy. Former PM Manmohan Singh believes that the cost to the economy may be as much as a two per cent drop in GDP growth rate this year; he also described demonetisation as organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people.Let me first put down the agreements shared by both supporters and critics of de-monetisation (hereafter DM). The known knowns are three. First, that DM was a bold, radical and unprecedented move  there is no template with which to analyse the short-run effects of DM. Second, that implementation could have been possibly much better. A known unknown is the fact that secrecy was of the essence for DM to have any chance of success. And it deserves emphasis that the ministry of finance has never had such an open mind to criticism from the public, and has actually implemented some improvements (like the indelible ink requirement for exchange of cash). Third, and possibly most importantly, no one believes (including myself) that DM will do much to stop the creation of future black money. There will be a mild deterrent effect, but one whose amplitude will fade in a few years  unless accompanied by additional economic reforms.Many believe that besides the inconvenience, the short-run costs to the economy are considerable and will even feed into significant negative effects over the next few years. Politicians (especially of the Mamata and Kejriwal kind, though the Congress is not too far behind) have shouted themselves hoarse as to the costs the poor are paying because of DM. Some brokerage firms (especially the small ones) see this as their Andy Warhol moment; a few days of fame (later ignominy?) can be garnered by making forecasts that are out of the ballpark, if not out of the universe  one brokerage/investment firm has forecast that over the next five months, GDP will register a rate of -2 per cent. The economy grew at 7.5 per cent for seven months (April-October) and will need to grow at -2 per cent to register the Ambit Capital forecast of 3.5 per cent for this fiscal year. (As comparison, the Lehman crisis quarters, 2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1, registered a growth rate of 1.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively).Some other forecasts are equally dire; we see newspaper headlines that the important rabi crop is in trouble, deep trouble, because of DM. The rural economy is primarily cash-dependent and a Times of India (November 24) front page story stated that job losses (among poor daily wage labourers) were mounting and prices of essential vegetables had dropped significantly between November 16-22. For example, potato prices were down 25 per cent, onion prices were halved, and tomato prices were down only 11 per cent (see table for all-India actual estimates).When poor people lose their jobs, and when land is idle, and/or produce is unmarketed, there could be riots in the streets. There are two short-run indicators of how the public is feeling  by-elections held on November 19, after the earthquake, and the pattern of food prices since November 8.Surprisingly, the voting public is not that angry with the BJP. In by-elections in five constituencies (Lok Sabha and Assembly) across four states in which the BJP was a contender (Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura), the BJP did about as well as the previous election. In three assembly constituencies (Nepanagar, MP, Baithalangso, Assam and Barjala, Tripura), the BJP did much better than previously. This is not supportive of the great DM negativity observed among the media and politicians.The DM-induced cash crunch was expected to considerably slow down the sowing for the rabi crop. Fortunately, and surprisingly, this has not happened. As of November 18, 241.7 million hectares (Mha) had been planted in 2016/17  compared to 243.4 Mha in the previous year. But shouldnt the acreage be more, given that this year was a much better rainfall year than the previous two years? No, because acreage varies little for individual crops, and responds to changes in relative prices. Acreage under pulses and oilseeds has increased significantly, under wheat, it has stayed the same. Furthermore, yield (output) is most affected by rainfall, so a decline is unlikely to be much affected by DM.One important source of information about the effects of DM is the pattern of food prices subsequent to November 8. The DM-induced cash crunch is expected to have two short-run effects on food output and consumption. The first is demand destruction in urban and rural India as consumers just dont have the cash to buy food  this would suggest that food prices should decline. If supply is really affected (supply destruction), then we should expect prices to shoot up. It is impossible to identify which effect is dominant.But attempt to infer we must. Hence, the presentation of detailed price pattern data for food items. For the last six years, the average November price change is reported for identical days across the years. The per cent change reported is between the average price observed across about 15-25 cities in India for each item, that is, brinjal, potatoes, apples, grapes, milk, etc. The data is collected daily. We have taken the median price for each day and each item. The average price for November 1-8 is the reference price; the per cent change reported is between the average median price between November 9-24 and this reference price. (If means are used rather than the median, there is little difference in the results).The reader can make her own inference; all the relevant data is provided. The conclusion we reach is that the net effect of the supply and demand destruction is very little on the price of food observed in urban markets.Let us look at the average change in vegetable and fruit prices. Vegetable prices have fallen by 4.3 per cent, but November is generally a time when vegetable prices decline. In 2011, despite healthy double digit inflation, vegetable prices fell 7.9 per cent; last year, vegetable prices were up 2.8 per cent. Fruit prices (a discretionary luxury food item) show a marginal increase of one per cent; overall food (with consumption weights as in the CPI) prices are down just 0.6 per cent in November.The strong result is that there is no juice for inference about destruction in the rural food economy. This result is not surprising for most agricultural experts  but the noise politicians dont want to hear that which is not convenient to their political ideology.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes.The currency crunch resulted by the Centres demonetisation move is set to hit farmers, agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) and farm produce transporters ahead of a bright Rabi season, forcing the government to plan measures to tackle the impending crisis.An urgent meeting was held at Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swawalamban Mission, a government organisation, at Amravati Monday to discuss the problem. We are expecting both bumper crop of soyabean and cotton in the Kharif season in Vidarbha and a very bright Rabi prospect across the state due to the last heavy spell of rains and visible positive impact of Jalayukta Shivar scheme. But with currency crunch, both procurement at APMCs and the ability of farmers to purchase seeds have been badly affected. Payments at APMCs are currently at only 10 per cent levels since traders dont have enough currency notes. The farmers are also facing problem in buying seeds for the forthcoming Rabi season which is likely to go up manifold in Vidarbha and Marathwada. We have thought of some measures to address these issues, Kishor Tiwari, director of the mission, told The Indian Express.Watch What Else Is making NewsHe said they had requested the state government to approach the Centre with request to allow use of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 for purchase of seeds at government and registered private centres. We also want the banks to make enough new currency notes available to APMCs to tide over the payment problem. If the farmers dont get money against procurement, how will they pay for purchasing seeds and other inputs for rabi, Tiwari said.He added, With sparse bank and ATM availability in rural parts, the problem is all the more serious for farmers and needs urgent intervention.Another problem is the possibility of the transportation of perishable farm produce coming to a halt in a few days time due to currency crunch. The transporters need money for their daily expenses. In the event of the currency crunch, we are afraid that they might be able to ply on a much lower scale after about a week from now. This might need to supply crunch and increase in prices of vegetables, said a senior state government official who did not wish to be named. We are planning to provide transporters of at least onion, potato and tomato with some cash to enable them to continue plying. It will require expenditure of a few crore rupees, which is not a big deal, added the official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Pavan Khengre) The market yard of the wholesale agricultural produce mandi at Pune wears a deserted look post-demonetisation. (Express Photo: Pavan Khengre)The last one week and more has brought nothing but bad news for Vasant Pimpale. This farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale, a village in Pune districts Junnar taluka, has already lost 11 tonnes of green chilli grown on eight out of his 15-acres holding. The loss hasnt been courtesy drought, flood or hail, but because of a disaster totally man-made.Till early this month, I used to dispatch roughly two tonnes of vegetables (including cabbage, cauliflower and brinjal) every day to the Vashi wholesale market in Navi Mumbai. But after November 8, I am unable to send even 800 kg, as the traders have told me that there is no demand, says Pimpale, who has had to endure the loss of his chilli crop, which has turned from green to red, simply for lack of buyers. And hes clear what has been behind his tale of misfortune: the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes.Watch What Else is Making NewsSince November 8, the day demonetisation happened, prices of green chilli at Vashi have fallen from around Rs 14 to Rs 3 per kg, while similarly dropping from Rs 13 to Rs 4 for cauliflower and from Rs 26 to Rs 12 for brinjal. The market for our produce has all but collapsed, complains Pimpale, who is among the many farmers in rural Maharashtra to have been impacted by the virtual disappearance of cash from the system.The bulk of them have operational bank accounts, but sell their entire produce for cash to traders who are now strapped for currency. With the mandis in Nashik, Lasalgaon, Manchar, Manmad and other produce market towns officially closed and even the terminal market at Vashi registering steep drop in trading volumes, farmers  particularly those growing perishables like vegetables and flowers that cannot remain in or outside fields too long after maturity  are the hardest hit.Shriram Gadve, a farmer from Arvi near Narayangaon and also president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India, estimates that Junnar  the taluka where his village, too, falls  alone has some 40,000 acres under vegetable cultivation. 95 per cent of growers in this belt sell to the Vashi terminal market that is about 160 km away, while the rest dispose of their produce in nearby mandis such as Narayangaon and Manchar. The ones selling at Vashi do it through hundekaris.The hundekaris are essentially local farmers, acting as conduits between growers, organised into groups, and traders sitting at Vashi. They aggregate the growers produce and arrange for its transport against a one per cent commission on the final price. While the traders in Vashi issue pattis (purchase slips) in the name of individual farmers, the entire payment after deducting transport cost and labour charges is made to the hundekaris. The hundekari may receive the payment either in cash or even through bank account transfer. But he pays the farmers belonging to his group entirely in cash.The pattis are sent to farmers a day after sale takes place, while payments happen on a weekly basis. We pay in cash after withdrawing the money from our own account. The farmers selling directly in local markets, too, transact wholly in cash, explains Sachin Gadve, a five-acre farmer from Arvi who is also a hundekari for 60 growers. Since demonetisation, the traders in Vashi have told us to send less quantities, as they are finding to it difficult to offload the produce further to retailers selling to the final consumer, he adds.Its very simple. The household end-buyer has no cash to purchase from the feriwala (hawker/retailer), who, in turn, sources from us. Everybody down the chain to the farmer has naturally been affected, points out Rajendra Shelke, president of the Onion Potato Commission Agents and Traders Union at the Vashi market, which, on an average day, receives 700-800 truckloads of vegetables and 100-115 of onions and potatoes. On Wednesday, these numbers were down to 300 and 40 trucks, respectively. Our whole business is done in cash. Today, we are neither able to sell the produce nor in a position to pay farmers, he notes.The situation is no different in other markets. Daily vegetable arrivals at Punes agriculture produce market committee mandi, which used to be around 200 truckloads, has dropped to 80. In most suburban markets, there has been no trading at all for the last one week. Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon market committee, has written a letter to the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, seeking permission for transactions in mandis using the now-withdrawn Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. 90 per cent of the business was, in any case, being done in these so-called high-value notes. If they have permitted petrol pumps to accept these, why cannot the same be allowed for agricultural produce in regulated markets such as ours? he asks.What makes matters worse is that no immediate end to the troubles seems to be in sight, at least for farmers. Hardly a week before demonetisation, Abhay Gadve, a five-acre farmer also from Arvi, had sent a two-tonne consignment of vegetables to Vashi and realised a net value of Rs 25,000 lakh after all the deductions. In my latest patti, all that I got was Rs10,000 for the same quantity. The traders have sent out signals that there could be further reductions, unless cash returns to the system. If I sell at the rate they are quoting, even recovering input costs would be impossible. Theres a lot of cauliflower, cabbage, green chilli, onion, brinjal and coriander at this moment in the Junnar vegetable belt that is ready to be harvested. All this will be lost because of demonetisation. And we are stuck, since bank transfer is also not possible, avers Gadve.But its not just collapse of demand and prices. The cash crunch on account of demonetisation has also affected farmers ahead of plantings for the rabi season. We normally start operations from the first week of November, during which time seeds, fertilisers and other inputs are procured. Since there is no cash, sowing of chana (chickpea), wheat and garlic is likely to be delayed by more than a fortnight. At the current rate, we may not even have plantings at all, fears Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar Taluka Tomato Growers Association.Pimpale, the farmer from Pargaon Tarfe Ale village who also manages a farm input shop at Narayangaon, informs that he does daily business of Rs 2-3 lakh during this otherwise busy season. Currently, I am hardly doing Rs 25,000-30,000. Farmers dont have the cash, they are not used to paying through swipe cards or cheques, and I am in no position to accept the withdrawn currency notes. If cash isnt injected into the system, we really dont know what to do, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Crates carrying tomatoes at the Nashik agriculture produce market committee. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Suryabhan Kusare hasnt come to terms with the method of payments at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC (agriculture produce market committee) yard thats barely a fortnight old. Earlier, we were getting hard cash. Now, the traders and commission agents pay us by cheque. The new system, were told, would ensure that buying will go on and our payments are on time. But effectively, it means standing for hours in front of banks, first to deposit these cheques and then withdraw whatever little we are allowed to, says this farmer from Sawargaon village in Niphad taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district.Soon after the Centres November 8 announcement, demonetising all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currency notes, traders in all of Nashiks 17 wholesale produce mandis ceased operations, citing shortage of cash to pay farmers. On November 20, the district collector convened a meeting of stakeholders, wherein it was decided that farmers would henceforth be paid either by cheque or through electronic bank transfer. The markets have since opened  with most traders opting for payment through cheques.Watch What Else is Making NewsKusare, who had harvested around 100 quintals of late-kharif season onions from his 2.5 acres holding, isnt happy at all with the new arrangement. Only last week, he sold 25 quintals at the Pimpalgaon Baswant market, fetching him Rs 7,500 at Rs 300 per quintal. The trader wrote out a cheque for this amount drawn on ICICI Bank, which Kusare then took to deposit in his account at the Nashik District Central Cooperative Banks Sawargaon branch. Depositing the cheque took me four hours. The bank people told me it would be cleared only in 4-5 days. After five days, I stood in the queue again and, at the end of it, got just a Rs 2,000 note, complains Kusare.Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farmer Pandit Gaikar with his cauliflower produce at the Nashik APMC. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Pramod Kusare, a fellow-farmer from the same village, has a similar story to narrate. About eight days back, he took 50 crates of tomatoes (each of 20 kg) to Pimpalgaon Baswant and got a cheque of Rs 4,000 for it: I stood for three hours to deposit the cheque and queued up for another two hours after four days to collect a single Rs 2,000 note. I was informed that the banks cash position did not permit me to get more.For farmers like the Kusare, November-December happens to also be the peak planting time for rabi season crops  mainly onions, tomatoes, and wheat. For them, the move from instant cash to receiving cheque payments has translated into productive time in the fields getting diverted to standing for hours in serpentine bank queues.Just as Lasalgaon is for onions, Pimpalgaon Baswant  also in Nashik district  is known as the market that sets the price for tomatoes in the country. With an annual turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore, this APMC last year recorded total produce arrivals of over 76 lakh quintals, mostly tomatoes, onions and pomegranate. During the peak season, which is from November through the first week of December, daily tomato arrivals are in the range of 20,000-30,000 crates. Even now, 15,000-20,000 crates are arriving every day, with nearly 100 per cent payments to farmers being done though cheques issued by traders either on the same or following day.Somnath Nimse, one of the 557 traders/commission agents at the Pimpalgaon Baswant APMC, admits that clearing of cheques takes 5-6 days. We were willing to adopt electronic bank transfers, but the internet connectivity here isnt good to enable that, he notes. Tomato prices have crashed post-demonetisation; the average quoted rate, last Friday, at Nashiks primary produce markets was as low as Rs 20 per crate or Rs 1/kg. Its not just farmers. We ourselves are struggling to sell in other (terminal) markets, as the traders there are finding it difficult to arrange funds for making purchases, claims Nimse, who, in the past, has also exported tomatoes to Bangladesh. That trade has completely stopped after November 8. During the peak season, I myself make tomato purchases of Rs 25-30 lakh in cash per day. As against this, the government has specified a weekly cash withdrawal limit of Rs 50,000 for traders, which is a cruel joke, he adds.Traders at Lasalgaon, a market that is synonymous with onions and deals in some 40 lakh quintals of the bulb annually, have also moved almost entirely to cheque payments post-demonetisation. Right now, about 97 per cent of transactions are being done through cheques. We are quite happy having done away with cash payments. Our attempt would be next to go in for direct bank transfer, states Nitin Jain, a commission agent-cum-exporter based in this APMC that is 30 km from Pimpalgaon Baswant.Jagdish Apsunde, a trader and director at the APMC in Nashik  not far from the main city  has already taken the step of electronically transferring money into the accounts of farmers supplying to him. Ive got them to submit their bank account details along with a cancelled cheque to enable me to remit payments directly. This way, farmers are ensured of getting their money the very next day, saving them at least the trouble of having to deposit cheques, observes Apsunde, whose daily peak business in tomatoes and onions runs to over Rs 10 lakh.The Nashik APMC, which handles around 84 lakh quintals of produce annually, was closed for three working days after the demonetisation announcement. Since the meeting with the district collector, the bulk of the 1,300-odd traders here have adopted non-cash means to pay farmers. We are also in the process of getting a public sector bank to open a branch within our mandi premises, which should help farmers, informs KB Shevale, assistant secretary of the APMC.Arun Govindrao Wagh, chairman of the smaller APMC at Sinnar, isnt as enthusiastic about produce trading going cashless. Although we have moved to cheque payments, it doesnt help farmers, as they need cash for purchase of farm inputs and labour payments. How can one expect them to embrace debit or credit cards, leave alone internet banking? he points out.Farmers, on their part, seem resigned to accepting payments now largely through cheque. Pandit Gaikar recently sold 25 crates of cauliflower at the Nashik APMC, for which he received Rs 1,000. The nearest bank is 15 km away from my village. I couldnt possibly have gone all that distance to deposit a cheque for such a paltry amount, and further await payment. My trader was fortunately kind enough to agree and pay me Rs 1,000 in cash, remarks this farmer from Gangavhare near Nashik.Gaikar has harvested just a quarter of his cauliflower crop on one acre and has another two acres of brinjal almost ready to be picked and sold. I dont know what price I am going to get in todays cashless market. Even I get a price, will I be able to lay my hands on cash from the sale? Without cash, how am I going to fill diesel in my tractor and make labour payments for my next crop, within the little planting time available now? asks Gaikar. Thats a question bothering most farmers today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Tomato farmers are throwing their produce in the fields or feeding it to animals because they are not getting even the cost incurred on transporting the produce to the market.The same problem is being faced by potato growers, said Doshi, adding, we want to convey this message to the nation how Gujarati farmers are suffering due to the demonetisation policy of the BJP government at the Centre.On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had addressed farmers in Deesa, around 100 km from Mehsana.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
