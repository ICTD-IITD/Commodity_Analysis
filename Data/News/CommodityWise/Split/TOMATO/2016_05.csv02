Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"
590a3d767be9e033fa430bdd,2016 – A year of sporting surprises galore,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/sport-others/year-ender-india-olympics-cricket-review-4451064/,2016-12-30,"The Mongolian wrestling coaches, with honey-comb guts and teddy bear chests, stripped to their briefs to protest the referees decision.

(Photo: Reuters ) The Mongolian wrestling coaches, with honey-comb guts and teddy bear chests, stripped to their briefs to protest the referees decision. It was surprising, shocking, heartbreaking and amusing  an undefineable mixed emotion that visited most minds throughout the year. (Photo: Reuters )You can never please the fans: Gary Linekar keeps his word, hosts Match of the Day in undies after his old club Leicester Citys title win. Trolls say, they were shortchanged. #BoxersArentUndies trends.Rainbow now has black too: Finally apartheid ends. Temba Bavuma becomes first black African specialist batsman. Its taken long for South Africas batting line-up, crickets pampered and elitish top order, to get a rainbow hue.Scratch the surface: We do live in the post-truth era. India gets excited about Pranav Dhanawades 1,009 from 327 balls. The rider that mostly went unread: 30 yard boundary, 10-year-old pacers, 25 chances.Mid-career crisis: And you thought Manish Pandey had made it. In January 2016, he scores 104 in 81 balls as India chase down 330 at SCG. Soon it will be January 2017. Pandey still gets chance when stars rest.Sporting rebirth: If you fail as Raju Sharma in India, you can succeed as Raju Rijal in Nepal. Mystery of how within a span of 10 years, an under-15 Mumbai junior player emerged as a under-19 Nepal captain.Negi demonetised: Never trust IPL valuations. How Pawan Negis Rs 8.5 crore cookie crumbled? Mostly on bench during the IPL season, not in Delhis Ranji probables and, now in December, released by Delhi Daredevils.Role reversal: The Ferris wheel went around a circle earlier this year, as Australian journalist Samuel Ferris tried nudging India ODI skipper MS Dhoni on the touchy retirement question. Dhoni called the scribe to sit next to him and asked Do you think I can survive till the 2019 World Cup? You should, yes, sure, the scribe was forced to concede. What goes up, and all that.Defeat to die for: If you thought bad defeats dont hurt coaches, think again. It even turns some towards potential suicide. Makhaya Ntini revealed to have looked for a tomato tree to hang himself after Zimbabwes umpteenth collapse with the bat against India.Final frontier conquered: You dont need the right tech for India to warm up to DRS. You need a captain and coach with the right take on the Decision Review System (DRS) which BCCI snubbed for eight seasons. Fortune favoured the brave as Virat Kohli-Anil Kumbles India won 4-0.Trouble at the top: Openers were a happy headache for Virat Kohli at the start of this year with many batsmen in form. It turned into an actual headache as they contrived to get injured by the end of the 2016. It got so bad that Kohli was forced to open with Parthiv Patel in Mohali while the selectors plucked out Gautam Gambhir from the cold. In all, India used five openers, and six different combinations in just 11 Tests. Not an open and shut case still.No homely feeling: India went into the Mumbai Test against England for the first time without a single player who could call Wankhede home; the first such instance since 1933, when Bombay Gymkhana hosted Indias first-ever Test. No wonder you didnt hear a commentator say he knows it like the back of his hand.More added to the list: Throughout his career, Kiran More was made to regret the dropped catch of Graham Gooch at Lords in 1990. Reprieved on 36, he went on to make 333. Alastair Cook can nurse a regret of his own now: he spilled a difficult one of Karun Nair on 34, and the Indian struck a triple. He has company in Adil Rashid who twice dropped Virat Kohli, who went on to make hundreds of match-changing proportions.Redemption for the royal: Once a figure of ridicule, Ravindra Jadeja silenced detractors in Tests, no less. Not only as a left-arm spinner spinning out England on a blameless pitch in Chennai, but also as a reliable lower-order batsman who batted in a restrained manner when needed. Sir-prise !!!His best delivery: As if being ICC Cricketer of the Year and Test Cricketer of the Year wasnt enough, Ravi Ashwin turned even more adorable becoming daddy to Daughter No 2. I delivered carrom baby #2 on the 21st Ashwins better half Prithi tweeted.Cricket gone to the dogs: England tried relentlessly to stop Pujara and Kohlis onslaught at Vizag. But a pitch-invader was more successful than the visitors. The game was halted when the dog was chased away, only to see it return after a while. A mongrel more dogged than the Poms and their three lions. Move over 007s, our Vizag dog has 700 followers on Twitter.Adding (financial) injury to insult: The Poms came here and literally paid for their defeats. The BCCI made the England team pay their own expenses under the pretext of a court ruling. Interest on the Kohinoor in instalments?Lights, camerapink: Not many expected the Ranji Trophy to get the much needed facelift this season. First, zonal system was scrapped. Then a shiny, pink ball and fully-lit up flood-lights suddenly gave Duleep the leap.You cant see me: Smog had its desolation moment in cricket. With visibility affected, Bengal-Gujarat and Hyderabad-Tripura  played in Delhi, split points. Bengal players had updated from monkey caps this winter to vogmasks.Goose cooked: South Africa are known to trigger captaincy changes in England with Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss stepping down after home series defeats against the Proteas. India can lay claim to Alastair Cooks head though.Wheres the star: The great AB de Villiers couldnt bat in Australia. 2016 mustve been really rotten.Reality check: By not playing the Ranji Trophy this term, Harbhajan Singh might have scripted a silent version of farewell to Tests. Ashwin now has Jayant Yadav for company.Too spicy for everyone: Heard of too many cooks spoiling the broth? Well South Africa have kind of dissed that myth. They are yet to lose a Test when both Stephen Cook and Keshav Maharaj have played together.South America is not South Asia: Months before Rio, Indias South Asian games tally: Gold: 188, Silver: 90 silver, Bronze: 30. Post-truth again.Tongas topless man for all seasons: Pita Taufatofua, the Taekwondo athlete, walked carrying Tongas flag, topless, his ripping torso oiled at the Rio opening ceremony. Hes threatening to qualify for Pyeongchangs Winter Olympics in two years time in cross-country skiing. Hell need a few thermals there though.All bases covered: Standing on the Olympic podium, under the US flag, wearing a hijab. Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Muslim girl from Maplewood, picked fencing since that would mean wearing the mask, glove, jacket, pants on sporting arena.One for the upstart: Didnt see it, Cant believe it, sang Marc Antony. Neither did Puerto Ricans imagine it. But Monica Puig won Olympics gold in tennis singles. Strains of Ricky Martins Cup of Life rent the air, this time for his compatriot.China is never too far away: It was PV Sindhu in yellow vs Carolina Marin in red that finals day of womens singles at Rio, the two hues being Chinas predominant playing colours. Shockingly, no Chinese eventually made the podium.Diving into matrimony: The Chinese decided to turn cute this Olympics. He Zi, moments after receiving a silver medal for 3m springboarding, was offered another piece of silverware. An engagement ring this time. Fellow diver and boyfriend Qin Kai went down on his knee to say the magical words. Zis ji followed.None of the above: Indias Entry List for 74kg Freestle Wrestling (Mens): Option A: Narsingh Yadav; Option B: Sushil Kumar; Option C: Parveen Rana; Option D: No one. ANSWER: D for Duh. Dont. Get. Us. Started. On. This. One.Leap into history: Sachin didnt know there was no R in Karma(r)kar two years ago when he first met Dipa, the Tripura gymnast. But everyone agreed there could be an extra U in Pro(u)dunova after Indias sensational 4th place finish in Vault.Phelps schooled: Michael Phelps may have ended the year with a photo shoot that rivalled only the gold adorning the Reddy daughter at her wedding. But Joseph Schooling, literally an autograph-seeking school-boy when Phelps last visited his home Singapore, pipped the American to the 100m fly gold.Breaking down walls: Olympics was all about climbing podiums. Now its climbing walls. The webs sport weaves to welcome Spidermen.Down Under: The Kookaburras had won everything in the lead-up to Rio, before the Dutch ditched them out in quarters. They failed to score against Spain, Belgium and The Netherlands. Come to think of it, India couldve fancied its chances against Aussies, atoning all prior sins in the grand flowing Amazon.Fashioning heartbreaks, German Hockey Style: India beaten with 3 seconds to go; Argentina denied win with a goal 8 seconds from time; and Kiwis stunned with 1 second remaining on the clock.Rising to the occasion: They were boring. Didnt win a game in 90 minutes. Finished third in their group. Dont know if Portugal were good or others that bad at Euros. But then, Ronaldo now has what Messi doesnt  a major international title. 2016s settled the matter.Having England on ice: Icelands dream run, surely, was over. But they had it in them to score a goal more than England in the Round of 16 of Euro 2016. It wound up with Roy Hodgson resigning as England coach.Stay original: The Viking Clap celebration looked good on Iceland. France trying to do an Iceland after their Euro semifinal win over Germany, though, drew a lot of criticism for their lack of creativity.Friendly fire: Sania Mirza and Martina Hingis won the Australian Open, and then made a Grand Slam final at the French, but against each other in mixed doubles. Irony is the partnership would break before the Olympics, the only tournament they arent allowed to pair up together. Not with  nor without you.Everyone loves a winner: World number 1. Wimbledon champ. And Olympic gold. Andy Murrays British identity looks safe by the end of 2016. Until he starts losing and becomes Scottish again.Rivalry for the ages: Indias next Davis Cup captain will be younger than the oldest active player. If theres one thing we know about Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi, it is that never put them in a year-ending list with finality. 20 years down the line, theyll still be at it  whatever the it is; love, hate, intrigue.Show me the money: While the general public reeled under the governments demonetisation drive, Mahesh Bhupathis International Premier Tennis League came and went without much fanfare and organisers of the Pro Wrestling League had to postpone the second edition due to cash crunch. Even Ranji Trophy teams struggled with daily allowances. Nothing la la about these Ligas.On auto pilot: Its Team Principal and managing director is absconding and chairman and co-owner Subrata Roy is out of jail on parole. And yet, Force India left all off the track problems in their slipstream in their best year ever in Formula One. They notched up a fourth-place finish, ahead of Williams and the iconic McLaren.A Lion in winter: Tiger has mellowed with age, injuries and lack of success. He was seen babysitting his teammates kids during the Ryder Cup, ensuring their families were having a good time while Team USA was conquering Europe. Who Woodve thunk!Cubs become LIons: Chicago Cubs recorded a no-hitter (when a team is not able to record a single hit) on April 21. It sat nicely with their moniker Lovable Losers. Seven months later they ended a 108 year curse to be crowned World Series champions. Americas staple of fairytale wins.Paving the way: In combat sports, UFC superstar Conor McGregor of Ireland showed his lightning-fast hands to match that motormouth. But the real story was Stipe Miocic of Cleveland. The Ohio native, a huge underdog, upset Fabricio Werdum in his den in Curitiba, Brazil, in a first-round knockout breaking the states longstanding sports curse. The Cavs followed in the NBA finals.Rest in peace: Circa 2016 proved to be bad for sports revolutionaries. Muhammad Ali, Johan Cruyff, Arnold Palmer and our very own Amal Dutta were taken out.And finally, again: L, E, I, C, E, S, T, E, R. When you think you cant do it, think of these letters of the English alphabet. In that order. Happy New Year!For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
591f0b537be9e025a5d49fe8,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migration",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/560567/bihar-state-litti-chokha-migration.html,2016-07-27,"Bihar: the state of litti chokha, migrationJustin Rowlatt, Jul 28, 2016, INYT: 23:29 ISTLitti are char-grilled flavour bombs, especially when freighted with chokha, the spicy stew of grilled aubergine, tomato and potato that traditionally accompanies one of my absolute favourite Indian street foods. They come originally from Bihar.Biharis absolutely love litti chokha, as  in truth  do most people who taste it. Put it like this, the first time I went to the Bihars capital, Patna, I had people in my office begging me to bring some back. I said Id do my best, but warned I was unlikely to be allowed any food through airport security checks.Nevertheless, I arrived for the return flight with two big bags full of the stuff. The security officers at Patna airport sniffed suspiciously, but, when I told them what and why, they broke into smiles and waved me right on through.Clearly, they judged it was more important to get a consignment of the states most celebrated street food to hungry fans than enforce a few petty restrictions and regulations.Litti are pastry balls, packed full of a spicy mash made with sattu  roasted chickpea flour. They are roasted in beds of charcoal  or, sadly a rarity these days, dried cow dung  and then dipped in salty melted ghee, clarified butter. A couple of these will be served with a decent dollop of chokha, as well as some yoghurt sauce and a scoop of hot, sour pickle. Yes, I thought that would get your mouth watering.You find litti wherever Biharis go, and since Biharis go almost everywhere in India, that means youve got a chance of tasting this delicious snack almost anywhere in the country. Youve got to keep your eyes peeled, though.Look out for the tell-tale pall of smoke from the charcoal and the queue of wiry, tough-looking men. Wiry men, because one of the few things Bihar is famous for in India  apart from litti  is migration.Historic cityThe state capital was once the greatest centre of learning and culture on the sub-continent. When the Greek ambassador Megasthenes visited in 302 BC  yes, it was a while back  he was stunned by Pataliputra, as Patna was then known. The city stretched for nearly 10 miles along the banks of the Ganges.It had, Megasthenes reported, 64 gates and 570 towers, not to mention gardens, palaces, temples and stables full of war elephants. I have seen the great cities of the east, he wrote, I have seen the Persian palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, but this is the greatest city in the world. No visitor would say that of Patna today.Buddha achieved enlightenment in Bihar, the state was home to worlds first residential university and was the powerbase from which Ashoka built the first pan-Indian empire, famous for its tolerance and pluralism. But sadly the capital has not  how shall I put this?  retained the elegance of the ancient city.Poverty-stricken stateTruth be told, modern Patna is a great sprawling, poverty-stricken megatropolis. Which should be no surprise because Bihar has a population of over 100 million people, larger than any western European country, and is one of the poorest states in India. It recorded an average per capita income of just $682 in 2015, less than half of the $1,627 average income nationally.Last year, I managed to get hold of a copy of a vast health survey carried out by the government with the UN agency for children, Unicef. The report had been due for publication in October 2014 but the government had decided to keep it secret.Flip through page after page of statistics and you can see why. Youll also discover why so many Biharis have decided to go in search of work elsewhere. The report shows that in 2013-14 half of children under the age of five in Bihar were stunted, a third were underweight and three quarters of households practised open defecation.Now comes the good news. A few years ago a new technocratic state government made tackling graft and promoting economic growth its priority, and Bihar  which had become a byword for caste division, crime and corruption  started scoring double-digit growth.Thats good news for the people of Bihar, but not for lovers of litti, like me. Because heres the rub: as a result, migration from the state has fallen dramatically.The fear is that the litti chokha stalls dotted across India that ensure that Bihari migrants still get a taste of the best of home will pack up shop and go home too. Then this wonderful street food snack will be even harder to find."

The price rise is a temporary phenomenon and it will faze out soon. In Delhi, there is no issue as tomatoes from hilly areas have started arriving,"" Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak told PTI.Wholesale tomato prices have started cooling down in the national capital on improved supplies, he said, and expressed confidence that prices in other parts would also ease with the arrival of fresh crop.Tomato Merchants Association President Ashok Kaushik said: ""The supply situation in Delhi mandis has started improving with the arrival of over 350 tonnes of tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. The prices as a result have come down by up to Rs 20/kg in the wholesale market.""The wholesale prices of high quality tomato variety 'Sona' from Himachal Pradesh fell to Rs 40-50/kg today from Rs 40-60/kg in the last two days. Prices of tomatoes of Haryana also declined to Rs 20-30/kg today from Rs 40-50/kg in the last two days, he said.However, the fall in wholesale rates in Delhi are yet to be reflected in the unorganised retail markets, where tomato is continued to be sold by local vegetable vendors at Rs 50-80/kg depending on the quality and locality.Tomatoes were sold at Rs 58/kg at Mother Dairy's Safal outlets. Godrej's Nature Basket was selling at Rs 80/kg and e-portal Bigbasket was offering it at Rs 55/kg.The tight supply-demand situation owing to some rabi crop damage has flared up tomato prices in both wholesale and retail market in last more than 15 days across the country. Retail prices in other cities like Bengaluru are ruling as high as Rs 80-100/kg.A senior Consumer Affairs Ministry official had yesterday said that tomato prices would continue to be under pressure till arrival of fresh crop from September onwards.According to the government's initial calculations, tomato output is estimated to be higher by 4-5 per cent in 2015-16 over the last year. ""It looks like the production figures may have to be revised downward when final estimates are released in September,"" the official had said.As per the latest government estimate, the country's tomato output is pegged at 18.28 million tonnes (mt) in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) as against 16.38 mt in the previous year.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states."

591f32c67be9e025a5d4bcbc,"Large farming cooperatives, a solution to farmers' suicides",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/530507/large-farming-cooperatives-solution-farmers.html,2016-02-22,"Large farming cooperatives, a solution to farmers' suicidesBapu Heddurshetti, February 23, 2016 0:07 ISTAccording to the National Crime Records Bureau of India, in 2014, a total of 1,31,666 persons committed suicide in India. Of them, 5,650 or 4.29 per cent, were farmers. Of these, 64.5 per cent were marginal and small farmers.The Bureau also reported that 25.6 per cent of farmers suicides were due to bankruptcy and indebtedness. According to the Niti Aayog head Arvind Panagaria, who conducted a survey in 2008, 20.35 per cent of these suicides were due to drinking and gambling, 16.81 per cent due to failure of crops, 2.65 per cent due to indebtedness and fall in agricultural prices each.The remaining 57.54 per cent were due to other reasons like discord in the family etc. In 2014, 4,400 farmers committed suicide due to drinking and gambling and 1,250 due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices while 3,672 farmers who committed suicide were marginal and small farmers.Suicides committed by farmers due to drinking, gambling and family discordsetc, cannot be termed as agriculture related though persons committing suicides were farmers. But suicides due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices are farmer-specific.Farmers are distressed because of three reasons: their landholdings are uneconomic and unviable; failure of crops due to floods and draughts; and fall in agricultural prices. After Independence, the number of marginal and small land holdings has increased due to land reforms. For example, when land reforms were implemented in Karnataka in 1971, the number of land holdings with less than two hectares was 29,22,000. By 2011, it was 59,87,000.According to the Department of Agriculture in Karnataka, the size of the land holding should be 2.56 hectares to be economically viable. The average size of land holdings of these marginal and small farmers also increased, though marginally, from 0.60 in 1971 to 0.81 in 2011, still leaving the holding economically unviable. It was quite natural that the number of suicides by these farmers also increased.To alleviate the problems of the marginal and small farmers, some people have suggested providing them with improved inputs. But the proper solution to the problem lies in encouraging cooperative farming. If farmers can pool their land by forming a cooperative, then the problem of unviability of the small holdings can be overcome as they will get the benefit of economies of scale. While a single small farmer cannot on his own dig a borewell or buy a tractor, a cooperative farm can easily do so. This may also to a great extent help the small farmers in overcoming the problem of fall in prices of agricultural produce.While a single small farmer may not have the capacity to store his produce and sell it only when he gets a better price and, hence, has to opt for distress sale, a farming cooperative can create such storing capacity and sustain itself when the agricultural prices fall. It is only then that a small land holding can become economically viable and prevent the losses.Since a farming cooperative with large tracts of land in its possession can go for multiple cropping, even if the prices of one or two of its produces fall, no member will be ruined because he will be sharing the profits earned by the cooperative from other produces.Agricultural pricesFailure of crops, which accounts for 16.81 per cent of the suicides committed by farmer, happens mostly due to floods or droughts which are natural phenomena. While crop insurance can be an answer to floods, irrigation could be the answer to droughts.The loss to farmers due to fall in agricultural prices is a man-made phenomenon. Since the demand for agricultural produce is by and large stable, the reason for the fall in agricultural prices is over-production.For example, if tomato fetches a good price in any one year, all farmers opt to grow tomatoes with the result that in the next year, there is over-production and the prices fall. There have been instances when farmers have thrown away their produce on the roads as they could not get a fair price.Some people have suggested solutions sans markets to this problem of fall in agricultural prices. They suggest that a floor price for agricultural produce should be fixed by law and no one should be allowed to sell his produce at a price lower than the statutory price. But then, the problem of fall in agricultural prices is not legal but an economic one and therefore, a legal solution to an economic problem will not ultimately work.Some have suggested the solution of a government intervention in the market by fixing support prices. But since the problem is one of over-production, this will only increase the financial burden on the government rather than solve the problem.The prices of agricultural produce in the markets fall when there is more supply than demand. The demand for agricultural produce, as compared to industrial produce, is more or less fixed. Hence, the demand cannot be reduced. But supply can be regulated to equalise with the demand. In the first instance, supply can be contained at the time of production itself. Since the demand is known, if the farmers can plan their supply, the fall in prices that happens due to over-production can be prevented.To achieve this, production will have to be meticulously planned at the national or at least at the state level. Secondly, if the far-mers can store their produce when the pri-ces fall and wait till the prices rise, they can overcome the problem of excessive supply.If large cooperative farms are encouraged and farming cooperatives can form a federation, it should be possible to plan what to produce and how much to produce depending on the demand. Only such solutions can solve the problems of the farmers and prevent them from committing suicides."

Now, there is theft of dal under the very nose of the chowkidar. But the chowkidar has not uttered a word. He is mum. ... Now he has become a big person. Leave that job of chowkidari to the Congress,"" Gandhi said.Taking a jibe at the BJP slogan 'Har Har Modi' used during the Lok Sabha polls, he said ""now people are saying 'Arhar Modi'.""""You may make as many hollow promises as you want, but give us a date by when the prices of daal will come down,"" he said.Listing the prices of vegetables and pulses , he said in 2014, the price of tomato was Rs 18, which has shot up to Rs 55 now. Urad and tur dal, priced at Rs 70 and 75 in February 2014, has gone up to Rs 160 and Rs 180 this month.In a dig at the NDA government's second ""happy birthday"" celebrations, the Congress Vice President said the Prime Minister did not even utter a single word about rising prices during this event and sought to know why he did that.Accusing the government of waiving Rs 52,000 crore of the corporates, Gandhi asked what benefit the government has given to the farmers and housewives of the savings amounting Rs 2 lakh crore it has made from the slump in the crude prices.He also questioned the NDA's flagship programmes like Make in India, Stand Up India and said ""the 'Make in India' programme has not got given a single job to the youth.""Gandhi said the price of pulses and vegetables have gone over the roof after the NDA came to power and the farmers have not been able to get any benefit of the steep rise in the price of these commodities.Recalling Modi's speech at a poll rally in Himachal Pradesh in February 2014, Gandhi said while attacking the then UPA government over the issue, he had said said that 'ma- bachche raat raat rote hain, aasoon pee ke sote hain' (mother and child cry the whole night and sleep drinking the tears).""What a dialogue,"" Gandhi said thrice, taking a dig at Modi who was not present in the House.""I want to remind the Prime Minister of the promises he made to the people of the country during the poll campaign, which Modiji does not talk about now and has forgotten. He had also promised that when the BJP government comes to power, it will bring down the prices,"" Gandhi said.He said there was a gap between the minimum support price for tur dal given to the farmers was Rs 45 whereas its price in the market was Rs 75. Now, the MSP has risen to Rs 50, but the price of the pulses was now Rs 180.""So, there is a gap of Rs 130 in the NDA government. Where is this Rs 100 going,"" Gandhi asked.""People in villages are chanting a new slogan, 'Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi, Arhar Modi"", Rahul said winding up his speech.Under the Modi government, Rahul said, dal prices have risen 120 per cent.""During the Congress government the difference between the MRP (Maximum Retail Price) and the market price was Rs 30, but today it is Rs 130,"" the Congress vice president said.Rahul declared that the Modi government should name a date when the prices of vegetable and dals will come back down to normal levels. ""This is a very serious matter and the truth is you can't make false promises about this,"" he added."
